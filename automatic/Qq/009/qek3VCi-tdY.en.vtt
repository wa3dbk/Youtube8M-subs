what's up everyone jon rettinger from

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.949 
what's up everyone jon rettinger from
technobuffalo<00:00:03.240> here<00:00:03.449> we've<00:00:03.570> had<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.840> iphone

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
technobuffalo here we've had the iphone

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.749 
technobuffalo here we've had the iphone
5<00:00:04.500> in<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.740> office<00:00:05.009> for<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> little<00:00:05.250> while<00:00:05.520> now

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
5 in the office for a little while now

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.249 
5 in the office for a little while now
when<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> first<00:00:06.270> things<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.569> did<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.810> speed

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
when the first things I did was speed

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.839 
when the first things I did was speed
tests<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.740> want<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.980> know<00:00:08.040> how<00:00:08.130> fast<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.639> thing

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
tests I want to know how fast the thing

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.940 
tests I want to know how fast the thing
was<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:10.050> then<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.349> curious<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:10.920> it

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
was and then I just curious how it

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.390 
was and then I just curious how it
compared<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.730> galaxy<00:00:12.210> s3<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:12.990> AT&amp;T<00:00:13.410> LTE

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
compared to the galaxy s3 on AT&amp;T LTE

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.609 
compared to the galaxy s3 on AT&amp;T LTE
speed<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.240> thought<00:00:15.450> why<00:00:15.900> not<00:00:15.929> show<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.410> on

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
speed so I thought why not show it on

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.910 
speed so I thought why not show it on
camera<00:00:17.300> AT&amp;T<00:00:18.300> version<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:18.840> AT&amp;T<00:00:19.619> version

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
here on the Galaxy S screen we've got

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
here on the Galaxy S screen we've got
four<00:00:22.619> bars<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.949> LTE<00:00:23.340> same<00:00:24.029> amount<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.300> bars<00:00:24.480> on

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
four bars of LTE same amount of bars on

four bars of LTE same amount of bars on
the<00:00:25.500> iphone<00:00:26.369> 5<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.119> let's<00:00:27.240> go<00:00:27.330> ahead<00:00:27.449> put<00:00:27.599> these

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the iphone 5 so let's go ahead put these

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.000 
the iphone 5 so let's go ahead put these
two<00:00:27.930> head-to-head<00:00:28.140> see<00:00:28.949> which<00:00:29.070> one's<00:00:29.220> faster

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.380 

so<00:00:35.010> I'll<00:00:35.130> run<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> full<00:00:35.610> head<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.030> head<00:00:36.210> of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
so I'll run a full head to head of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.760 
so I'll run a full head to head of
everything<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:37.050> including<00:00:37.170> speed<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
everything here including speed of

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.549 
everything here including speed of
processor<00:00:38.309> applications<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.840> core<00:00:40.260> things

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
processor applications and core things

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.170 
processor applications and core things
in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> OS<00:00:41.129> bright<00:00:41.399> now<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
in the OS bright now this is just a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.819 
in the OS bright now this is just a
speed<00:00:42.420> test<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.930> LT<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.530> Southern<00:00:43.800> California

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
speed test of LT in Southern California

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.350 
speed test of LT in Southern California
obviously<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:44.760> speeds<00:00:44.969> could<00:00:45.120> change

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
obviously your speeds could change

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
obviously your speeds could change
depends<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.840> where<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.320> time<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.770> day<00:00:46.860> all

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
depends on where you are time of day all

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.680 
depends on where you are time of day all
that<00:00:47.399> kind<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> stuff<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.090> totally<00:00:48.510> subjective

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that kind of stuff so totally subjective

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
that kind of stuff so totally subjective
but<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.440> curious<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.309> test<00:00:50.789> both<00:00:51.059> at<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
but I was curious to test both at the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.840 
but I was curious to test both at the
same<00:00:51.719> time<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.500> open<00:00:52.770> speed<00:00:53.010> test<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
same time so open speed test here and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.130 
same time so open speed test here and
let<00:00:54.000> me<00:00:54.059> show<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.390> everything<00:00:54.840> else<00:00:54.930> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
let me show you that everything else is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.189 
let me show you that everything else is
closed<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.800> we've<00:00:56.370> got<00:00:56.399> open<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.989> speed

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
closed all we've got open is the speed

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.310 
closed all we've got open is the speed
test<00:00:58.379> app<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> every<00:00:58.859> 10<00:00:59.010> apps<00:00:59.160> there<00:01:00.320> so

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
test app and every 10 apps there so

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.100 
test app and every 10 apps there so
speed<00:01:01.920> test<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.609> open<00:01:03.030> its<00:01:03.420> open<00:01:03.510> speed<00:01:03.870> test

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
speed test is open its open speed test

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.230 
speed test is open its open speed test
here<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.619> well<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.790> find<00:01:06.030> our

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
here as well it's going to find our

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.020 
here as well it's going to find our
closest<00:01:06.630> server<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.049> let's<00:01:07.710> begin<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.790> test

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
closest server and let's begin the test

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.539 
closest server and let's begin the test
a<00:01:09.210> Wi-Fi<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.810> turned<00:01:09.960> off<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.680> both<00:01:11.100> least<00:01:11.340> well

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
a Wi-Fi is turned off on both least well

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.620 
a Wi-Fi is turned off on both least well
so<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.909> straight<00:01:12.180> LT<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.939> let's<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.210> which

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
so it's straight LT and let's see which

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.920 
so it's straight LT and let's see which
one<00:01:15.840> am<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.049> taking<00:01:16.170> bets<00:01:17.659> see<00:01:18.659> which<00:01:18.780> one's

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
one am I taking bets see which one's

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.980 
one am I taking bets see which one's
faster<00:01:21.979> look<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.700> close<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.360> even<00:01:24.630> iphone

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
faster look pretty close to even iphone

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.219 
faster look pretty close to even iphone
5<00:01:25.549> decently<00:01:26.549> faster<00:01:27.299> almost<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.689> whole<00:01:27.840> megabit

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
5 decently faster almost a whole megabit

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.179 
5 decently faster almost a whole megabit
per<00:01:28.259> second<00:01:28.710> faster<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.360> got<00:01:30.509> 5.5<00:01:30.990> down<00:01:31.590> at

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
per second faster so we got 5.5 down at

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.100 
per second faster so we got 5.5 down at
a<00:01:32.250> pretty<00:01:32.490> whopping<00:01:33.060> almost<00:01:33.509> 6<00:01:33.869> up<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> this

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
a pretty whopping almost 6 up so this

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.819 
a pretty whopping almost 6 up so this
finished<00:01:37.560> quicker<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> iphone<00:01:38.909> 5<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.829> give

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
finished quicker on the iphone 5 I give

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.230 
finished quicker on the iphone 5 I give
18t<00:01:41.250> credit<00:01:41.579> there<00:01:41.700> upload<00:01:41.939> speeds<00:01:42.150> are

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
18t credit there upload speeds are

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.190 
18t credit there upload speeds are
pretty<00:01:42.390> fast<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.920> 4.72<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.250> 5.26<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> little

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
pretty fast so 4.72 and 5.26 so a little

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.010 
pretty fast so 4.72 and 5.26 so a little
bit<00:01:46.350> faster<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> download<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> iphone

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
bit faster on the download on the iphone

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.690 
bit faster on the download on the iphone
5<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.860> restart<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> test<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.579> run

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
5 so go and restart the test and run

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.609 
5 so go and restart the test and run
them<00:01:50.820> one<00:01:50.909> more<00:01:50.939> time<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.530> get

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
them one more time and see if we get

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:02.390 
them one more time and see if we get
similar<00:01:52.890> results

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.310 

so<00:02:03.400> we're<00:02:03.610> getting<00:02:03.880> now<00:02:04.030> about<00:02:04.390> four<00:02:05.049> to<00:02:05.260> five

ish<00:02:05.890> on<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.970> galaxy<00:02:07.390> s3<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.170> about<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.860> same

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
ish on the galaxy s3 and about the same

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.550 
ish on the galaxy s3 and about the same
on<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.880> iphone<00:02:10.149> 5<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.390> little<00:02:10.690> bit<00:02:10.780> under<00:02:11.020> and

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
on the iphone 5 a little bit under and

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.890 
on the iphone 5 a little bit under and
we<00:02:11.680> got<00:02:11.830> just<00:02:12.040> exactly<00:02:12.400> five<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.690> moral

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
we got just exactly five so the moral

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.809 
we got just exactly five so the moral
being<00:02:14.140> they<00:02:14.260> appear<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.620> be<00:02:14.770> just<00:02:15.459> about<00:02:15.580> as

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
being they appear to be just about as

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.290 
being they appear to be just about as
fast<00:02:16.000> i<00:02:16.209> will<00:02:16.360> say<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:16.810> i<00:02:17.200> ran<00:02:17.470> these<00:02:17.650> tests

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
fast i will say that i ran these tests

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.720 
fast i will say that i ran these tests
outside<00:02:19.300> on<00:02:20.020> both<00:02:20.260> phones<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.709> iphone<00:02:20.980> 5<00:02:21.220> was

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
outside on both phones the iphone 5 was

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.390 
outside on both phones the iphone 5 was
a<00:02:22.030> bit<00:02:22.390> quicker<00:02:22.660> by<00:02:23.380> not<00:02:23.560> by<00:02:23.739> much<00:02:23.950> looks<00:02:24.280> like

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
a bit quicker by not by much looks like

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.250 
a bit quicker by not by much looks like
the<00:02:24.489> LTE<00:02:24.819> radios<00:02:25.270> in<00:02:25.480> each<00:02:25.690> are<00:02:25.959> very

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
the LTE radios in each are very

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.250 
the LTE radios in each are very
comparable<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.980> if<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.819> 4g<00:02:28.750> LTE

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
comparable so if you have a 4g LTE

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.559 
comparable so if you have a 4g LTE
