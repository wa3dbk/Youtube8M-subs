00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.049
 myself 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.329
 self transmission dialogue 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.019
 feature of it 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.149
 is that blocking thin 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:26.769
 through the mechanism 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.119
 gear shift located 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.169
 on the box 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.169
 that is, here 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.620
 in the cabin as they do ordinary castle 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.770
 gear boxes 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.410
 now a little bit more in detail why we 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 have chosen such a scheme 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.950
 this is the shift lever 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.960
 transmission which is located on 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.270
 here he enters 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.470
 in box 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.950
 further went to the control cables in this 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.540
 rubber 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.160
 here it is further 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.340
 is he 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340
 and are joined to the gear shift artem 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.510
 now see how to switch 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.560
 gear honors case air 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.160
 filter 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.350
 now it's just the beginning now 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.790
 includes editorial 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.780
 share reverse gear neutral drive 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.980
 and in the reverse order 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.340
 here is the parking position 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.890
 and now we will show 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.890
 what it looks like with three salons 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.150
 like this 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.940
 according to which traditionally 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.220
 connect the transfer 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.509
 which go goes under the hood 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.860
 we are interested in the question 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.730
 initially there is 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.660
 plastic which is dismantled addition 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.600
 that was 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.870
 he is clearly visible 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.660
 classic locks on the gearbox 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.240
 I am blocking the lever myself 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.310
 or there is a demand 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.720
 near the lever 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.660
 but at the same time everything 100 goes under the hood 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.460
 remains unprotected that is and 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.620
 myself just here on this site nobody 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.250
 proper mechanism 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.550
 under the hood 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.550
 what is the most important 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:13.649
 now and am in the car 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.649
 him 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.229
 you can see that 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.719
 gearbox is in position 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.899
 parking lot 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:25.479
 gear shift lever 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.649
 as if in a parking position 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.649
 exact toms then 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.299
 but a simple movement 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.549
 third part of speech 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.549
 today transfer 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.409
 all night back 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.449
 allowing handbrake 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.629
 note that all this is still 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.629
 is in a position later 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.239
 lock for locking mechanism 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.239
 gear shift 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.799
 executed shopping 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 after the cookie control cables 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.179
 next box 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.069
 which are simply not assigned to 20 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.639
 so will the management of the castle 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.179
 the hood 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.479
 archers griffite designs sphere 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.889
 worth considering what to go 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.029
 the locking element is mounted on the top 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.859
 front load shelf and here is the third item m 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.869
 is a lock on the box 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:52.099
 gears 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.909
 Well 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.209
 using these hole 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.719
 intertwined regular places 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.619
 on the gear box 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:00.239
 i'm here actually located 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.999
 blocking elements 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.709
 to stick out gear shift 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.669
 three days the question is what are they 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.919
 parking position 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.409
 further blocked 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.249
 and all this is nonsense 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:14.899
 where it is necessary to open 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:16.829
 string bolts are used for them 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.390
 haiti see how 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.160
 anti-theft complex installed 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.160
 car 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.270
 final installation so 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.910
 when all the blocking element is already 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.219
 installed 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.219
 regular shift lever 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.180
 what a fly 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.469
 bracket installed regular places 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:42.020
 bout supposedly bolt 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.580
 and here we were raising go 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.580
 locking element 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:48.869
 Now we will show how this device 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:51.349
 working i'm in the cabin and switching 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.499
 transmission 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.000
 that is, the adventures of a regular hand 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.969
 the box is in the park 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.689
 today when a person has no role to drive 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.050
 in reverse order 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.860
 so that is, nothing blocks for 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.770
 lever movement 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.770
 now the castle is venturing 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.139
 revealed a big click and try 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.309
 gear keys 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:14.119
 the machine is still in mode 

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:15.839
 parking lot 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.860
 that is, you see my partner here 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.830
 shooting a little trying to promote 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.740
 the car 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.629
 first months of the war of displacement 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.430
 in parking mode now i'm trying 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.729
 imitate an attempt 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.729
 opening 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:34.059
 continues to move in the same 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:35.710
 the most acceptable limits 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.639
 that is, we cannot turn on another point 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.949
 locked lock 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.949
 car assembled 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.279
 installed 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.009
 why does not interfere 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.319
 on the bridge through the mechanism 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.300
 gear shift optional 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.289
 protects even the hood lock which 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.289
 who have already been told 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.839
 rub from the work of Damocles sword 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.839
 two daisies 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.650
 turchak is in park position 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.199
 I can then 15 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.659
 then square meters 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:12.659
 back park 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.110
 I'm closing the lock now 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.979
 note that it closes without 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.099
 key by simple pressing 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.960
 I am also trying to enable transfers 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.029
 but nothing is allowed to me 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.400
 this is the maximum course 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.520
 who is capable of on the shelf 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.860
 try again 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.330
 Shift gear with open market 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.330
 this year 15 

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:54.410
 appeared in the cabin 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.879
 such stuffing 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.610
 locking happens shake them 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.490
 everything is locked again 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.490
 opening occurs with a key 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.900
 dialogue can be a feeling but is free to 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.070
 one of three options 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.780
 the first option is purely mechanical 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.070
 the castle when we turn on the houses 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.830
 short passes and open and close 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.070
 second veto electromechanical option 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.139
 lock like gear boxes 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:22.650
 deputy to the hood separate to 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.710
 devices 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.960
 and the third option is when 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.210
 pure mechanical lock controls immediately 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.660
 two locks and hood and mechanism 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.560
 gear shift
