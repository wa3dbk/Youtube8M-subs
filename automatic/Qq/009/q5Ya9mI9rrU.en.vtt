00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.330
 application is very successful 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.150
 in recent weeks on social networks is 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.610
 the smash of a German application that was 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.259
 created by fashion today and that was 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.590
 inspired by an American TV show 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.900
 the Jimmy Kimmel where the presenter 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.150
 invited some artists and people 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.519
 important to dub in other actors 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.689
 or singers there comes the play is 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 conquering everyone mainly 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.730
 here in Brazil too many videos 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.050
 funny created how she moves 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.770
 I'm still aware you have 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.410
 heard a speech from someone and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.420
 trying to repeat will create a self in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.620
 video and you can share with 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.450
 world on social networks 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.390
 the application it works with a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 technology used with voice synchronization 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 It's important that you speak and not just 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.160
 has really dumb speechless speech 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.289
 try to repeat what you are 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.770
 disputing why he will save himself 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.239
 your voice a video and many people do not 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.729
 have been able to install the application 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.170
 because when they try to install it appears 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.299
 a phone message is not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.490
 compatible there are many versions 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.229

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.259
 devices to top-of-the-line devices 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.360
 sold in 2014 that are not 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.979
 can install the application know if 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.830
 it is your case to leave the link here at 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.530
 description of applying the application you 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.299
 can be enabled to the device is to do 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.110
 download from unknown sources 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.509
 if you install the application 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.759
 usually rains here in the description're 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.040
 there was it much of the system version 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.750
 if you have a total of 4 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.509
 below you probably will not 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 get only 14 points 2 onwards 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.799
 but as always leaves tips for you 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.399
 to create the second semester 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.500
 Perfect 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.530
 Can you tell me since this was mine? 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.020
 if my android phone does not rotate 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.149
 for damages but want me to make the option 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.869
 for leaving you and you use the flash 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.130
 10 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.619
 you can download and install on your 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.740
 computer and the android system is popular 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.560
 it is download the captain app leave the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.450
 link 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.330
 if you want to sin down here in the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.190
 description of the video and you can 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.680
 usually on your computer 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.410
 sincere should not be installed in tags 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.290
 then you installed also mess with 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.940
 to sin and it just spins as if 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.769
 had a smartphone you can use a 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.209
 webcam and record videos normally 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.769
 is not cool 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.390
 so if you do not have a phone with 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.349
 battery, even if you do not want to 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.110
 to use 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.319
 The first tip is the breath is super 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.600
 important for you to listen to the voice and 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.670
 good dubbing music that you will do 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.769
 more than once and pay attention 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.590
 in those moments when there was a 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.080
 skin breath you try to imitate already 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.700
 application can synchronize the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.069
 as perfect as possible 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.630
 tip number two is to know the letter is 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.489
 super important you know what will 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.680
 talk in the middle of the recording you go 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.349
 mess up everything and then you will not 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.940
 able to create the video you want 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.750
 With synchrony, then you will not be 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.280
 cool 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.349
 you can even share but the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.540
 people will not find it so funny and 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.110
 you will not achieve the effect that you 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.019
 I wanted 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.519
 so be sure to listen well again 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.859
 what will you talk like that so it was a 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.019
 text and you write and when 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.209
 recording the speech is high because so 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.230
 application can synchronize your voice with 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.440
 what is being said 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.000
 the third tip facial expression the mouth 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.340
 pay attention when you are making a 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.549
 It 's super important that you do not 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.950
 keep your mouth shut too much talking 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.109
 that little thing of expression because 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.720
 It will get really cool in the dubbing opens. 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.720
 plus the mouth when you go and talk 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.730
 tries to open more than necessary until 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.069
 because the situation of a normal recording 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.560
 because it will be cooler for who goes 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.230
 you're seeing dubs it will look like 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.450
 the sound really came out of his mouth and the fourth 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.920
 and last body expression tip 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.540
 It's no use talking about the plan. 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.360
 national 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.450
 talking and do not move or if you 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.000
 You're dubbing something you need sometimes. 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.670
 of an interaction is so you can tinker 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.790
 run a hand in the hair do something 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.769
 will it shake open your hands do something 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.290
 that has expression because you are going 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.000
 more realism in what you 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.919
 is trying to pass but of course that 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 all a great joke do not need 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.669
 following these tips or rules is 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.169

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.360
 Do you want to try a voiceover? 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.150
 The better you can use these small 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.289

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.419

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.820

 I'd rather even research and test for 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.630
 see if it really works there but 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.610

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.479
