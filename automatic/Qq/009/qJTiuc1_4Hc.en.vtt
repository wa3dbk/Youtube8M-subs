00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.830
 I wanted to be like me so fast but 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.590
 not 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.840
 and I felt bad because I was good 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.600
 agency and both in the race because 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.640
 I just did it for young people and 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.830
 focused his efforts on getting 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.240
 work and I was doing my internship 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.680
 professionals in the sat already had many 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.230
 possibilities to stay to work 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.540
 Well, it was my turn not because I had to 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.699
 continue with my studies the sport 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.030
 recreational caused an injury that the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.440
 forced to slow down stopped running 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.350
 he started walking and his qualities 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.600
 naturals appeared before the eyes of his 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.600
 first coach jose luis peralta 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.420
 but from me the opportunity to take her 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.600
 with a friend of mine the best coach 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.189
 I do not know another without a better coach 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.340
 There are proper ones to see if it is that 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.539
 all right 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.799
 and he tried reluctantly 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:21.619
 when he arrived to work with me 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.619
 it was difficult difficult everything protested 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.450
 or 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.820
 everything he wants to do and how he is very strong 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.030
 then he is also performing 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.189
 queries guadalupe left until his 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.159
 professional career as an engineer in 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.890
 systems and bet everything for the walk 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.229
 after the call they did well the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.149
 morning they did talk to me and I 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.670
 I answered my parents were there in the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.610
 room what I already had the work that I 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.860
 will present the next day 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.260
 and I told them no thanks 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.840
 I told them that little by little we were 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.310
 giving things from my escapades of 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.690
 five thirty in the morning and I 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.970
 I left home from home and trained and 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.320
 I would go as I could, I would go 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.450
 Instead of training so 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.729
