myth-busting this one we are going to
continue<00:00:06.150> our<00:00:06.180> work<00:00:06.569> doing<00:00:06.899> some<00:00:07.109> lag<00:00:07.290> busting

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830

gave me a ton of great feedback and this
episode<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.080> are<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> test<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.889> lot<00:00:14.160> of

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
episode we are going to test a lot of

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.770 
episode we are going to test a lot of
potential<00:00:14.820> like<00:00:15.000> courses<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.750> been

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780

potential like courses that have been
suggested<00:00:16.470> by<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.070> viewers<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:18.000> before

we<00:00:18.390> jump<00:00:18.630> back<00:00:18.690> into<00:00:19.080> testing<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.770> want<00:00:20.250> to

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
we jump back into testing I want to

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.700 
we jump back into testing I want to
address<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.730> concern<00:00:21.029> many<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.840> had<00:00:22.080> during

the course of my crafts development lag

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.210 
the course of my crafts development lag
has<00:00:25.170> become<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.680> term<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.160> describing

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.679 
framerate issues and poor game
performance<00:00:28.769> lag<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.789> originally<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> term

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
performance lag was originally a term

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.659 
performance lag was originally a term

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
for latency issues this is where a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.610 
for latency issues this is where a
server<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> client<00:00:33.420> are<00:00:33.960> impeded<00:00:34.440> from

talking to one another fast enough to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
talking to one another fast enough to
keep<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> game<00:00:37.110> running<00:00:37.320> smooth<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> make

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
keep the game running smooth so to make

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.670 
keep the game running smooth so to make
it<00:00:38.610> clear<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.180> called<00:00:39.600> lag<00:00:39.809> busting<00:00:40.290> but

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
it clear this is called lag busting but

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
it clear this is called lag busting but
we<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:40.920> specifically<00:00:41.430> looking<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.270> in

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
we are specifically looking at what in

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.540 
we are specifically looking at what in
the<00:00:42.480> game<00:00:42.690> will<00:00:43.140> reduce<00:00:43.500> frame<00:00:43.829> rates<00:00:44.070> again

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the game will reduce frame rates again

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
the game will reduce frame rates again
our<00:00:44.730> testing<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> far<00:00:45.570> from<00:00:45.719> scientific<00:00:46.410> but

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
our testing is far from scientific but

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.650 
our testing is far from scientific but
it<00:00:46.950> will<00:00:47.010> give<00:00:47.160> us<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.460> good<00:00:47.670> idea<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:48.239> what

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it will give us a good idea of what

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.779 
it will give us a good idea of what
could<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.870> causing<00:00:49.170> lag<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.829> our<00:00:49.980> world<00:00:50.250> so

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
could be causing lag in our world so

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.610 
could be causing lag in our world so
we're<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> start<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:51.780> revisiting<00:00:52.079> two

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we're going to start by revisiting two

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
we're going to start by revisiting two
tests<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> armorstand

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
tests the armorstand

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.910 
tests the armorstand
and<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> item<00:00:54.750> frames<00:00:54.989> we're<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> find

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and the item frames we're going to find

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.680 
and the item frames we're going to find
out<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.730> intensive<00:00:57.300> when

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
out if they are more intensive when

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.040 
out if they are more intensive when
displaying<00:00:58.140> items<00:00:59.030> one<00:01:00.030> half<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> our<00:01:00.510> test<00:01:00.809> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
displaying items one half of our test is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.450 
displaying items one half of our test is
done<00:01:01.260> I'm<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> show<00:01:01.829> some<00:01:01.859> screenshots

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
done I'm going to show some screenshots

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
done I'm going to show some screenshots
of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.969> armorstands<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> test<00:01:04.500> world<00:01:04.769> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of the armorstands in the test world so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
of the armorstands in the test world so
we<00:01:04.920> don't<00:01:05.070> need<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.369> into<00:01:05.489> each<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:05.909> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
we don't need to go into each one to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
we don't need to go into each one to
show<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.170> results<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.860> been<00:01:08.040> doing

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
show you the results but have been doing

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.980 
show you the results but have been doing
a<00:01:08.400> lot<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.939> testing<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:09.810> there's

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
a lot of testing here now there's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.270 
a lot of testing here now there's
something<00:01:10.170> important<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.799> need<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> mention

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
something important I need to mention

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.550 
something important I need to mention
the<00:01:11.850> item<00:01:12.210> frame<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.600> our<00:01:12.780> benchmark<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.439> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the item frame is our benchmark and I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.260 
the item frame is our benchmark and I
went<00:01:13.710> back<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.890> checked<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.850> previous

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
went back and checked out the previous

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
went back and checked out the previous
video<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.600> did<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.320> test<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.830> an

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
video we did actually test it with an

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.560 
video we did actually test it with an
item<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.460> item<00:01:17.820> frame<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.360> good

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
item in the item frame which is a good

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.030 
item in the item frame which is a good
thing<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.350> quite<00:01:19.560> likely<00:01:19.770> that's

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
thing because it's quite likely that's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.620 
thing because it's quite likely that's
going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.430> more<00:01:20.610> intensive<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
going to be more intensive but this is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.050 
going to be more intensive but this is
our<00:01:21.840> benchmark<00:01:22.380> score<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.130> has<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.549> score<00:01:23.939> of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
our benchmark score this has a score of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
our benchmark score this has a score of
1<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.869> are<00:01:24.930> 512<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.890> those<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.280> my

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
world our fps goes down to 30 so that's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.710 
world our fps goes down to 30 so that's
kind<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> an<00:01:29.400> indicator<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.939> how<00:01:30.030> laggy<00:01:30.390> things

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
kind of an indicator of how laggy things

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.080 
kind of an indicator of how laggy things
are<00:01:30.960> compared<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.890> another<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.490> over<00:01:32.880> here

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
are compared to one another so over here

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.819 
are compared to one another so over here
we<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.540> each<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> armor<00:01:34.380> stands<00:01:34.710> I've

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
we have each of the armor stands I've

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.560 
we have each of the armor stands I've
tested<00:01:35.220> these<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.549> individual<00:01:36.119> worlds<00:01:36.450> with

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
tested these in individual worlds with

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
tested these in individual worlds with
one<00:01:36.810> two<00:01:37.170> three<00:01:37.560> four<00:01:37.979> pieces<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.369> armor<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
one two three four pieces of armor and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
one two three four pieces of armor and
even<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:39.689> with<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> weapon<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.500> well<00:01:40.530> which<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
even one with a weapon as well which is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
even one with a weapon as well which is
something<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.400> can't<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.850> survival<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
something you can't do in survival but I

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.740 
something you can't do in survival but I
thought<00:01:42.720> I'd<00:01:42.869> test<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
thought I'd test it just to see if that

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
thought I'd test it just to see if that
increases<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> intensity<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> computer

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
increases the intensity on the computer

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.580 
increases the intensity on the computer
and<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.640> no<00:01:47.850> surprise<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:49.259> intense

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and so no surprise it is more intense

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.770 
and so no surprise it is more intense
you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.090> an<00:01:51.210> item<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.630> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you can see here that with an item on it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.660 
you can see here that with an item on it
our<00:01:51.930> score<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.320> zero<00:01:52.799> point<00:01:53.070> five<00:01:53.399> seven

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
our score is zero point five seven

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.730 
our score is zero point five seven
without<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.630> zero<00:01:54.869> point<00:01:55.200> three<00:01:55.439> free

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
without it with zero point three free

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.560 
without it with zero point three free
and<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.490> goes<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.880> each<00:01:57.090> time<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.479> you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and this just goes up each time so you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.149 
and this just goes up each time so you
can<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> look<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.079> numbers<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.409> zero

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
can have a look at the numbers here zero

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.700 
can have a look at the numbers here zero
point<00:01:59.399> seven<00:01:59.729> six<00:01:59.939> zero<00:02:00.240> point<00:02:00.930> nine<00:02:01.110> seven<00:02:01.409> so

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
point seven six zero point nine seven so

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.889 
point seven six zero point nine seven so
an<00:02:01.860> item<00:02:02.009> frame<00:02:02.490> sorry<00:02:03.149> armor<00:02:03.450> stand<00:02:03.719> with

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
an item frame sorry armor stand with

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.139 
an item frame sorry armor stand with
three<00:02:04.140> pieces<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.560> armor<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.640> equivalent

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
three pieces of armor is the equivalent

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.999 
three pieces of armor is the equivalent
to<00:02:06.210> an<00:02:06.479> item<00:02:06.630> frame<00:02:06.930> pretty<00:02:07.229> much<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.680> then

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to an item frame pretty much and then

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.260 
to an item frame pretty much and then
when<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> fourth<00:02:08.700> piece<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.090> gets

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
when you have a fourth piece it gets

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.270 
when you have a fourth piece it gets
slightly<00:02:09.629> laggy<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.200> slightly<00:02:10.739> more<00:02:10.979> intense

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
slightly laggy a slightly more intense

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
slightly laggy a slightly more intense
on<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.670> computer<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.599> then<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.080> five<00:02:13.319> it's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
on your computer and then with five it's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.030 
on your computer and then with five it's
even

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
even

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.740 
even
or<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.849> anyway<00:02:14.909> now<00:02:15.209> we're<00:02:15.360> going<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.540> test

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
or so so anyway now we're going to test

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.390 
or so so anyway now we're going to test
the<00:02:15.900> item<00:02:16.230> frames<00:02:16.469> and<00:02:16.739> see<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.069> these<00:02:17.219> are

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
the item frames and see if these are

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.740 
the item frames and see if these are
less<00:02:17.579> intensive<00:02:18.120> when<00:02:18.269> they<00:02:18.359> don't<00:02:18.599> have

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
less intensive when they don't have

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.309 
less intensive when they don't have
items<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.349> we<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.159> 1200<00:02:20.879> item<00:02:21.599> frames<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:22.140> I

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
items in we have 1200 item frames here I

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.750 
items in we have 1200 item frames here I
think<00:02:22.530> that's<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.799> really<00:02:23.219> clear<00:02:23.459> sign<00:02:23.730> that

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
think that's a really clear sign that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.580 
think that's a really clear sign that
these<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.269> not<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.719> likely<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.319> see<00:02:25.469> with

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
these are not as likely you can see with

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.520 
these are not as likely you can see with
just<00:02:25.620> getting<00:02:26.280> around<00:02:26.540> 29<00:02:27.540> fold<00:02:27.959> frames<00:02:28.290> per

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
just getting around 29 fold frames per

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.009 
just getting around 29 fold frames per
second<00:02:28.890> at<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.069> moment<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.180> gives<00:02:30.840> this

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
second at the moment and that gives this

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.710 
second at the moment and that gives this
thing<00:02:31.079> a<00:02:31.470> lag<00:02:31.769> factor<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.370> 0.4<00:02:33.090> free<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.629> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
thing a lag factor of 0.4 free when it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.449 
thing a lag factor of 0.4 free when it
doesn't<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.200> items<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.980> once<00:02:35.099> again<00:02:35.220> just

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
doesn't have items and once again just

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.979 
doesn't have items and once again just
want<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> reiterate<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:36.689> we're<00:02:36.840> going<00:02:36.930> to

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
want to reiterate that we're going to

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.839 
want to reiterate that we're going to
use<00:02:37.170> lag<00:02:37.409> it's<00:02:37.709> slang<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.310> know<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.609> not<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
use lag it's slang I know it's not the

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.069 
use lag it's slang I know it's not the
correct<00:02:39.090> term<00:02:39.239> we're<00:02:39.450> talking<00:02:39.689> about<00:02:39.780> frame

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
correct term we're talking about frame

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.720 
correct term we're talking about frame
rate<00:02:40.260> issues<00:02:40.379> but<00:02:40.829> that's<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.280> word<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.430> I'm

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
rate issues but that's the word that I'm

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220 
rate issues but that's the word that I'm
going<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:41.909> use<00:02:41.970> because<00:02:42.689> it's<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.049> word<00:02:43.200> that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
going to use because it's the word that

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.979 
going to use because it's the word that
pretty<00:02:43.530> much<00:02:43.650> everyone<00:02:43.950> uses<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:45.450> next<00:02:45.810> one

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
pretty much everyone uses this next one

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.929 
pretty much everyone uses this next one
is<00:02:46.139> another<00:02:46.319> revised<00:02:46.889> test<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.549> lot<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.760> you

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939

about<00:02:49.769> this<00:02:50.189> apparently<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.180> what's<00:02:51.389> above

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
about this apparently it's what's above

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.300 
about this apparently it's what's above
the<00:02:51.930> hopper<00:02:52.230> that's<00:02:52.409> going<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.739> affect<00:02:53.159> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
the hopper that's going to affect the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.460 
the hopper that's going to affect the
frame<00:02:53.549> rate<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:53.819> we<00:02:54.480> have<00:02:54.629> one<00:02:54.840> with<00:02:54.989> air<00:02:55.200> above

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
frame rate so we have one with air above

frame rate so we have one with air above
which<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.889> supposed<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.730> luckiest

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
which is supposed to be the luckiest

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.970 
which is supposed to be the luckiest
because<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.689> going<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.049> look<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.470> items<00:02:58.799> in

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
because it's going to look for items in

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.009 
because it's going to look for items in
the<00:02:59.099> space<00:02:59.370> above<00:02:59.700> then<00:03:00.209> we<00:03:00.359> have<00:03:00.540> one<00:03:00.750> with

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the space above then we have one with

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.289 
the space above then we have one with
half<00:03:01.290> slabs<00:03:01.680> since<00:03:02.010> that's<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.669> block<00:03:02.909> yet<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
half slabs since that's a block yet it

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.000 
half slabs since that's a block yet it
can<00:03:03.480> pick<00:03:03.629> up<00:03:03.750> items<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.319> are<00:03:04.409> on<00:03:04.470> top<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.889> it

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
can pick up items that are on top of it

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
can pick up items that are on top of it
and<00:03:05.129> then<00:03:05.549> we<00:03:05.669> have<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:06.030> inventory<00:03:06.629> I<00:03:06.659> chose<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and then we have a inventory I chose the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.110 
and then we have a inventory I chose the
dropper<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.859> one<00:03:08.069> but<00:03:08.519> across<00:03:08.669> the<00:03:08.939> free

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
dropper for this one but across the free

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.550 
dropper for this one but across the free
test<00:03:09.389> you<00:03:09.629> can<00:03:09.780> see<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.230> footage<00:03:10.530> that

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
test you can see with the footage that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.960 
test you can see with the footage that
I've<00:03:10.799> shown<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.280> there<00:03:11.430> really<00:03:11.579> is<00:03:11.819> no

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
I've shown you that there really is no

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.809 
I've shown you that there really is no
difference<00:03:12.900> at<00:03:13.049> all<00:03:13.169> to<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.500> frame<00:03:13.739> rate<00:03:13.950> so

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
difference at all to the frame rate so

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.550 
difference at all to the frame rate so
now<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.359> get<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.689> the<00:03:15.810> cool<00:03:15.989> stuff<00:03:16.290> these

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
now we can get to the cool stuff these

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.439 
now we can get to the cool stuff these
are<00:03:16.620> flowerpots<00:03:17.459> things<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.939> don't<00:03:18.120> think<00:03:18.329> are

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
are flowerpots things I don't think are

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.300 
are flowerpots things I don't think are
going<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.900> an<00:03:19.049> issue<00:03:19.199> at<00:03:19.500> all<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.099> I<00:03:20.129> also

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
going to be an issue at all but I also

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.979 
going to be an issue at all but I also
tested<00:03:20.849> this<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.120> flowers<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.659> the<00:03:21.750> flower

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
tested this with flowers in the flower

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.469 
tested this with flowers in the flower
pot<00:03:22.019> as<00:03:22.379> well<00:03:22.409> and<00:03:22.949> so<00:03:23.729> now<00:03:23.909> we've<00:03:24.060> gone<00:03:24.239> from

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
pot as well and so now we've gone from

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.259 
pot as well and so now we've gone from
about<00:03:24.750> 200<00:03:25.290> frames<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.799> 180<00:03:26.459> don't<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.150> this

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
about 200 frames to 180 don't think this

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.580 
about 200 frames to 180 don't think this
is<00:03:27.299> ever<00:03:27.599> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.870> be<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> problem<00:03:28.290> in<00:03:28.560> your

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
is ever going to be a problem in your

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.849 
is ever going to be a problem in your
world<00:03:29.780> furnaces<00:03:30.780> doesn't<00:03:31.379> look<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:31.680> these

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
world furnaces doesn't look like these

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.409 
world furnaces doesn't look like these
are<00:03:31.919> ever<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.489> be<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.639> problem<00:03:32.970> for<00:03:33.269> you

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
are ever going to be a problem for you

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.270 
are ever going to be a problem for you
however<00:03:33.780> some<00:03:34.079> if<00:03:34.199> you<00:03:34.319> have<00:03:34.470> suspected<00:03:34.919> that

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
however some if you have suspected that

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.770 
however some if you have suspected that
when<00:03:35.699> they're<00:03:35.909> running<00:03:36.060> they<00:03:36.359> could<00:03:36.569> be<00:03:36.750> a

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
when they're running they could be a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.659 
when they're running they could be a
little<00:03:37.019> bit<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.440> lag<00:03:37.650> causes<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:38.280> let's<00:03:38.459> get

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
little bit of a lag causes so let's get

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.819 
little bit of a lag causes so let's get
all<00:03:38.819> of<00:03:38.940> these<00:03:39.060> cooking<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.720> with<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.590> power

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
all of these cooking and with the power

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.619 
all of these cooking and with the power
of<00:03:40.949> mcedit<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.669> took<00:03:41.879> a<00:03:41.909> furnace<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:42.510> was

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
of mcedit I took a furnace that was

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.180 
of mcedit I took a furnace that was
cooking<00:03:42.959> something<00:03:43.169> duplicated<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.159> a

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
cooking something duplicated it a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.740 
cooking something duplicated it a
ridiculous<00:03:44.760> amount<00:03:44.879> of<00:03:45.060> times<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.599> can

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
ridiculous amount of times and you can

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.719 
ridiculous amount of times and you can
see<00:03:45.930> there's<00:03:46.379> no<00:03:46.560> real<00:03:46.739> framerate<00:03:47.040> issue<00:03:47.370> here

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
see there's no real framerate issue here

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.509 
see there's no real framerate issue here
a<00:03:47.909> lot<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.079> requested<00:03:49.260> nether<00:03:49.979> portals

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
a lot of you requested nether portals

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.030 
a lot of you requested nether portals
and<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.909> can<00:03:51.060> see<00:03:51.299> 360<00:03:51.900> frames<00:03:52.500> per<00:03:52.680> second

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
and you can see 360 frames per second

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.439 
and you can see 360 frames per second
not<00:03:53.159> really<00:03:53.400> an<00:03:53.459> issue<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:53.879> does<00:03:54.030> drop<00:03:54.239> down<00:03:54.419> a

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
not really an issue it does drop down a

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.059 
not really an issue it does drop down a
little<00:03:54.750> bit<00:03:54.900> when<00:03:55.319> we<00:03:55.349> move<00:03:55.650> around<00:03:55.889> because

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
little bit when we move around because

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.830 
little bit when we move around because
it's<00:03:56.310> rendering<00:03:56.699> all<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.449> portal

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
it's rendering all of the portal

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.319 
it's rendering all of the portal
animations<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.709> but<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.579> really<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.879> lag

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
animations and but it's not really a lag

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.939 
animations and but it's not really a lag
caller<00:04:00.629> and<00:04:00.930> who<00:04:01.019> would<00:04:01.169> have<00:04:01.319> this<00:04:01.560> moving

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
caller and who would have this moving

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.379 
caller and who would have this moving
over<00:04:02.099> portals<00:04:02.579> in<00:04:02.669> their<00:04:02.819> world<00:04:03.000> anyway

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
over portals in their world anyway

crazy Pigman farm up in the sky but I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.050 
crazy Pigman farm up in the sky but I
think<00:04:07.799> anyone<00:04:08.099> would<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.370> foolish<00:04:08.790> enough<00:04:08.819> to

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
think anyone would be foolish enough to

think anyone would be foolish enough to
do<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:10.590> next<00:04:10.889> one<00:04:11.099> was<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.310> real<00:04:11.549> shock

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
do that this next one was a real shock

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.879 
do that this next one was a real shock

when<00:04:54.120> we<00:04:54.240> move<00:04:54.450> around<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:54.960> can<00:04:55.020> see<00:04:55.260> the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
when we move around you can see the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.990 
when we move around you can see the
frames<00:04:55.650> are<00:04:55.830> going<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.100> drastically<00:04:56.370> drop

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
frames are going to drastically drop

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.880 
frames are going to drastically drop
we're<00:04:57.150> going<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.330> see<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.720> little<00:04:58.140> bit<00:04:58.260> of<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.680> lag

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
we're going to see a little bit of a lag

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.770 
we're going to see a little bit of a lag
spike<00:04:59.250> here<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.700> there<00:04:59.850> as<00:05:00.030> well<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.480> the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
spike here and there as well and the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.060 
spike here and there as well and the
reason<00:05:01.050> why<00:05:01.170> is<00:05:01.230> because<00:05:01.290> this<00:05:01.680> is<00:05:01.920> a

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
reason why is because this is a

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.560 
reason why is because this is a
transparent<00:05:02.520> block<00:05:02.850> and<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.120> means<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.480> the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
transparent block and it means that the

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.570 
transparent block and it means that the
game<00:05:03.720> has<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.230> a<00:05:04.410> lot<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.800> rerender<00:05:05.430> ring

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
game has to do a lot of rerender ring

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.550 
game has to do a lot of rerender ring
when<00:05:06.030> you<00:05:06.210> move<00:05:06.420> around<00:05:06.600> so<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.080> lot<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.380> these

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
when you move around so a lot of these

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.230 
when you move around so a lot of these
in<00:05:07.740> your<00:05:07.830> world<00:05:08.010> cook<00:05:08.250> cools<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:08.640> little<00:05:08.880> bit<00:05:09.060> a

in your world cook cools a little bit a

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.180 
in your world cook cools a little bit a
jutter<00:05:09.750> enos<00:05:10.110> but<00:05:10.320> what<00:05:10.440> I'm<00:05:10.560> concerned<00:05:10.770> about

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
jutter enos but what I'm concerned about

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.250 
jutter enos but what I'm concerned about
is<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.910> these<00:05:12.060> blocks<00:05:12.420> are<00:05:12.600> often<00:05:12.930> used<00:05:13.140> with

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
is that these blocks are often used with

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.720 
is that these blocks are often used with
pistons<00:05:13.680> because<00:05:13.950> obviously<00:05:14.100> they<00:05:14.400> can<00:05:14.580> move

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
pistons because obviously they can move

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.820 
pistons because obviously they can move
blocks<00:05:15.030> around<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.630> so<00:05:16.080> if<00:05:16.170> these<00:05:16.350> blocks<00:05:16.650> are

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
blocks around and so if these blocks are

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.530 
blocks around and so if these blocks are
moving<00:05:17.100> around<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.460> lot<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:17.970> is<00:05:18.090> a<00:05:18.120> lot<00:05:18.420> of

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
moving around a lot that is a lot of

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.420 
moving around a lot that is a lot of
calculations<00:05:19.020> for<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.530> game<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:20.010> do<00:05:20.190> now<00:05:20.400> I

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
calculations for the game to do now I

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.100 
calculations for the game to do now I
can't<00:05:20.700> get<00:05:20.850> into<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.210> specifics<00:05:21.840> it<00:05:22.020> would

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
can't get into the specifics it would

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.260 
can't get into the specifics it would
probably<00:05:22.260> take<00:05:22.440> a<00:05:22.740> lot<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:23.610> figure<00:05:23.880> it<00:05:23.970> out<00:05:24.090> but

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
probably take a lot to figure it out but

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.330 
probably take a lot to figure it out but
if<00:05:24.390> you<00:05:24.510> do<00:05:24.720> have<00:05:24.990> you<00:05:25.440> know<00:05:25.470> a<00:05:25.590> lot<00:05:25.920> of<00:05:25.950> slime

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
if you do have you know a lot of slime

string<00:05:51.090> block<00:05:51.360> but<00:05:51.570> this<00:05:51.690> is<00:05:51.810> play<00:05:51.990> string<00:05:52.380> and

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
string block but this is play string and

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.380 
string block but this is play string and
when<00:05:52.710> we<00:05:52.800> move<00:05:52.980> around<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.640> framerate<00:05:53.940> does

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
when we move around the framerate does

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.880 
when we move around the framerate does
drop<00:05:54.720> a<00:05:54.780> bit<00:05:55.080> but<00:05:55.260> I<00:05:55.320> don't<00:05:55.500> think<00:05:55.650> you're<00:05:55.770> ever

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
drop a bit but I don't think you're ever

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.770 
drop a bit but I don't think you're ever
going<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.130> have<00:05:56.310> this<00:05:56.910> much<00:05:57.180> string<00:05:57.510> in<00:05:57.660> your

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
going to have this much string in your

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.740 
going to have this much string in your
world<00:05:57.930> so<00:05:58.080> it's<00:05:58.230> nothing<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.650> worry<00:05:58.860> about<00:05:59.750> so

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
world so it's nothing to worry about so

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.240 
world so it's nothing to worry about so
you<00:06:00.870> can<00:06:01.050> see<00:06:01.260> I've<00:06:01.410> been<00:06:01.560> doing<00:06:01.800> a<00:06:01.890> little<00:06:02.070> bit

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
you can see I've been doing a little bit

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.950 
you can see I've been doing a little bit
of<00:06:02.370> flying<00:06:02.670> around<00:06:02.850> we<00:06:03.240> have<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.660> lot<00:06:03.930> of

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
of flying around we have a lot of

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.170 
of flying around we have a lot of
enchanting<00:06:04.620> tables<00:06:05.040> right<00:06:05.250> here<00:06:05.490> our<00:06:05.670> frames

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
enchanting tables right here our frames

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.030 
enchanting tables right here our frames
are<00:06:06.420> down<00:06:06.630> to<00:06:06.780> 50<00:06:07.140> but<00:06:07.290> I<00:06:07.350> don't<00:06:07.650> think<00:06:07.860> you're

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
are down to 50 but I don't think you're

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.740 
are down to 50 but I don't think you're

diamonds to craft these in your world as

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.910 
diamonds to craft these in your world as

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
you would need to make it cause an issue

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.500 
you would need to make it cause an issue
but<00:06:14.250> check<00:06:14.490> this<00:06:14.610> out<00:06:14.790> when<00:06:15.000> we<00:06:15.120> fly<00:06:15.360> around

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
but check this out when we fly around

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.750 
but check this out when we fly around
all<00:06:15.930> of<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:16.350> books<00:06:16.560> move<00:06:16.800> towards<00:06:17.250> us<00:06:17.370> that<00:06:17.430> is

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
all of the books move towards us that is

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.640 
all of the books move towards us that is
ever<00:06:18.030> so<00:06:18.270> cool<00:06:18.510> we<00:06:18.660> leave<00:06:18.810> a<00:06:18.840> little<00:06:19.020> trail<00:06:19.260> I

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
ever so cool we leave a little trail I

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.680 
ever so cool we leave a little trail I
really<00:06:20.430> liked<00:06:20.580> that<00:06:20.610> last<00:06:20.910> awesome<00:06:21.420> but<00:06:21.570> there

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
really liked that last awesome but there

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.750 
really liked that last awesome but there
you<00:06:21.780> go<00:06:21.960> and<00:06:22.230> that's<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.830> last<00:06:22.920> test<00:06:23.460> for<00:06:23.550> this

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
you go and that's the last test for this

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.900 
you go and that's the last test for this
episode<00:06:24.270> and<00:06:25.040> there<00:06:26.040> you<00:06:26.160> go<00:06:26.340> it<00:06:26.520> has<00:06:26.670> been<00:06:26.880> a

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
episode and there you go it has been a

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.060 
episode and there you go it has been a
shorter<00:06:27.390> video<00:06:27.690> but<00:06:28.020> it's<00:06:28.200> taking<00:06:28.560> me<00:06:28.680> just<00:06:28.950> as

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
shorter video but it's taking me just as

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.800 
shorter video but it's taking me just as
much<00:06:29.250> time<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.700> do<00:06:29.850> all<00:06:30.060> of<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.300> testing<00:06:30.780> you

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
much time to do all of the testing you

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.180 
much time to do all of the testing you
know<00:06:31.020> I've<00:06:31.170> kind<00:06:31.410> of<00:06:31.470> learned<00:06:31.710> how<00:06:31.890> to

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
know I've kind of learned how to

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.190 
know I've kind of learned how to
condense<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.150> video<00:06:33.360> down<00:06:33.630> and<00:06:33.840> get<00:06:33.930> the<00:06:34.020> most

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
condense the video down and get the most

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.320 
condense the video down and get the most
important<00:06:34.800> information<00:06:34.890> into<00:06:35.730> it<00:06:35.880> and<00:06:36.060> we're

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
important information into it and we're

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.400 
important information into it and we're
probably<00:06:36.450> going<00:06:36.660> to<00:06:36.720> do<00:06:36.870> one<00:06:37.050> more<00:06:37.080> of<00:06:37.320> these

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
probably going to do one more of these

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.110 
probably going to do one more of these
in<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.740> future<00:06:37.890> to<00:06:38.250> do<00:06:38.400> with<00:06:38.580> mobs<00:06:38.820> and

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
in the future to do with mobs and

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.119 
in the future to do with mobs and
entities<00:06:39.540> like<00:06:39.870> minecarts<00:06:40.410> and<00:06:40.560> stuff<00:06:40.740> like

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
entities like minecarts and stuff like

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.279 
entities like minecarts and stuff like
