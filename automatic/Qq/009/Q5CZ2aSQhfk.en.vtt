not really but I think they brought me
my<00:04:03.599> family<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:04.230> was<00:04:04.380> born<00:04:04.620> into<00:04:04.799> that<00:04:05.069> so

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
my family I was born into that so

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.850

there's<00:04:06.060> obstacles<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.989> have<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.680> get

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
there's obstacles you have to get

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.080 
there's obstacles you have to get
through<00:04:08.010> themselves<00:04:08.190> don't<00:04:08.670> take<00:04:08.880> the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
through themselves don't take the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.270 
through themselves don't take the
shortcut<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.750> think<00:04:10.170> switching<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.739> family<00:04:11.160> is

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
shortcut I think switching to family is

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.520 
shortcut I think switching to family is
as<00:04:11.519> nice<00:04:11.819> as<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.030> sounds<00:04:12.510> it's<00:04:12.810> not<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.380> right

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
as nice as it sounds it's not the right

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.890 
as nice as it sounds it's not the right
if<00:04:14.010> everything<00:04:14.849> was<00:04:14.970> perfect<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.540> wouldn't<00:04:15.720> be

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
if everything was perfect it wouldn't be

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.490 
if everything was perfect it wouldn't be
a<00:04:17.180> real<00:04:18.180> family<00:04:18.419> like

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
a real family like

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.170 
a real family like
families<00:04:20.220> do<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.610> have<00:04:21.060> their

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
families do have you have their

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.580 
families do have you have their
arguments<00:04:21.480> their<00:04:21.840> bounce<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.440> think

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
arguments their bounce and I think

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.190 
arguments their bounce and I think
that's<00:04:22.710> part<00:04:22.920> of<00:04:22.980> what<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.640> family<00:04:23.790> is<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.420> love

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
the fact that my family is original

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.850 
the fact that my family is original
it's<00:04:27.900> not<00:04:28.050> like<00:04:28.200> one<00:04:28.350> of<00:04:28.440> those<00:04:28.530> perfect

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
it's not like one of those perfect

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.240 
it's not like one of those perfect
families<00:04:29.250> we<00:04:30.210> make<00:04:30.390> mistakes<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.170> do<00:04:32.070> all

that we stay together
I<00:04:33.720> would<00:04:34.080> never<00:04:34.170> save<00:04:34.440> my<00:04:34.560> family<00:04:35.840> even<00:04:36.840> if<00:04:36.960> you

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
I would never save my family even if you

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.840 
I would never save my family even if you
have<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.140> chance<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.500> meet<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.740> new<00:04:37.890> daddy<00:04:38.190> you're
