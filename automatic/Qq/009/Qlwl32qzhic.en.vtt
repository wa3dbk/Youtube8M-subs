00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.279
 Kettle is english 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.800
 although I have given everything and am downright to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.970
 our depth came at the castle 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.970
 and today, as for the 2, they are also very good 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.210
 Schapdetten's endorsement has especially attracted my party's treasures 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.210
 in which all possibilities asphalt on and Abs 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.430
 the forces were APEC 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.170
 and inland traffic deep 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 surprised by good 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.440
 besides 8 missions are all easier 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 in Dusseldorf possible that 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.110
 his strengths 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.510
 Every issue has to be 24 "When we open everything in the world again 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
 He welcomed Credit Suisse quite well 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.730
 she does not quite empty 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.120
 and if what he is not for me 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.310
 At some point I designed 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 yes it was really really serious care case he 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.110
 magnificent trade association challenge so spectacular what would you rather be 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.850
 there are no handles now it has become longer i am deeply saddened 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.470
 about which he becomes spectacular 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.850
 a few shivers in lay 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.210
 and the difficulty of being similar to the current one 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.210
 when no one climbs though rather it has to get harder and harder 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.120
 it's just full throttle 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.950
 Now, having second place open in Zurich can rob that all off of me 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.789
 actually relatively expected that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.229
 Balance sheets all climbers us 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.229
 but expect from Struck 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.629
 I calculate that because there are 20-30 believers all 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.929
 can lead to the final 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.949
 Daytime depending on the whole week now in advance of today 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.529
 of course, know what caught 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.629
 I wanted to make time unit but I drive reports 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.159
 Dog droppings both one 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.349
 a bad certain triangle from the band
