 archaeologists is linked with the 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.940
 development works and could act 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.790
 quickly and before the destruction of the site by 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.690
 work prepares operations 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.310
 archeological 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.840
 it's about preventive archeology 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.950
 yeah well you just do not have one 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.970
 archaeologist on hand for him 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.430
 helps me find my phone from a 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.880
 thing because then it's been two years 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.240
 I look for 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.220
 we prepare our work by preparing a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.290
 diagnosis by doing the research 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.930
 historical first and then the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.430
 interregional commission judge if issued 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.050
 of this diagnosis there is a search 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.800
 prescribed or not in any case the small 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.370
 voice me what I like in 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.440
 archeology 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.390
 it's the digging there I just did 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.120
 an amazing discovery I discovered 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.540
 boots in my opinion this is the second 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.610
 empire 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.020
 yeah but there is a man at the end of 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.740
 boots but that one there you are in the process of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.210
 scare the game 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.850
 so you take your little clicks and 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.440
 slaps and you break quietly 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.729
 yes okay falls to the little voice this 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.950
 if you can go on before that 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.950
 degenerates there because rochette 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.640
 oula good I like it degenerates and I leave 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.290
 speak to our specialist for us 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.750
 present the archaeological excavations in 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.130
 link with method if one intervenes in 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.290
 the frame of an ark of an archeology 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.580
 so preventive on the site bye bye 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.380
 the goal is to try to understand 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.700
 neighborhood evolution since the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.040
 ancient period to see from 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.900
 when men settled here 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.970
 to see also the type of occupation 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.830
 on confronting them with something 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.850
 rather craft rather domestic what 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.800
 are crazy they are very very 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.630
 fruitful because we have been able to study 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.850
 buildings characterized the type 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.990
 of occupation that were current and also 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.990
 dated touched level 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.890
 we will try to translate the whole 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.350
 discovery on lead shots it's a 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.790
 first a first element and geo 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.710
 referenced all these discoveries 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.380
 then the furniture will be studied 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.400
 drawn and restored to be 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.580
 exposed at the museum of the Golden Court in 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.350
 thalassotherapy matter from here 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.110
 a few days it will have to make the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.360
 ground for construction celebrated the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.800
 embankment of the future pie street which 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.170
 resumes the name of a street 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.310
 medieval that passed to this same place 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.170
