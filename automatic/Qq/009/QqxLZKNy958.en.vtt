00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.700
 nicolÃ¡s magazine of students of 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.700
 social anthropology and human geography 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.270
 the kinship topology is a sub 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.220
 discipline of social anthropology that 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.580
 is dedicated to studying history in this 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.090
 institution of human reproduction 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:42.030
 how the reproduction of the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.190
 socially fit individuals through 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.910
 institutions like marriage the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.720
 family the relation of descent and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.720
 others 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.310
 ah 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.310
 i 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.059
 and the anthropology of kinship arises 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.740
 together with the social anthropology of 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.600
 done the first jobs in 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.980
 anthropology the foundation of the studies 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.140
 of anthropology can be considered 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.370
 as the foundation of the studies of 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.640
 relationship 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:18.550
 this happens around 1870 with louis 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.900
 henry morgan with affinity systems and 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.300
 consanguinity of the human family 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.770
 all important anthropologists have 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.870
 done studies on kinship 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.540
 then the anthropology of kinship 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.540
 goes hand in hand with social anthropology 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 ah 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.009
 rather it could be said that the study 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.039
 of kinship is the hinge between 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.300
 social dimension and dimension 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.430
 let's call it subjects 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.410
 the kinship topology has reached 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.620
 denaturalize relationships 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.170
 kinship and has shown us that the 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.360
 conception that we have of relations of 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.990
 kinship as based on relationships 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.900
 genetic or biological 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.240
 our own society is saying many 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.840
 cultures in the world as demonstrated 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.730
 in anthropology they do not build their 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.600
 kinship relationships from 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.600
 biological ties 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.230
 It would have to be said to ask about 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.600
 the origin of something is not a question 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.570
 relevant in the anthropological field more 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.430
 well we could say what is the notion 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.680
 that anthropology has built on 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.690
 the family and in that sense we can 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.890
 say that it has also denatured 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.050
 a lot of time there was talk of the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.610
 universality of the family this has already 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.220
 been totally debated and overcome by 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.380
 contemporary anthropology there is no 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.720
 universality of the family there is no 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.090
 naturalness of the family however 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.700
 these notions so deeply 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.160
 settled in common sense are the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.420
 that harder anthropology 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.340
 you can build and give a definition 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.250
 then there is currently no 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.640
 definition of family the authors speak 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.620
 well I want to say there is no definition 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.930
 the universally accepted family 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.150
 anthropologists rather we talk about groups 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.090
 domestic 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.110
 Y 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.660
 of relationships what distinguishes the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.510
 anthropology of other disciplines that 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.430
 they also study the family is that for 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.980
 the anthropologists are first the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.489
 relations the offspring the german and 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.790
 affinity dad and the family is not 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.269
 taken as a thing as a die but 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.720
 as the product of a series of 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.830
 relationships and constructions 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.830
 Historical and cultural 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.159
 to 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.610
 well we have to talk in our 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.880
 societies of families because there is no 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.959
 a single general type we can not define 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.540
 the family as simply the unit of 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.510
 more pro gm couple that would be the kind of 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.790
 restricted family called so by him 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.450
 seen other authors called her family 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.360
 conjugal nuclear family then what 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:40.870
 we understand by our society in the 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:46.149
 Mexico City - Contemporary there is a 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.649
 85% of units called homes 

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:50.629
 constituted by family ties what 

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:53.959
 means this that there is 15 percent 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:56.659
 of people who cohabit without having 

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:58.999
 family ties is not all 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.389
 people who live together and live 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:05.949
 together they are related to each other within 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:09.319
 this or 85 percent of people who 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.649
 whose homes have family ties 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.709
 each other we find in many types 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:18.110
 we find restricted type or 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:19.729
 nuclear is to say more progeny couple in 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.399
 different points of your cycle of 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.069
 development we also find homes 

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:29.089
 of extended family is to say where there is 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:31.449
 two or three marriage alliances also 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:34.789
 we found many single-family homes 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.149
 then diversity is very big 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:41.509
 this has type constructions 

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:44.619
 demographic of spatial type and about 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.619
 everything of cultural type
