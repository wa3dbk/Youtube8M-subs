00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:06.230
 we will now pass the draw groups starting with group 1 with the figure 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.740
 somersault as a submarine 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.070
 the front carp position and the ascent from the front position 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.930
 with a partial somersault the body assume the position of double cancan 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.080
 submerged 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.350
 one of the tenth legs to join the horizontal position of the body reform 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.200
 a cancan position simply submerged 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.790
 in this position 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.180
 the bodies rise until reaching the surface in position of simple cancan 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.480
 the figure ends with city against 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.240
 trunk until it reaches a 90 degree angle 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.310
 legs and so remained during the spin 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.400
 until the athlete reaches the double cancan submerged position 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.940
 When reaching this position the palm have undergone lifting is used 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.730
 during the descent of one of the legs to always try under threat 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.280
 on the rise for those who have surface 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.970
 can be used palm cross shaft to start 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.860
 or just as an example of this figure 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.230
 the descent of cancan and extension of sailboat depends on a good arrival to 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.230
 surface 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
 what we ask 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.169
 in the position of quotaters the athlete must slide his legs across the surface in 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.370
 towards the trunk that remain phillips and with good posture 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.829
 with this it the prisoners that do not have cost of the water line 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.879
 with the continued movement the body rolls back in 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.329
 on December 4 by a side- 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.359
 until you reach the position of fun gurupÃ¡ 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.579
 note that the twisting of the boys was performed with the body using palm 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.259
 stubbornly to balance and sustain the position 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.189
 this position should be very compact with the hips close to the feet and the 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.989
 knees next to cheese 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.779
 the athlete then begins to climb one of the legs at the same time as 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.829
 proportional form of the trunk 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.070
 she should leave the round column 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.219
 and it fits in the hips 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.989
 descending the chain by extending one leg to the vertical position with the 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.989
 other leg flexed in a controlled manner 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.120
 an imaginary line 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.879
 the decrease of a head they are supported perpendicular to the 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.999
 surface 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.169
 must be maintained throughout the rolling process 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:03.569
 note that you are an athlete and show almost only two types of stick 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.709
 mateyu 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.709
 the support next to the comics 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.069
 and where the support can arrive grouped inverted and until the end of the descent
