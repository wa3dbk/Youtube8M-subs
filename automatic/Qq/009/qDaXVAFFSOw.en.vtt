right<00:00:06.210> now<00:00:06.330> we're<00:00:06.420> going<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.600> talk<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:06.870> how

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
right now we're going to talk about how

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.350 
right now we're going to talk about how
to<00:00:07.470> do<00:00:07.680> what's<00:00:07.919> called<00:00:08.069> lead<00:00:08.490> belaying<00:00:08.910> for

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
to do what's called lead belaying for

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.919 
to do what's called lead belaying for
indoor<00:00:09.960> sport<00:00:10.290> climbing<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.580> similar<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
indoor sport climbing so similar to the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.690 
indoor sport climbing so similar to the
same<00:00:13.139> principle<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.860> used<00:00:14.070> earlier<00:00:14.490> when

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
same principle that we used earlier when

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.000 
same principle that we used earlier when

so<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.119> climber<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.510> moving<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> wall

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
so as the climber is moving up the wall

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
so as the climber is moving up the wall
one<00:00:32.130> critical<00:00:32.550> thing<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.730> you're<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
one critical thing that you're going to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
one critical thing that you're going to
be<00:00:33.149> doing<00:00:33.300> while<00:00:33.690> lead<00:00:33.930> belaying<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.500> giving

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
be doing while lead belaying is giving

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580 
be doing while lead belaying is giving
slack<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> climber<00:00:36.450> allowing<00:00:37.230> rope<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
slack to the climber allowing rope to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.950 
slack to the climber allowing rope to
actually<00:00:38.010> feed<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.370> both<00:00:38.640> directions<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
actually feed in both directions so that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.540 
actually feed in both directions so that
the<00:00:40.079> climber<00:00:40.290> has<00:00:40.500> more<00:00:40.800> rope<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.190> they're

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the climber has more rope as they're

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.130 
the climber has more rope as they're
moving<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.969> you're<00:00:42.570> also<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> be

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
moving up you're also going to be

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.260 
moving up you're also going to be
breaking<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.860> belay<00:00:44.129> device<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> prepared

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
breaking that belay device and prepared

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.760 
breaking that belay device and prepared
to<00:00:45.390> catch<00:00:45.570> any<00:00:45.719> Falls<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.260> case<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> climber

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to catch any Falls in case the climber

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.830 
to catch any Falls in case the climber
comes<00:00:47.039> off<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> wall<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.239> you're<00:00:48.570> still

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
comes off the wall but you're still

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.750 
comes off the wall but you're still
never<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.530> letting<00:00:49.770> go<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.520> break

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
never going to be letting go that break

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.450 
never going to be letting go that break
end<00:00:51.320> before<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> climber<00:00:52.770> makes<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> first

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
end before the climber makes the first

end before the climber makes the first
clip<00:00:53.850> you're<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.570> spotting<00:00:55.050> them

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
clip you're going to be spotting them

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.660 
clip you're going to be spotting them
similar<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
similar to the way you would if the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
similar to the way you would if the
climber<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:57.059> bouldering<00:00:57.539> once<00:00:58.109> guys<00:00:58.350> makes

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
climber was bouldering once guys makes

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.709 
climber was bouldering once guys makes
this<00:00:58.829> first<00:00:59.070> clip<00:00:59.370> he'll<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.120> belay<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this first clip he'll be on belay and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.709 
this first clip he'll be on belay and
I'll<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.199> ready<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.949> belaying<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> go<00:01:03.600> ahead

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
I'll be ready to be belaying so go ahead

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.320 
I'll be ready to be belaying so go ahead
guys<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.710> start<00:01:04.949> climbing

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.790 

now<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.540> guys<00:01:13.690> has<00:01:13.870> made<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.230> clip<00:01:14.500> I'll

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
now that guys has made that clip I'll

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.160 
now that guys has made that clip I'll
put<00:01:15.340> him<00:01:15.460> on<00:01:15.640> belay<00:01:16.030> pulling<00:01:16.570> out<00:01:16.690> any<00:01:16.870> extra
