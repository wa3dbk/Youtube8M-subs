00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
addition of two digit numbers three tens

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.200 
addition of two digit numbers three tens
plus<00:00:07.950> four<00:00:08.400> verse<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:09.210> equal<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.290> thirty<00:00:11.219> plus

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
plus four verse is equal to thirty plus

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.230 
plus four verse is equal to thirty plus
four<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.259> equal<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:14.570> 34<00:00:16.520> we<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:18.109> add<00:00:19.109> like<00:00:19.410> this

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
four is equal to 34 we can add like this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:36.799 
four is equal to 34 we can add like this
hence<00:00:21.260> once<00:00:22.369> 30<00:00:23.990> plus<00:00:25.220> 4<00:00:28.760> we<00:00:29.760> write<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:33.410> for<00:00:35.809> Z

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
hence once 30 plus 4 we write here for Z

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:51.110 
hence once 30 plus 4 we write here for Z
plus<00:00:37.590> 4<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:40.640> here<00:00:46.610> 334<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> test<00:00:50.309> two<00:00:50.760> tenths

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
plus 4 for here 334 and test two tenths

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:02.529 
plus 4 for here 334 and test two tenths
a<00:00:52.370> bunsen<00:00:53.399> verse<00:00:54.710> first<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:56.010> add<00:00:56.600> 62<00:00:57.600> plus<00:00:58.670> 25
