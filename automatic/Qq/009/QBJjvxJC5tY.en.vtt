out<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.220> first<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> epic<00:01:48.750> on

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
out so the first one here is the epic on

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.280 
out so the first one here is the epic on
TR<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.649> TR<00:01:49.950> stands<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.430> trail<00:01:51.020> we've<00:01:52.020> had<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
TR the TR stands for trail we've had the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.080 
TR the TR stands for trail we've had the
epic<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.829> many<00:01:52.920> years<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.759> have

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
epic on for many years but now we have

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.420 
epic on for many years but now we have
it<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.360> every<00:01:54.720> wheel<00:01:54.869> size<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:56.040> got<00:01:56.159> twenty

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it in every wheel size so we got twenty

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.359 
it in every wheel size so we got twenty
six<00:01:56.700> twenty<00:01:56.939> seven<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.479> half

this<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> 32<00:02:00.630> mil<00:02:01.020> stanchion<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:02.400> will<00:02:02.520> come

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
this is a 32 mil stanchion it will come

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.060 
this is a 32 mil stanchion it will come
with<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.909> hollow<00:02:03.150> crown<00:02:03.560> we<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> couple

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
with a hollow crown we have a couple

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.260 
with a hollow crown we have a couple
different<00:02:05.250> dampers<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:05.970> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.150> get<00:02:06.240> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
different dampers so you can get a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.090 
different dampers so you can get a
remote<00:02:06.600> lockout<00:02:07.140> or<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.470> crown<00:02:07.710> mounted

remote lockout or a crown mounted

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.160 
remote lockout or a crown mounted
lockout<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.789> then<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.630> options<00:02:10.080> for

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
lockout and then you have options for

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.559 
lockout and then you have options for
low-speed<00:02:10.830> compression<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.270> simple

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
low-speed compression or just simple

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
purposely built for the enduro racing so

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.199 
purposely built for the enduro racing so
we<00:02:24.420> pump<00:02:24.660> up<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.989> stanchion<00:02:25.440> size<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.209> 34

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
we pump up the stanchion size to a 34

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.059 
we pump up the stanchion size to a 34
millimeter

7000<00:02:29.069> series<00:02:29.250> still<00:02:30.120> have<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.300> hollow<00:02:30.630> crown<00:02:31.340> it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
7000 series still have a hollow crown it

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.880 
7000 series still have a hollow crown it
has<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.489> wider<00:02:32.850> stance<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> crown<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.680> it

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
has a wider stance to the crown so it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.890 
has a wider stance to the crown so it
gives<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> bit<00:02:35.459> more<00:02:35.760> stiffness<00:02:36.450> out<00:02:36.780> of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
gives you a bit more stiffness out of

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.020 
gives you a bit more stiffness out of
the<00:02:37.019> four<00:02:37.890> steering<00:02:38.220> steering<00:02:38.760> precision

Q<00:02:51.930> lock<00:02:52.170> system<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:53.069> is<00:02:53.190> called<00:02:53.400> key<00:02:53.610> lock<00:02:53.790> to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
Q lock system this is called key lock to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.090 
Q lock system this is called key lock to
basically<00:02:54.810> operation<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.500> is<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.769> open

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
basically operation of this is you open

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.160 
basically operation of this is you open
the<00:02:56.190> lever<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.970> then<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.540> push<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.780> button

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
the lever and then you push the button

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.949 
the lever and then you push the button
and<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.410> depresses<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.190> collet<00:02:59.610> system<00:03:00.030> so

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
and that depresses this collet system so

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.600 
and that depresses this collet system so
we've<00:03:01.440> designed<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.430> just

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
we've designed this so that you just

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.710 
we've designed this so that you just
simply<00:03:03.269> push<00:03:03.630> down<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.410> turn<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.299> holds

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
simply push down and turn and it holds

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.199 
simply push down and turn and it holds
the<00:03:06.989> collet<00:03:07.320> system<00:03:07.709> down<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.730> can<00:03:08.880> slide

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
the collet system down so it can slide

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.600 
the collet system down so it can slide
in<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.600> out<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.810> hub<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:10.680> free<00:03:11.519> it

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
in and out of the hub and then free it

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.330 
in and out of the hub and then free it
up<00:03:12.230> slam<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.380> curricula<00:03:13.739> down<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.220> you're

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
up slam the curricula down and you're

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.370 
up slam the curricula down and you're
good<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.700> go<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.510> probably<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> fastest

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
good to go so it's probably the fastest

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.990
