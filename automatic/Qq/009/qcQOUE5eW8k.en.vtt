00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629 
the Boynton vessel by far the best thing

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.839 
the Boynton vessel by far the best thing
that<00:04:41.659> was<00:04:41.930> ever<00:04:42.169> ever<00:04:42.620> designed<00:04:43.370> put<00:04:43.729> on<00:04:43.819> a

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
that was ever ever designed put on a

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.489 
that was ever ever designed put on a
tank<00:04:44.090> so<00:04:44.389> that's<00:04:44.749> where<00:04:44.930> we<00:04:45.020> got<00:04:45.229> off<00:04:45.349> hot

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:45.499 
tank so that's where we got off hot

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:48.100 
tank so that's where we got off hot
water<00:04:45.710> from<00:04:45.949> and<00:04:46.490> without<00:04:46.699> that<00:04:46.909> you<00:04:47.900> just

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
water from and without that you just

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.800 
water from and without that you just
wouldn't<00:04:48.259> go<00:04:48.379> anywhere<00:04:48.789> we<00:04:49.789> stole<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.539> idea

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
wouldn't go anywhere we stole the idea

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.360 
wouldn't go anywhere we stole the idea
you<00:04:51.020> can<00:04:51.110> now<00:04:51.259> find<00:04:51.499> something<00:04:51.889> very<00:04:52.159> very

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
you can now find something very very

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.860 
you can now find something very very
similar<00:04:52.699> it's<00:04:52.909> almost<00:04:53.060> identical<00:04:53.210> design

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
similar it's almost identical design

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.480 
similar it's almost identical design
just<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.169> slightly<00:04:54.409> different<00:04:54.529> tan<00:04:54.919> color<00:04:55.219> in

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
just to slightly different tan color in

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.580 
just to slightly different tan color in
the<00:04:55.849> Abrams<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:56.749> in<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:56.960> Bradley<00:04:57.319> I<00:04:57.439> think

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
the Abrams and in the Bradley I think

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.589 
the Abrams and in the Bradley I think
strikers<00:04:57.949> happen<00:04:58.219> as<00:04:58.310> well<00:04:58.490> so<00:04:59.210> we<00:04:59.389> are<00:04:59.479> not

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
strikers happen as well so we are not

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.050 
strikers happen as well so we are not
too<00:04:59.810> proud<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.499> steal<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:00.800> good<00:05:01.099> idea<00:05:01.400> because

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
too proud to steal a good idea because

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.260 
too proud to steal a good idea because

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
you know your projector on the bag

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.399 
you know your projector on the bag
charge<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.479> then<00:05:14.569> obviously<00:05:14.689> the<00:05:14.900> vent<00:05:15.080> tube

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
charge and then obviously the vent tube

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.290 
charge and then obviously the vent tube
as<00:05:15.710> well<00:05:15.979> which<00:05:16.189> starts<00:05:16.580> initiates<00:05:17.029> the<00:05:17.180> whole

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
as well which starts initiates the whole

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.360 
as well which starts initiates the whole
system<00:05:17.719> they're<00:05:18.169> not<00:05:18.289> 50<00:05:18.620> caliber<00:05:18.949> magazine

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370

as<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.669> were<00:05:19.789> so<00:05:20.029> I<00:05:20.330> mean<00:05:20.659> there<00:05:21.050> is<00:05:21.139> always

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
as it were so I mean there is always

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.080 
as it were so I mean there is always
great<00:05:21.710> argument<00:05:22.129> as<00:05:22.189> to<00:05:22.219> how<00:05:22.370> quickly<00:05:22.729> you<00:05:23.060> can

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
great argument as to how quickly you can

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.700 
great argument as to how quickly you can
load<00:05:23.509> around<00:05:23.629> this<00:05:24.020> with<00:05:24.259> a<00:05:24.289> three<00:05:24.529> piece

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
load around this with a three piece

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.140 
load around this with a three piece
first<00:05:24.979> is<00:05:25.129> the<00:05:25.219> one<00:05:25.370> piece<00:05:25.550> now<00:05:25.699> personally<00:05:25.909> I

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
first is the one piece now personally I

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.850 
first is the one piece now personally I
think<00:05:26.330> because<00:05:26.659> you<00:05:27.020> can<00:05:27.169> upload<00:05:27.439> the<00:05:27.650> round

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
think because you can upload the round

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.499 
think because you can upload the round
and<00:05:28.129> they<00:05:28.550> are<00:05:28.610> small<00:05:28.879> and<00:05:28.939> easy<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.389> maneuver

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
and they are small and easy to maneuver

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.110 
and they are small and easy to maneuver
I<00:05:29.990> think<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.620> know<00:05:30.680> just<00:05:30.800> as<00:05:31.069> quick<00:05:31.310> but<00:05:31.520> yeah

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
I think you know just as quick but yeah

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.279 
I think you know just as quick but yeah
I<00:05:32.150> do<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.509> mean<00:05:32.689> I've<00:05:32.779> seen<00:05:32.900> obviously<00:05:33.199> I've

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
I do I mean I've seen obviously I've

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.409 
I do I mean I've seen obviously I've
been<00:05:33.439> on<00:05:33.529> you<00:05:33.800> know<00:05:33.889> a<00:05:33.949> few<00:05:34.520> American<00:05:34.999> vehicles

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
been on you know a few American vehicles

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.670 
been on you know a few American vehicles
I<00:05:35.509> have<00:05:35.659> to<00:05:35.779> say<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:35.990> mean<00:05:36.169> I<00:05:36.319> think<00:05:36.409> it<00:05:36.589> perhaps

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
I have to say I mean I think it perhaps

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.769 
I have to say I mean I think it perhaps
the<00:05:36.860> difference<00:05:37.099> is<00:05:37.490> on<00:05:37.729> here<00:05:38.000> it's<00:05:38.240> a<00:05:38.479> lot<00:05:38.659> of

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779 
the difference is on here it's a lot of

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.420 
the difference is on here it's a lot of
its<00:05:38.900> up<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.110> experience<00:05:39.469> of<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:40.039> loader<00:05:40.250> I

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
its up to experience of the the loader I

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.499 
its up to experience of the the loader I
mean<00:05:40.580> obviously<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:40.909> more<00:05:41.000> experienced<00:05:41.360> load

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
mean obviously the more experienced load

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.329 
mean obviously the more experienced load
is<00:05:41.689> were<00:05:41.900> able<00:05:42.319> to<00:05:42.349> do<00:05:42.469> it<00:05:42.620> quicker<00:05:42.860> than<00:05:42.979> the

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:43.339 
is were able to do it quicker than the

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.179 
is were able to do it quicker than the
new<00:05:43.729> load<00:05:43.909> is<00:05:44.469> purely<00:05:45.469> by<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.740> fact<00:05:45.979> and<00:05:46.129> I

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:46.189 
new load is purely by the fact and I

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:48.429 
new load is purely by the fact and I
have<00:05:46.339> to<00:05:46.490> say<00:05:46.729> that<00:05:46.969> it<00:05:47.180> was<00:05:47.419> you<00:05:47.810> know<00:05:47.839> it<00:05:48.169> was

00:05:48.429 --> 00:05:48.439 
have to say that it was you know it was

00:05:48.439 --> 00:06:02.839 
have to say that it was you know it was
quite<00:05:48.800> tiring<00:05:49.129> system<00:05:49.669> today

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.909 

you
