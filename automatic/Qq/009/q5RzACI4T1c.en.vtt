00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 geo people what's on brazil's start 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.470
 that the ece games is finally starting 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.730
 and fittingly I have a little one 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.230
 video made so that you can see 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.880
 which vehicles are really too 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.710
 buy and if its really easier 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.020
 Since then, let's go first 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 the pegasus of her tested to see 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 if a vehicle is really raceworthy 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.990
 I consider it under three points 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.029
 once the curve position the acceleration 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.830
 and the final speed looks here 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.449
 you just straighten out the straight 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.650
 final speed of the super horny I have 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 even the impression that he has one more 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.630
 tick goes over the central and me 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 have to say I was not enough here 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.629
 especially with my colleagues 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.370
 stumbles and clean and nice greetings 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.540
 at this point 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.040
 and they can definitely do this 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.289
 stretch on the office on the animal 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.910
 tested very well with their drive 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.440
 center and you can see it here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.800
 partie goes off right 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.420
 Gets a Leap Forward so much 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.289
 the final speed is on everyone 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.879
 fall convincingly straight after the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.399
 kurvenlage you can see her husband is coming 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 right around I had the feeling of 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.760
 drives approximately like the tourism 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.200
 Here you can see just now and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.939
 slightly lifted and still has 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.630
 quickly return to the ground 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.520
 found 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.010
 as well as here over the sand 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.570
 horse fits everything in any case 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.950
 acceleration I can not quite exactly 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.000
 say but I guess it's about 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.040
 as with the center 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.170
 all in all a mega 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.350
 horny there are fat times thumb 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.270
 high for rockstar and I'll leave you 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.700
 now a little bit to watch how 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.970
 I drove it 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.970
 music 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.470
 It is worthwhile to buy in any case 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.610
 so we are the race track five rounds 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.310
 Drove and I wanted you now 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.430
 again to the end yes show how 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.960
 that has become exciting again 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.670
 here I have times like right 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.900
 in the last round shortly before the end 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.520
 everyone who knows the route knows 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.220
 decision 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.990
 but because this car overboard properly 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.330
 is and really cool in the 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.800
 curve I guess that's me 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.250
 but still somehow managed 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.860
 Susi to overtake though the track 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.790
 really good but drives against osiris 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.800
 camera and do nothing 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.990
 peep as where the center away he drifts 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.610
 osiris just keep it up after me 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.750
 now so much positive about the one 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.459
 I have to say car now unfortunately 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.860
 much negative about say than others 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.450
 So here goes the benni formality in sterling 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.800
 In any case, a really cool 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.650
 car also in reallife if i have him 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.209
 really wet but to race unfortunately 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.290
 not really suitable if you are here 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.030
 sees end speed and 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.700
 Acceleration in contrast to the collision 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.709
 we do not know from the name update 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.480
 chance and even coquette 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.959
 classic overtakes him and leaves him 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.959
 stand correctly 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.530
 Of course he has an advantage anyway 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.090
 So I noticed or 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.230
 I feel it so that a curve yet 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.550
 is somehow horny than any other 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.830
 You can see classics here now 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.970
 which runs quite well around and have since 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.900
 I think I also have a bit of space 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.170
 extended to the front 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.100
 that means for very winding roads 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.730
 you can of course still in 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.730
 use race 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.390
 Well, here I am the turn 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.220
 somehow drove very slowly but 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.300
 Well, the others are apparently too 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.890
 did not come around so fast 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.420
 it always has the problem the old ones 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.880
 Classics who have no abs and 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.510
 are just the ko and so fucked up 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.010
 somehow I have now 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.120
 managed to come at first but 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.000
 I lost the race 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.380
 but anyway, I do not care 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.970
 find him so I'll get him anyway 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.440
 not sell here completely slipped away 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.760
 I will not sell it anyway 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.350
 because I think that's a horny cart 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.169
 looks great from sontra city and you have to 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.130
 you finally know yourself 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.540
 so that 's it with the 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.890
 video I hope you liked it 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.240
 or you know what you are 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.530
 should buy and many thanks for 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.530
 watch and warsaw
