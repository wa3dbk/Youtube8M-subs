00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
this plant is Cistus sunset magenta rock

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.540 
this plant is Cistus sunset magenta rock
rose<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.609> rock<00:00:05.819> rose<00:00:06.120> family<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.930> a

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
rose and the rock rose family is a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.629 
rose and the rock rose family is a
really<00:00:08.900> broad<00:00:09.900> group<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.800> plants<00:00:11.160> they<00:00:11.610> are

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
really broad group of plants they are

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.320 
really broad group of plants they are
from<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.690> Mediterranean<00:00:13.530> area<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.330> very

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
from the Mediterranean area and very

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.830 
from the Mediterranean area and very
useful<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:16.170> drier<00:00:16.949> areas<00:00:17.580> especially<00:00:18.240> neat

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
useful in drier areas especially neat

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.990 
useful in drier areas especially neat
near<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> seashore

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
near the seashore

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.529 
near the seashore
they<00:00:21.720> are<00:00:22.080> very<00:00:22.439> deer<00:00:22.920> resistant<00:00:23.580> because

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
they are very deer resistant because

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.140 
they are very deer resistant because
their<00:00:25.050> leaves<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.650> full<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.070> resin<00:00:26.340> that's

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
their leaves are full of resin that's

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.439 
their leaves are full of resin that's
can<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.080> quite<00:00:28.560> pungent<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.910> deer<00:00:30.150> just

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
can be quite pungent and the deer just

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.770 
can be quite pungent and the deer just
don't<00:00:30.779> seem<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.360> that<00:00:33.360> along

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
don't seem to like that so that along

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.889 
don't seem to like that so that along
with<00:00:34.160> very<00:00:35.160> good<00:00:35.460> drought<00:00:35.760> resistance<00:00:36.510> makes

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
with very good drought resistance makes

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.049 
with very good drought resistance makes
these<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.559> popular<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.820> said

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
these very popular and as I said

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.470 
these very popular and as I said
especially<00:00:39.210> near<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.680> ocean<00:00:41.250> these<00:00:42.000> that

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
especially near the ocean these that

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.240 
especially near the ocean these that
you're<00:00:42.660> looking<00:00:43.050> at<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.680> Pacific<00:00:44.219> Grove

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
you're looking at are in Pacific Grove

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.660 
you're looking at are in Pacific Grove
California<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.860> much<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.460> San

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
California and much like the San

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.690 
California and much like the San
Francisco<00:00:48.390> area<00:00:48.660> along<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> coast

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
Francisco area along the coast

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.630 
Francisco area along the coast
so<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.840> design<00:00:52.410> what<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.280> these

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so in design what I like about these

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.139 
so in design what I like about these
plants<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:55.430> they<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.820> natural

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
plants is that they have this natural

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.310 
plants is that they have this natural
form<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.410> see<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.840> this<00:01:00.840> plants

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
form that you see here and this plants

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.250 
form that you see here and this plants
probably<00:01:01.620> never<00:01:02.100> been<00:01:02.430> pruned<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.719> 4

beginning<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.280> bloom<00:01:17.520> by<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.060> time<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.630> gets

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
beginning to bloom by the time this gets

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
beginning to bloom by the time this gets
its<00:01:19.170> full<00:01:19.500> bloom<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.400> probably<00:01:20.850> won't<00:01:21.090> see

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
its full bloom you probably won't see

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
its full bloom you probably won't see
very<00:01:21.540> much<00:01:21.810> foliage<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.799> thousands<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
very much foliage there are thousands of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.530 
very much foliage there are thousands of
flowers<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.990> plant<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.030> that's<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.390> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
flowers on this plant and that's one of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.560 
flowers on this plant and that's one of
the<00:01:28.100> things<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.340> make<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:29.729> popular<00:01:30.420> is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the things that make these popular is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
the things that make these popular is
that<00:01:30.600> when<00:01:30.990> they<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.350> into<00:01:31.560> their<00:01:31.860> full<00:01:32.189> show

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that when they go into their full show

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.469 
that when they go into their full show
they're<00:01:32.939> they're<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:33.270> stunning<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:36.150> they

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
they're they're really stunning and they

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.289 
they're they're really stunning and they
bloom<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.170> early<00:01:37.619> spring<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.400> through

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
bloom from early spring on through

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.050 
bloom from early spring on through
sometimes<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.770> late<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.100> early<00:01:41.579> summer<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
sometimes as late as early summer so

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.889 
sometimes as late as early summer so
probably<00:01:43.189> there's<00:01:44.189> maybe<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.869> three

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
probably there's maybe two to three

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.389 
probably there's maybe two to three
month<00:01:46.380> bloom<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.740> different

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
month bloom and and they can different

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.160 
month bloom and and they can different
types<00:01:50.840> sporadically<00:01:51.840> bloom<00:01:52.290> after<00:01:52.560> that

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
types sporadically bloom after that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.410 
types sporadically bloom after that
again<00:01:55.170> water<00:01:55.740> let's<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.399> into<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.119> take

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
again water let's get into how to take

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.030 
again water let's get into how to take
care<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.780> these<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.290> how<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.469> set<00:01:58.799> them<00:01:59.009> up

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
care of these and how to set them up

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.609 
care of these and how to set them up
once<00:02:00.030> they're<00:02:00.270> established<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:01.170> really

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
once they're established they really

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.039 
once they're established they really
don't<00:02:01.799> need<00:02:02.070> much<00:02:02.310> water<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
don't need much water here in the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.639 
don't need much water here in the
Monterey<00:02:04.920> Bay<00:02:05.070> area<00:02:05.820> there's<00:02:06.570> no<00:02:06.960> seasonal

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
Monterey Bay area there's no seasonal

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.770 
Monterey Bay area there's no seasonal
rain<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.340> about<00:02:08.520> six<00:02:08.910> months<00:02:09.209> during<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
rain for about six months during the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.380 
rain for about six months during the
summer<00:02:09.899> now<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.099> cooler<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:12.180> can

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
summer now it is cooler so they can

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.990 
summer now it is cooler so they can
handle<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
handle that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.120 
handle that
better<00:02:13.240> than<00:02:13.570> some<00:02:13.870> other<00:02:13.900> areas<00:02:14.590> but<00:02:14.860> even

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
better than some other areas but even

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.730 
better than some other areas but even
inland<00:02:15.670> where<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:15.940> live<00:02:16.360> where<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.170> gets<00:02:17.380> into

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
inland where I live where it gets into

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.250 
inland where I live where it gets into
the<00:02:17.860> 90s<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.580> hundreds<00:02:19.030> these<00:02:19.840> are<00:02:20.020> very

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the 90s and the hundreds these are very

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.860 
the 90s and the hundreds these are very
drought<00:02:20.590> tolerant<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:22.270> would<00:02:22.600> say

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
drought tolerant so I would say

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.290 
drought tolerant so I would say
establish<00:02:23.290> these<00:02:23.770> under<00:02:24.220> if<00:02:24.310> irrigation

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
establish these under if irrigation

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.590 
establish these under if irrigation
I<00:02:25.330> wouldn't<00:02:25.960> recommend<00:02:26.110> spraying<00:02:26.710> these<00:02:27.130> and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
I wouldn't recommend spraying these and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.230 
I wouldn't recommend spraying these and
and<00:02:28.600> then<00:02:29.200> they<00:02:29.380> can<00:02:29.590> really<00:02:29.860> be<00:02:30.670> held<00:02:31.000> back

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
and then they can really be held back

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.810 
and then they can really be held back
quite<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> bit<00:02:32.020> once<00:02:32.230> they're<00:02:32.560> established<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
quite a bit once they're established the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.550 
quite a bit once they're established the
one<00:02:33.970> thing<00:02:34.180> about<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.660> plant<00:02:34.990> that<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.260> don't

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
one thing about the plant that I don't

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.740 
one thing about the plant that I don't

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
love is these if you put them in regular

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.930 
love is these if you put them in regular
garden<00:02:38.350> conditions<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.400> water<00:02:39.640> them<00:02:39.880> a

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
then I would want to use these on slopes

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.020 
then I would want to use these on slopes
so<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:08.590> they're<00:03:08.739> not<00:03:08.920> sitting<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.520> low-lying

so that they're not sitting in low-lying

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.820 
so that they're not sitting in low-lying
areas<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.720> would<00:03:10.840> hold<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.230> lot<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.530> moisture
