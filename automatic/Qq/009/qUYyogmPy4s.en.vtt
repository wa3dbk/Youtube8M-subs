00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.320 
I'm actually getting really good at that
game<00:01:37.620> last<00:01:38.220> week<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> buddy<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.970> mine<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
game last week with a buddy of mine in

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.600 
game last week with a buddy of mine in
multiplayer<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.990> won<00:01:40.320> five<00:01:40.620> to<00:01:40.980> be<00:01:41.190> two<00:01:41.370> games

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
multiplayer I won five to be two games

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
multiplayer I won five to be two games
in<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.120> row<00:01:42.300> all<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.780> under<00:01:42.900> 30<00:01:43.230> minutes<00:01:43.530> which

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
in a row all in under 30 minutes which

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.470 
in a row all in under 30 minutes which
is<00:01:43.770> insane<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.340> most<00:01:44.850> games<00:01:44.970> lasts<00:01:45.300> about

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
is insane because most games lasts about

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.570 
is insane because most games lasts about
30<00:01:45.720> minutes<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.200> an<00:01:46.260> hour<00:01:46.409> we<00:01:47.130> kept<00:01:47.310> making<00:01:47.400> the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
30 minutes to an hour we kept making the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.070 
30 minutes to an hour we kept making the
enemy<00:01:47.790> surrender<00:01:48.180> by<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.450> rushing<00:01:48.780> about<00:01:48.870> to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
enemy surrender by just rushing about to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.370 
enemy surrender by just rushing about to
start<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:49.650> brilliant

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
start it was brilliant

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.289 
start it was brilliant
so<00:01:51.950> yeah<00:01:52.040> that's<00:01:52.159> pretty<00:01:52.340> much<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.549> when<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.060> get

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299
