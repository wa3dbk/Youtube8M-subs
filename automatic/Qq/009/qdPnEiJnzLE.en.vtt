00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 need how we are going to do it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.390
 they are things that almost everyone has at home 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 and so 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.399
 super easy to do very little things 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.800
 little things 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.879
 we're going to need accounts of course 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.339
 today one went flying two or two accounts 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.960
 three different sizes ok I 'm 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.600
 occupying these that are really a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.570
 little bit big after I'm occupying 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.480
 these medium and if you want some 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.180
 chiquititas as well as chaquiras and good 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.340
 those are like perlitas type ok and good 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.820
 we are also going to need 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.979
 scissors a piece of cardboard that have 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.409
 a little bit hard as well as the box 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.610
 cereal also any glue or 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.460
 hot silicone can also do 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.010
 also a ring and the base of a ring 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.660
 it can be one that we do not want or a 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010
 old man we have out there or what 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.350
 We can buy any store 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.720
 crafts ok and we're also going to 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.150
 need a milestone pencil now what 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.370
 Let's do with our cardboard 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.740
 let's see our account we are going to 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.890
 need a big one that is the base and 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.350
 let's make today another one that goes flying 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.540
 let's make a bigger circle than 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.520
 this granny like a centimeter more 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.110
 big one that the ball that we go to 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.360
 work I can not tell you the measure 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.670
 because I do not know what kind of what kind 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.110
 of little stories I will use but one that 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.090
 be a little bit big that there is going 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.720
 to be the base already after we have 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.350
 We will cut our circle by 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.979
 supposed to cut and we will have something left 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.170
 so good is perfect but then there I 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.270
 I tried good already having it so what 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.050
 let's do that we're going to bring our 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.239
 accounts what we 're going to approach with 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.580
 our accounts marks us a little bit the 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.190
 camera 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.640
 and we're going to start hitting 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.380
 - from the center of our little circle 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.380
 our account the big ok 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.110
 what is going to be our base now the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.590
 account we are going to stick with the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.360
 perforations on the sides where I have 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.760
 my fingers are the perforations so the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.680
 we are going to paste in the center we are not going to 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.450
 stick with the perforations facing up 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.080
 because if you are not going to see a little bit 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.080
 feito 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.090
 well 0 and a half now super easy 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.879
 around we are going to put more glue and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.700
 let's go putting the accounts of another 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.019
 color and another size a little bit more 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.020
 little ones that our account then 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.090
 our base account 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.640
 a case simply there we are 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.990
 putting glue and let's go putting 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.990
 one by one 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.909
 around and the little stories 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.819
 we are also going to paste them just like the 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.360
 large with perforations on the sides 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.990
 so that it does not look 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.990
 okay 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.110
 as I told you they can occupy any 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.850
 kind of glue 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.100
 okay 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:45.060
 It can also be silicon if they have 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:49.160
 those little pistols that are finite 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.900
 ok and so we're going to hit everything 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.900
 the outline of our 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.760
 of our ring ok after doing 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.860
 this row what we can do that 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.280
 above the black accounts we can 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.280
 put other smaller accounts 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.860
 as a type of chaquiras 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.860
 but that is optional ok 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.040
 and so it will be the last ok 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.940
 and so we will be ok what we are going to 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.010
 to do that we are going to let it dry is 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.500
 glue we need a glue that 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.180
 be strong and dry fast in this 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.390
 case I did not have one that stays super 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:43.220
 fast and then let's leave it 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:45.590
 dry this is an option ok now here 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.570
 I give you another option that is the one 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.460
 I have previously dried so we will 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.400
 be final result as I said 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.400
 that can put other accounts up 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.819
 of course it's smaller as well 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.819
 around like this 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.780
 ok so around our ring 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.120
 okay 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.060
 or if we want we can leave it as well 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.770
 Well, I'm showing it to you right now 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.330
 just what are we going to do that the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.330
 let's stick to our ring 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.710
 with the same glue we are going to paste it 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.710
 let's grab our base 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.680
 and we're going to hit him like this 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.680
 okay 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:51.570
 in this way so below as 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:55.290
 they realize me here because you see the 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.690
 color you see the cardboard in this I put it on 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.200
 I put the color back where the 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.510
 beads and cut and carton the color 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.970
 of the cardboard I put it down here in this 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.020
 occasion I put it backwards and so we 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:13.260
 this beautiful vintage ring is going to be 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:17.340
 or romantic as you want to say ok 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.520
 these are two options here I have other 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.110
 if they do not want to do it so 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.510
 formal because this one has super formal 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.400
 here I have a super fun colorful 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.710
 we can also do them with an account 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.830
 of various colors as well as to use of 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.600
 daily or for school our work 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:38.400
 and at night we put our 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.710
 well formal ring well romantic serves 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.460
 and then here we have the other one that we 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.100
 it is drying 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:48.900
