00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
yeah it's very fast especially when you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.859 
yeah it's very fast especially when you
hold<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.259> yeah<00:01:46.909> yeah<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
hold it like yeah yeah to get what it is

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.330 
hold it like yeah yeah to get what it is
i<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.259> way<00:01:49.380> i'm<00:01:49.440> holding<00:01:49.770> means<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
i think the way i'm holding means it

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
i think the way i'm holding means it
faster<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.149> i<00:01:51.330> take<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.940> looks<00:01:54.479> even

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
faster if i take this one it looks even

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
faster if i take this one it looks even
slower<00:01:55.110> than<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.500> did<00:01:55.740> before<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.130> held<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
slower than it did before I held it this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.300 
slower than it did before I held it this
way<00:01:56.819> so<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> hand<00:01:58.050> isn't<00:01:58.229> necessarily<00:01:58.979> what's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
way so the hand isn't necessarily what's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.249 
way so the hand isn't necessarily what's
fast<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.539> fruit<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.460> top<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:02.880> hand
