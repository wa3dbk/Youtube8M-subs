00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.180 
but I would like a pink diamond LeBron
James<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.750> I<00:05:05.780> don't<00:05:06.470> know<00:05:06.590> tonight<00:05:06.920> I<00:05:06.950> might

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
James so I don't know tonight I might

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.470 
James so I don't know tonight I might
have<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.400> go<00:05:07.520> with<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.700> Cavs<00:05:07.940> man<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:08.390> I'm

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
have to go with the Cavs man but I'm

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.820 
have to go with the Cavs man but I'm
pretty<00:05:08.660> sure<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:08.930> Cavs<00:05:09.110> not<00:05:09.290> going<00:05:09.470> win<00:05:09.620> I

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
pretty sure the Cavs not going win I

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.680 
pretty sure the Cavs not going win I
think<00:05:10.130> I<00:05:10.580> think<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.940> finals<00:05:11.300> are<00:05:11.390> actually

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
think I think the finals are actually

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.470 
think I think the finals are actually
set<00:05:11.930> up<00:05:12.130> for<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.550> Cavs<00:05:13.820> to<00:05:14.000> win<00:05:14.180> in<00:05:14.300> seven

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
set up for the Cavs to win in seven

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.110 
set up for the Cavs to win in seven
games<00:05:14.860> so<00:05:15.860> that's<00:05:16.220> why<00:05:16.370> I<00:05:16.400> don't<00:05:16.550> think<00:05:16.940> that

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
games so that's why I don't think that

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.510 
games so that's why I don't think that
they<00:05:17.480> are<00:05:17.780> gonna<00:05:18.050> win<00:05:18.230> tonight<00:05:18.530> but<00:05:18.740> anyways

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
they are gonna win tonight but anyways

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.220 
they are gonna win tonight but anyways
