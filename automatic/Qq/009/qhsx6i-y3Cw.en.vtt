the care Finiti did nothing for me
I<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.230> took<00:00:43.379> my<00:00:43.440> hair<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.280> quick<00:00:44.610> weave

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I just took my hair out of a quick weave

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.450 
I just took my hair out of a quick weave
and<00:00:45.329> decided<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.530> wanted<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> wear<00:00:47.100> my<00:00:47.129> own

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and decided that I wanted to wear my own

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.360 
and decided that I wanted to wear my own
hair<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.750> don't<00:00:48.899> really<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370

what<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.500> but<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.890> how<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> looks

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
what I like but really like how it looks

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.400

because<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.390> in-between<00:00:54.629> stage

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
because I'm in that in-between stage

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.590 
because I'm in that in-between stage
where<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.920> don't<00:00:56.160> really<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.760> what<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.420> do
