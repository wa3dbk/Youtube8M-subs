 So I'll show you the before and it's 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.029
 which I entered from my room to the door and 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.899

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.330
 with wallpaper that you know 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.790
 You know 41 but the law he was ne 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.920
 super cheap at the time is that you have this mine 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.350
 I do not have a computer on this board. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.030
 The hard part is that there 's my bed. 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 while announcing the people at the time I am 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.859

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.280

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.649
 I hate that I had a banner here 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.609
 of my 15 years I took it and it was just 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.980
 stained 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.079
 I do not know if they are following from here but the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.000
 wall so it is stained so I want to do 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.229
 something with a taboo so I guess 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.149
 that 's something we come to the window 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.619
 I'll have that curtain but I 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.160
 I did not like it either 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.470
 that the dresser good people this wall 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.179

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.490
 I went to vote these balls when 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.259
 It came to go red, but then when I 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.509
 I then decided to put this paper 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.460

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.959
 Thursday night but what leaves me for 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.020
 You take it from me. 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.490
 so girls 14 was painted yesterday I 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.820
 I'll show you a little bit of 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.190
 How good the color is is to stay 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.650
 strong that color was to stay pink indeed 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.020
 it turned out to be the same but it was because 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.400
 I bought a very small drop then 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.230
 have to mix with a white paint 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.060
 to try to cover part of everything else 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.110
 I finally liked the color though. 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.760
 while not 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.280
 the room was empty but for now 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.340
 I liked the color and this wall here 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.890
 it was in a suede tone that I too 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.470
 I found the ceiling of white that was 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.470
 swollen and there you see me 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.120
 I changed the position of the room above some 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.710
 things you have to put on the device 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.200
 because we met all the holes 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.180
 it 's not because there because on that wall 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.860
 family then had several 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.530
 holes in the buildings to hold a 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.060
 mirror the lights and then how I am here 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.000
 The side had to come to cover the holes. 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.430
 then put the dough blank for nothing 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.260
 here in my room and I separated everything that 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.870
 have to hang on the wall again 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.290
 Why is it that once here and there? 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.780
 that I bought this light spot here 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.169
 there leroy I failed him 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.450
 I said so because in your teaching was to 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.760
 this focus of light but there are judges who 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.000
 without legend is much better than the law 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.160
 It will warm up and here are the pictures. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.200
 they stayed on the wall here afraid of 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.940
 computer has to put on the wall 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.440
 so how are you watching 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.800
 The dressing table changed places will be 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.990
 now on this wall here and there it goes 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.420
 stay on the dressing table and on that 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.880
 the computer is on the block 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.040
 I did not find you either so this is it 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.840
 now the boy is missing here 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.940
 looking like on the streets to me and going 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.740
 fix it time and I recorded dollar 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.090

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.710
 How will he fix it? 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.050

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.670
 here and something else we want to help with 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.130
 these two puffs I do not know what I 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.050
 I was with the idea of couch them 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.750
 but I put it on the wall 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.820
 bush as ugly still have a doubt 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.280
 What do you think leaves them like this? 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.810
 I buy a cloth to cover these two 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.910
 puffins and who do you think 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.440
 leave here in the comments by then 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.360
 Girls, I just showed my room to 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.370
 You've seen more or less how it is. 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.710
 What, I think, about a three-four 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.330
 days it's ready depending on the guy 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.980
 What are you going to install here? 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.530
 for me to fix them here. 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.480
 ceiling but people are sorry not having 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.700
 many videos because I thought I had 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.010
 video is in the group and I do not 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.290
 I had then no place to record 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.930
 my fourth place that only I have 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.760
 I can have our legal power to record and 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.950
 That's when I have a hotel today that shows 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.630
 same as me on the wall so do not have 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.700
 how to record the liberals and now for you 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.170
 and you do not run out of video but it was the 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.820
 advice understood and so when 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.590
 have everything installed as everything 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.030

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.700
