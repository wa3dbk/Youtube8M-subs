week<00:04:34.410> my<00:04:34.590> husband<00:04:34.860> asked<00:04:35.070> me<00:04:35.160> when<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.310> was

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
week my husband asked me when I was

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.550 
week my husband asked me when I was
going<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.090> think<00:04:36.120> that's<00:04:36.630> kind<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
going to and I think that's kind of the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.470 
going to and I think that's kind of the
kick<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.860> ribs<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.220> needed<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.820> get<00:04:38.970> working

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
kick in the ribs I needed to get working

out<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:40.740> can<00:04:41.070> tell<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.310> weight<00:04:41.460> loss<00:04:41.580> is

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
out I can tell the weight loss is

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.260 
out I can tell the weight loss is
slowing<00:04:42.270> down<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.570> ditch<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.260> think<00:04:44.270> well

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
slowing down the ditch and I think well

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.910 
slowing down the ditch and I think well
I<00:04:45.330> always<00:04:45.510> say<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.050> then<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.620> end<00:04:46.860> up

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
I always say that and then I end up

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.800 
I always say that and then I end up
losing<00:04:47.310> like<00:04:47.460> six<00:04:47.820> pounds<00:04:48.000> next<00:04:48.300> week<00:04:48.540> so<00:04:48.780> I
