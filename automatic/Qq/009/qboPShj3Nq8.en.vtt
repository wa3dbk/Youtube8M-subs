00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
Claudia's life and she used the exact

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.060 
Claudia's life and she used the exact
same<00:03:39.390> kit<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.900> use<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.500> she<00:03:40.800> just<00:03:40.920> did

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
same kit that I use and she just did

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.380 
same kit that I use and she just did
like<00:03:41.220> random<00:03:41.489> highlights<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.030> we're<00:03:42.120> like<00:03:42.239> oh

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
that seems like a good idea to make it

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.979 
that seems like a good idea to make it
blend<00:03:44.010> more<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:45.239> it's<00:03:45.420> actually<00:03:45.720> my<00:03:45.780> first

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
blend more so it's actually my first

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.330 
blend more so it's actually my first

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.690 
time doing it this way so we'll see how
it<00:03:47.459> goes

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700

the first I'm going to be using is the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.380
