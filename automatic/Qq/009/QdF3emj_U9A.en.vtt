thought I want three frogs just put a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.849 
thought I want three frogs just put a
lot<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.719> frogs<00:01:09.899> in<00:01:10.079> ponds<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.530> things<00:01:10.679> but<00:01:10.770> I

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 
lot of frogs in ponds and things but I

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.109 
lot of frogs in ponds and things but I
got<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.069> little<00:01:11.130> three<00:01:11.399> for<00:01:11.549> example<00:01:11.639> six

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
got these little three for example six

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.199 
got these little three for example six
of<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.389> and<00:01:12.749> they're<00:01:13.700> really<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:14.909> cute

and so I thought must throw them in the
garden<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.240> they'll<00:01:18.389> be<00:01:18.509> nature<00:01:18.719> and<00:01:19.079> that<00:01:19.170> is

garden and they'll be nature and that is
kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.709> live<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.219> breathe<00:01:21.209> it<00:01:21.569> had<00:01:21.719> lots<00:01:21.869> of

unnatural cold across the bush but hey

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.030
