00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
can see one as soon as I had the circle
button<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.230> cross<00:01:28.470> button<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:29.250> gonna<00:01:29.520> be

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
button the cross button I'm gonna be

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.250 
button the cross button I'm gonna be
holding<00:01:29.850> l2<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:31.500> make<00:01:31.770> nine<00:01:32.760> Golan<00:01:33.270> manually

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
holding l2 to make nine Golan manually

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.320 
holding l2 to make nine Golan manually
back<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> header<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:35.730> pass<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
back of the header up and pass it to the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.450 
back of the header up and pass it to the
player<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.900> think<00:01:37.080> is<00:01:37.470> more<00:01:37.650> accurate<00:01:38.190> when<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
player I think is more accurate when you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:58.190 
player I think is more accurate when you
use<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.730> manual<00:01:38.940> button<00:01:39.330> which<00:01:39.480> smell<00:01:39.780> too

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.050 

our<00:01:59.200> second<00:01:59.830> tactic<00:02:00.160> is<00:02:00.340> similar<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.940> the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
our second tactic is similar to the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.240 
our second tactic is similar to the
first<00:02:01.360> one<00:02:01.600> but<00:02:02.080> what<00:02:02.290> we<00:02:02.380> gonna<00:02:02.530> do<00:02:02.740> guys

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
first one but what we gonna do guys

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.960 
first one but what we gonna do guys
when<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.700> hold<00:02:04.030> l1<00:02:04.330> just<00:02:05.230> hold<00:02:05.500> l1<00:02:05.770> a<00:02:06.310> player

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
when you hold l1 just hold l1 a player

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.800 
when you hold l1 just hold l1 a player
will<00:02:07.240> come<00:02:07.480> closer<00:02:08.220> automatically<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:10.420> make<00:02:10.600> a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
will come closer automatically to make a

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.120 
will come closer automatically to make a
bet<00:02:11.050> opponent<00:02:11.410> thinking<00:02:11.710> that<00:02:11.860> you're<00:02:11.980> gonna

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
bet opponent thinking that you're gonna

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.690 
bet opponent thinking that you're gonna
pass<00:02:12.430> we're<00:02:12.850> gonna<00:02:12.970> tap<00:02:13.360> l1<00:02:14.140> once<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:15.130> player

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
pass we're gonna tap l1 once a player

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.190 
pass we're gonna tap l1 once a player
comes<00:02:16.030> forward<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.630> then<00:02:16.930> we're<00:02:17.080> gonna

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
comes forward and then we're gonna

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.960 
comes forward and then we're gonna
