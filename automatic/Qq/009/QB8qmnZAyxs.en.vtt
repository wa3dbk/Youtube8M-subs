you<00:02:24.120> always<00:02:24.390> give<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.959> read<00:02:25.260> through<00:02:27.349> now

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
you always give this a read through now

you always give this a read through now
back<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.739> plane<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.819> made<00:02:29.970> out<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.209> an

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
back to the plane this is made out of an

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.750 
back to the plane this is made out of an
EPO<00:02:30.780> foam<00:02:31.170> which<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.650> very<00:02:32.010> very<00:02:32.250> good<00:02:32.489> it's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
EPO foam which is very very good it's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.259 
EPO foam which is very very good it's
lightweight<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.900> crash<00:02:34.349> resistant<00:02:35.269> the

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
lightweight and crash resistant the

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.030 
lightweight and crash resistant the
electronics<00:02:36.959> in<00:02:37.049> this<00:02:37.200> thing<00:02:37.379> come<00:02:37.709> fully

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
electronics in this thing come fully

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.120 
electronics in this thing come fully
installed<00:02:38.549> they<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.330> underneath<00:02:39.750> here

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
installed they are underneath here

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.870 
installed they are underneath here
simply<00:02:41.130> pull<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:42.510> comes<00:02:42.720> away<00:02:42.870> very<00:02:43.170> nicely<00:02:43.880> up

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
simply pull it comes away very nicely up

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.660 
simply pull it comes away very nicely up
front<00:02:45.269> we<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.870> battery<00:02:46.140> it's<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:47.190> seven

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
front we have the battery it's a seven

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.839 
front we have the battery it's a seven
point<00:02:47.819> five<00:02:48.120> volt<00:02:48.650> 450<00:02:49.650> amp<00:02:49.860> battery<00:02:50.310> all<00:02:50.790> I

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
point five volt 450 amp battery all I

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.839 
point five volt 450 amp battery all I
pub<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.019> it's<00:02:52.170> very<00:02:52.470> very<00:02:52.650> good<00:02:53.040> it'll<00:02:53.579> take

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
pub so it's very very good it'll take

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.759 
pub so it's very very good it'll take
around<00:02:54.060> an<00:02:54.390> hour<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.810> charge<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.620> will

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
around an hour to charge and it will

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.720 
around an hour to charge and it will
give<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.069> very<00:02:56.459> nice<00:02:56.700> flight<00:02:57.060> time<00:02:58.549> at<00:02:59.549> the

thing all you need to do is get yourself

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.210 
thing all you need to do is get yourself
some<00:04:23.300> batteries<00:04:23.840> which<00:04:24.470> you'll<00:04:24.710> need<00:04:24.890> eight

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
some batteries which you'll need eight

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.610 
some batteries which you'll need eight
double-a<00:04:25.910> batteries<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.900> go<00:04:27.020> inside<00:04:27.350> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
double-a batteries to go inside the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.469 
double-a batteries to go inside the
actual<00:04:27.770> control<00:04:28.340> here<00:04:29.110> once<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.260> put<00:04:30.620> them<00:04:30.800> in

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
actual control here once you put them in

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.290 
actual control here once you put them in
simply<00:04:32.479> turn<00:04:32.780> your<00:04:32.960> control<00:04:33.290> on<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.880> then

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
simply turn your control on and then

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.740 
simply turn your control on and then
connect<00:04:35.690> up<00:04:35.979> your<00:04:36.979> battery<00:04:37.729> and<00:04:37.910> your<00:04:38.479> motor

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
connect up your battery and your motor

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.850 
connect up your battery and your motor
inside<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.590> plane<00:04:39.830> very<00:04:40.370> very<00:04:40.640> easy<00:04:41.830> once<00:04:42.830> you

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
inside the plane very very easy once you

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.409 
inside the plane very very easy once you
hear<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.190> sound<00:04:45.910> you'll<00:04:46.910> see<00:04:47.120> that<00:04:47.240> it's

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
hear that sound you'll see that it's

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.260 
hear that sound you'll see that it's
slowly<00:04:47.660> connecting<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:48.440> there<00:04:49.010> we<00:04:49.130> go<00:04:49.310> it's

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
slowly connecting and there we go it's

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.030 
slowly connecting and there we go it's
fully<00:04:50.479> connected<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:51.470> now<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.650> can<00:04:52.010> see

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
fully connected so now you can see

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.100 
fully connected so now you can see
everything<00:04:52.820> that<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.300> camera<00:04:53.660> can<00:04:53.690> see<00:04:56.110> very

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
everything that the camera can see very

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.240 
everything that the camera can see very
very<00:04:57.500> good<00:04:57.740> as<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:59.510> can<00:04:59.660> tell<00:05:00.020> it's<00:05:00.260> very<00:05:00.919> very

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
very good as you can tell it's very very

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.550 
very good as you can tell it's very very
good<00:05:01.430> quality<00:05:01.640> screen<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.930> picture<00:05:03.320> itself
