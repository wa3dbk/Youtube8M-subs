00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.080
 so before you submit his latest report 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.759
 so I did not go on to find out how 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.390
 and that it was believed that Michel to regain competition of the enclosure 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.140
 Parisian 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.970
 with our flying cannelloni recipe 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 so it's still time of preparation work 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.359
 I hope now we have nothing to luck that's all 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.769
 it's the first time 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.769
 here are his whims and the settings 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 it was to find the flat courses 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.460
 we agreed on a blog 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.600
 the most determined knowing that we had three seats 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.520
 three dishes that was important to me 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.290
 we came across the one on the finish he dies rework on a flat on 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.790
 which we had already worked on and which seduced us both 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.569
 at the same time the former a sharp rise according to the INSEE 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:56.760
 I am against this young woman 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700
 to read you 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.190
 for castles, by the way 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.030
 great supporter of the om 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 you go bordeaux what is that yes 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.000
 so mom 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.620
 and it's true that theirs 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.220
 also having people without silly corals 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.050
 it's not time it's a dish it's funny because it's not a dish 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.510
 was done for the circumstances 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.110
 the question of his identity it's a dish that are from the book 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.980
 and it's one of the few plates denied day 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.230
 from theater side in perpignan 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.790
 and this dish he even has a story is that it's a dish I made 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.550
 the issue of 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.590
 in europe his appetite of course 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.000
 while if you see the robuchon dish 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.610
 alas since the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 he evolved during 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.150
 michel the aesthetics of plastic evening or if a procedure 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.540
 it is true that this climate 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.850
 so decided the dish is my departure 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 and the fact that pr dr 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.400
 she harder things 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.660
 ben sahar sanogo 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.510
 sanou in montebourg 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.850
 stimulated 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.790
 to get the most out of 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.470
 some dishes and it's true that having made the book helped me in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.699
 my approach 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.309
 what I was reading about the picture is a man 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.659
 but we realize the importance of the photo already 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.029
 when I realized it when I travel and soon like these 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.609
 settings indeed not the same dishes has just happened if the 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:25.599
 plasters 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.689
 we have to say that we will be saved depending on the country according to 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.619
 products the chefs 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.919
 different counts of sometimes the mediocrity of the dish through him 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:39.979
 a small device 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.269
 but I like 6% of teemix 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.310
 and often I did photos like that the fly in japan - marseille 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.930
 and at his apartment where I did it I definitely decided each time 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.919
 will pass 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.619
 it's badly positioned 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.619
 who did that singing with a professional photographer these clauses 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.619
 immediately we realize 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.759
 of the purpose of 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:06.759
 this relationship to the arena 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.759
 this study evaluates the six finals 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:12.990
 short for the week of the aces 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.539
 he can enjoy 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.139
 % over the period 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.639
 you could bring his titles 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.659
 the hostility of the North more beautiful his debut the breakage that will bring the 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.459
 just wear the fact that 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.459
 we may be going out of the polls 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.419
 it's a way of 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.419
 a vision of the dish a little different 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.469
 a little different from the one you tried is to be in the same 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.429
 phase of the same as reading years 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.599
 but I'm not going abroad because it's useless 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.599
 for going to see what was happening in others it's that it's 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.659
 a little it turns the spirit of this good opening of world importance 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.189
 claude du ch and must all paid 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.599
 because your account 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.109
 honda career you evolve 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.620
 and evolving it also means going to see what the 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:01.309
 other 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:02.829
 we made it known 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.559
 anea both safe 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.309
 for these delivered tickets 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.329
 laurent is a fight and I think the aesthetics already has been 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.699
 brought by the Japanese Japanese crisis 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:12.639
 the goal 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.739
 I killed the priest's side of your places-here- 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.469
 I played at ten and a photographer of the future jubilation 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.859
 if we can the curious 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.330
 ten years ago it's abominable what we actually did 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.580
 the general customers is abominable this is the time that wanted that 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.639
 now 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.439
 how when we see evolution the evolution of dishes the evolution of 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:35.550
 our cuisine has gone through the fact that we are 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.909
 known to travel all 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.289
 the Russian economy 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.449
 come to purify to make things more liquid more visible 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.909
 I see a housing the numbers will be compensated 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.909
 these huge evolution the house threegros 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.210
 when you touch all the big bosses over the avenue so not at 

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.879
 program 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.229
 a version of stone 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.059
 68 'intermediate version michel lapierre 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:00.879
 and there it is michel full and frankly this error 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.189
 I found that so it evolved in the ocean monsanto and it's going 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.529
 better 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.089
 that is to say that what everyone did, however, believes the era what I know 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:11.229
 now michel troisgros growing in his present day 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.229
 and she lives on them but I would have become nerdy 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.449
 so if that requires 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.699
 but still questioned 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.680
 considering the age of 6 years but on these have questioned 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.189
 compared to our offer to our kitchen 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.759
 for example average more cream is more than two hours March 28 m 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.389
 I go through things that we 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.809
 match many others 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:31.830
 it goes by guy delisle by d 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.830
 the products scene by 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.540
 we are in another triplet here and finding ourselves daddy company 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.190
 pope to have seen things elsewhere to have traveled 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.779
 and then first of all his own 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.589
 his own culture too 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:47.439
 what is necessary is to remain oneself 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.139
 I do not want to have a culinary past for them 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.529
 pump or to go 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.279
 for the voices of the atmb the arrondissement including the righteous actually a little 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.860
 editing that is done elsewhere everything is eaten 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.580
 always is it that the dish 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.419
 it is just the right 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.529
 for the picture 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.979
 after that it's true that as part of 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.400
 of the restaurant 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.080
 I will not spend a quarter of an hour positioning the coast on the cannelloni 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.949
 we will do it 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.370
 her recent setbacks did not look at her after the others along 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.520
 his past choices 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.680
 it's the raviole dough it's the arduous notebook this entry of the heart 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.810
 aubergines from the circle 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.050
 chives 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.050
 it is purifying complaining not to do more 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.249
 no no what mattered was above all to eat the dish 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:30.150
 is that are greedy 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.150
 in total amputated left arm 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.889
 not to run away for the moment we do not know if you can 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.309
 the euro at 1 41 euro reflects with me 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.729
 the alert was raised as a result that there were 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.309
 will be taken into account 

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:51.449
 waratahs forms
