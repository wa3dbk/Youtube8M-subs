00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.230
 what's up, how are you? 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.270
 super good and if you who are watching me 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.610
 You do not know me if you are new or new to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.160
 this super-welcome channel, my name is 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.740
 Ricardo we see him here all the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.779
 Wednesday and well welcome all 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.540
 to the second episode of the special 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.309
 huacal or cava or as they know it and in the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.590
 last video I explained to you what 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.449
 It's basically about using these 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 wooden boxes and turn them into something 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.769
 incredible without spending so much and with the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.510
 satisfaction that we are recycling and 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.219
 for today's video how can you see in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 the title is about something that many 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.090
 will save our lives mainly 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.399
 those who have pets and that 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.200
 we love it is a super bed 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.390
 cute for your puppy that also 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.730
 will love him or her but if you want 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.810
 to know with what and how I did not 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.170
 move and hands to work 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.170
 Y 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:14.950
 and the materials that we are going to need 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.950
 to make this beautiful little bed 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:38.120
 huÃ¡scar or java you the wadding foami thread and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.120
 needle and the tool of always 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.260
 and the first thing we're going to do is the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.260
 cushion quoted we start by cutting the fabric 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.369
 for this we are going to need two 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.490
 rectangles 48 x 29 centimeters 2 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.040
 strips of 29 x 5 centimeters and other two 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.410
 strips 48 x 5 centimeters 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.209
 first of all I recommend that 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.860
 they sew the fabric instead of sticking it 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.630
 it is safer 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.190
 I had planned to meet her but to the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.940
 time to record I found it needle by 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.730
 no side so I had no choice 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.310
 but if it gives them lazy to sew or do not know 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.680
 or have no one to help them, no 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.460
 nothing happens with the hot silicone is 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.340
 very well 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.480
 and then nothing started sticking the strips 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.480
 to the fabric rectangle 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.010
 once this is done we are going to paste the other 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.510
 rectangle at the other end of the strips 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.280
 between this procedure we are going to go 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.270
 sticking the strips together to go 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.270
 closing the sachet 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.190
 and just like a little bag we have to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.019
 stay in this way remember that 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.519
 we have to leave a space without hitting 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.110
 so that through this opening 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.570
 we can fill the pad 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.310
 Now we take the wadding and we start it 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.640
 tear to make us stay like 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.640
 cotton 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.650
 and once this is done we proceed to 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.650
 Fill 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.110
 and since it is completely filled 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.460
 we finished gluing the fabric to close 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.110
 and ready it 's time to pass the crate 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.660
 as we did in the video has happened let's go 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.270
 to start removing on the boards but 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.980
 a lot of eye this time we're just going to 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.710
 remove two of the long ones so that we 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.630
 something like that remains after we make sure 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.720
 that do not have a nail left that can 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.300
 hurt our pet and we proceed to 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.130
 paint it first I give it a hand in 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.130
 white color so that it works for me as 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.350
 base color and then I paint it pink 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.240
 because it 's for my dog â€‹â€‹but you 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.240
 can put in the colors they want 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.240
 and I'm highlighting the planchette of 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.370
 forward in yellow so that 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.680
 have more color game 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.479
 finally print my name 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.780
 doggie and I use it as a mold for 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:58.260
 cut out in families letters 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.260
 all right 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.250
 he stuck it in the cradle and ready 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.490
 i 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.490
 the result is this 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.180
 i 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.599
 ah 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.599
 ah 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.670
 and what they thought surely he liked 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.100
 yes but I'm more confident than your puppy 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.440
 or your puppy will love that my glasses 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.810
 without this idea because it is super versatile 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.300
 you can change the color to the jaba to 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.490
 the fabric with another pattern can 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.290
 put accessories other drawings like 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.150
 want is more can do several 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.310
 Mattress if we are changing to 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.410
 every so often for example when 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.720
 they are going to wash so they have some extras 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.970
 and your puppy or dog keeps sleeping 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.950
 as king or as queen and if they want 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.110
 save even more or do not want to do the 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.330
 I'm going to give you another idea 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.610
 can use a pillow or some 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.410
 old cushion and there they save almost everything 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.720
 the expense and you do not need to have a 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.760
 they can do it and give themselves away 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.600
 Some friend that they know they have 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.640
 pet 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.050
 I'm sure you will love the gift 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.090
 and that's all in today's video 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.310
 remember that if you do this or any 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.470
 another one of the things that you see in this channel 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.630

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.370

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.020
