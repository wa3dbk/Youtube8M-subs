00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
going to create a diagonal part kind of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.560 
going to create a diagonal part kind of
at<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> corner<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:55.710> eye<00:00:55.770> up<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.570> that's

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
take a diagonal section like that and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510 
take a diagonal section like that and
we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.440> all<00:01:01.620> ready<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.160> our<00:01:02.280> next

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
you like how it looks if the front

doesn't look quite dramatic enough you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.420 
doesn't look quite dramatic enough you
can<00:02:19.140> always<00:02:19.350> loosen<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.400> little

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
can always loosen it up just a little

can go ahead and secure your hair with
an<00:02:25.980> elastic<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.760> then<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.930> need<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.080 
an elastic and then if you need to you
can<00:02:28.530> use<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.710> comb<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.460> even<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.880> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
can use a comb to kind of even out the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.910 
can use a comb to kind of even out the
front<00:02:30.300> bang<00:02:30.540> area<00:02:30.870> if<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.350> looks<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.590> little<00:02:31.709> bit

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
front bang area if it looks a little bit

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.220 
front bang area if it looks a little bit
messy<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:33.450> we're<00:02:33.630> ready<00:02:33.780> for<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.020> final

bun and hairstyle are good to go so this

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.810

we're going to move on to the next
action<00:04:07.410> which<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.520> curl<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.940> cheese<00:04:09.180> some

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
start off with the cheesing let that

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.210 
start off with the cheesing let that
front<00:04:12.060> section<00:04:12.360> of<00:04:12.420> hair<00:04:12.630> down<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.170> split<00:04:14.100> it

front section of hair down and split it
in<00:04:14.310> half<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:15.360> then<00:04:15.510> we're<00:04:15.600> going<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.750> use<00:04:15.900> this

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
in half and then we're going to use this

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.870 
in half and then we're going to use this
back<00:04:16.290> section<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.739> hair<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.160> tease<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.790> a

back section of hair and tease just a
little<00:04:18.180> bit<00:04:18.299> more<00:04:18.540> once<00:04:19.140> that's<00:04:19.380> done<00:04:19.620> go

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
little bit more once that's done go

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.750 
little bit more once that's done go
ahead<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.010> pick<00:04:20.130> up<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.340> rest<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.640> front

section and use your comb to smooth it

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.070 
section and use your comb to smooth it
out<00:04:22.550> then<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.669> grab<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:24.030> large<00:04:24.390> curling<00:04:24.690> iron

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080

and curl those front pieces going away
from<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.180> face<00:04:27.390> so<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:27.990> get<00:04:28.140> some<00:04:28.320> extra

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
from the face so that you get some extra

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.020 
from the face so that you get some extra
texture<00:04:28.980> especially<00:04:29.580> if<00:04:29.640> your<00:04:29.760> hair<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:30.000> a

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
texture especially if your hair is a

texture especially if your hair is a
little<00:04:30.240> shorter<00:04:30.510> than<00:04:30.540> my<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.020> front<00:04:31.260> they

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.450 
that fall out kind of like hers do
throughout<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.530> movie<00:04:34.830> then<00:04:35.130> use<00:04:35.310> your
