00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.680 
I did is I combined the the grip from
the<00:00:47.250> minimalist<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> many<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> are

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the minimalist that many of you are

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.610 
the minimalist that many of you are
familiar<00:00:48.719> with<00:00:49.340> with<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> large<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.690> 90<00:00:52.530> degree

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
familiar with with a large in 90 degree

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.979 
familiar with with a large in 90 degree
hook<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> end<00:00:53.399> ok<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.420> we're<00:00:54.570> talking<00:00:54.690> two

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
hook on the end ok so we're talking two

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.689 
hook on the end ok so we're talking two
inches<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.379> blade<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> 90<00:00:56.190> degree<00:00:56.280> curve

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
inches of blade with a 90 degree curve

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.990 
inches of blade with a 90 degree curve
so<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> real<00:00:57.899> pain<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> manufacture<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.850> it's

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
so a real pain to manufacture but it's

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.470 
so a real pain to manufacture but it's
really<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:02.210> geared<00:01:03.210> towards

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
really kind of it's geared towards

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.850 
really kind of it's geared towards
self-defense<00:01:04.019> there's<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.650> much

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
self-defense there's not really much

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.289 
self-defense there's not really much
utility<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.519> anything<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.090> much

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
utility with anything with this much

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.750 
utility with anything with this much
much<00:01:06.840> thin<00:01:07.110> point<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.610> it's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
much thin point but really for what it's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.780 
much thin point but really for what it's
designed<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.720> excels<00:01:10.610> for<00:01:11.610> those

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
designed for I think it excels for those

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.920 
designed for I think it excels for those
of<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> minimalist

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
of you that don't know the minimalist

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.780 
of you that don't know the minimalist
will<00:01:13.049> actually<00:01:13.350> index<00:01:13.920> into<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.189> end<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
will actually index into the end of the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.370 
will actually index into the end of the
joints<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> fingers<00:01:15.780> instead<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
joints of the fingers instead of the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
joints of the fingers instead of the
palm<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.799> hand<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.640> gives<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> lot

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
palm of the hand so it gives you a lot

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.289 
palm of the hand so it gives you a lot
of<00:01:18.119> control<00:01:18.479> over<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.840> tip<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.200> extreme

yeah it I've got an evil nasty wicked I

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.690 
yeah it I've got an evil nasty wicked I
have<00:01:48.560> people<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.070> just<00:01:49.220> cringe<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.670> little

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
have people that just cringe a little

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.130 
have people that just cringe a little
bit<00:01:50.060> when<00:01:50.240> they<00:01:50.330> see<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.750> counter<00:01:51.080> and

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
bit when they see it in the counter and

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.100 
bit when they see it in the counter and
walk<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.470> other<00:01:51.500> way<00:01:51.680> but<00:01:52.460> um<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:53.120> think<00:01:54.020> it's

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
walk the other way but um I think it's

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.260 
walk the other way but um I think it's
important<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.770> have<00:01:54.980> a<00:01:55.240> purpose-driven<00:01:56.240> life

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
important to have a purpose-driven life

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.510 
important to have a purpose-driven life
brighter<00:01:56.900> it's<00:01:57.170> whether<00:01:57.620> it's<00:01:57.800> for<00:01:57.920> utility

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
brighter it's whether it's for utility

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.490 
brighter it's whether it's for utility
and<00:01:58.700> for<00:01:58.850> every<00:01:59.030> day<00:01:59.150> carry<00:01:59.479> whether<00:02:00.170> it's<00:02:00.350> for

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
and for every day carry whether it's for

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.260 
and for every day carry whether it's for
self-defense<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.850> know<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.000> think<00:02:02.180> it's

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
self-defense you know I think it's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.969 
self-defense you know I think it's
important<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:02.690> carry<00:02:02.930> things<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.860> know

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
important to carry things that you know

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.800 
important to carry things that you know
work<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.640> things<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.330> are<00:02:05.420> designed<00:02:05.540> for

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
work and things that are designed for

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.290 
work and things that are designed for
what<00:02:06.020> they're<00:02:06.229> being<00:02:06.560> used<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.610> when<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.149> get

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
what they're being used so when you get

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.910 
what they're being used so when you get
into<00:02:08.420> self-defense<00:02:09.050> knives<00:02:09.350> do<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.740> have

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
into self-defense knives do you have

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.470 
into self-defense knives do you have
experience<00:02:10.070> with<00:02:10.640> knife<00:02:10.850> fighting<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.360> stuff

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
experience with knife fighting and stuff

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.520 
experience with knife fighting and stuff
like<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.720> have<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.050> ever<00:02:12.200> done<00:02:12.320> any<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.500> that

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
like that have you ever done any of that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.140 
like that have you ever done any of that
kind<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.830> training<00:02:13.070> um<00:02:13.280> no<00:02:13.550> not<00:02:13.730> really<00:02:13.790> and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
kind of training um no not really and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.370 
kind of training um no not really and
what<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.420> was<00:02:14.600> trying<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> do<00:02:15.080> with<00:02:15.260> this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
what I was trying to do with this

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.110 
what I was trying to do with this
project<00:02:15.620> was<00:02:15.980> actually<00:02:16.430> make<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> knife<00:02:16.880> that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
project was actually make a knife that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.630 
project was actually make a knife that
was<00:02:17.360> geared<00:02:17.840> more<00:02:18.140> towards<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
was geared more towards the the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.260 
was geared more towards the the
untrained<00:02:20.150> okay<00:02:20.890> okay<00:02:21.890> because<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.520> if<00:02:23.030> you

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
untrained okay okay because of a if you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.990 
untrained okay okay because of a if you
were<00:02:23.450> use<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:24.100> spear<00:02:25.100> point<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.610> something<00:02:25.910> like

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
were use a spear point or something like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.150 
were use a spear point or something like
that<00:02:26.060> for<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.600> self-defense<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:27.440> it'll<00:02:27.980> tend

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
that for a self-defense like it'll tend

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.920 
that for a self-defense like it'll tend
to<00:02:28.280> hit<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.430> hard<00:02:28.700> target<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.300> slide<00:02:29.690> off<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
to hit a hard target and slide off the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.110 
to hit a hard target and slide off the
side<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:31.040> krann<00:02:31.310> bit<00:02:31.489> late<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:31.820> me<00:02:31.940> makes

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
side so the krann bit late for me makes

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.600 
side so the krann bit late for me makes
perfect<00:02:32.600> sense<00:02:32.840> for<00:02:33.170> an<00:02:33.590> untrained<00:02:34.280> user

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
perfect sense for an untrained user

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.759 
perfect sense for an untrained user
right<00:02:35.120> but<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.630> Quran<00:02:35.959> bits<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.350> are<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
right but the Quran bits that are on the

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.590 
right but the Quran bits that are on the
market<00:02:36.920> tend<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.519> be<00:02:37.640> geared<00:02:38.030> towards<00:02:38.360> those

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
market tend to be geared towards those

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.840 
market tend to be geared towards those
at<00:02:38.810> Tremont<00:02:39.260> right<00:02:39.709> not<00:02:40.010> necessarily<00:02:40.580> those

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
at Tremont right not necessarily those

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.809 
at Tremont right not necessarily those
that<00:02:41.060> are<00:02:41.150> untrained

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
that are untrained

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.330 
that are untrained
self-defense<00:02:42.329> arts<00:02:42.629> right<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.409> why<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:43.980> put

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
self-defense arts right so why not put

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.339 
self-defense arts right so why not put
it<00:02:44.489> into<00:02:44.700> something<00:02:44.939> that's<00:02:45.180> very<00:02:45.329> very<00:02:45.810> it

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
it into something that's very very it

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.379 
it into something that's very very it
fits<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.799> your<00:02:46.829> hand<00:02:46.950> one<00:02:47.249> way<00:02:47.400> right<00:02:47.939> if<00:02:48.180> this

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
fits in your hand one way right if this

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.759 
fits in your hand one way right if this
isn't<00:02:48.629> for<00:02:48.870> twirl<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.379> they're<00:02:49.499> spinning

isn't for twirl and they're spinning

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.830 
dramatically and aggressively / not
necessarily<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.849> be<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> replacement<00:03:03.810> for

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
necessarily to be a replacement for

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.209 
necessarily to be a replacement for
somebody<00:03:04.230> that's<00:03:04.319> trained<00:03:04.620> with<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.799> parameter

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
somebody that's trained with a parameter

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.059 
somebody that's trained with a parameter
right<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:07.049> know<00:03:07.139> this<00:03:07.319> allows<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.919> knife

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
right so you know this allows the knife

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.619 
right so you know this allows the knife
to<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:09.079> basically<00:03:10.079> aggressive<00:03:10.919> okay<00:03:11.760> again

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
to be basically aggressive okay again

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.959 
to be basically aggressive okay again
with<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.019> Bible<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.129> spine<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.400> tried<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.819> keep

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
it thin so that even if this is being

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.679 
it thin so that even if this is being
used<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.609> defensive<00:03:18.060> position<00:03:18.209> and

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:18.689 
used in a defensive position and

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:19.970 
used in a defensive position and

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
backside of this it's still thin enough

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.750 
backside of this it's still thin enough
to<00:03:21.750> puncture<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.199> skin<00:03:22.439> right<00:03:22.980> okay<00:03:23.609> it's

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:57.110 
that but honestly what I'm trying to do
is<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.949> know<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.280> redefine<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
is is you know just redefine the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.670 
is is you know just redefine the
minimalist<00:03:57.540> line<00:03:57.659> into<00:03:57.900> something<00:03:58.259> that<00:03:58.409> fits

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
minimalist line into something that fits

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.439 
minimalist line into something that fits
right<00:03:58.949> line<00:03:59.250> towards<00:03:59.669> self-defense<00:04:00.239> one

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
right line towards self-defense one

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.119 
right line towards self-defense one
that's<00:04:00.629> Purpose<00:04:01.019> Driven<00:04:01.049> for<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.799> exact

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
that's Purpose Driven for that exact

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.939 
that's Purpose Driven for that exact
purpose<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:03.329> think<00:04:03.359> this<00:04:03.840> this<00:04:04.530> kind<00:04:04.799> of

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
purpose and I think this this kind of

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.429 
purpose and I think this this kind of
incorporates<00:04:05.639> some<00:04:06.449> factors<00:04:06.959> some<00:04:07.199> other

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
incorporates some factors some other

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.599 
incorporates some factors some other
knives<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.799> are<00:04:07.889> used<00:04:08.159> for<00:04:08.310> train

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
knives that are used for train

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.670 
knives that are used for train
self-defense<00:04:09.209> but<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:09.870> puts<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.169> in<00:04:10.259> a<00:04:10.349> small

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
self-defense but it puts it in a small

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.979 
self-defense but it puts it in a small
concealable<00:04:11.489> little<00:04:11.729> package<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.689> I<00:04:12.720> think

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
concealable little package that I think

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.159 
concealable little package that I think
people<00:04:13.169> can<00:04:13.549> can<00:04:14.549> get<00:04:15.299> their<00:04:15.479> own<00:04:15.599> use<00:04:15.810> on<00:04:16.019> it

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
people can can get their own use on it

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.710 
people can can get their own use on it
even<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:16.590> it's<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.949> know<00:04:17.070> for<00:04:17.340> that

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
even if it's you know for that

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.330

take<00:04:49.400> a<00:04:49.460> hack<00:04:49.730> at<00:04:49.760> it<00:04:49.970> see<00:04:50.270> how<00:04:50.390> far<00:04:50.600> in<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.900> goes

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
take a hack at it see how far in it goes

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.870 
take a hack at it see how far in it goes
sure<00:04:51.470> with<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.950> thin<00:04:52.160> tip<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.580> would<00:04:52.730> actually

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
sure with the thin tip it would actually

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.060 
sure with the thin tip it would actually
hit<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.540> kind<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:53.870> spring<00:04:54.200> and<00:04:54.350> flexin<00:04:54.860> hit

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
hit and kind of spring and flexin hit

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.830 
hit and kind of spring and flexin hit
that<00:04:55.250> Center<00:04:55.640> you<00:04:56.150> know<00:04:56.180> because<00:04:56.390> everything

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
that Center you know because everything

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.710 
that Center you know because everything
wants<00:04:57.200> to<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:58.430> remain<00:04:58.970> in<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.270> center<00:04:59.570> of<00:04:59.600> that

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
wants to to remain in the center of that

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.690 
wants to to remain in the center of that
gut<00:05:00.110> right<00:05:00.560> in<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.890> center<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.370> that

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
gut right in the center of that that

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.150 
gut right in the center of that that
concave<00:05:02.300> dry<00:05:02.570> line<00:05:02.810> because<00:05:03.320> 90<00:05:03.830> degrees

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
concave dry line because 90 degrees

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.710 
concave dry line because 90 degrees
everything<00:05:04.730> wants<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.030> sit<00:05:05.270> right<00:05:05.300> here<00:05:05.450> in

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
everything wants to sit right here in

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.150 
everything wants to sit right here in
the<00:05:05.780> middle<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:06.080> this<00:05:06.200> no<00:05:06.440> matter<00:05:06.590> how<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:06.890> do

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
the middle of this no matter how you do

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.490 
the middle of this no matter how you do
it<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.090> tip<00:05:08.300> would<00:05:08.480> almost<00:05:08.750> just<00:05:09.020> act<00:05:09.290> as<00:05:09.470> a

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
it so the tip would almost just act as a

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.680 
it so the tip would almost just act as a
spring<00:05:09.980> to<00:05:10.280> get<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.730> Center<00:05:11.030> up<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.390> then

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
spring to get it to Center up and then

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.750 
spring to get it to Center up and then
work<00:05:11.870> right<00:05:12.080> through<00:05:12.110> with<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.220> customs<00:05:13.610> I

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
work right through with the customs I

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.430 
work right through with the customs I
have<00:05:13.940> customs<00:05:14.390> that<00:05:14.480> you<00:05:14.690> can<00:05:14.840> turn<00:05:14.990> 90

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
have customs that you can turn 90

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.140 
have customs that you can turn 90
degrees<00:05:15.710> on<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.010> table<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.520> typical<00:05:16.880> bend

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
degrees on the table the typical bend

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.510 
degrees on the table the typical bend
over

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
over

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.610 
over
90<00:05:18.150> degrees<00:05:18.479> and<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.840> will<00:05:18.960> spring<00:05:19.199> back<00:05:19.229> oh

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
90 degrees and it will spring back oh

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.529 
90 degrees and it will spring back oh
and<00:05:20.069> it's<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.280> other<00:05:20.400> way<00:05:20.610> so<00:05:21.120> that's<00:05:21.449> how

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
and it's the other way so that's how

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.270 
and it's the other way so that's how
thin<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:21.960> customs<00:05:22.349> are<00:05:22.500> these<00:05:22.710> are<00:05:22.919> our

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
thin the customs are these are our

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.890 
thin the customs are these are our
little<00:05:23.669> beefier<00:05:23.819> towards<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.360> tip<00:05:24.509> I<00:05:24.660> think

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
little beefier towards the tip I think

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.770 
little beefier towards the tip I think
they<00:05:25.020> really<00:05:25.379> you<00:05:25.979> know<00:05:26.069> they<00:05:26.250> nailed<00:05:26.460> it

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
they really you know they nailed it

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.760 
they really you know they nailed it
probably<00:05:27.780> better<00:05:27.930> than<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.319> do<00:05:28.379> the<00:05:28.620> way<00:05:28.740> I

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
probably better than I do the way I

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.439 
probably better than I do the way I
grind<00:05:29.159> them<00:05:29.340> so<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:29.669> better<00:05:30.150> for<00:05:30.360> the

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
grind them so I better for the

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.180 
grind them so I better for the
production<00:05:30.659> market<00:05:31.139> exactly<00:05:31.740> better<00:05:31.949> for<00:05:32.129> the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
production market exactly better for the

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.379 
production market exactly better for the
production<00:05:32.400> line<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.879> I<00:05:32.940> still<00:05:33.150> make<00:05:33.270> the

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
production line and I still make the

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.180 
production line and I still make the
customers<00:05:33.810> kind<00:05:33.990> of<00:05:34.110> thinner<00:05:34.289> and<00:05:34.590> you<00:05:35.069> know<00:05:35.159> I

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
customers kind of thinner and you know I

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.100 
customers kind of thinner and you know I
can<00:05:35.490> tweet<00:05:35.940> that<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.270> the<00:05:36.360> customers<00:05:36.810> wants

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
can tweet that to the customers wants

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.050 
can tweet that to the customers wants
and<00:05:37.259> needs<00:05:37.349> but<00:05:37.800> for<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.340> production<00:05:38.550> market

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
and needs but for the production market

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.719 
and needs but for the production market
and<00:05:39.180> everyday<00:05:39.539> use<00:05:40.020> kind<00:05:40.440> of<00:05:40.590> Defense<00:05:41.099> item<00:05:41.460> I

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
and everyday use kind of Defense item I

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.189 
and everyday use kind of Defense item I
think<00:05:42.120> they<00:05:42.240> nailed<00:05:42.509> it<00:05:42.629> really<00:05:42.870> really<00:05:43.050> well

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
think they nailed it really really well

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.779 
think they nailed it really really well
so<00:05:43.680> do<00:05:43.770> you<00:05:43.830> have<00:05:43.919> anything<00:05:44.129> else<00:05:44.310> planned<00:05:44.460> for

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
so do you have anything else planned for

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.999 
so do you have anything else planned for
