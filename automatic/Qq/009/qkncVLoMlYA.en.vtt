this<00:00:00.950> program<00:00:01.340> is<00:00:01.490> brought<00:00:01.640> to<00:00:01.850> you<00:00:02.000> by<00:00:02.030> Emory

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.570 
this program is brought to you by Emory

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:16.890 
this program is brought to you by Emory
University

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.920 

so<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.020> concept<00:00:18.560> here<00:00:18.619> is<00:00:19.000> that<00:00:21.189> bone<00:00:22.189> marrow

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
so the concept here is that bone marrow

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.830 
so the concept here is that bone marrow
is<00:00:23.930> a<00:00:24.470> repository<00:00:25.099> for<00:00:25.580> stem<00:00:26.300> cells<00:00:26.599> and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
is a repository for stem cells and

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.710 
is a repository for stem cells and
progenitor<00:00:27.170> cells<00:00:27.619> these<00:00:28.400> are<00:00:28.700> early<00:00:29.300> cell

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
progenitor cells these are early cell

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.780 
progenitor cells these are early cell
types<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.200> are<00:00:30.470> able<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.980> proliferate<00:00:31.340> and

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
types that are able to proliferate and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.549 
types that are able to proliferate and
differentiate<00:00:32.180> into<00:00:33.070> more<00:00:34.270> advanced<00:00:35.559> tissues

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
differentiate into more advanced tissues

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.920 
differentiate into more advanced tissues
such<00:00:36.949> as<00:00:37.129> blood<00:00:37.309> vessels<00:00:37.989> organs<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:40.510> that<00:00:41.510> in

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
such as blood vessels organs and that in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.750 
such as blood vessels organs and that in
individuals<00:00:42.680> who<00:00:42.739> have<00:00:42.860> peripheral<00:00:43.400> arterial

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
individuals who have peripheral arterial

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.910 
individuals who have peripheral arterial
disease<00:00:43.850> one<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.809> deficits<00:00:45.379> is<00:00:45.559> that<00:00:45.769> they

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
disease one of the deficits is that they

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.680 
disease one of the deficits is that they
do<00:00:45.980> not<00:00:46.100> have<00:00:46.489> enough<00:00:46.730> blood<00:00:46.970> flow<00:00:47.269> and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
do not have enough blood flow and

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.729 
do not have enough blood flow and
therefore<00:00:48.549> blood<00:00:49.549> vessel<00:00:49.970> growth<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:51.530> can

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
therefore blood vessel growth that can

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.160 
therefore blood vessel growth that can
form<00:00:52.370> natural<00:00:52.879> bypasses<00:00:53.629> from<00:00:53.870> blood

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
form natural bypasses from blood

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.960 
form natural bypasses from blood
unblocked<00:00:54.890> arteries<00:00:55.339> towards<00:00:55.670> blocked

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
unblocked arteries towards blocked

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.570 
unblocked arteries towards blocked
arteries<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.170> concept<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:57.799> is<00:00:58.010> advanced

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
arteries is the concept that is advanced

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:08.610 
arteries is the concept that is advanced
with<00:00:58.790> this<00:00:59.080> kind<00:01:00.080> of<00:01:00.199> therapy

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the last 10 years or so

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
the last 10 years or so
have<00:01:11.760> been<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.030> number<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.680> investigations

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
have been a number of investigations

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550 
have been a number of investigations

more at an experimental level that have

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.670 
more at an experimental level that have

areas meaning areas where there is lack

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.640 
areas meaning areas where there is lack
of<00:01:31.200> blood<00:01:31.410> supply<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:33.020> see<00:01:34.020> whether<00:01:34.290> these

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of blood supply and see whether these

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.360 
of blood supply and see whether these
cells<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.400> able<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.200> promote<00:01:37.370> collateral

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
cells are able to promote collateral

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.550 
cells are able to promote collateral
formation<00:01:39.000> or<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.450> new<00:01:39.870> blood<00:01:40.170> vessel

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
formation or these new blood vessel

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.040 
formation or these new blood vessel
formation<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.610> would<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.000> increase<00:01:42.810> blood

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
formation that would then increase blood

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.850 
formation that would then increase blood
flow<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.350> these<00:01:43.680> areas<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:44.550> requiring

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
flow to these areas that are requiring

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.140 
flow to these areas that are requiring
increased<00:01:46.860> blood<00:01:47.070> flow<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.369> therefore

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
increased blood flow and therefore

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:58.280 
increased blood flow and therefore
relieve<00:01:48.960> symptoms

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.620 

so<00:01:59.290> there<00:01:59.500> are<00:01:59.530> various<00:02:00.520> ways<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:02.610> accessing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
so there are various ways of accessing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.530 
so there are various ways of accessing
stem<00:02:04.630> cells<00:02:04.930> or<00:02:05.200> progenitor<00:02:05.380> cells<00:02:05.950> and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
stem cells or progenitor cells and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.570 
stem cells or progenitor cells and
delivering<00:02:07.540> them<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.220> there<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.340> variety

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
delivering them and there is a variety

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.480 
delivering them and there is a variety
of<00:02:09.820> different<00:02:09.880> techniques<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:10.899> can<00:02:11.110> use<00:02:11.490> and

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
of different techniques one can use and

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.630 
of different techniques one can use and
and<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.660> approach<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.380> we<00:02:14.650> have<00:02:14.890> decided

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
and this approach that we have decided

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.480 
and this approach that we have decided
to<00:02:16.290> investigate<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.710> particular<00:02:18.040> trial

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
to investigate in this particular trial

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.090 
to investigate in this particular trial
uses<00:02:19.030> an<00:02:19.150> autologous<00:02:19.780> approach<00:02:20.170> meaning<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
uses an autologous approach meaning the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.670 
uses an autologous approach meaning the
cells<00:02:21.340> are<00:02:21.550> being<00:02:21.990> obtained<00:02:22.990> from<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.440> same

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
cells are being obtained from the same

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.250 
cells are being obtained from the same
individual<00:02:24.460> who's<00:02:25.030> being<00:02:25.300> treated<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.110> these

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
individual who's being treated so these

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.250 
individual who's being treated so these

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
are not imported cells off-the-shelf

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.280 
are not imported cells off-the-shelf
cells<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:30.040> embryonic<00:02:30.400> cells<00:02:31.000> these<00:02:31.690> are<00:02:31.750> your

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
cells or embryonic cells these are your

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.710 
cells or embryonic cells these are your

own<00:02:34.870> bone<00:02:35.110> marrow<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.600> concept<00:02:38.590> is

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
own bone marrow and then the concept is

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.760 
own bone marrow and then the concept is
that<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> ischemia<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.510> leg<00:02:40.720> meaning<00:02:41.410> the

that the ischemia in the leg meaning the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.010 
that the ischemia in the leg meaning the
areas<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.180> leg<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.660> are<00:02:44.100> devoid<00:02:45.100> or<00:02:46.020> have

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
areas of the leg that are devoid or have

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.640 
areas of the leg that are devoid or have
reduced<00:02:47.440> blood<00:02:47.800> supply<00:02:48.420> will<00:02:49.420> attract<00:02:50.380> these

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
reduced blood supply will attract these

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.040 
reduced blood supply will attract these
cells<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:52.090> we<00:02:52.510> know<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.900> these

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
cells and and we know that these

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.530 
cells and and we know that these
progenitor<00:02:53.440> cells<00:02:53.860> have<00:02:54.190> markers<00:02:54.880> on<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.180> on

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
progenitor cells have markers on this on

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.870 
progenitor cells have markers on this on
their<00:02:55.840> surface<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.770> allows<00:02:56.920> them<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.580> home

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
their surface that allows them to home

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.540 
their surface that allows them to home
to<00:02:58.209> areas<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.870> skin<00:02:58.990> iya<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.770> therefore

to areas of the skin iya and therefore

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.940 
to areas of the skin iya and therefore
the<00:03:00.670> one<00:03:01.570> who<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.140> idea<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.769> you

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
the one who the idea is that you

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.410 
the one who the idea is that you
mobilize<00:03:03.430> these<00:03:03.670> cells<00:03:03.940> from<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.239> bone

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
mobilize these cells from the bone

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.360 
mobilize these cells from the bone
marrow<00:03:04.450> they<00:03:05.200> are<00:03:05.290> able<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.620> circulate<00:03:06.220> in

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
marrow they are able to circulate in

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.670 
marrow they are able to circulate in
increasing<00:03:06.940> numbers<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.660> blood<00:03:08.410> stream

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
increasing numbers in the blood stream

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.890 
increasing numbers in the blood stream
and<00:03:08.950> then<00:03:09.580> they're<00:03:09.790> home<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.330> areas<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
and then they're home to areas of the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.930 
and then they're home to areas of the
schema<00:03:11.320> in<00:03:11.560> this<00:03:11.769> case<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.190> would<00:03:12.370> be<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.580> legs

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
schema in this case it would be the legs

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.080 
schema in this case it would be the legs
which<00:03:13.690> are<00:03:13.959> devoid<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.709> blood<00:03:14.890> flow<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.430> then

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
which are devoid of blood flow and then

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.180 
which are devoid of blood flow and then
they<00:03:16.269> are<00:03:16.390> able<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.810> form<00:03:17.260> new<00:03:17.470> blood<00:03:17.739> vessels

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
they are able to form new blood vessels

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.270 
they are able to form new blood vessels
because<00:03:18.550> they<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:18.970> capacity<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.900> grow

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
because they have this capacity to grow

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.220 
because they have this capacity to grow
proliferate<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.519> even<00:03:22.300> stimulate<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.050> local

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230
