00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
currently if the decorator the game

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.340 
currently if the decorator the game
would<00:03:14.580> end<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.510> get<00:03:15.660> zero<00:03:15.900> points<00:03:16.200> that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
would end now you get zero points that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.560 
would end now you get zero points that
okay<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.580> would<00:03:17.760> keep<00:03:17.880> growing<00:03:18.210> out<00:03:18.360> this

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
okay so this would keep growing out this

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.780 
okay so this would keep growing out this
way<00:03:18.750> this<00:03:19.380> way<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.800> even<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:20.160> way<00:03:20.310> only

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
way this way and even this way only

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.220 
way this way and even this way only
place<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.180> can't<00:03:21.420> play<00:03:21.570> cards<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:21.960> on<00:03:22.110> the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
place you can't play cards is on the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.080 
place you can't play cards is on the
green<00:03:22.500> side<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.160> railings<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.640> stairs<00:03:23.880> right

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
green side of a railings of stairs right

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.580 
green side of a railings of stairs right
so<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.540> keep<00:03:24.660> building<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.020> deck<00:03:25.230> out<00:03:25.410> like

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
so I can keep building the deck out like

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.700 
so I can keep building the deck out like
this<00:03:25.710> okay<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.320> third<00:03:28.320> action<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710
