 get the extensions from the others 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.390
 maps created by other people 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.570
 Well this option gives workshop to 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.810
 for tools tools alfa weighs 5 gigas with 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.670
 500 megabytes which, as I told you, is going to 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.890
 give you the ease of creating games 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.200

 that extension 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.020
 they will not be able to play it in a 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.840
 mandatory will ask them to download 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.300
 this extension 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.009
 it actually takes a long time in case 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.300
 you have a low internet like that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.930
 I have 4 megabytes 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.240
 but you have 8 megabytes 10 megabytes will take 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.880
 a lot in the case of what makes cabins 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.280
 from Internet 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.190
 but this is to take your time like this 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.020
 download it 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.590
 they have to talk to the owner so that 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.200
 can you download that extension that 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.410
 It depends on each one 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.239
 well then this is the end that I do not 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.870
 I have downloaded iodine I need to download 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.269
 download it before launching the maps 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.610
 even because I find it interesting 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.349
 find download the stations for 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.980

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:55.280
 benefits I'm going to see good them 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.430

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.860

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.060
 you create maps I know you want it if 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.739
 is that they have a design option 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.440
 when you download them they go to 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.270
 ask them to enter a name or a 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.510
 user 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.520
 so you can create is to say 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.430

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.330
 good 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.319
 I was saying this serves to create 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:01.310
 gaming maps of dota 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.360
 let's find the stores the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.470
 structures 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.980
 the color of water the color of earth 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.370
 and likewise the colors of the vegetation 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.840
 they will not find all kinds of 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.810
 tools so that you can 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.090
 create your own maps I have even tried 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.540
 create some later perhaps to each 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:29.860
 one to try and publish it 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.849
 good these options we have 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.849
 to create them 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.550
 has many options, not me, still 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.250
 I do not know where he has completely exterminated 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.440
 because I actually downloaded it 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.580
 option is to be able to play by taking 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.660
 invoke guards who performed the 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.530
 news that time 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.510

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.510
 at 5 gb 500 megs 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.880
