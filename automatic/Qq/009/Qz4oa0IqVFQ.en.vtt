hypothetical<00:03:29.510> what<00:03:30.470> if<00:03:30.620> you're<00:03:31.130> playing

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
hypothetical what if you're playing

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.160 
hypothetical what if you're playing
basketball<00:03:31.940> it's<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.330> good<00:03:32.570> game<00:03:32.840> and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
basketball it's like a good game and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.020 
basketball it's like a good game and
then<00:03:34.130> something<00:03:35.000> happens<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:36.590> floor<00:03:36.830> is

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
then something happens and the floor is

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.449 
then something happens and the floor is
covered<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.150> lava<00:03:38.890> what<00:03:39.890> could<00:03:40.010> possibly

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
covered in lava what could possibly

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.039 
covered in lava what could possibly
happen<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:41.150> make<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.420> floor<00:03:41.570> covered<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:41.959> lava

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
happen to make the floor covered in lava

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.970 
happen to make the floor covered in lava
like<00:03:44.200> possibility<00:03:45.200> would<00:03:45.500> be<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.830> earth

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
like possibility would be the earth

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.030 
like possibility would be the earth
opens<00:03:46.400> up<00:03:46.549> and<00:03:46.730> lava<00:03:47.120> comes<00:03:47.330> up<00:03:47.540> probably<00:03:48.350> it

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
opens up and lava comes up probably it

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.350 
opens up and lava comes up probably it
would<00:03:49.160> start<00:03:49.430> in<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.580> middle<00:03:49.670> court<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:50.209> do

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
would start in the middle court so do

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.610 
would start in the middle court so do
like<00:03:50.480> an<00:03:50.570> equal<00:03:50.780> amount<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:51.019> lava<00:03:51.200> on<00:03:51.470> either

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
like an equal amount of lava on either

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.789 
like an equal amount of lava on either
side<00:03:52.480> what<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.720> point<00:03:54.080> my<00:03:54.290> guess<00:03:54.530> would<00:03:54.739> be

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
side what that point my guess would be

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.030 
side what that point my guess would be
that<00:03:54.950> dislike<00:03:55.760> protocol<00:03:56.620> like<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.650> law<00:03:57.860> office

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
that dislike protocol like a law office

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.530 
that dislike protocol like a law office
situation<00:03:58.430> I<00:03:58.730> mean<00:03:58.880> I<00:03:58.910> haven't<00:03:59.120> read<00:03:59.330> anything

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
situation I mean I haven't read anything

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.140 
situation I mean I haven't read anything
but<00:04:00.320> I<00:04:00.350> would<00:04:00.500> assume<00:04:00.769> that<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.940> know<00:04:02.000> the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
but I would assume that you know the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.840 
but I would assume that you know the
focus<00:04:02.480> kind<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.720> shifts<00:04:02.989> away<00:04:03.080> from<00:04:03.850> offense

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
focus kind of shifts away from offense

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.120 
focus kind of shifts away from offense
defense<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.660> more<00:04:06.380> towards<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.799> human

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
defense and more towards like a human

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.330 
defense and more towards like a human
survival<00:04:07.730> standpoint<00:04:08.350> what<00:04:09.350> if<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:09.650> okay

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
survival standpoint what if like okay
