play<00:00:36.269> and<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.289> we<00:00:37.379> worked<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.679> into<00:00:37.769> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
play and I think we worked it into the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.259 
play and I think we worked it into the
script<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:38.699> have<00:00:38.910> one<00:00:39.089> of<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
script so you actually have one of the

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.569 
script so you actually have one of the
character<00:00:39.629> saying<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.170> line<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> yep<00:00:41.100> in

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
character saying that line and yep in

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.240 
character saying that line and yep in
the<00:00:41.699> movie<00:00:42.170> there's<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> Exeter<00:00:43.679> badge<00:00:43.859> on

captain's chair and Holly we were

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
running out of time and we figured we

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.850 
running out of time and we figured we
needed<00:02:12.459> some<00:02:12.670> shots<00:02:12.880> on<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.180> bridge<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.140> since

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
needed some shots on the bridge so since

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.380 
needed some shots on the bridge so since
we<00:02:14.980> didn't<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.340> enough<00:02:15.580> time<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.760> build<00:02:16.030> a

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
we didn't have enough time to build a

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.790 
we didn't have enough time to build a
whole<00:02:16.660> section<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.140> bridge<00:02:17.349> we<00:02:17.590> did<00:02:17.709> it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
whole section of the bridge we did it

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.449 
whole section of the bridge we did it
with<00:02:17.890> green<00:02:18.160> screen<00:02:19.890> which<00:02:20.890> was<00:02:21.069> better<00:02:21.250> than

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
with green screen which was better than

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.479 
with green screen which was better than
not<00:02:21.670> including<00:02:22.450> these<00:02:22.569> shots<00:02:22.870> at<00:02:23.080> all<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:24.250> it

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
not including these shots at all and it

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.100 
not including these shots at all and it
actually<00:02:24.790> turned<00:02:25.180> out<00:02:25.300> looking<00:02:25.569> pretty<00:02:25.959> good

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
actually turned out looking pretty good

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.690 
actually turned out looking pretty good
well<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.560> was<00:02:26.739> good<00:02:26.890> for<00:02:27.190> one<00:02:27.340> thing<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.640> we

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
well it was good for one thing that we

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.130 
well it was good for one thing that we
actually<00:02:27.849> could<00:02:28.120> show<00:02:28.420> commander<00:02:28.870> Harris

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
actually could show commander Harris

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.660

that might be

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.870 
that might be
yeah<00:04:09.740> but<00:04:10.740> that<00:04:10.890> was<00:04:11.040> part<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.340> charm<00:04:11.580> of

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
yeah but that was part of the charm of

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.520 
yeah but that was part of the charm of
the<00:04:12.000> original<00:04:12.450> series<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.900> kind<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.410> got

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
the original series that kind of got

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.190 
the original series that kind of got
well<00:04:14.490> see<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.330> next<00:04:15.390> generation<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.170> think

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
well see in the next generation I think

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.460 
well see in the next generation I think
they<00:04:16.620> they<00:04:17.100> had<00:04:17.310> data<00:04:17.730> was<00:04:17.940> an<00:04:18.060> Android<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.900> so

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
they they had data was an Android and so

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.000 
they they had data was an Android and so
they<00:04:19.620> could<00:04:19.830> poke<00:04:20.010> fun<00:04:20.220> at<00:04:20.280> him<00:04:20.720> because<00:04:22.010> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
they could poke fun at him because the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.710 
they could poke fun at him because the
analogy<00:04:23.850> wasn't<00:04:24.150> quite<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.480> same<00:04:24.510> as

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
analogy wasn't quite the same as

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.360 
analogy wasn't quite the same as
different<00:04:25.620> racial<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.100> weren't<00:04:26.250> being

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
different racial you weren't being

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.520 
different racial you weren't being
racist<00:04:26.880> if<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.150> report<00:04:27.420> poking<00:04:28.110> fun<00:04:28.260> at<00:04:28.320> an

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
racist if you report poking fun at an

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.480 
racist if you report poking fun at an
Android<00:04:28.950> yeah<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.250> suppose<00:04:31.220> anyway<00:04:32.220> enough

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
Android yeah I suppose anyway enough

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.200 
Android yeah I suppose anyway enough
about<00:04:32.610> that<00:04:33.800> here's<00:04:34.800> a<00:04:34.890> cool<00:04:35.430> control<00:04:35.850> panel

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
about that here's a cool control panel

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.840
