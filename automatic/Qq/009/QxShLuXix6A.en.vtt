00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:10.309
 knitting a square from a corner first we 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.309
 make the first loop 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.030
 so do the loop 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:29.160
 it's not very good and now I will do 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:34.590
 center loop and then I tie it 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.829
 3 columns without nakida so I made a loop 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:48.649
 and in it I need to knit 3 columns 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:48.649
 without nakida 1 2 3 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.770
 I'm making an air loop now 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.770
 I turn around and I have only 3 here 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.140
 loops i am knitting my first loop 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.090
 nakida column then there will be 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.340
 Only single crochet so I like 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.320
 would the gun no longer be central 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.240
 we will add a loop 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.090
 angle direction respectively 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.210
 Here in this collected loop I will do 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.140
 adding you here I knit 2 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:32.000
 eyelets 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 1 and 2 and one loop is left here 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.140
 I knit 1 1 column in this way 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.810
 it turns out that's because this design 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.200
 then do the loop again 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 unfold and now I will add 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.470
 here in this direction 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.930
 how would I have two sides of a square 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.880
 which I impose it turns out 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.700
 one loop on one side one by one 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.200
 loop on the other 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:11.750
 so I knit the first two loops without 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:16.280
 changes 1 and 2 now i need here 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.850
 add a loop here 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.200
 three 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.250
 and then here on the other side to me 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.910
 also two loops 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:31.580
 accordingly here I knit 2 loops 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:33.799
 1 loop 2 columns so it remains one 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:40.010
 loop that is, respectively one 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:42.470
 column so i already have on 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.640
 each side of 3 loops that is 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:50.470
 it was 2 now three each so now i 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.250
 do air loop unfold 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:59.240
 I knit 1 2 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.080
 and here in the third loop I add one 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.220
 loop that is, I knit 2 columns 1 and 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.530
 2 that is, place 3 is already four 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.090
 accordingly and here on this side 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:17.600
 But in this loop I knit 2 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:22.970
 column once and dovyazyvaya remaining 2 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:27.380
 loop 1 2 thousand addition again 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:31.040
 I repeat we are at the corner like this 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.350
 here's a way that is, on looking side 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.130
 I add squares on each row of 1 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.010
 loop and 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.940
 on the top side of the squares I add 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.739
 on each row 1 loop 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:49.850
 so now I turn around again and 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:52.160
 I knit it so I have here 1 2 3 4 already 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.360
 drinking loops matching provyazyvayu 3 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.360
 without changes 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:09.320
 23 so and in the fourth I knit 2 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:11.810
 column two times so now i'm 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:18.830
 I turn around in this loop 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:20.419
 I knit 5 2 columns 1 2 is 4 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:28.900
 April only on this side and 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:31.600
 three remaining unchanged 1 2 3 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.880
 so it starts at me 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.100
 form a square in this place he 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.729
 will be a little bit rounded because 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.480
 in this direction I see but tie 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.090
 the square is exactly in this 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.970
 the form can be that is, the more you have 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.810
 will be rows the brighter will be expressed 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:56.200
 square shape so that every time 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.370
 count loops and see how the place 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.790
 adding ie we add loops 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.490
 at an angle here in this direction on every 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.860
 row we add 1 st here at 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.920
 each of these two sides then there are two 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.810
 loops turn out I add 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.900
 accordingly, you need to find the place where 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.510
 need to make an addition but you can, as it were 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.730
 linty usually here on the corner here i have 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:35.440
 five loops here I will tie them now 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:38.880
 times two three 4 5 and if you look 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.070
 carefully this is just the previous two 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.450
 the loops in which I have already done 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.430
 adding that is my first 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.850
 tying two columns and here 2 1 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.090
 I like to skip the second column 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:59.860
 I do adding that is, I knit 2 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:05.820
 column then 3 add 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:09.630
 I knit 2 columns and in 4 I knit 1 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.880
 so and so and so on until the end 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:18.190
 given row to the next 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:20.280
 in the next row here is my pair like 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.910
 data will be doubled bars and 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.220
 accordingly, these are the last ones Iâ€™ll skip 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:30.670
 columns but in these two I will tie 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.880
 2 columns in the central than more 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:37.480
 rows you tie the poorer so let's say 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.990
 there will be this part and it will already be possible 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:44.080
 will add intuitively loops 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.270
 if it is so inconvenient to look where 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.080
 add one loop each 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.620
 parties 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.150
 then count on 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.760
 each row you will have added something 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.150
 there so here i am bound 55 must knit 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.370
 here on the next row will be six seven 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:02.479
 eight and so on depending on 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:05.840
 the size of the square in the end you have 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:09.050
 it turns out such a square 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.990
 bound from the corner don't know where you can 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.669
 apply this knitting 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.949
 as if nothing comes to mind but then 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:20.979
 that such a way of knitting a square is 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:20.979
 Now I showed you by example
