it's a Rin con or samyang that goes

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.450 
it's a Rin con or samyang that goes
around<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.719> kind<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.019> global<00:00:13.410> lens<00:00:13.650> comes

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
around it's kind of a global lens comes

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.990 
around it's kind of a global lens comes
in<00:00:14.610> all<00:00:14.849> mounts<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.780> an<00:00:15.900> 85<00:00:16.550> 1.4<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:17.880> it's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
in all mounts this is an 85 1.4 but it's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.540 
in all mounts this is an 85 1.4 but it's
completely<00:00:18.930> manual<00:00:19.470> which<00:00:19.980> means<00:00:20.220> manual

focus manual aperture control everything
and<00:00:22.730> because<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.180> really<00:00:24.449> cheap

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and because of that it's really cheap

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
pretty remarkable this is the focal

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.870 
pretty remarkable this is the focal
length<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.469> really<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:34.950> using<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.430> usually<00:00:35.760> use

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
length I really like using I usually use

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.049 
length I really like using I usually use
my<00:00:35.910> 70<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.450> 200<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.110> eight<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.790> with<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
my 70 to 200 to eight and with that you

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.209 
my 70 to 200 to eight and with that you
have<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.239> stop<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.629> down<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.290> three<00:00:40.829> two<00:00:41.010> or

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
have to stop it down to three two or

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.180 
have to stop it down to three two or
three<00:00:41.250> five<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.750> sharp<00:00:42.930> images<00:00:43.379> so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
three five to get really sharp images so

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.250 
three five to get really sharp images so
this<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> same<00:00:45.420> focal

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this this is kind of the same focal

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.139 
this this is kind of the same focal
range<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
range that I like but you can go all the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.250 
range that I like but you can go all the
way<00:00:48.210> down<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.629> point<00:00:48.780> four<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.230> want

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
way down to one point four if you want

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.939 
way down to one point four if you want
and<00:00:49.649> allegedly<00:00:50.430> optically<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.239> lens<00:00:51.510> is

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
and allegedly optically this lens is

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.029 
and allegedly optically this lens is
remarkable<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.879> let<00:00:54.629> me<00:00:54.750> open<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.079> box<00:00:55.350> see

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
remarkable so let me open this box see

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.790 
remarkable so let me open this box see
what<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:57.559> have<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.980> paperwork<00:01:00.800> come

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
what we have have some paperwork come

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.899 
what we have have some paperwork come
with<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> little<00:01:02.390> pouch<00:01:07.369> comes<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> lens

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
with a little pouch comes with a lens

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.570 
with a little pouch comes with a lens
hood<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.490> lens<00:01:11.700> itself<00:01:13.159> it's<00:01:14.159> fairly

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
hood and the lens itself it's fairly

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
hood and the lens itself it's fairly
good-sized<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.049> probably<00:01:16.560> twice<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
good-sized so it's probably twice the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.340 
good-sized so it's probably twice the
size<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.840> least<00:01:19.200> twice<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> weight<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.610> my

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
size and at least twice the weight of my

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
size and at least twice the weight of my
51<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.790> which<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.330> another<00:01:24.540> review

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
51 for which I will do another review

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.200 
51 for which I will do another review
later<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> compare<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> two

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
later on and compare the two

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.069 
later on and compare the two
lens<00:01:28.080> cap<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:29.040> mean<00:01:29.220> screw<00:01:30.060> ones<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.780> squeeze

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
lens cap I mean screw ones you squeeze

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.789 
lens cap I mean screw ones you squeeze
at<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.229> side<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.710> works<00:01:31.920> okay<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:34.020> cap

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
at the side it works okay the back cap

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.310 
at the side it works okay the back cap
is<00:01:35.159> pretty<00:01:36.060> cheap<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.900> works<00:01:38.750> well<00:01:39.750> focus

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
is pretty cheap but it works well focus

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.280 
is pretty cheap but it works well focus
ring<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.560> really<00:01:41.070> nice<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.729> heavy<00:01:41.970> weighted

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
ring is really nice it's heavy weighted

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.069 
ring is really nice it's heavy weighted
feels<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.740> good<00:01:44.960> aperture<00:01:45.960> ring<00:01:47.509> wow<00:01:48.509> this

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
feels really good aperture ring wow this

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.609 
feels really good aperture ring wow this
has<00:01:49.259> got<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> huge<00:01:50.130> aperture<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:52.229> step

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
has got a huge aperture the step

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
has got a huge aperture the step
increments<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.340> 1.4<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> then<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> next<00:01:55.049> one

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
increments are 1.4 and then the next one

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.499 
increments are 1.4 and then the next one
is<00:01:55.259> 2<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.009> 2<00:01:56.189> point<00:01:56.430> 8<00:01:56.490> 4<00:01:56.729> 5<00:01:57.030> 6<00:01:57.390> 8<00:01:57.719> 11<00:01:58.259> 16<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.040> 22

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
is 2 then 2 point 8 4 5 6 8 11 16 and 22

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.050 
is 2 then 2 point 8 4 5 6 8 11 16 and 22
so<00:02:00.509> between<00:02:00.840> 1.4<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.009> 2<00:02:02.430> there's<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so between 1.4 and 2 there's kind of a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270 
so between 1.4 and 2 there's kind of a
big<00:02:03.240> gap<00:02:03.479> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.110> wish<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> 1.8

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
big gap kind of wish there was a 1.8

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.420 
big gap kind of wish there was a 1.8
there<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:07.459> will<00:02:08.459> be<00:02:08.580> ok

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
there but that will be ok

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.380 
there but that will be ok
minimum<00:02:11.430> focus<00:02:11.879> distance<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.569> 1

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
minimum focus distance is 1

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.280 
minimum focus distance is 1
meter<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:15.360> fairly<00:02:16.360> far<00:02:16.660> away<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.370> let's<00:02:19.290> attach

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
meter so fairly far away so let's attach

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
meter so fairly far away so let's attach
this<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.620> my<00:02:20.950> camera<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.580> see<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.070> does

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
this to my camera and see what it does
