so I'm just going to place out right
below<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> brows<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.810> then<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.520> to

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
below the brows and then I'm going to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.929 
below the brows and then I'm going to
take<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.140> little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:15.770> like<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> cold

and<00:01:24.350> that's<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.469> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.859> act<00:01:26.039> as<00:01:26.600> again

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and that's just going to act as again

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.870 
and that's just going to act as again
the<00:01:27.840> mid-tone<00:01:28.289> transitioning<00:01:29.130> color<00:01:29.369> we're

the mid-tone transitioning color we're
going<00:01:29.999> to<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.149> using<00:01:31.310> think<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.490> five<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.179> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
going to be using think like five of the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.209 
going to be using think like five of the
eight<00:01:33.539> colors<00:01:34.229> from<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.649> petal<00:01:34.920> pusher

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
eight colors from the petal pusher

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.969 
eight colors from the petal pusher
palette<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:36.479> i<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.899> it<00:01:36.959> open<00:01:37.140> i'm<00:01:37.740> going

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
palette if i can get it open i'm going

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.440 
palette if i can get it open i'm going
to<00:01:38.069> dip<00:01:38.250> into<00:01:38.459> this<00:01:40.130> black<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.819> silver

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to dip into this black with silver

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.690 
to dip into this black with silver
flecks<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:44.099> we're<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.490> pop

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
flecks in it because we're going to pop

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.449 
flecks in it because we're going to pop
that<00:01:44.849> into<00:01:45.209> the<00:01:45.810> outer<00:01:45.959> corner<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.219> little

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
that into the outer corner and a little

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.990 
that into the outer corner and a little
into<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.819> crease<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.810> I'm<00:01:48.929> using<00:01:49.140> my<00:01:49.289> Sigma

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
into the crease so I'm using my Sigma

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.539 
into the crease so I'm using my Sigma
e25<00:01:51.000> blending<00:01:51.780> brush<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:55.310> popping<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
e25 blending brush and popping that

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:08.990 
e25 blending brush and popping that
right<00:01:56.789> into<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> corner

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.590 

so<00:02:09.539> once<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:12.330> going

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
so once we have that on I'm just going

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.910 
so once we have that on I'm just going
to<00:02:12.720> kind<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.680> blend<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.770> don't

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
to kind of blend that out so we don't

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.450 
to kind of blend that out so we don't
have<00:02:17.070> any<00:02:17.190> harsh<00:02:17.430> lines<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.800> then<00:02:23.190> I'm<00:02:23.310> going

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
have any harsh lines and then I'm going

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.730 
have any harsh lines and then I'm going
to<00:02:23.490> take<00:02:23.550> my<00:02:23.820> NYX<00:02:24.090> jumbo<00:02:24.300> pencil<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:25.290> purple
