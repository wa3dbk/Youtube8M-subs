00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.369
 No special recipe or that's how it works 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.050
 fast and therefore find but 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.520
 actually pretty cool because it's easy 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.410
 can always eat in between times 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.880
 I've got it and I just wanted to 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.340
 share with you because it really is 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.010
 find delicious and yes I'm starting to catch 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.070
 to show me what comes in and that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.470
 like these are balsamic water cools 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.239
 racing made that totally easy because 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.940
 there just comes this balsamic 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.780
 Creamfines are a bit of water 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.130
 after wanting to have liquid now and 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.290
 I have a bit of power 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.730
 Personally made blender you can 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.450
 also mix with a fork as well 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.070
 always and yes that makes for altona 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.120
 then I have about five here 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.860
 cherry tomatoes two thick radishes and 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.180
 self- bred sprouts 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.590
 and then came half a bridge 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.319
 Rhine is half the Ocado here 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.830
 Now a thick handful of spinach 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:20.179
 a bit basilic a bit 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.759
 key task so even the on 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.720
 open garden stand yes and have that 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.369
 I already cut before with it 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.090
 I can do it faster now 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.810
 fast on the avocado the cucumber and 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.810
 then maybe I say something 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.319
 so now all they have together 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.850
 made quick who thinks you can 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.739
 probably already mix the things 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.580
 that she did not step for real 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.500
 explain step 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.880
 I have to correct something very briefly 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.489

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.110

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.610
 garden grow as the grow naturally 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.580
 with us on the balcony 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.519
 therefore yes but could you you 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.640

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.940

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.739

 a farm and if it is bad 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.799
 even the better when you know that 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.060
 Maybe you can not taste it 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.829
 which you also like to write 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.840

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.970
