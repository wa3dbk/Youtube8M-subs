00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello I'm luca in this video we were talking 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.420
 by tom's dams is an English acronym that 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.679
 is for god laid a set but only sommers 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.210
 ie soreness or muscle pain 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.799
 localized and delayed you are wood 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.389
 effectively you will surely be 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.520
 happened to have muscle pains 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.470
 in the following days to work out and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.330
 typically for the legs 48 hours later 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.189
 these are muscle pain 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.260
 they are called domus and they are 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.990
 absolutely normal and completely e 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.060
 intuitively you can use them as we say 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.090
 spy as a value to understand if a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.500
 workout you did was effective and 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 this gives them simply due 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.890
 of the micro lacerations that occur a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.930
 muscle level and then then 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 they represent a response of the body 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 to the stress of stress training 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 then we will obviously say compensated 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.210
 with a type of adaptation of course 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.620
 functional as he trained with in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.660
 terms of petro fia rather than of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 strength of resistance and so on 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.930
 It is therefore important to understand to debunk 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 a myth that since these pain does not 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.680
 they are due to lactic acid as much 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.539
 it is often thought that instead it comes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 converted and eliminated shortly afterwards 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.930
 the training but they are for the note 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.369
 due to these micro lacerations the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.510
 body will then go to repair them so it is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.909
 very important to rest properly 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.439
 both at night when the gh 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 the growth hormone in fact 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.460
 promote cell regeneration yes 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.070
 open a training session 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.689
 very important therefore absolutely 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.100
 do not train the muscle that is still doing 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.390
 bad then that still these d'hommes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.979
 for otherwise you would risk for 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 the note to frustrate the effort made 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.100
 that you maybe have it effectively 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 to the hypothesis guata ment though if a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.630
 day needs day after or two days 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 after it's still bad it's very important 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.780
 otherwise the body will not rest 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.409
 I can recover so the effort will be 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.119
 was in vain 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.259
 here in doubt it is always better one day 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.970
 more rest than an in 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.500
 less though of course maybe the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.329
 motivation to overdo it and then 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.470
 go to other new but truly the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.970
 body needs its time 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.920
 so he feels like he's still sick 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.530
 a few more dons and then having a mind a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.670
 do some cardio and or train a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.780
 another muscular robot that just already 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.130
 recovered 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.170
 wanting then obviously do some 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.340
 stretching for and say but of course 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.920
 improve 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.299
 flexibility and therefore precisely 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.740
 however, favor this recovery 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.359
 in general at the time when a 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.490
 a balanced diet for rest 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.140
 worthy the body will typically go 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.910
 recovery will obviously recover 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.480
 faster because the more muscle the more 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.129
 small like shoulders and arms 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.560
 possibly even calves evening 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.660
 calves may have longer times 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.549
 but actually they recover enough 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.470
 quickly because they are used to doing 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.340
 let's say to the very long efforts 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.540
 duration 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.010
 while it will obviously be this time of 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.140
 longer recovery for muscle groups 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.030
 like chest and back quadriceps 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.799
 as I mentioned before for the legs then 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.049
 quadriceps in particular is also 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.310
 hamstring friends can happen that 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.200
 a recovery can also make 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.700
 four five days especially you 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.230
 you will notice that very often 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.849
 these muscle pains do not come 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.500
 day after training so maybe 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.030
 I'm not the two Monday's legs there 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.280
 muscles are not necessarily will be 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.660
 present on Tuesday and then maybe me 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.769
 will want to think about the day itself 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.170
 my training was not effective 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.030
 but will be present on Wednesdays and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.500
 so let's say as a spy 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.480
 this will indicate me precisely 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.370
 that the workout was effective and has 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.140
 having had its effects I repeat a lot 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.640
 important at rest otherwise then body 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.350
 cannot recover night-time poses e 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.700
 fran session and the other in doubt 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.470
 rest an extra day allows the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.540
 body to recover because absolutely 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.130
 yes you even had to do one 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.690
 total rest week 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.730
 the body loses nothing it does not lose 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.560
 muscle mass always if you rest eat 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.970
 adequately but rather recover to 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.459
 better when you leave again you will be back 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.510
 more effective for your results then 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.400
 I hope I have provided you with some 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.200
 useful information about how 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.850
 always up and revolutionize your form 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.110
 physical then contact me I will give you 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.660
 as part of a personal service 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.370
 online trainer also shaking mine 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.670
 facebook page and to my site 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.670
 Hello
