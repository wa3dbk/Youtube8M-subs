00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:12.260
 and the city was like you spicy 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.230
 drank and waited for news 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.890
 good evening friends i'm not by chance with 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.369
 the songs then started because 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.060
 something that reminds me of our channel 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.390
 youtube 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.109
 Bill saw spicy cocktail waiting 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.829
 of news 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.840
 well, or there what he drank, then who drinks and 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.500
 us young man 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:43.239
 told me how he got on December 31 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:47.770
 refugee status and political asylum 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:51.160
 sorry the united states and got 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.129
 he has 300 emails after our stories there 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.600
 two stories were 300 email 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.129
 he answered 300 emails and there with 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.910
 some questions i don't know there u 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.640
 each his own but then what happened here 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.509
 I'm just telling you so that you 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.360
 understood how drunk and spicy 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.300
 cocktails drink that there is some kind of life 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.030
 still happening besides here 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.500
 let's say it was interesting because 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.200
 what is man every man who 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 coming out on 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.409
 public arena he says something 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 there is a lot of interest in it 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:39.149
 there to his family can be friends there and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.130
 so beyond what I wanted 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.189
 tell outside of what 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.670
 actually talk and there are some 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.740
 questions that would not want to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.760
 there were some kind of relationship that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.250
 show 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.260
 and someone spoils someone loads something 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.540
 and so on that is when you are with something 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.080
 get out then 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.300
 you places may be different 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.920
 what do you think of myself often 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.130
 there are that person so he came out a little 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.160
 told him it seemed there that he was about 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.350
 one thing and then figure out with the tank to this 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.060
 there is still such a cart he just hitched 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.710
 thinking the whole night like this take 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:28.830
 says i had a boy 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:31.950
 told me what his name is Misha 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.709
 Armenian he talked about how he 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.209
 ended up in an immigration prison 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:43.420
 came but he was framed you even know 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.230
 who if you think for a second helped 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.660
 he came in general and I framed 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.000
 it turned out he immigration prison 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.610
 so oh further there already in this 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.790
 immigration prison he from there 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.590
 managed to get refugee status that's not 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.710
 political asylum refugee status he 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.490
 as if officially entered the country as 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.100
 would be abroad although in the us and 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:14.690
 he also talked about this year 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.180
 please remove my videos about me 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.840
 still in the playlist was about 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.250
 political asylum and like that I go there 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.640
 then put and then had to 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.640
 to choose 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.720
 what topic is interesting is not only 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.019
 linked to political asylum is 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.620
 connected with the fact that being on a big 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.890
 the screen 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.049
 even on such a relatively small 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.049
 as our man 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.410
 substituted here is such a spotlight 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.690
 to public attention 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.520
 that's why I'm not really telling 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.980
 to the fact that the paste scare what they say is not 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.400
 never give any interviews and how 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:02.860
 just the opposite I am in this case I say 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.600
 about what you need to understand that people 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.830
 are in this state 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.910
 Here it is necessary to the specifics of a particular 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.890
 able to understand here you drink spicy 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.880
 cocktails but when come on 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.190
 curly this light think and he 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.660
 you will sing like that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.580
 directly ignite that is from somehow 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.350
 more careful here i am i say in this 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.930
 need to understand that you're going 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.000
 which we said that a blogger is there 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.800
 some kind of messi private space 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.710
 from which he wants to save and not 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.810
 so that everyone there has access to the same 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.150
 most any person who speaks he 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.970
 he says something and something doesn't 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.990
 I want something he does not like 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.600
 annoying attention is not pleasant 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:55.690
 claims who do not like and so on 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:58.210
 therefore, there are always claims and what 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.820
 the more the audience the more different 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.920
 claims and the most unexpected here 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.000
 you may be too old or 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.850
 too young 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.580
 too cute or p too 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.560
 ugly well-groomed or vice versa 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.060
 running it all the same person 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:21.450
 depending on who appreciates you and you can 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:26.220
 to be truthful or deceitful you can be 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:27.390
 patriotic colleagues traitor is like 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.220
 would not matter maybe 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:34.230
 intelligent or felt and there alone 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.400
 the stones are so flexible there but your name is 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.040
 so 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.470
 it's just sort of 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.770
 inevitability to find public 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.770
 being 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.289
 so here I just sort of 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.590
 appeal to those who watch the video 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.750
 what 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.040
 careful will give the title of the warehouse of this 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.700
 teacher not given 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.770
 the teacher is not and here is more careful how 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.590
 we can cover case 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.040
 the same key should be treated more carefully 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.120
 those who go to 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.120
 tribune, I basically 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.610
 when absolutely people start there at someone 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.990
 spread rot to the screens 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.880
 all these people are under my protection 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.190
 and when someone starts there 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.400
 let's paint very much by combining the fact that 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.610
 I have to send the bank some 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.520
 especially violent 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.520
 datko that not so often it happens year 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.020
 happiness 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.740
 summertime is something pretty pretty 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.699
 seldom 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.699
 wire so 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:45.020
 cherish cherish those who tell 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.910
 what if we kill the kill 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.120
 He says then nothing at all 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.830
 will remain in addition to the first channel and others like 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.780
 by him 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.980
 but we still have some kind of alternative 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.980
 such a building 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.880
 so as not to work 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.710
 okudzhava in the song like guns charged 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.590
 there is no one left except that city 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.290
 to shoot anyone in it 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:21.020
 we will never have this 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:24.530
 There is someone to shoot the thief on 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.530
 happy guys
