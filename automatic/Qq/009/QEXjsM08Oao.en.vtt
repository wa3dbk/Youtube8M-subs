00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.309 

now<00:02:19.090> listen<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.750> come<00:02:19.959> out<00:02:20.079> here<00:02:20.230> you're

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
now listen if you come out here you're

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.360 
now listen if you come out here you're
going<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.530> notice<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.829> there's<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.159> pipeline

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
going to notice that there's a pipeline

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.729 
going to notice that there's a pipeline
right<00:02:22.329> next<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.599> this<00:02:22.689> bridge<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.409> fish<00:02:23.590> are

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
right next to this bridge the fish are

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.130 
right next to this bridge the fish are
holding<00:02:24.040> right<00:02:24.250> up<00:02:24.400> against<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.819> pipeline

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
holding right up against that pipeline

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.059 
holding right up against that pipeline
my<00:02:26.140> guess<00:02:26.349> is<00:02:26.500> they're<00:02:26.620> probably<00:02:26.769> holding

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
my guess is they're probably holding

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.949 
my guess is they're probably holding
under<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.400> bridge<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.819> running<00:02:28.720> out<00:02:28.810> and

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
under that bridge and running out and

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.330 
under that bridge and running out and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
hitting some bait when it when it passes

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:38.069 
hitting some bait when it when it passes
through<00:02:36.299> nothing<00:02:37.299> wrong<00:02:37.569> with<00:02:37.720> trout<00:02:37.930> that

you<00:02:50.049> can<00:02:50.739> easily<00:02:51.010> catch<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.489> limit

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
you can easily catch a limit

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.720 
you can easily catch a limit
particularly<00:02:52.209> early<00:02:52.329> in<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.569> morning<00:02:53.730> and

particularly early in the morning and
actually<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:55.150> throwing<00:02:55.389> the<00:02:55.540> only<00:02:55.750> top<00:02:55.959> water

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
actually I'm throwing the only top water

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.949 
actually I'm throwing the only top water
I<00:02:56.230> have<00:02:57.060> praying<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.180> don't<00:02:58.389> lose<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.599> but

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
I have praying that I don't lose it but

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.440 
I have praying that I don't lose it but
if<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.739> had<00:02:59.859> my<00:03:00.040> choice<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:00.849> would<00:03:00.879> be<00:03:01.060> throwing<00:03:01.389> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
if I had my choice I would be throwing a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.410 
if I had my choice I would be throwing a
bone<00:03:01.690> or<00:03:02.159> a<00:03:03.159> glow<00:03:03.549> something<00:03:04.030> along<00:03:04.269> those

you come out here you'll notice that
there<00:03:10.540> are<00:03:10.629> times<00:03:10.870> when<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.790> bait<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.909> moving

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
there are times when the bait is moving

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.300 
there are times when the bait is moving
through<00:03:13.389> it's<00:03:13.599> going<00:03:13.690> crazy<00:03:14.099> you<00:03:15.099> seen<00:03:15.280> a

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
through it's going crazy you seen a

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.280 
through it's going crazy you seen a
little<00:03:15.549> bit<00:03:15.639> of<00:03:15.730> surface<00:03:16.090> action<00:03:16.329> a<00:03:16.660> lot<00:03:17.169> of

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
little bit of surface action a lot of

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.780 
little bit of surface action a lot of
surface<00:03:17.620> activity<00:03:17.889> for<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.310> from<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.549> bait

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
surface activity for the from the bait

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.949 
surface activity for the from the bait
but<00:03:19.120> every<00:03:19.299> now<00:03:19.389> and<00:03:19.510> then<00:03:19.599> they'll<00:03:19.720> get<00:03:19.810> hit

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
but every now and then they'll get hit

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.699 
but every now and then they'll get hit
by<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.109> trout<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:22.359> and<00:03:23.109> that's<00:03:23.319> when<00:03:23.470> you'll<00:03:23.590> get

by a trout it and that's when you'll get

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.159 
by a trout it and that's when you'll get
your<00:03:23.769> hits<00:03:24.239> when<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.329> surface<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.840> nice<00:03:25.989> and

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
your hits when the surface is nice and

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.449 
your hits when the surface is nice and
calm<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:27.569> undisturbed<00:03:28.569> there's<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.560> that's

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
calm and undisturbed there's a that's

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.080 
calm and undisturbed there's a that's
I'm<00:03:30.819> not<00:03:30.970> getting<00:03:31.180> any<00:03:31.299> hits<00:03:31.480> at<00:03:31.599> all<00:03:33.060> now<00:03:34.060> a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
I'm not getting any hits at all now a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.939 
I'm not getting any hits at all now a
drawback<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.019> fishing<00:03:35.319> from<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.560> land<00:03:35.739> is

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
drawback to fishing from the land is

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.339 
drawback to fishing from the land is
that<00:03:36.099> you're<00:03:37.060> kind<00:03:37.209> of<00:03:37.389> limited<00:03:37.780> because<00:03:38.139> you

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
that you're kind of limited because you

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.629 
that you're kind of limited because you
just<00:03:38.500> have<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:38.739> wait<00:03:38.889> for<00:03:38.919> the<00:03:39.160> fish<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.340> show

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
just have to wait for the fish to show

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.909 
just have to wait for the fish to show
up<00:03:39.849> but<00:03:40.449> it<00:03:40.540> also<00:03:40.660> forces<00:03:41.139> you<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.260> be<00:03:41.470> patient

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
up but it also forces you to be patient

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.059 
up but it also forces you to be patient
so<00:03:42.069> it's<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.310> it's<00:03:42.910> kind<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.650> love-hate<00:03:44.650> type

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
so it's a it's kind of a love-hate type

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.350 
so it's a it's kind of a love-hate type
thing

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
thing

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.300 
thing
now<00:03:47.960> if<00:03:48.080> you're<00:03:48.200> really<00:03:48.290> not<00:03:48.470> in<00:03:48.620> top<00:03:49.100> water

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
now if you're really not in top water

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.120 
now if you're really not in top water
type<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:50.140> hate<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.260> even<00:03:51.320> think<00:03:51.680> about<00:03:51.770> what<00:03:51.980> you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130

under a quart boy you would just whack
