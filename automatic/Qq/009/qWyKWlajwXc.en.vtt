 see you getting money for yourself 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.050
 all men are almost endless 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.759
 all games except those online on 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.830
 your iphone ipad ipad of everything ok ok 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.630
 in this trick they are called with the app 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.320
 store this here would be ok to have it 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.310
 He had to have 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.619
 you must have jailbroken a 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.950
 moment I go to open and I'll show you 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.300

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.190

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.309

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:44.070

 system face in the app store is so ready 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.610
 be born boh I don't know why I wrote it 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.509
 because I understand a shit and a lot 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.950
 really a description 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:18.090
 that's why so much with discretion 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:26.050
 ok where would you like to go looking for nacs 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:28.750
 here's your stand this was a tweak here 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.790
 time stamped as done three first test 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.790
 the pasta and activate nimble 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.310
 now no game and I know for example 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.840
 that's what I really like because it grows 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:52.110
 plants with functions and I 'm very sorry 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.869
 hard because we hope that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.250
 instead it does not work 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.930
 function but it seems to me to improve 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.690

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.259

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.630
 col de romme works 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.080

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.269

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.120
