little and it is in the end but I rushed
it<00:02:30.450> way<00:02:30.600> more<00:02:30.630> than<00:02:30.990> I<00:02:31.080> should<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.530> came

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
it way more than I should have so I came

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.590 
it way more than I should have so I came
out<00:02:31.830> looking<00:02:32.040> kind<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.310> shitty<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.300> honest

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
out looking kind of shitty to be honest

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.750 
out looking kind of shitty to be honest
but<00:02:33.840> considering<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.650> elected<00:02:35.310> perspective

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
but considering the elected perspective

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.220 
but considering the elected perspective
is<00:02:35.880> off<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.330> stuff<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:36.990> but

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
is off and stuff like that but

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.920 
is off and stuff like that but
considering<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.740> nature<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> topic<00:02:38.580> I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
considering the nature of the topic I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.540 
considering the nature of the topic I
don't<00:02:39.930> think<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.380> perspective<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
don't think that perspective is the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.460 
don't think that perspective is the
first<00:02:41.730> thing<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.000> our<00:02:42.060> minds<00:02:42.510> right<00:02:42.750> now<00:02:42.810> like

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
first thing on our minds right now like

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.580 
first thing on our minds right now like
