battery thing it's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.840 
battery thing it's
I'll<00:02:11.820> try<00:02:12.000> my<00:02:12.180> best<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.540> get<00:02:12.660> open<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.850> it's

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
I'll try my best to get open but it's

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.040 
I'll try my best to get open but it's
actually<00:02:15.110> legitimately<00:02:16.110> hard<00:02:17.810> there<00:02:18.810> I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
actually legitimately hard there I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.930 
actually legitimately hard there I
popped<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.410> off<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.040> then<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.550> can<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
popped it off and then you can see the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.450 
popped it off and then you can see the
battery<00:02:21.300> slides<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.440> right<00:02:22.890> there<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.160> think<00:02:23.400> I

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
believe it's a Qualcomm Snapdragon

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.400 
believe it's a Qualcomm Snapdragon
although<00:03:06.540> I'm<00:03:06.660> not<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.810> hundred<00:03:06.930> percent<00:03:07.110> sure

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
although I'm not a hundred percent sure

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.890 
although I'm not a hundred percent sure
pretty<00:03:08.370> positive<00:03:08.550> though<00:03:08.910> also<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.630> running

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
pretty positive though also is running

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.830 
pretty positive though also is running
android<00:03:10.260> 2.2<00:03:10.290> froyo<00:03:11.420> hopefully<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> gets<00:03:12.630> a

android 2.2 froyo hopefully it gets a

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.600 
android 2.2 froyo hopefully it gets a
gingerbread<00:03:13.170> update<00:03:13.440> although<00:03:13.890> i<00:03:14.100> don't

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
gingerbread update although i don't

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.070 
gingerbread update although i don't
think<00:03:14.850> i've<00:03:14.940> heard<00:03:14.970> anything<00:03:15.240> specifically

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
think i've heard anything specifically

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.050 
think i've heard anything specifically
definite<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.980> again<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.760> has<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.940> 8

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
definite on that again it has the 8

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.030 
definite on that again it has the 8
megapixel<00:03:18.180> camera<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.770> believe

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
megapixel camera on it and I believe

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.440 
megapixel camera on it and I believe
this<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.190> running<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.640> newest<00:03:21.000> version<00:03:21.330> of

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
this is running a newest version of

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.660 
this is running a newest version of
sense<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.900> United<00:03:22.140> States<00:03:22.320> which<00:03:22.650> allows<00:03:23.520> you

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
sense the United States which allows you

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.760 
sense the United States which allows you
to<00:03:23.760> back<00:03:23.940> up<00:03:23.970> some<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.660> your<00:03:24.750> data<00:03:24.990> online<00:03:25.260> or

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
to back up some of your data online or

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.870 
to back up some of your data online or
at<00:03:26.580> least<00:03:27.510> at<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> very<00:03:27.750> least<00:03:28.080> if<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.370> lose

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
at least at the very least if you lose

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.090 
at least at the very least if you lose
your<00:03:30.030> phone<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.570> can<00:03:30.600> then<00:03:31.110> deactivate<00:03:32.070> it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
your phone you can then deactivate it

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.850 
your phone you can then deactivate it
remotely<00:03:33.050> so<00:03:34.050> that<00:03:34.080> nobody<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.530> access<00:03:34.830> your

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
remotely so that nobody can access your

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.410 
remotely so that nobody can access your
information<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.640> think<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.090> allows<00:03:36.240> you<00:03:36.330> to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
information I think it allows you to

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.690 
information I think it allows you to
wipe<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.780> too<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.920> can<00:03:38.100> all<00:03:38.250> be<00:03:38.280> accessed

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
wipe it too and that can all be accessed

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.490 
wipe it too and that can all be accessed
