00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I guess and then here is the whole Taif

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.020 
I guess and then here is the whole Taif
ku<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.979> kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.220> transparent<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.970> don't

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
ku it's kind of transparent and I don't

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.960 
ku it's kind of transparent and I don't
think<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.390> goes<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.259> messy<00:01:52.680> but

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
think it goes in that messy but

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.389 
think it goes in that messy but
something<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.470> box<00:01:55.860> it

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
something like that here is the box it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.990 
something like that here is the box it
says<00:01:56.460> la<00:01:57.270> ku<00:01:57.509> gun<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.829> familiar<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.520> all

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
believe this goes in it and maybe this

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.759 
believe this goes in it and maybe this
is<00:03:32.639> a<00:03:32.910> thigh<00:03:33.510> it's<00:03:34.019> really<00:03:34.319> popular<00:03:34.500> here

right now I think it's type of berry and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.670 
right now I think it's type of berry and
it<00:03:37.910> it's<00:03:38.910> really<00:03:39.269> nutritious<00:03:39.930> I've<00:03:40.260> actually

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
it it's really nutritious I've actually

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.590 
it it's really nutritious I've actually
never<00:03:40.950> had<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.549> but<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:41.880> know<00:03:42.090> it's<00:03:42.209> popular

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
never had it but I know it's popular

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.030 
never had it but I know it's popular
here<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.350> then<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.579> maybe<00:03:45.829> donut<00:03:46.829> I

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
here and then is this maybe donut I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.770 
here and then is this maybe donut I
think<00:03:47.430> I'm<00:03:47.670> not<00:03:47.819> sure<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.480> doesn't<00:03:48.690> really

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
think I'm not sure it doesn't really

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.599 
think I'm not sure it doesn't really
come<00:03:48.989> with<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.170> plate<00:03:49.470> or<00:03:49.500> anything<00:03:49.889> so<00:03:50.370> I'm

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
come with a plate or anything so I'm

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.370 
come with a plate or anything so I'm
assuming<00:03:50.880> it's<00:03:51.150> something<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.540> eat<00:03:51.780> by<00:03:52.049> hand

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
assuming it's something you eat by hand

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.500 
assuming it's something you eat by hand

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
so maybe a donut

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.180

buns

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
buns

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.940

not<00:04:37.790> always<00:04:37.940> pork<00:04:38.330> butt<00:04:38.630> meat<00:04:38.870> boo<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:39.230> meat<00:04:39.500> so

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
not always pork butt meat boo is meat so

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.580 
not always pork butt meat boo is meat so
I'm<00:04:40.550> assuming<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:41.360> pork<00:04:41.810> of<00:04:41.990> some<00:04:42.170> sort<00:04:42.380> or

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
I'm assuming it's pork of some sort or

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.130 
I'm assuming it's pork of some sort or
meat<00:04:42.800> of<00:04:42.980> some<00:04:43.130> sort<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:44.120> here<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.480> is<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:44.960> guess

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
meat of some sort so here it is I guess

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.980 
meat of some sort so here it is I guess
this<00:04:45.320> is<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.920> steamer<00:04:46.550> it's<00:04:46.970> basically<00:04:47.900> just

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
this is the steamer it's basically just

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.690 
this is the steamer it's basically just
panko<00:04:48.620> this<00:04:48.800> is<00:04:48.980> rubbery<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:49.490> it's<00:04:49.580> supposed

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
panko this is rubbery so it's supposed

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.990 
panko this is rubbery so it's supposed
to<00:04:49.790> be<00:04:49.940> like<00:04:50.270> a<00:04:50.420> silicone<00:04:50.980> steamer<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:52.310> here

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
to be like a silicone steamer and here

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.380 
to be like a silicone steamer and here
