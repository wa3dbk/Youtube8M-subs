00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.930
 tried to surprise us Judas spill and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.009
 that we proceed directly to our 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.489
 the hero goes here so small 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.980
 small boxes 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.980
 inside the device itself 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.570

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.780
 cord by the way in our like this 22 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.150
 battery can't be this standard 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.390
 battery pack 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:01:08.220

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:12.880
 device with an opel smartphone up 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.750
 that we have two sim card slots inside 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.799
 one micro sim and usually a slot for 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.580
 micro sd cards state support up to 64 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:28.960

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:34.420
 here at 2000 milliamps for couples 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:41.400
 hours during normal boot phone 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.400
 keeps somewhere a day although it happens less 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.100
 So 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.810
 back cover well what can you say so well 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.250
 there is corrugated plastic that pretty 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.700
 pleasant to the touch although the lid does not inspire 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.789
 if the confidence to disassemble the phone of the same 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 can often weaken 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:08.250
 until on our device and backlash 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.840
 it is observed that the rear speaker is lost 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.440

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:34.430
 headphone input well yes yes it is 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.180
 the device is equipped with a display then inches 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.840
 three keys back home and menu and 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.019
 5 megapixel front camera 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:52.620
 Now let's switch and see that 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:54.150
 us after for fancy yet 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.459
 stay turns on quickly go for a walk 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.000
 Vut no machine configurations equipped 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.690
 4-core mt6589 chip with a frequency of 1 2 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.290
 gigahertz 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.980
 from mediatek company for graphics responsible 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.669
 microsoft power vr sgx544mp 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.760
 technologies 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:14.639
 also included are 1 gigabyte 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.919
 ram and 16 loves inner 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:22.260
 memory and Wi-Fi module 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:24.060
 there will be 40 compass and gyroscope 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.510
 devices turned on let's talk 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.400
 about the main primus that was announced 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.650
 it is about full hd and without screen from 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.610
 companies shot screen resolution 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.200
 is 1920 by 1080 pixels 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.370
 the picture is not practically inverted 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.940
 the screen has a very good 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.820
 color rendering and quite high 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:52.590
 The brightness in my opinion is one of 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.990
 best screens to date but 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.540
 let's talk about the screen a little later and 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:02.220
 move on to the tests we spent a few 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.290
 test pre-read 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.730
 by results 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.580
 The first test is antutu hardware 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.350
 11600 48 parrots as you see on 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.739
 my opinion today is not much and not 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.019
 little well so mediocre result of this 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:25.050
 no surprise Well, this second test 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.570
 0 mark 28 frames per second 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.590
 Well, you know, the engine is certainly not very 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.210
 sum it up in our review 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.940
 talk about no pros and cons 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.160
 this device to unique pluses 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.380
 can be attributed 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.390
 device screen and materials 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.470
 shells 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.919
 the device is made of fairly sturdy 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.110
 materials they are pleasant to the touch 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.919
 the device is comfortable in the hands there is no feeling 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.100
 some shovels that are inherent 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.290
 modern smartphones well, and perhaps all 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.500
 no although it should also be low instead 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.350
 price for 350 dollars for breed with such 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.860
 characteristics it is cheap and now about 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.500
 Some disadvantages of devices is very 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.240
 quickly get loose unwound 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.310
 his cogs and he starts to creak 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.910
 you have to spin them every time 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.050
 Further 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.980
 the disadvantages include the fact that 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.690
 the developers got a little hot 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.280
 became such a configuration such a screen 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.400
 For example, if you see on the frame when 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.980
 fast flipping he see 2 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.200
 the site also happens on games and on 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.260
 fraction on video sometimes 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.560
 the device hangs up annoying people 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.510
 who are used to quick reaction 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.030
 the phone for today was all with you 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.570
