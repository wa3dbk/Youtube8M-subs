quest<00:07:08.880> line<00:07:09.120> but<00:07:09.860> what<00:07:10.860> could<00:07:11.010> probably<00:07:11.370> be

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790 
quest line but what could probably be

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.120 
quest line but what could probably be
the<00:07:11.940> case<00:07:12.240> is<00:07:12.600> that<00:07:13.410> it<00:07:13.800> will<00:07:13.919> probably

glitched<00:07:19.639> but<00:07:20.639> I<00:07:20.669> guess<00:07:20.910> we'll<00:07:21.090> see<00:07:21.270> moving

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.140 
glitched but I guess we'll see moving
forward<00:07:22.190> but<00:07:23.190> that<00:07:23.340> will<00:07:23.490> wrap<00:07:23.640> it<00:07:23.790> up<00:07:23.880> for<00:07:24.060> now

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150
