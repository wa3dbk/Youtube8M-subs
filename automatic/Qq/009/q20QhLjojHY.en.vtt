00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.490
 We begin a section in which 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.170
 through a series of questions can 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.209

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.209

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.490
 today we have the player of the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.130
 america the national fiction raúl jiménez 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.350
 in here between us do not go to see 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.420
 tell me what does america mean in your 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.860
 good life is a very large institution 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.930
 to which I have always belonged since 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.849
 since he was 7 years old and good is a 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.960
 proudly wear this shirt which 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.300
 considered the most 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.010
 important of your career is having 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.430
 debuted in first division in 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.500
 get the Olympics and the 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.960
 last tournament with america win it and the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.850
 harder I think that when before 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.890
 to debut I saw that all of my 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.269
 companions to the first edition and I myself 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.579
 I was like they're stagnating 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.679
 So that's where I thought that 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.190
 I was going to do what I already do 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:57.050
 mine this good I have several so that 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.149
 always since I was little I do not know about raúl 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.730
 gonzález I like the duty madrid and 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.210
 good from mexico pearl hermosillo is something 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.380
 that they are like my form not some 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.450
 technique 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.430
 Well now Miguel de Herrera, I know that 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.650
 I have 60 now that is giving me the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.360
 opportunity what this favorite stadium 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.000
 Well, I think the Aztec because 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.040
 then like the other house to me and 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.220
 It is always every 15 days we are when 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.410
 there and then as I am part of me if not 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.730
 outside player that would be better that yes 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.890
 it's hard, I think I would have 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.530
 dedicated to the school I do not know any 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.710
 career in specific but presides 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.130
 I would have to put him over his 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.130
 effects 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.700
 then I do not suddenly know how to do this 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.700

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.280

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:58.610

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.010

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.080
 not wanting to do things when when 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.840
 they tell me and then some of your 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.390
 qualities what would this be that I am 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.130
 very punctual when it comes to being in 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.610

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.350
 for all matches for all 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.030

 Mixed insurance of the team but mixed by 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.580
