18<00:00:17.430> months<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:18.180> got<00:00:18.420> into<00:00:18.660> such<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.230> pattern

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
18 months have got into such a pattern

18 months have got into such a pattern
of<00:00:19.859> play<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.369> whoever<00:00:20.789> gets<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.150> ball

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
of play that whoever gets the ball

wherever<00:00:21.840> they<00:00:22.109> are<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> pitch<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:23.039> look

for<00:00:23.640> Robin<00:00:23.910> van<00:00:24.060> Persie<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.289> he<00:00:25.439> doesn't

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
for Robin van Persie and if he doesn't

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.460 
for Robin van Persie and if he doesn't
perform<00:00:25.949> then<00:00:26.670> they<00:00:26.880> struggle<00:00:27.539> now<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> believe

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
wrong because I remember last season

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.209 
wrong because I remember last season
there<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> point<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.100> you're

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
there was a point and and you're

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.740 
there was a point and and you're
absolutely<00:00:38.460> right<00:00:38.820> about<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.300> fact<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.629> he

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
absolutely right about the fact that he

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
absolutely right about the fact that he
was<00:00:40.170> prolific<00:00:40.559> who<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.370> he<00:00:41.460> did<00:00:41.730> go<00:00:41.940> for<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
was prolific who but he did go for a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.000 
was prolific who but he did go for a
little<00:00:42.420> phase<00:00:42.780> 2<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.379> six<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:43.860> eight

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
little phase 2 or what six or eight

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.830 
little phase 2 or what six or eight
gates<00:00:44.250> before<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.730> end<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> season<00:00:45.210> when

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
gates before the end of the season when

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.319 
gates before the end of the season when
he<00:00:45.930> didn't<00:00:46.379> score<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.910> Arsenal<00:00:47.910> still

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
he didn't score and Arsenal still

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.450 
he didn't score and Arsenal still
managed<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.780> chisel<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> winds<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.430> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
managed to chisel out the winds so I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430 
managed to chisel out the winds so I
think<00:00:50.610> although<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> their<00:00:51.809> instinct<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
think although that is their instinct to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.380 
think although that is their instinct to
find<00:00:52.710> him<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.010> much<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.219> often<00:00:53.610> as<00:00:53.760> possible<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
find him as much as often as possible I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.240 
find him as much as often as possible I
still<00:00:55.170> think<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:55.530> found<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> win

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
still think they found a way to win

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
still think they found a way to win
without<00:00:56.520> him<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.000> they'll<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> again

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
without him I think they'll do it again

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.599 
without him I think they'll do it again
I<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> bring<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.260> our<00:00:58.350> next<00:00:58.590> guest<00:00:59.399> these

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it was often as possible and I was

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.020 
it was often as possible and I was
suggesting<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.799> there<00:01:23.189> was<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.610> period

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
suggesting that there was that period

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.640

wasn't<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.479> was<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:24.900> end<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.259> season

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

where<00:01:26.009> he<00:01:26.040> wasn't<00:01:26.670> scoring<00:01:26.939> goals<00:01:27.330> but

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
where he wasn't scoring goals but

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
where he wasn't scoring goals but
Arsenal<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.320> still<00:01:28.560> winning<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.909> maybe

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
Arsenal was still winning and and maybe

Arsenal was still winning and and maybe
even<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.290> they<00:01:31.500> had<00:01:31.619> worked<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:32.189> maybe<00:01:32.479> we

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
even then they had worked out maybe we

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.710 
even then they had worked out maybe we
can<00:01:33.750> cope<00:01:34.049> without<00:01:34.229> van<00:01:34.590> Persie<00:01:35.329> then<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.509> think

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
can cope without van Persie then I think

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.420 
can cope without van Persie then I think
it's<00:01:36.840> ever<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.220> thing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it's ever going to be a good thing

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.969 
it's ever going to be a good thing
losing<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> heist<00:01:40.170> finishes

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
losing you know what the heist finishes

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.380 
losing you know what the heist finishes
on<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> planet<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.700> new<00:01:41.970> that's<00:01:42.240> never

on the planet that new that's never

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330 
on the planet that new that's never
going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> good<00:01:42.930> thing<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.290> what<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.070> kind

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
going to be a good thing and what I kind

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
going to be a good thing and what I kind
of<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.850> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.570> agree<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.350> you're

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
of can kind of agree with what you're

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
of can kind of agree with what you're
saying<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.220> were<00:01:47.369> looking<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.790> Robin<00:01:48.180> van

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
saying and we were looking for Robin van

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
saying and we were looking for Robin van
Persie<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.049> last<00:01:49.560> season<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.159> he<00:01:50.430> was

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
Persie and last season because he was

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
Persie and last season because he was
pretty<00:01:51.149> much<00:01:51.299> our<00:01:51.479> only<00:01:51.509> goal<00:01:51.810> threat<00:01:52.140> outside

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
pretty much our only goal threat outside

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.969 
pretty much our only goal threat outside
and<00:01:53.369> very<00:01:53.790> consistent<00:01:54.479> their<00:01:54.659> work<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and very consistent their work on but I

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.709 
and very consistent their work on but I
think<00:01:56.310> we've<00:01:56.549> impressed<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.360> someone

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
think we've impressed that is someone

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
think we've impressed that is someone
we've<00:01:57.930> got<00:01:58.310> plenty<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.549> players<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.969> who<00:02:00.180> can

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
we've got plenty of players in who can

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.499 
we've got plenty of players in who can
assist<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.079> start<00:02:02.040> creating<00:02:02.250> chance<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
assist and start creating chance is the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.959 
assist and start creating chance is the
only<00:02:03.659> concern<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.829> Arsenal<00:02:05.130> fans<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.729> we

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
only concern for Arsenal fans is if we

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.089 
only concern for Arsenal fans is if we
do<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.119> Robin<00:02:06.540> van<00:02:06.630> Persie<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:07.200> we're

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
do that Robin van Persie go we're

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.400 
do that Robin van Persie go we're

that<00:02:47.320> thing<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.340> already<00:02:48.730> gone<00:02:48.820> on<00:02:48.940> record

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
that thing is already gone on record

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.330 
that thing is already gone on record
saying<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.959> Podolski<00:02:50.800> will<00:02:50.980> probably

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
saying that and Podolski will probably

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.630 
saying that and Podolski will probably
play<00:02:51.459> through<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.030> center<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.190> Theo<00:02:54.190> Walcott

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
play through the center and Theo Walcott

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.610 
play through the center and Theo Walcott
like<00:02:54.940> if<00:02:55.540> he's<00:02:55.720> not<00:02:55.870> good<00:02:56.050> enough<00:02:56.080> out<00:02:56.440> why

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
like if he's not good enough out why

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.870 
like if he's not good enough out why
it's<00:02:56.890> not<00:02:56.980> going<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.250> get<00:02:57.370> enough<00:02:57.550> through<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
it's not going to get enough through the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.130 
it's not going to get enough through the
whip<00:02:58.030> through<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.510> middle<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:58.870> certainly

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
whip through the middle we certainly

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.780 
whip through the middle we certainly
shouldn't<00:02:59.380> be<00:02:59.500> playing<00:02:59.860> to<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.250> strengths<00:03:00.700> of

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
shouldn't be playing to the strengths of

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.690 
shouldn't be playing to the strengths of
a<00:03:00.880> striker<00:03:01.209> what<00:03:02.200> potential<00:03:02.830> strike<00:03:03.040> only<00:03:03.550> has

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
a striker what potential strike only has

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.940 
a striker what potential strike only has
really<00:03:04.269> one<00:03:04.450> trick<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.840> his<00:03:04.959> article<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.530> think

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
really one trick in his article I think

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.640 
really one trick in his article I think
I'm<00:03:06.130> sure<00:03:06.400> ooh<00:03:06.870> looks<00:03:07.870> like<00:03:07.989> a<00:03:08.110> really<00:03:08.380> good

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
I'm sure ooh looks like a really good

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.680 
I'm sure ooh looks like a really good
sort<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.340> traditional<00:03:10.030> English<00:03:10.480> striker

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
sort of traditional English striker

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.190 
sort of traditional English striker
think<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.380> 12<00:03:11.680> assists<00:03:12.100> last<00:03:12.220> season<00:03:12.660> 22<00:03:13.660> 22

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
think I 12 assists last season 22 22

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.610 
think I 12 assists last season 22 22
goals<00:03:14.739> if<00:03:15.100> he<00:03:15.700> can<00:03:15.880> make<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.870> step<00:03:17.110> up<00:03:17.350> thing

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
goals if he can make the step up thing

deliveries<00:05:09.160> not<00:05:09.460> good<00:05:09.669> enough<00:05:09.970> at<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.630> top
