00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:12.639
 the truth is the group is very well 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.790
 I also feel in a position to 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.830
 face tomorrow's game 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.480
 and well as we all know, I think the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.120
 lion comes squeezing and we close strong 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.590
 I think even is not 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.590
 playing the quarterfinals 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.890
 we have to think that we are inside 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.140
 the league and three games are still 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.750
 very important and difficult I think that 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.750
 according to the passage of days and 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.980
 matches apparently changed that 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 people perspective 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.500
 and you were more of a process not 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.470
 I think it was time that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 We needed the equipment the new ones 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.000
 flavors obviously included me 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.920
 so that people would respond in favor of 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.920
 not be in favor of us we think 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.110
 first to beat the lion is not going to be 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.420
 nothing easy is a court 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 has always been very difficult to the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.530
 Lion court and the truth is that good 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 we tried quite hard this week 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.220
 to face it more or less we have a 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.050
 idea how how will you play before 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 us and good man what 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.130
 we practice like this during the week is a 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.120
 very unbalancing team I think that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.550
 since he returned to 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.050
 the first vision and also in the 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.250
 first ascent 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.490
 it was seen that it was a very offensive team and 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:41.030
 well we can not stop thinking about what 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.000
 what can cause us why 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.040
 and so come on a bad streak are very 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.250
 dangerous end up first 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.830
 during the tournament it would be important to see 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.380
 also not 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.130
 and obviously the rate a 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.310
 liberators would be 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.310
 even more important because we would have 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.880
 a very large showcase that is this 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.920
 South American tournament then 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.830
 hopefully and you can achieve both 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.050
 I believe that this team was formed to 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.599
 The biggest stick does not want to search 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.319
 first a group and after a 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.970
 title that this club deserves 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.610
 and this and these people the team has 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.370
 worked for that the points and the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.670
 actions have have been every weekend 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.860
 of the week so for what is in the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.170
 group is to get the highest 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.150
 It's going to be that hopeless championship 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.030
 how much do these people need 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.190
 back all the truth we feel in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.160
 good level at a time and the decision 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.380
 it's from tomÃ¡s who plays good will give 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.390
 always the best to say obviously in the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.450
 Liguilla all arrive at their best point 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.849
 there are three very complicated teams that 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.410
 that as a network as you told me they are 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.890
 they are looking for 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.090
 to enter the group and well, it's not going to 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.510
 be easy 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.250
 we have a local party that the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.730
 the goals will be very complicated 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.680
 they come squeezing very hard and good not 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.210
 it remains more to do our soccer I think 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.970
 that the back has shown in this 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.480
 campaign a different football and so has 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.480
 left ahead
