00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.400
 hi chachi how are you today I'm going to 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.330
 teach how to change the strings of your 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.850
 electric guitar 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.860
 and for that we are going to see the example with 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.020
 a single string because once you see it 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.689
 and it is therefore the same for the rest of 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.420
 strings and we will see it in my case with 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.310
 the fourth string will be 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.350
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.910
 remove the ropes in this case I will 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.440
 remove the rope and then loosen it 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.440
 here is worth the light plan 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.860
 Y 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.230
 If you have broken what you have to do 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.890
 is to remove the one from both ends of the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.970
 end of here 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.970
 of the pegbox 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.110
 and at the end of the bridge 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.880
 some electric guitars have a lid 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.220
 other electric guitars do not have 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.730
 top in this case I have it but it will be 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.080
 edited because I feel like it's worth it and because 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.330
 also to be able to take out the rope 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.270
 because if not the lid does not leave me then 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:10.210
 we push the rope and we see that it goes out 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.210
 there by its corresponding hole 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.480
 the rope outside you'll see that the strings 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.430
 the new ropes 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.710
 at one end he has nothing and on the other 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 side have the ball right now 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.530
 tells you to go on the bridge 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.119
 and nothing without further explanation let's 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.030
 change the rope and let's put now 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.890
 the new rope the fourth rope 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.920
 and I'm going to zoom in so you can see it 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.990
 best 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.420
 we started putting the rope by the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.659
 bridge by this pileup here and you 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.450
 we turn the guitar 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.119
 now with the guitar rotated 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.140
 we introduce the rope through the hole 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.289
 corresponding to the string ie 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.729
 how are we with the fourth string or 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.759
 1-2-3-4 this hole here this 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.679
 hole goes in and we put it in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.679
 this is the top of the rope 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.950
 there to the bottom and now we give you the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.789
 back to the guitar 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.650
 we already have the rope well fastened and now 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.260
 we go to the pegbox that is where it is 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.290
 the trick we are changing the fourth 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.959
 Then I turn the headstock of such 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.930
 so that the hole here is 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.530
 pointing to the bridge because that way the rope 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.530
 come here 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.190
 and I introduce it 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.810
 and one thing remains that way 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.129
 Pub 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.769
 you can the trick now the knot is worth 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.530
 the knot we do the following 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.689
 somehow we think so is it worth 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.540
 tense but what we are going to do is that 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:59.950
 let's go a little bit over a little 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.780
 well of rope to give it a spin by 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.470
 on top of the leftover 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.470
 A) Yes 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.560
 what we have done is give a 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.750
 back but over the leftover and 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.000
 then we have the rope on top and 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.000
 this left over the bottom end 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.900
 once we have this 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.379
 we think we squeeze 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.180
 and we started thinking 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.189
 the leftover goes around here 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:04.469
 It follows continues if it serves restaurant 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.769
 here and now look, look what is it 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.780
 what happens now the surplus is 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.930
 above is when he turns around 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.250
 now we have the surplus above and 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.250
 the rope below 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.469
 and we keep thinking 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.930
 and we have it 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.080
 here it would not hurt 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.620
 a pileup of those to turn the 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:42.830
 pegbox 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:45.680
 [Music] 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.250
 and voilÃ  is now the only thing would be 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.190
 refine what and we already have it worth so 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.960
 summarizing the trick of the light plan is 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.240
 that we give a return to above and the 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.390
 leftover remains below we begin to 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.660
 tense and when you turn around you stay 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.200
 the leftover above and the rope below do not 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.260
 has nothing else the rest is very easy and 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.030
 last glass as nothing to cut with the 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.160
 pliers 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.160
 the excess of strings not to puncture 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.820
 tea or take a look at someone 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.580
 and wallace 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.160
 we already have the rope changed if it has 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.580
 liked comment what you want any 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.470
 doubt what is subscribe if it has 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.170
 liked you can also donate in our 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.300
 web page give me the like and see you 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.440
 in another tutorial we have a lot 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.440
 bye bye
