00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello in touch Sergey well and today 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.420
 Let me tell you what should 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.969
 be the right power load which 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.690
 aims to burn fat and rid 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.400
 overweight I have often said that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.539
 weight loss process 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.080
 it is a complex physiological process and to 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.450
 he needs to be taken seriously not to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.660
 harm health and only strengthen it 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:40.829
 get rid of excess fat and improve 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.649
 your well-being is clear what those tips 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 which I give they are universal and this 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.480
 let's say as for 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 for the mean flee statistical 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.210
 human many variations appear in 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.579
 depending on your weight on your 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.399
 performance level from your 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.100
 body condition from your from your 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.150
 contraindications of diseases from your 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.490
 age however now I tell you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.090
 I'll tell you about the secrets of strength training 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.490
 that contribute and aims to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.990
 weight loss 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 your fat blink and as I said 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:34.799
 power load must be at least 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.310
 30-40 min this load is better 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.000
 alternate your even ie we are in front 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.399
 power load must be actively like 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.680
 or run around in course boundaries 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.290
 certain about who told you 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.780
 which is fat burning and post power 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.299
 load also need to be like or escape 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.619
 tusit a and even load in the same 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.460
 pulse boundaries on fat burning a 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:06.479
 here is the most power load should have 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.500
 following first let its borders itself 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.420
 power loads must be the same 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.150
 as well as aerobic exercise well average 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.950
 universal at the border itself is 125 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.830
 beats per minute 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.970
 captured 135 minutes or 2223 hits in 10 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.870
 seconds if we get down and sit down 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.450
 accordingly, the power load is needed 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.470
 perform on the same pulse that is, we 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.840
 how to simulate aerobic exercise 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:47.280
 doing exercises understand yes it 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.140
 exercise to perform 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.720
 naturally with the right technique and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.870
 correctly selected which ones 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.430
 exercises we will see I will tell you in 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.989
 next course videos 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.360
 or you can immediately order from me 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.640
 personalized program and I these 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.099
 exercises for you personally 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:14.599
 for you for your body but for now 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:17.190
 universal advice means exercise 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.530
 we select and the number of repetitions 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.010
 Exercise and weight are selected as follows 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.349
 the way the principle is so less weight more 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.980
 reps here when we have less weight 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.680
 more reps in the approach we are actively 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.099
 working on fat burning for study 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.549
 muscle and and muscle relief neither by volume a 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.700
 vice versa for dry relief of muscles and such 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.670
 manner average approach medium amount 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.230
 reps in the approach 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.330
 15 12-15 repetitions 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.430
 Terry 20 if we work 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.040
 muscle stabilizers of this abdominal muscle 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.220
 press or muscle extensors 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.220
 spinal muscles back and minimum 30 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.200
 we will repeat then there will be an effect 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.530
 at least 30 reps to us abdominal muscles 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.310
 press and muscle extensors back for anything 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.269
 the remaining muscles 15-20 repetitions in one 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.880
 Approach the number of approaches we select 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.940
 depending on your age from 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.570
 your performance in the middle of 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.790
 your contraindications for health 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:32.450
 average condition is 3-4 approaches 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:35.000
 average per exercise 3-4 approaches 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.850
 if we do an exercise for example 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.460
 twisting press lying on the floor on 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.419
 upper abdominals we do 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.160
 4 sets of 30 times or 3 sets of 30 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.190
 time 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:53.210
 who makes hard at the beginning 25 to 20 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:56.090
 but then goes on 31 approach always 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:02.060
 must be warming up ie we 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:04.389
 do either less weight or less 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.860
 repetitions in the first approach the rest 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.580
 3-4 approaches working intensively next 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.630
 indicator 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.650
 which is important with power load for 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:23.660
 losing weight is a rest between the rest approach 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:26.900
 between sets should be 45 seconds 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.270
 either one minute or 60 seconds that is 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.910
 for example on the example of an exercise on 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.740
 upper abdominals 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.849
 twisting lying on the floor or twisted in 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.280
 simulator if you practice 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.539
 fitness club 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:45.080
 done 1 warm-up approach 20 times 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:48.680
 rest 45 seconds did the second 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.470
 the approach is already working 30 times rested 45 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.470
 seconds and so on respectively 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:58.610
 very important what you do during 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:02.650
 rest while relaxing here these 45 seconds 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:05.780
 or there 60 seconds need to perform 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.230
 stretching stretch working muscles 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.900
 to increase the effectiveness of the exercises 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.530
 how and what to do stretch I will tell 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.530
 in the following lessons 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:22.550
 thus less weight more 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.700
 reps if muscle stabilizers 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.070
 abdominal muscles and lower back 30 times 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:34.420
 minimum approach 4 approaches 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:37.160
 if the power load for example is very 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.220
 women hip popular topic if we 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:44.090
 perform an exercise on the hips and buttocks 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:49.820
 then at least four approaches 15-20 times a day. 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:52.340
 one approach and so after you 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.070
 completed all strength exercises and in 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.070
 training must be at least 10 610 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.980
 strength exercises need to be given aerobic 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.860
 loads of at least 20 minutes are better than 30 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.919
 your body if we're all right 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:10.280
 do that within 8 hours after 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.450
 workouts will burn fat we will 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.540
 lying on the couch and he will continue 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:17.090
 move and for doubt training we 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:21.640
 burn unlimited calories 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:24.919
 thereby get rid of excess weight 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:28.130
 use these methods data 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:31.729
 secrets data tips and lose weight 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.290
 see you next 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:35.470
 lessons 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.470
 I wish you success
