 they make very long migrations e 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.930
 they arrive from us early March 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.730
 to then colonize the areas of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.360
 nesting of the burning areas 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.210
 to make some reeds they are here 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 we say to raise the offspring up to 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.300
 end of September and beginning of October 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.030
