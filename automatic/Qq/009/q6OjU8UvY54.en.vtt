we<00:00:20.369> might<00:00:20.520> refer<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.150> kind<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.510> physicist

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
we might refer to one kind of physicist

calculations that he works on have to do

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.810 
calculations that he works on have to do
with<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.260> motions<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.830> stars<00:00:28.860> and<00:00:29.310> galaxies

with the motions of stars and galaxies

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.220 
with the motions of stars and galaxies
it's<00:00:30.120> just<00:00:30.300> easier<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.960> people<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it's just easier for people to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.779 
it's just easier for people to
understand<00:00:31.950> when<00:00:32.219> you're<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> cocktail

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789

party<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.629> basically<00:00:34.020> accurate<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.890> no

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
party and it's basically accurate so no

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.299 
party and it's basically accurate so no

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

reach back further into the past and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.150 
reach back further into the past and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
find a fossil of a Pteranodon you got to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.740 
find a fossil of a Pteranodon you got to
get<00:02:29.310> into<00:02:29.520> older<00:02:29.880> layers<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.300> earth<00:02:30.450> so

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
get into older layers of earth so

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.810 
get into older layers of earth so
archaeologists<00:02:31.500> study<00:02:31.830> human<00:02:32.250> history<00:02:32.640> but

archaeologists study human history but

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.460 
archaeologists study human history but
humans<00:02:33.180> have<00:02:33.270> been<00:02:33.330> around<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.660> long<00:02:33.870> time<00:02:33.900> and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
humans have been around a long time and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.110 
humans have been around a long time and
we<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:34.890> left<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.220> lot<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.430> history<00:02:35.850> lying

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
we have left a lot of history lying

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.940 
we have left a lot of history lying
around<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> makes<00:02:37.020> sense<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.530> there<00:02:37.860> are

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
around so it makes sense that there are

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.070 
around so it makes sense that there are
different<00:02:38.370> kinds<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.030> archaeology<00:02:39.750> since

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
down a lot of archaeologists study

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.890 
down a lot of archaeologists study
prehistory<00:02:44.250> now<00:02:44.730> prehistory<00:02:45.180> doesn't<00:02:45.780> mean

paleontology<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.660> as<00:03:51.840> diverse<00:03:52.049> as<00:03:52.530> soon

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
paleontology is just as diverse as soon

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.380 
paleontology is just as diverse as soon
as<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.920> mentioned<00:03:53.190> fossils<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.700> probably<00:03:54.180> go

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
as I mentioned fossils you probably go

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.880 
as I mentioned fossils you probably go
straight<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.840> thinking<00:03:55.019> about<00:03:55.170> dinosaurs<00:03:55.380> and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
straight to thinking about dinosaurs and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.650 
straight to thinking about dinosaurs and
yeah<00:03:56.070> lots<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.580> paleontologists<00:03:57.540> study

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
yeah lots of paleontologists study

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.390 
yeah lots of paleontologists study
dinosaurs<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:58.500> there<00:03:58.620> are<00:03:58.680> even<00:03:58.950> more<00:03:59.190> who

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
dinosaurs so there are even more who

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.770 
dinosaurs so there are even more who
study<00:03:59.670> other<00:03:59.850> kinds<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.180> ancient<00:04:00.540> life

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
study other kinds of ancient life

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.410
