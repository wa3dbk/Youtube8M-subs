du<00:00:07.970> Shi<00:00:08.029> killer<00:00:08.240> robot<00:00:08.480> -<00:00:08.599> this<00:00:09.639> is<00:00:10.639> what

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
du Shi killer robot - this is what

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.509 
du Shi killer robot - this is what
people<00:00:11.150> do<00:00:11.300> is<00:00:11.830> either<00:00:12.830> they<00:00:13.160> use<00:00:13.280> helicopters

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
people do is either they use helicopters

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.999 
people do is either they use helicopters
to<00:00:13.969> check<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:15.019> lines<00:00:15.200> from<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.410> top

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
to check the lines from the top

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.760 
to check the lines from the top
or<00:00:16.880> they<00:00:17.420> have<00:00:17.570> to<00:00:17.720> stop<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.199> transmission<00:00:18.470> of

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
or they have to stop the transmission of

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.920 
or they have to stop the transmission of
electricity<00:00:19.100> and<00:00:19.580> send<00:00:20.210> people<00:00:20.359> to<00:00:20.689> do<00:00:20.810> this

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
electricity and send people to do this

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.700 
electricity and send people to do this
kind<00:00:21.020> of<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:21.260> job

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
kind of a job

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.279 
kind of a job
so<00:00:22.160> sometimes<00:00:22.550> it's<00:00:22.789> 80<00:00:23.300> metres<00:00:23.750> 100<00:00:23.990> metres

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
so sometimes it's 80 metres 100 metres

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.359 
so sometimes it's 80 metres 100 metres
above<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:24.740> ground

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
above the ground

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.099 
above the ground
and<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:26.000> people<00:00:26.269> they<00:00:26.359> have<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.599> walk<00:00:26.779> on<00:00:27.019> the

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
and the people they have to walk on the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.490 
and the people they have to walk on the
cables<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.769> just<00:00:28.670> inspect<00:00:29.090> them<00:00:29.330> by<00:00:29.449> hand<00:00:29.689> so

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
cables and just inspect them by hand so

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.960 
cables and just inspect them by hand so
it's<00:00:30.679> a<00:00:30.769> very<00:00:30.980> dangerous<00:00:31.160> job

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
it's a very dangerous job

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's a very dangerous job
it's<00:00:32.210> very<00:00:32.480> demanding<00:00:32.770> and<00:00:33.770> it's<00:00:33.950> also<00:00:34.130> very

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
it's very demanding and it's also very

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.819 
it's very demanding and it's also very
expensive<00:00:35.360> to<00:00:35.840> stop<00:00:36.170> transmission<00:00:36.649> of

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
expensive to stop transmission of

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.729 
expensive to stop transmission of
electricity<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.930> this<00:00:39.110> way<00:00:39.260> we<00:00:39.379> developed

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
electricity so this way we developed

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.680 
electricity so this way we developed
explainer<00:00:40.129> with<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:40.910> machine<00:00:41.329> we<00:00:41.510> don't

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
explainer with this machine we don't

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.600 
explainer with this machine we don't
need<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.930> stop<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:42.520> transmission<00:00:43.520> of

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
need to stop the transmission of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.900 
need to stop the transmission of
electricity<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.390> can<00:00:44.420> move<00:00:44.719> on<00:00:44.899> on<00:00:45.050> live<00:00:45.440> lines

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
electricity it can move on on live lines

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.520 
electricity it can move on on live lines
here<00:00:46.910> in<00:00:47.000> Japan<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.390> are<00:00:47.510> using<00:00:47.660> up<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.320> five

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
here in Japan you are using up to five

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.500 
here in Japan you are using up to five
hundred<00:00:48.559> kilovolts<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.969> it<00:00:50.059> could<00:00:50.210> be<00:00:50.329> used

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
hundred kilovolts but it could be used

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.510 
hundred kilovolts but it could be used
in<00:00:50.739> 750<00:00:51.739> kilowatts<00:00:52.160> for<00:00:52.340> example<00:00:54.340> so<00:00:55.340> they

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
in 750 kilowatts for example so they

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.520 
in 750 kilowatts for example so they

dismiss<00:01:01.809> there<00:01:02.809> is<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.960> huge<00:01:03.859> number<00:01:04.070> of

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
dismiss there is a huge number of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.160 
dismiss there is a huge number of
obstacles<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.850> cross<00:01:05.150> there<00:01:05.930> are<00:01:06.020> cables

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
obstacles to cross there are cables

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.050 
obstacles to cross there are cables
facers<00:01:06.830> they<00:01:07.340> are<00:01:07.400> used<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.700> keep<00:01:07.939> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
facers they are used to keep the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.690 
facers they are used to keep the
distance<00:01:08.270> between<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.900> lines<00:01:09.110> constant<00:01:09.770> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
distance between the lines constant and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.490 
distance between the lines constant and
those<00:01:11.030> are<00:01:11.210> still<00:01:11.450> more<00:01:11.900> or<00:01:11.990> less<00:01:12.020> easy<00:01:12.290> to

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
those are still more or less easy to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.370 
those are still more or less easy to
cross<00:01:12.710> but<00:01:13.640> when<00:01:13.850> we<00:01:13.970> reach<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.330> tower<00:01:14.540> we

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
cross but when we reach the tower we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.170 
cross but when we reach the tower we
have<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.799> suspension<00:01:16.189> clamp<00:01:16.610> which<00:01:17.060> is

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
have the suspension clamp which is

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.510 
have the suspension clamp which is
basically<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.659> metallic<00:01:18.259> -<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:19.040> hanging

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
basically a metallic - that is hanging

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.109 
basically a metallic - that is hanging
the<00:01:19.970> wires<00:01:20.439> and<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:22.520> have<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.759> find<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:23.000> way<00:01:23.090> to

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
the wires and we have to find a way to

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.330 
the wires and we have to find a way to
cross<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.900> continue<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.619> next<00:01:24.830> Tower

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
cross that to continue to the next Tower

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.399 
cross that to continue to the next Tower
so<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:26.299> is<00:01:26.420> one<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.750> strong<00:01:26.990> points<00:01:27.020> of

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
so this is one of the strong points of

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.620 
so this is one of the strong points of
explainer<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:28.130> was<00:01:28.280> developed<00:01:28.759> in<00:01:28.939> order<00:01:29.299> to

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
explainer it was developed in order to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.179 
explainer it was developed in order to
be<00:01:29.750> able<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.079> do<00:01:30.229> some<00:01:30.470> we<00:01:30.829> call<00:01:31.040> them

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
be able to do some we call them

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.120 
be able to do some we call them
acrobatic<00:01:31.729> motions<00:01:32.150> on<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.990> lines<00:01:33.200> to

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
acrobatic motions on the lines to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.039 
acrobatic motions on the lines to
overcome<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:34.729> obstacles<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.450> continue

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
overcome the obstacles and continue

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.380 
overcome the obstacles and continue
expecting<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.280> for<00:01:37.490> example<00:01:37.820> if<00:01:37.909> we<00:01:38.030> stretch

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
expecting so for example if we stretch

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.620 
expecting so for example if we stretch
this<00:01:38.600> manipulator<00:01:39.110> all<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.650> way<00:01:39.799> to<00:01:40.400> one<00:01:40.549> side

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
this manipulator all the way to one side

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.359 
this manipulator all the way to one side
we<00:01:41.630> end<00:01:41.840> up<00:01:41.960> lifting<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.829> pulleys<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.280> the

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
we end up lifting the pulleys in the

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.580 
we end up lifting the pulleys in the
other<00:01:43.460> side<00:01:43.790> by<00:01:44.630> lifting<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.110> pulleys<00:01:45.439> then

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
other side by lifting the pulleys then

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.440 
other side by lifting the pulleys then
we<00:01:45.740> can<00:01:45.890> do<00:01:46.040> those<00:01:46.340> acrobatic<00:01:46.939> modes<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.299> was

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
we can do those acrobatic modes I was

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.190 
we can do those acrobatic modes I was
talking<00:01:47.780> about

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
talking about

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.260 
talking about
rotate<00:01:48.530> them<00:01:48.619> outside<00:01:48.860> or<00:01:49.159> use<00:01:49.909> them<00:01:50.119> to

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
rotate them outside or use them to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.469 
rotate them outside or use them to
overcome<00:01:50.630> obstacles<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:51.409> on

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.730 

today<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.509> know<00:01:56.630> camera<00:01:56.899> those<00:01:57.229> units<00:01:57.530> got<00:01:57.710> a
