00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.200 

now<00:00:01.860> typically<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:02.460> don't<00:00:02.760> really<00:00:02.939> need<00:00:03.149> to

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
now typically you don't really need to

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.340 
now typically you don't really need to
sharpen<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:05.120> four<00:00:06.120> millimeter<00:00:06.480> lad<00:00:06.750> but<00:00:07.080> it

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
sharpen this four millimeter lad but it

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.919 
sharpen this four millimeter lad but it
happened<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.770> have<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.220> mini<00:00:08.460> let<00:00:09.450> pointer

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
happened to have this mini let pointer

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.100 
happened to have this mini let pointer
from<00:00:10.260> my<00:00:10.559> mini<00:00:10.800> pencil<00:00:11.250> set<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:11.929> we<00:00:12.929> can

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
from my mini pencil set so we can

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.060 
from my mini pencil set so we can
restore<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.009> sharp<00:00:14.759> tip<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.560> three<00:00:16.830> point

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
restore the sharp tip on the three point

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.390 
restore the sharp tip on the three point
eight<00:00:17.130> millimeter<00:00:17.580> let<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:19.439> slowly

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
eight millimeter let so it's slowly

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.260 
eight millimeter let so it's slowly
recovering

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
recovering

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.849 
recovering
so<00:00:22.020> let's<00:00:22.470> sharpen<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.070> ton<00:00:23.340> more<00:00:24.140> but<00:00:25.140> by<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
so let's sharpen a ton more but by and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.589 
so let's sharpen a ton more but by and
large<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.609> rotate<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.090> barrel<00:00:27.300> as

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
large you can just rotate the barrel as

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.170 
large you can just rotate the barrel as
you're<00:00:27.750> working<00:00:29.720> that's<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.090> you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
you're working that's it so but if you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.580 
you're working that's it so but if you
wanted<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> sharpen<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.110> need<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.559> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
wanted to sharpen it you need to get a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.160 
wanted to sharpen it you need to get a
tiny<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.160> pencil<00:00:35.550> set<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
tiny little pencil set and this is the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.819 
tiny little pencil set and this is the
only<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:38.190> works<00:00:39.230> or<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.620> could

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
only one I know that works or you could

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.010 
only one I know that works or you could
use<00:00:41.090> one<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> those<00:00:42.329> stealthy<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.870> that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
use one of those stealthy and that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.920 
use one of those stealthy and that
pointer<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.719> museum<00:00:45.719> let

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
pointer that I'm in this museum let

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.560 
pointer that I'm in this museum let
holders<00:00:46.350> look<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.360> touch<00:00:48.539> up

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
holders look so you can just touch up

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.950 
holders look so you can just touch up
the<00:00:48.809> points<00:00:49.200> by<00:00:49.379> doing<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:53.149> well<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.809> kind

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the points by doing this well it's kind

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
the points by doing this well it's kind
of<00:00:54.989> pointers<00:00:55.289> are<00:00:55.410> gonna<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.620> messy<00:00:56.390> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
of pointers are gonna be messy so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.139 
of pointers are gonna be messy so
basically<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.890> heavier<00:00:59.430> metallic

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
basically this is a heavier metallic

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.630 
basically this is a heavier metallic
flat<00:01:00.329> holder<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.460> full

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
flat holder and this is just a full

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
flat holder and this is just a full
plastic<00:01:02.850> lightweight<00:01:03.420> body<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.080> can

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
plastic lightweight body and they can

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.350 
plastic lightweight body and they can
both<00:01:04.409> use<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.650> same<00:01:04.890> type<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> LEDs<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.330> can

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
both use the same type of LEDs you can

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
both use the same type of LEDs you can
use<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.720> with<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.840> pilotless<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.530> come<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.040> 6b

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
use it with the pilotless I come in 6b

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.750 
use it with the pilotless I come in 6b
be<00:01:09.270> an<00:01:09.570> age<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.580> use<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
be an age or you can use the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.429 
be an age or you can use the
technologists<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.630> coming<00:01:14.150> b3p

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
technologists are coming b3p

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.719 
technologists are coming b3p
or<00:01:16.439> even<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> water<00:01:17.009> columnist<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
or even the water columnist for that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.999 
or even the water columnist for that
matter<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:19.049> read<00:01:19.259> somewhere<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> blog

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
matter and I read somewhere in the blog

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.060 
matter and I read somewhere in the blog
that<00:01:20.040> now<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.549> added<00:01:20.820> two<00:01:21.600> three<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.530> four<00:01:22.830> B

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that now they added two three and four B

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.160 
that now they added two three and four B
but<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.000> haven't<00:01:24.210> seen<00:01:24.420> those<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
but we haven't seen those here in the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
but we haven't seen those here in the
States<00:01:25.409> yes<00:01:25.680> maybe<00:01:25.950> jetpens<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:26.520> pick<00:01:26.700> them

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
States yes maybe jetpens will pick them

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.480 
States yes maybe jetpens will pick them
up<00:01:26.939> too<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> let's<00:01:28.619> move<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.950> junk<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:29.400> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
up too so let's move this junk out of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
up too so let's move this junk out of
the<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.659> been<00:01:30.810> babbling<00:01:31.049> too

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the way and I just been babbling too

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.350 
the way and I just been babbling too
much<00:01:31.560> okay<00:01:32.460> let<00:01:32.610> me<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:32.909> dust<00:01:33.329> off

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
much okay let me get this dust off

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.350 
much okay let me get this dust off
there's<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:36.990> quickly<00:01:37.259> schedule<00:01:37.770> face

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
there's one more quickly schedule face

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
there's one more quickly schedule face
so<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.509> seen<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> char<00:01:39.990> pointer<00:01:40.640> lets<00:01:41.640> me

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
so you seen the char pointer lets me

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.480 
so you seen the char pointer lets me
just<00:01:42.240> look<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> closet<00:01:43.770> manga<00:01:44.220> shape
