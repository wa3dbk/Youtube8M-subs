Rubik's<00:02:12.420> three<00:02:13.200> by<00:02:13.319> three<00:02:13.530> that's

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
Rubik's three by three that's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.530 
Rubik's three by three that's
not<00:02:14.400> been<00:02:14.580> lubricated<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:15.120> thing<00:02:15.270> has<00:02:15.360> not

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
not been lubricated this thing has not

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.470 
not been lubricated this thing has not
been<00:02:15.690> lubricated<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.489> yeah<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.300> stinks

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
been lubricated so yeah and it stinks

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.089 
been lubricated so yeah and it stinks
also<00:02:18.720> real<00:02:18.870> easy<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.140> take<00:02:19.260> apart<00:02:19.349> if<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.920> can

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
also real easy to take apart if I can

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.199 
also real easy to take apart if I can
try<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.090> edge<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:21.900> cooperate<00:02:23.209> like

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
try the edge that will cooperate like

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.660 
try the edge that will cooperate like
right<00:02:24.480> here<00:02:24.800> like<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.010> see<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:26.519> really

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
right here like that see it's really

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.970 
right here like that see it's really
easy<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:26.940> take<00:02:27.060> apart<00:02:27.500> unlike<00:02:28.500> my<00:02:28.650> other<00:02:28.680> one

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
easy to take apart unlike my other one

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.600 
easy to take apart unlike my other one
which<00:02:29.129> is<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:30.170> very<00:02:33.769> stubborn<00:02:34.769> in<00:02:35.220> terms<00:02:35.400> of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
which is and very stubborn in terms of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.309 
which is and very stubborn in terms of
taking<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.120> apart<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.230> I'm<00:02:38.569> pretty<00:02:39.569> good<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
taking it apart so I'm pretty good for a

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.559 
taking it apart so I'm pretty good for a
Rubik's<00:02:40.620> tripathi<00:02:40.950> an<00:02:41.040> opinion<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.420> this

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
Rubik's tripathi an opinion so this

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.270 
Rubik's tripathi an opinion so this
other<00:02:42.750> one<00:02:43.019> this<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.260> actually<00:02:43.739> not<00:02:43.799> lies<00:02:44.010> my

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
other one this is actually not lies my

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.580 
other one this is actually not lies my
brothers<00:02:44.760> but<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.390> reason<00:02:45.510> why<00:02:45.720> he's<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:45.959> own

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
brothers but the reason why he's in own

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.500 
brothers but the reason why he's in own
anymore<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.190> because<00:02:47.220> he<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.730> no<00:02:47.940> use<00:02:48.209> for<00:02:48.480> it

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
anymore is because he is no use for it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.990 
anymore is because he is no use for it
but<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.840> still<00:02:49.110> say<00:02:49.769> it's<00:02:49.920> his<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.459> case<00:02:50.730> he<00:02:50.880> ever

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
but I still say it's his in case he ever

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.819 
but I still say it's his in case he ever
wants<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.330> learn<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.810> I'll<00:02:51.900> let<00:02:52.410> him<00:02:52.500> use<00:02:52.680> this

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
wants to learn so I'll let him use this

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.960 
wants to learn so I'll let him use this
but<00:02:53.730> um<00:02:54.110> overall<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.319> Ben's<00:02:56.250> okay<00:02:56.579> this<00:02:56.790> one

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
but um overall it's Ben's okay this one

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.600 
but um overall it's Ben's okay this one
I<00:02:57.000> did<00:02:57.329> lubricate<00:02:57.900> with<00:02:58.200> wd-40<00:02:59.160> I'm<00:02:59.310> pretty

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
I did lubricate with wd-40 I'm pretty

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.850 
I did lubricate with wd-40 I'm pretty
sure<00:02:59.819> it's<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.720> best<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.260> lubricate<00:03:01.709> with

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
sure it's not the best of lubricate with

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.400 
sure it's not the best of lubricate with
but<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> mean<00:03:02.640> come<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:02.940> wd-40<00:03:03.810> seems<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.200> fix

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
but I mean come on wd-40 seems to fix

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.860 
but I mean come on wd-40 seems to fix
everything<00:03:04.739> so<00:03:05.190> your<00:03:06.000> fix<00:03:06.239> Rubik's<00:03:06.540> cubes

than it originally did um in terms of
actual<00:03:25.260> turning<00:03:25.950> quality<00:03:26.280> again<00:03:26.489> as<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:27.000> said

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
actual turning quality again as I said

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.960 
actual turning quality again as I said
it's<00:03:27.569> pretty<00:03:27.870> good<00:03:28.459> but<00:03:29.459> again<00:03:29.700> corner

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
it's pretty good but again corner

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.300 
it's pretty good but again corner
cutting<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:31.079> crap<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.750> sucks<00:03:34.650> me<00:03:34.950> look<00:03:35.190> at

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
this what do you call this for the only

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.069 
this what do you call this for the only
thing<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.549> could<00:03:42.239> even<00:03:42.510> count<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.810> quarter

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
thing I could even count a quarter

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.819 
thing I could even count a quarter
cutting<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.010> with<00:03:44.940> enough<00:03:45.269> budging

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
cutting is this and with enough budging

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
it'll go but I don't think even that

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.860 
it'll go but I don't think even that
could<00:03:50.100> even<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.459> called<00:03:50.790> quarter<00:03:51.690> cutting

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
could even be called quarter cutting

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.690 
could even be called quarter cutting
this<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:53.269> very<00:03:54.269> sorry<00:03:54.810> excuse<00:03:55.290> but<00:03:55.709> it's<00:03:56.310> no

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it's rubik Brian what do you expect it's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.099 
it's rubik Brian what do you expect it's
not<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.739> best<00:03:58.859> quality<00:03:59.069> out<00:03:59.400> there<00:03:59.609> but<00:04:00.540> um<00:04:00.720> as

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
not the best quality out there but um as

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.449 
not the best quality out there but um as
you<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.470> see<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.680> one<00:04:01.829> is<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:01.950> lot<00:04:02.280> more

you can see this one is a lot more

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.009 
you can see this one is a lot more
presentable<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:03.150> because<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.599> didn't<00:04:03.840> go<00:04:03.930> to
