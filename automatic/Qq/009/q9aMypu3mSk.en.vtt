 [musics] 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.870
 Everyone who looks at the guitar radar 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.870
 Hello, my name is Yoshiaki Manabe 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:26.860
 Well that mainly in the album called Japan's key to open the people gathered time machine + 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:33.130
 The opportunity to join the album 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:35.870
 Well, I was satisfied with it because I was able to make a piece of music that was just enough for myself 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.670
 Thank you for making an album 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:44.149
 I'll tell you a bit, I'm a little instrumental I'm in an unknown field so far 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.360
 But I think I'll try to challenge a bit and I will make an appraisal album 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.360
 Was 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.440
 That's right 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:58.010
 I think you said in the various approaches in that the guitar instrumental Well of each 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.180
 There are various guitar instrumental albums with the guitar list showing each composition 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.460
 But 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 In the case of me, it is the result technique that I thought variously, but rather than launching such a guitar play 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.170
 You can just put out your own guitar style 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.820
 Well it's easy to understand song 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.450
 That song is not included but it is a rock album A guitar album like that with my personality 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.200
 is there 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.020
 For example, the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:27.750
 Compact is given more and more a layer of that guitar or was a guitar solo 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:31.360
 The atmosphere of such a rock like building a music 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.690
 I hope that it will be a drifting instrumental album 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.290
 Nice to meet you, as a result I think that the world of what I want to aim for could not be reached 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.290
 think 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.810
 Well Well basically 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:56.690
 Well that it had Well first solo album guitar solo album 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.420
 Outside of the person and if you mogul more and more Toka he is not peel off session came made with Hey hat 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.450
 How to walk 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.860
 Tetsuno Tetsuo from the beginning to the end 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:09.630
 The other time I'd think it was Which one also select or make your own alone 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.710
 After all to put out love in the first thing 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.540
 To the music play mix 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.580
 I will try it all by myself this time in my home studio 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.490
 Oh dear 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:29.500
 I am making the sound around the amp simulator with almost no amp 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.760
 I could catch up with the guitar sound all the time because there was a home environment 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.760
 I think it was an album 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:45.950
 Well Well, I used the main one to accommodate even the pillows 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:51.260
 There is my model of a total of 4 guitar brand Sago, but it is 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:54.720
 I am using it for about 70% Main line is the same as the pillow 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.380
 This is in the middle of the day coding with the main guitar 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.670
 Hmm 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.960
 And we have guitar called rutile here anymore my 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.290
 I made a guitar called rutile because I gave this album the title "Exhibit Chiru". 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.069
 Ask me if you will 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.069
 me 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.630
 Good Very balanced Ee' 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.290
 It is correct to have you make a hearing 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.840
 As a request, the basic line is the same as Chaos 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.380
 Mail order backing 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.650
 Though shape is jazz master type 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.850
 I wonder if slightly smaller it also usually of jazz 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.319
 At once 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.980
 My 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.519
 With a coil tap function is a necessary program in and it becomes odd type 9 to single 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.840
 say 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:47.460
 This I Well this is was using the main cut of coding 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.910
 If it comes up from the second half , it becomes main here 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.920
 Well really this guitar is also a feature 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:58.480
 I have a processing that is aiming for the neck of Thermo Wood processing 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.880
 This is another weakness of this 6 kita 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.980
 [musics] 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.250
 Uu 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.240
 9 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.190
 It is said that tompa per fret is among the 56 cases 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.280
 very 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.019
 It's fun to pull out what I heard 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.690
 Even if I think that a leader has been created, the universe 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.270
 With that teak 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.860
 In order to do various layers with the k element center in mind with k element center 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.290
 Stratocaster 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.610
 mustang 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.090
 Low line 6 needle ax 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:38.620
 After the acoustic guitar that kind of various guitar 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.620
 It feels like you made the world of that Otsuizu while letting it blend 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.349
 Well Well 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:56.199
 It has been a long time since I was released 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:05:02.660
 eleven rack Prepare this at the center of the sound makeup 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:06.390
 It's a so-called amp simulator, but it's the most realistic I think 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.910
 Playing the guitar and pretty husband 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.500
 Real and 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:16.980
 It says that it should not come out 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 In the center Well there because I received feeling in the guitar sound make-to-mer modeling 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:24.430
 Is a little from my guitar style 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:29.560
 Surprising might be but I Toka is the drive channel Soldado of 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.760
 In clean marshall it was originally my main amp for that minute 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.889
 Because there is no orange 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.719
 Oh dear 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:41.879
 I did not need to look like this, but this time modeling the amplifier in various sound make 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:45.289
 What part of the farthest edge I have never used this folder's actual while selecting 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:49.000
 And I went into the drive gas very concerned but I was 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:52.590
 The drive of the plate spoon is that 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.120
 Don't grab the compact effector 's amp's 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:06:01.440
 I have made a that worked sound by the head of the section of the drive 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:06.240
 Well after that miking in that modeling 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:13.199
 Well, that 's because there are characters that sound quite a bit 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:17.849
 It is kind of viking or kind of mike according to the music It is basically writing it 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:22.770
 Make the core sound of a guitar with eleven rack and put it 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:26.260
 quality goods system of the effect, in I protools 10 or not 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.560
 Retained space system is all created by plugin 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.560
 is 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:40.150
 Well that's right after saying that aloud , after releasing album au 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.560
 I'm going to do an instrumental live at the timing 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:48.190
 Oh dear 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:49.090
 Since it is a work made by myself only with such a guitar, what kind of form do you live? 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.160
 various 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:56.860
 I'm thinking about it now, but I think it's ok to have a little fun looking for a title 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:02.830
 I'm thinking of doing something interesting 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:06.370
 If you think that by all means want to come to play if there is an opportunity that can come in rather watch 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:10.719
 Live is December 27th 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:13.110
 Because we'll do in the way of defense Yano Tower Records to come to us to play those who can come a if 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:13.110
 Please give me 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:22.220
 Everyone who looks at the guitar radar 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:28.070
 That I'm going to the list to learn who was miscellaneous expenses rose 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:34.820
 From the position a little bit of a challenge this time to make the guitar main 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:39.340
 And very real big challenge up with their own, which I tried to make the work even its result 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:45.430
 I think that I could make a work that I could be satisfied with myself 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:46.860
 If you are a rock band guitarist, let's have a look forward to hearing that the edition has come down 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.810
 please 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.110
