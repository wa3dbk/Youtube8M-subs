00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
questions are being raised about the

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.550 
questions are being raised about the
impact<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.310> aviation<00:00:02.850> on<00:00:02.939> our<00:00:03.149> environment

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
impact of aviation on our environment

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.230 
impact of aviation on our environment
their<00:00:04.560> traffic<00:00:04.980> levels<00:00:05.160> are<00:00:05.490> expected<00:00:05.730> to

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
their traffic levels are expected to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.780 
their traffic levels are expected to
double<00:00:06.450> in<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.870> next<00:00:07.020> 15<00:00:07.560> years<00:00:07.589> if<00:00:08.370> nothing

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
double in the next 15 years if nothing

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.480 

yells<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> problem<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.800> solve<00:00:28.950> in<00:00:29.100> 24

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490

hours<00:00:29.750> what's<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> most<00:00:31.080> inefficient<00:00:31.380> part

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
hours what's the most inefficient part

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.610 
hours what's the most inefficient part
of<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.220> flight<00:00:32.460> ah<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:33.720> its<00:00:34.200> aircraft

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of a flight ah I know its aircraft

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.490 
of a flight ah I know its aircraft
action<00:00:35.250> why<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.630> airplanes<00:00:37.230> are

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
action why is that because airplanes are

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.620 
action why is that because airplanes are
not<00:00:37.770> made<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.310> ground<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.760> engines

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
not made to be on the ground and engines

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.500 
not made to be on the ground and engines
neener<00:00:39.930> oh<00:00:40.260> yes<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.220> just<00:00:41.430> remember<00:00:42.030> actually

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
neener oh yes I just remember actually

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.990 
neener oh yes I just remember actually
six<00:00:43.080> percent<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> fuel<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.520> burned<00:00:44.820> on

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
six percent of the fuel is burned on

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.990 
six percent of the fuel is burned on
ground<00:00:45.239> operation<00:00:45.900> mmhmm<00:00:46.620> yeah<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.430> fuel

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
ground operation mmhmm yeah and fuel

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.450 
ground operation mmhmm yeah and fuel
account<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.690> forty-five<00:00:49.650> percent<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
account for forty-five percent of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.720 
account for forty-five percent of
airline<00:00:50.970> cause<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.320> long<00:00:52.590> well<00:00:53.550> done

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
airline cause that's not long well done

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.140 
airline cause that's not long well done
girls<00:00:53.970> so<00:00:54.300> let's<00:00:54.510> focus<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.890> it

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
girls so let's focus on that that's it

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.270 
girls so let's focus on that that's it
so<00:00:57.150> what<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.900> we<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> improve<00:00:58.559> aircraft

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so what can we do to improve aircraft

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:21.789 
so what can we do to improve aircraft
run<00:00:59.400> operations<00:00:59.940> let's<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:18.680> yes<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:20.190> it

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
run operations let's think yes that's it

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
run operations let's think yes that's it
renewable<00:01:22.799> energy<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.610> transferred<00:01:23.940> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
renewable energy can be transferred to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.510 
renewable energy can be transferred to
the<00:01:24.510> we<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.810> system<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> ground<00:01:25.830> through<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the we go system at the ground through a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.340 
the we go system at the ground through a
magnetic<00:01:26.820> induction<00:01:27.180> energy<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.170> then

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
magnetic induction energy is then

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.350 
magnetic induction energy is then
transferred<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.220> ricoh<00:01:29.579> system<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
transferred to the ricoh system on the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.719 
transferred to the ricoh system on the
plane<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.289> placed<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.950> between<00:01:31.979> wheels

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.420 

another<00:01:35.729> plane<00:01:36.090> ready<00:01:36.719> for<00:01:36.810> take<00:01:37.020> off<00:01:40.430> yeah

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
another plane ready for take off yeah

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.490 
another plane ready for take off yeah
but<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:42.119> are<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> benefits<00:01:42.539> for<00:01:42.990> industry

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
but what are the benefits for industry

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.940 
but what are the benefits for industry
there<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.009> plenty<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.490> benefits<00:01:45.229> we<00:01:46.229> go<00:01:46.409> we'll

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
there are plenty of benefits we go we'll

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.609 
there are plenty of benefits we go we'll
make<00:01:47.130> deviation<00:01:47.640> industry<00:01:48.119> greener<00:01:48.630> safer

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
make deviation industry greener safer

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.660 
make deviation industry greener safer
and<00:01:50.189> more<00:01:50.520> efficient<00:01:51.000> by<00:01:52.189> providing<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.399> fully

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
and more efficient by providing a fully

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.719 
and more efficient by providing a fully
electric<00:01:54.270> aircraft<00:01:54.539> taxing<00:01:55.289> co2<00:01:56.189> emission

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
electric aircraft taxing co2 emission

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.719 
electric aircraft taxing co2 emission
will<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.030> reduced<00:01:57.329> by<00:01:57.539> seventy<00:01:57.990> percent<00:01:58.729> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
will be reduced by seventy percent and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.940 
will be reduced by seventy percent and
we<00:01:59.939> will<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.270> less<00:02:00.479> noise<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.020> airport<00:02:01.530> with

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
we will have less noise the airport with

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.160 
we will have less noise the airport with
no<00:02:02.100> engines<00:02:02.640> running<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> ground<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.990> go

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
no engines running on the ground we go

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.560 
no engines running on the ground we go
can<00:02:04.380> achieve<00:02:04.740> improve<00:02:05.490> safety<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> apron

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
can achieve improve safety at the apron

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.280 
can achieve improve safety at the apron
and<00:02:06.780> you'd<00:02:07.469> use<00:02:07.649> foreign<00:02:08.070> object<00:02:08.670> damage

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
and you'd use foreign object damage

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.899 
and you'd use foreign object damage
we<00:02:11.290> go<00:02:11.470> animals<00:02:12.010> could<00:02:12.190> say<00:02:12.370> for<00:02:12.580> around<00:02:12.760> two
