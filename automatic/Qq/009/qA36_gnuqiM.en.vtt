the North Star just you know get

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.880 
the North Star just you know get
inspiration<00:00:44.760> from<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.680> kind<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
inspiration from that so it's kind of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.880 
inspiration from that so it's kind of
like<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.160> nice<00:00:50.399> African<00:00:51.210> rhythm<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> was

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
like this nice African rhythm that I was

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.220 
like this nice African rhythm that I was
introduced<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:54.059> while<00:00:54.510> back<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> thought

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
introduced to a while back and I thought

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.779 
introduced to a while back and I thought
it'd<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.410> nice<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.920> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
it'd be nice to kind of have that as a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.709 
it'd be nice to kind of have that as a
counter<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:58.140> another<00:00:59.090> sound<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.629> was

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
counter to another sound that was

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.680 
counter to another sound that was
actually<00:01:01.050> playing<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.410> three<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.149> I<00:01:03.149> decided

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
actually playing in three and I decided

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.410 
actually playing in three and I decided
to<00:01:03.809> give<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.500> sound<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> piano<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
to give that sound to the piano so that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.780 
to give that sound to the piano so that
I<00:01:06.540> could<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.200> fun

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.430 

the<00:01:14.790> most<00:01:15.000> complex<00:01:15.480> part<00:01:15.780> about<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.200> song

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
the most complex part about the song

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.710 
the most complex part about the song
it's<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.520> counter<00:01:17.880> line<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> base<00:01:18.540> is

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it's the counter line at the base is

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600 
it's the counter line at the base is
actually<00:01:18.870> planned<00:01:19.350> because<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.220> piano<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
actually planned because the piano is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.490 
actually planned because the piano is
playing<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.000> threes<00:01:21.300> is<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.990> two<00:01:22.230> three

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
playing in threes is that one two three

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.570 
playing in threes is that one two three
one<00:01:22.830> two<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.250> two

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.390 

when<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.300> baseline<00:01:27.780> comes<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.410> it's<00:01:29.160> not

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
when the baseline comes in it's not

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
when the baseline comes in it's not
playing<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.940> fool<00:01:30.120> like<00:01:30.480> boom<00:01:30.720> boo-boom

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
playing the fool like boom boo-boom

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
only playing like the first accent of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.290 
only playing like the first accent of
each<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.320> boom<00:01:37.620> boom<00:01:37.890> boom<00:01:38.640> boom

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
boom boom boom it's kind of a challenge

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.050 
boom boom boom it's kind of a challenge
to<00:01:45.360> mentally<00:01:46.260> block<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.550> piano<00:01:47.850> is

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
to mentally block out that the piano is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
to mentally block out that the piano is
playing<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.480> three<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.650> only<00:01:49.830> reference

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
playing in three and to only reference

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.980 
playing in three and to only reference
the<00:01:50.490> bass<00:01:50.700> part<00:01:56.120> for<00:01:57.120> me<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.840> most

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the bass part for me that was the most

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.940 
the bass part for me that was the most
difficult<00:01:58.110> part<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.680> was<00:01:58.800> actually

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
difficult part when I was actually

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.650 
difficult part when I was actually
writing<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.460> song<00:01:59.670> where<00:02:00.120> writing<00:02:00.450> was

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
writing a song where writing was

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.240 
writing a song where writing was
actually<00:02:01.050> easier<00:02:01.470> than<00:02:01.650> actually<00:02:01.800> playing

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
actually easier than actually playing

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.960 
actually easier than actually playing
but<00:02:03.150> hopefully<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> have
