hi this is Sean with go-stop today we're
going<00:00:07.060> to<00:00:07.149> talk<00:00:07.359> about<00:00:07.540> the<00:00:07.839> full-spectrum

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
going to talk about the full-spectrum

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.520 
going to talk about the full-spectrum
cameras<00:00:09.280> and<00:00:09.460> camcorders<00:00:09.700> and<00:00:10.290> any<00:00:11.290> of<00:00:11.440> the

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
cameras and camcorders and any of the

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.350 
cameras and camcorders and any of the
lighting<00:00:11.799> configurations<00:00:12.549> you<00:00:12.760> can<00:00:12.969> use<00:00:13.180> to

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
lighting configurations you can use to

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.670 
lighting configurations you can use to
go<00:00:13.480> along<00:00:13.719> with<00:00:13.750> them<00:00:14.170> whether<00:00:14.379> it<00:00:14.559> be

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
go along with them whether it be

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.490 
go along with them whether it be
infrared<00:00:15.279> full-spectrum<00:00:15.910> and<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
infrared full-spectrum and the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.890 
infrared full-spectrum and the
differences<00:00:18.039> between<00:00:18.250> them<00:00:18.789> so<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:19.750> we're

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
differences between them so and we're

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.320 
differences between them so and we're
also<00:00:20.050> going<00:00:20.290> to<00:00:20.380> show<00:00:20.590> you<00:00:20.940> what<00:00:21.940> they<00:00:22.090> look

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
also going to show you what they look

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.050 
also going to show you what they look
like<00:00:22.390> and<00:00:22.930> which<00:00:23.110> lights<00:00:23.440> are<00:00:24.250> better<00:00:24.640> off<00:00:24.850> for

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
like and which lights are better off for

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.820 
like and which lights are better off for
the<00:00:25.180> setup<00:00:25.420> you're<00:00:25.750> probably<00:00:26.050> looking<00:00:26.590> for

opcom and before we get started with the
lighting<00:00:38.680> I<00:00:38.770> just<00:00:38.980> wanted<00:00:39.160> to<00:00:39.250> show<00:00:39.400> what<00:00:39.550> the

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
lighting I just wanted to show what the

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.100 
lighting I just wanted to show what the
full<00:00:39.790> spectrum<00:00:40.090> typically<00:00:40.720> looks<00:00:40.930> like

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
full spectrum typically looks like

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.270 
full spectrum typically looks like
outside<00:00:42.810> that<00:00:43.810> pink.you<00:00:44.200> comes<00:00:44.770> from<00:00:45.070> the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
outside that pink.you comes from the

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.639 
outside that pink.you comes from the
ultraviolet<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.329> infrared<00:00:46.649> together

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
ultraviolet and the infrared together

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.260 
ultraviolet and the infrared together
coming<00:00:47.980> into<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.520> lens<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.820> right<00:00:51.970> now<00:00:52.090> we're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
coming into the lens all right now we're

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.880 
coming into the lens all right now we're
inside<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.780> do<00:00:52.930> some<00:00:53.200> lighting

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
inside to do some lighting

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.470 
inside to do some lighting
demonstrations<00:00:54.730> so<00:00:54.969> you<00:00:55.059> can<00:00:55.210> see<00:00:55.360> the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
demonstrations so you can see the

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.120 
demonstrations so you can see the
difference<00:00:55.809> between<00:00:56.170> all<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:57.100> different

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
difference between all the different

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.830 
difference between all the different
lights<00:00:57.640> in<00:00:57.910> combination<00:00:58.510> with<00:00:58.690> the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
lights in combination with the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.600 
lights in combination with the

that you can only get at Ghost opcom

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.499 
that you can only get at Ghost opcom
we're<00:01:08.350> going<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.590> test<00:01:08.829> some<00:01:09.130> infrareds<00:01:09.850> full

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
we're going to test some infrareds full

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.300 
we're going to test some infrareds full
spectrums<00:01:11.109> all<00:01:11.350> different<00:01:11.679> types<00:01:11.889> of<00:01:12.069> lights

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
spectrums all different types of lights

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.889 
spectrums all different types of lights
so<00:01:12.579> you<00:01:12.609> can<00:01:12.759> see<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.329> differences<00:01:13.749> between

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
so you can see the differences between

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.410 
so you can see the differences between
them<00:01:14.350> all<00:01:14.499> on<00:01:14.649> this<00:01:14.799> side<00:01:14.859> which<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.759> best<00:01:16.149> for

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
them all on this side which is best for

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
them all on this side which is best for
you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.730 
you
basically<00:01:18.340> what<00:01:18.639> you're<00:01:18.759> seeing<00:01:19.090> now<00:01:19.329> is<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
basically what you're seeing now is the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.599 
basically what you're seeing now is the
full-spectrum<00:01:22.109> camcorder<00:01:23.429> with<00:01:24.429> the

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
full-spectrum camcorder with the

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.639 
full-spectrum camcorder with the
overhead<00:01:25.209> light<00:01:25.450> on<00:01:25.689> in<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.109> office<00:01:26.229> here

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
overhead light on in the office here

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.639 
overhead light on in the office here
it's<00:01:26.799> a<00:01:26.950> fluorescent<00:01:27.939> light<00:01:28.060> so<00:01:28.389> a<00:01:28.719> lot<00:01:29.469> of<00:01:29.499> the

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
it's a fluorescent light so a lot of the

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.050 
it's a fluorescent light so a lot of the
questions<00:01:30.009> that<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.189> get<00:01:30.279> from<00:01:30.490> people<00:01:30.579> are

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
questions that I get from people are

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.029 
questions that I get from people are
when<00:01:31.659> they<00:01:31.749> get<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.049> camcorder<00:01:32.469> they<00:01:32.799> say

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
when they get the camcorder they say

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.449 
when they get the camcorder they say
occasionally<00:01:34.349> hey<00:01:35.349> this<00:01:35.679> looks<00:01:35.859> it<00:01:36.369> looks

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
occasionally hey this looks it looks

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:37.830 
occasionally hey this looks it looks
normal<00:01:36.909> I<00:01:36.969> thought<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.240> was<00:01:37.329> supposed<00:01:37.569> to<00:01:37.630> look

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
normal I thought it was supposed to look

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.089 
normal I thought it was supposed to look
pink<00:01:38.170> well<00:01:38.380> what's<00:01:38.560> happening<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.039> this

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
pink well what's happening in this

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.739 
pink well what's happening in this
particular<00:01:39.279> case<00:01:39.759> especially<00:01:40.359> with<00:01:40.539> the

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
particular case especially with the

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:44.249 
particular case especially with the
fluorescent<00:01:41.740> bulb<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.270> any<00:01:43.270> energy-saving

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
fluorescent bulb and any energy-saving

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.749 
fluorescent bulb and any energy-saving
bulbs<00:01:44.439> that<00:01:44.679> are<00:01:44.799> out<00:01:44.979> there<00:01:45.219> on<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.459> market

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
bulbs that are out there on the market

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.319 
bulbs that are out there on the market
these<00:01:45.880> days<00:01:45.959> the<00:01:46.959> reason<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.619> way<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:48.039> they

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
these days the reason the way that they

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.760 
these days the reason the way that they
the<00:01:49.329> way<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.659> they<00:01:49.779> save<00:01:50.079> energy<00:01:50.349> is

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
the way that they save energy is

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.249 
the way that they save energy is
basically<00:01:50.950> by<00:01:51.639> removing<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.419> infrared<00:01:53.020> and

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
basically by removing the infrared and

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.769 
basically by removing the infrared and
ultraviolet<00:01:53.859> so<00:01:54.279> it's<00:01:54.819> only<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.359> lights<00:01:55.599> are

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
ultraviolet so it's only the lights are

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.929 
ultraviolet so it's only the lights are
only<00:01:55.959> projecting<00:01:56.679> visible<00:01:57.159> light<00:01:57.340> that's<00:01:57.669> the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
only projecting visible light that's the

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.239 
only projecting visible light that's the
way<00:01:58.060> they<00:01:58.270> save<00:01:58.539> energy<00:01:58.810> they're<00:01:59.709> not<00:01:59.889> putting

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:00.249 
way they save energy they're not putting

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.459 
way they save energy they're not putting
out<00:02:00.369> infrared<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.090> UV<00:02:01.119> like<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.779> old<00:02:01.989> bulbs

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
out infrared and UV like the old bulbs

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.699 
out infrared and UV like the old bulbs
so<00:02:03.159> they're<00:02:03.789> able<00:02:04.149> to<00:02:04.329> save<00:02:04.630> energy<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.289> cost

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
so they're able to save energy and cost

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.460 
so they're able to save energy and cost
that<00:02:05.979> way<00:02:06.359> another<00:02:07.359> thing<00:02:07.539> about<00:02:07.630> this<00:02:07.840> these

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
that way another thing about this these

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.820 
that way another thing about this these
camcorders<00:02:09.099> first<00:02:09.729> off<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.630> aperture<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
camcorders first off is the aperture the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.710 
camcorders first off is the aperture the
aperture<00:02:12.250> on<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> camera<00:02:12.820> is<00:02:12.940> essentially<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
aperture on a camera is essentially the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.100 
aperture on a camera is essentially the
it's<00:02:14.380> like<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.710> pupil<00:02:15.130> in<00:02:15.280> your<00:02:15.400> eyeball

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
it's like the pupil in your eyeball

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.070 
it's like the pupil in your eyeball
it<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.580> open<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.180> close<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.780> allow

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
it you can open and close it to allow

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.890 
it you can open and close it to allow
more<00:02:19.470> or<00:02:19.740> less<00:02:20.430> light<00:02:20.790> into<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.300> camera<00:02:21.690> right

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
more or less light into the camera right

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.190 
more or less light into the camera right
now<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.350> set<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.890> default<00:02:23.370> setting<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
now it's set on the default setting and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.540 
now it's set on the default setting and
you<00:02:25.200> can<00:02:25.410> open<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.890> up<00:02:26.010> I'm<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.310> go<00:02:26.460> ahead

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
you can open it up I'm going to go ahead

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.240 
you can open it up I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:26.820> open<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.510> aperture<00:02:28.380> here<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.070> can

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
and open up the aperture here so you can

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.030 
and open up the aperture here so you can
see<00:02:29.840> see<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.990> difference<00:02:31.380> now<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.830> see

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
see see the difference now you can see

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.980 
see see the difference now you can see
we're<00:02:32.280> allowing<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.790> lot<00:02:33.090> more<00:02:33.360> light<00:02:33.570> into<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
we're allowing a lot more light into the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.540 
we're allowing a lot more light into the
lens<00:02:34.170> which<00:02:34.380> gives<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> much<00:02:35.280> brighter

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
lens which gives you a much brighter

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.030 
lens which gives you a much brighter
picture<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:37.110> what<00:02:37.290> we're<00:02:37.410> going<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.680> now

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
picture so what we're going to do now

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.190 
picture so what we're going to do now
I'm<00:02:38.490> going<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.700> turn<00:02:38.820> off<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.090> lights<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.600> you

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
I'm going to turn off the lights and you

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.600 
I'm going to turn off the lights and you
can<00:02:40.230> see<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.890> difference<00:02:41.310> we're<00:02:41.430> going<00:02:41.550> to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
can see the difference we're going to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.420 
can see the difference we're going to
start<00:02:41.850> off<00:02:41.970> with<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.300> infrared<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> here<00:02:44.250> goes

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
start off with the infrared so here goes

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.640 
start off with the infrared so here goes
the<00:02:44.610> light<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:45.870> virtually<00:02:46.140> pitch-black

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the light and it's virtually pitch-black

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.270 
the light and it's virtually pitch-black
in<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:48.360> can't<00:02:49.020> even<00:02:49.080> see<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.410> hand<00:02:50.070> in

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
in here I can't even see the hand in

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.370 
in here I can't even see the hand in
front<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.550> my<00:02:50.640> face<00:02:50.850> here<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.959> I'm<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> go

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
front of my face here so I'm going to go

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.070 
front of my face here so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.680> kick<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.270> infrared<00:02:54.270> light<00:02:54.480> now

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
ahead and kick on the infrared light now

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.360 
ahead and kick on the infrared light now
this<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.650> phantom<00:02:56.100> infrared<00:02:57.090> light<00:02:58.370> this

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
this is the phantom infrared light this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.020 
this is the phantom infrared light this
is<00:02:59.640> got<00:03:01.670> 25<00:03:02.670> infrared<00:03:03.660> LEDs<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:05.030> I'm

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
is got 25 infrared LEDs on it and I'm

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.729 
is got 25 infrared LEDs on it and I'm
going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.330> pan<00:03:06.660> around<00:03:06.900> here<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.470> can

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
going to just pan around here so you can

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.060 
going to just pan around here so you can
see<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.510> rest<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.020> room<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.530> various

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
see the rest of the room and various

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.290 
see the rest of the room and various
distances<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.170> at<00:03:13.410> roughly<00:03:13.920> about<00:03:14.100> the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
distances this is at roughly about the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.260 
distances this is at roughly about the
16<00:03:15.300> 17<00:03:15.720> feet<00:03:16.290> something<00:03:16.739> like<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.270> again

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
16 17 feet something like that again

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.580 
16 17 feet something like that again
with<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> phantom<00:03:19.320> infrared<00:03:19.980> light<00:03:20.220> only<00:03:21.590> I'm

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
with the phantom infrared light only I'm

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.860 
with the phantom infrared light only I'm
going<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.830> switch<00:03:23.040> over<00:03:23.220> now<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:25.760> phantom

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
going to switch over now to the phantom

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.330 
going to switch over now to the phantom
infrared<00:03:27.870> Pro<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:28.980> is<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.630> IR<00:03:30.630> Pro<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:32.190> only

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
infrared Pro this is the IR Pro the only

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.070 
infrared Pro this is the IR Pro the only
difference<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.239> pretty<00:03:33.540> much<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.959> like

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
difference this is pretty much just like

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.140 
difference this is pretty much just like
the<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.739> other<00:03:34.920> phantom<00:03:35.430> light<00:03:35.610> except<00:03:36.060> it

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
the the other phantom light except it

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.780 
the the other phantom light except it
actually<00:03:36.480> has<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.980> diffusion<00:03:37.980> lens<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
actually has a diffusion lens on the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.360 
actually has a diffusion lens on the
front<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.420> lot<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> other

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
front of it like a lot of the other

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.710 
front of it like a lot of the other
standard<00:03:41.370> infrared<00:03:41.820> lights<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.209> see<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.540> the

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
standard infrared lights you see on the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.110 
standard infrared lights you see on the
on<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.410> market<00:03:43.769> it's<00:03:43.920> got<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.100> red<00:03:44.400> diffusion

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
on the market it's got a red diffusion

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360 
on the market it's got a red diffusion
lens<00:03:46.080> on<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> front<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:46.830> basically

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
lens on the front of it that basically

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.750 
lens on the front of it that basically
takes<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.110> infrared<00:03:49.110> light<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.620> diffuses<00:03:50.610> it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
takes the infrared light and diffuses it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.789 
takes the infrared light and diffuses it
a<00:03:50.820> little<00:03:51.000> bit<00:03:51.209> further<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:52.019> fills<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.769> the

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
a little bit further so it fills in the

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.910 
a little bit further so it fills in the
picture<00:03:53.540> more<00:03:54.540> widely<00:03:54.810> hand<00:03:55.350> with<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> little

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
picture more widely hand with a little

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.250 
picture more widely hand with a little
bit<00:03:56.040> more<00:03:56.250> light<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.720> I'm<00:03:57.989> gonna<00:03:58.080> go<00:03:58.170> ahead

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
bit more light and I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.020 
bit more light and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:03:58.610> pan<00:03:59.610> back<00:03:59.910> over<00:04:00.840> here<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:01.410> can<00:04:01.560> gauge

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
and pan back over here so you can gauge

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.870 
and pan back over here so you can gauge
various<00:04:03.030> distances<00:04:03.420> again<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.519> this<00:04:05.519> is<00:04:05.700> at

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
various distances again and this is at

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.360 
various distances again and this is at
roughly<00:04:06.209> ten<00:04:06.570> feet<00:04:08.390> now<00:04:09.620> what<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.650> typically<00:04:11.160> do

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
roughly ten feet now what I typically do

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.180 
roughly ten feet now what I typically do
on<00:04:11.610> this<00:04:11.790> particular<00:04:12.239> bracket<00:04:12.930> with<00:04:13.680> phantom

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
on this particular bracket with phantom

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.729 
on this particular bracket with phantom
you<00:04:15.060> can<00:04:15.209> have<00:04:15.420> two<00:04:15.690> lights<00:04:15.959> on<00:04:16.169> this<00:04:16.320> on<00:04:16.650> the

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
you can have two lights on this on the

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.159 
you can have two lights on this on the
single<00:04:17.070> bracket<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.549> with<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.510> camcorder<00:04:19.079> in

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
single bracket and with the camcorder in

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.539 
single bracket and with the camcorder in
the<00:04:19.290> center<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.799> that's<00:04:19.890> how<00:04:20.100> I<00:04:20.130> have<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.430> set

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
the center and that's how I have it set

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.150 
the center and that's how I have it set
up<00:04:20.729> right<00:04:21.000> now<00:04:21.150> so<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:22.830> can<00:04:22.979> use

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
up right now so that you can use

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.980 
up right now so that you can use
multiple<00:04:23.669> lights<00:04:23.850> at<00:04:24.060> once<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:24.570> I'm<00:04:24.810> going<00:04:24.930> to

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
multiple lights at once so I'm going to

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.930 
multiple lights at once so I'm going to
kick<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.260> on<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.740> with<00:04:26.039> two<00:04:26.370> infrareds

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
kick it on this is with two infrareds

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.750 
kick it on this is with two infrareds
this<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.450> infrared

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
this is the infrared

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.370 
this is the infrared
standard<00:04:29.360> phantom<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:31.300> addition<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.750> IR

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
standard phantom in addition to the IR

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.770 
standard phantom in addition to the IR
Pro<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:35.440> can<00:04:36.440> see<00:04:36.710> that<00:04:36.890> you<00:04:37.040> get<00:04:37.780> good

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
Pro and you can see that you get good

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.350 
Pro and you can see that you get good
amount<00:04:39.230> of<00:04:39.350> light<00:04:39.850> coming<00:04:40.850> through

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
amount of light coming through

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.970 
amount of light coming through
especially<00:04:42.050> when<00:04:42.170> you<00:04:42.290> open<00:04:42.530> up<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.740> aperture

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980

on<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.310> camcorder<00:04:44.440> now<00:04:45.440> we're<00:04:45.560> going<00:04:45.650> to

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
on the camcorder now we're going to

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.160 
on the camcorder now we're going to
switch<00:04:45.860> over<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.310> full<00:04:46.520> spectrums<00:04:49.990> now<00:04:50.990> this

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
switch over the full spectrums now this

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.960 
switch over the full spectrums now this
is<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.470> same<00:04:51.680> view<00:04:51.950> with<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.250> phantom<00:04:52.700> full

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
is the same view with the phantom full

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.510 
is the same view with the phantom full
spectrum<00:04:53.450> light<00:04:53.630> this<00:04:53.870> is<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.080> new<00:04:54.520> full

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
spectrum light this is the new full

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.090 
spectrum light this is the new full
spectrum<00:04:56.030> called<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:56.480> fsx<00:04:57.050> which<00:04:57.740> has<00:04:57.950> an

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
spectrum called the fsx which has an

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.750 
spectrum called the fsx which has an
additional<00:04:58.640> row<00:04:58.850> of<00:04:59.150> infrared<00:05:00.280> LED<00:05:01.280> so<00:05:01.580> it's

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
additional row of infrared LED so it's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.870 
additional row of infrared LED so it's
got<00:05:01.940> 10<00:05:02.210> IR<00:05:02.810> LEDs<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.650> has<00:05:04.130> some<00:05:04.370> ultraviolet

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
got 10 IR LEDs it has some ultraviolet

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.330 
got 10 IR LEDs it has some ultraviolet
light<00:05:05.270> and<00:05:05.510> visible<00:05:06.440> light<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.890> form<00:05:07.160> of

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
light and visible light in the form of

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.340 
light and visible light in the form of
red<00:05:08.240> green<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.930> blue<00:05:09.350> lights<00:05:10.310> on<00:05:10.550> it<00:05:10.700> so<00:05:11.360> what

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
red green and blue lights on it so what

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.690 
red green and blue lights on it so what
you're<00:05:12.590> seeing<00:05:12.800> with<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.160> naked<00:05:13.370> eye<00:05:13.640> is

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
you're seeing with the naked eye is

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.840 
you're seeing with the naked eye is
basically<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.720> very<00:05:15.080> dull<00:05:15.590> blue<00:05:16.130> light<00:05:16.490> in<00:05:16.700> the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
basically a very dull blue light in the

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.060 
basically a very dull blue light in the
room<00:05:17.030> so<00:05:17.720> it's<00:05:17.840> very<00:05:18.020> non-obtrusive

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
room so it's very non-obtrusive

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.050 
room so it's very non-obtrusive
during<00:05:19.400> investigations<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:22.550> that's<00:05:22.760> the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
during investigations so that's the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.060 
during investigations so that's the
Phantom<00:05:23.750> full<00:05:23.960> spectrum<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:24.680> then<00:05:24.830> I'm<00:05:24.950> going

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
Phantom full spectrum and then I'm going

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.670 
Phantom full spectrum and then I'm going
to<00:05:25.100> show<00:05:25.430> you<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:26.540> setup<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:26.960> I<00:05:27.140> typically

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
to show you the setup that I typically

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.280 
to show you the setup that I typically
use<00:05:27.800> which<00:05:28.280> is<00:05:28.490> essentially<00:05:29.090> this<00:05:29.330> with<00:05:30.050> the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
use which is essentially this with the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.100 
use which is essentially this with the
addition<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.760> IR<00:05:32.090> Pro<00:05:32.300> let<00:05:32.480> me<00:05:32.540> pan<00:05:32.810> here

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
addition of the IR Pro let me pan here

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.920 
addition of the IR Pro let me pan here
real<00:05:33.350> quick<00:05:33.620> just<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:34.640> can<00:05:34.880> see<00:05:35.390> back<00:05:35.600> over

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
real quick just so you can see back over

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.360 
real quick just so you can see back over
here<00:05:36.320> with<00:05:37.010> the<00:05:37.160> full<00:05:37.340> spectrum<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:40.130> then<00:05:40.280> I'm

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
here with the full spectrum and then I'm

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.030 
here with the full spectrum and then I'm
going<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:40.550> turn<00:05:40.790> on<00:05:40.970> an<00:05:41.150> infrared<00:05:41.650> now<00:05:42.650> this<00:05:42.860> is

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
going to turn on an infrared now this is

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.820 
going to turn on an infrared now this is
the<00:05:43.190> typical<00:05:43.610> setup<00:05:43.850> that<00:05:44.090> I<00:05:44.150> use<00:05:44.620> which<00:05:45.620> is

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
the typical setup that I use which is

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.310 
the typical setup that I use which is
again<00:05:46.790> on<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:46.940> same<00:05:47.210> bracket<00:05:47.810> since<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.170> can

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
again on the same bracket since you can

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.110 
again on the same bracket since you can
fit<00:05:48.530> multiple<00:05:48.710> lights<00:05:49.160> on<00:05:49.310> one<00:05:49.490> bracket<00:05:49.790> I've

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
fit multiple lights on one bracket I've

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.590 
fit multiple lights on one bracket I've
got<00:05:50.900> a<00:05:50.930> full<00:05:51.260> spectrum<00:05:51.670> fsx<00:05:52.670> on<00:05:52.850> one<00:05:53.150> end<00:05:53.390> and

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
got a full spectrum fsx on one end and

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.380 
got a full spectrum fsx on one end and
an<00:05:54.320> infrared<00:05:54.710> on<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:55.190> Eldar<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:56.180> more

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
an infrared on the Eldar the more

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.150 
an infrared on the Eldar the more
infrareds<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:57.170> better<00:05:57.350> it<00:05:57.530> just<00:05:57.560> helps<00:05:57.980> with

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
infrareds the better it just helps with

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.570 
infrareds the better it just helps with
distance<00:05:59.030> and<00:05:59.210> such<00:05:59.500> so<00:06:00.500> again<00:06:00.980> this<00:06:01.160> is<00:06:01.370> the

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
distance and such so again this is the

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.350 
distance and such so again this is the
setup<00:06:02.060> that<00:06:02.330> I<00:06:02.390> usually<00:06:03.110> recommend<00:06:04.120> this<00:06:05.120> is

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
setup that I usually recommend this is

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.870 
setup that I usually recommend this is
the<00:06:05.660> again<00:06:06.260> a<00:06:06.320> full-spectrum<00:06:06.830> camcorder<00:06:07.340> with

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
the again a full-spectrum camcorder with

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.590 
the again a full-spectrum camcorder with
ghost<00:06:08.180> comm<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.850> different<00:06:10.850> combinations<00:06:11.420> of

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
ghost comm and different combinations of

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.750 
ghost comm and different combinations of
lights<00:06:11.840> that<00:06:11.960> you<00:06:12.080> can<00:06:12.320> use<00:06:12.530> you<00:06:13.340> can<00:06:13.460> get<00:06:13.580> more

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
lights that you can use you can get more
