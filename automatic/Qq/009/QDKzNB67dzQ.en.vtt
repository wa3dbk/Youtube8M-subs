00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.109

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.019

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.510
 second time and in March of this year how would 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.590
 perform talasa so who had 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.069
 well done 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.769
 and this is my trip to the ocean elsa literally 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.340
 it was December 3rd that is totally 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:11.110
 recently this concert impressed me 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:14.290
 tel that people people who they gathered 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.079
 so somehow were harmonious with each 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.810
 a friend they did not jostle they did not swear 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.340
 they did not smoke did not drink in the hall 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.530
 although maybe it was just 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.750
 forbidden but in all cases it was so 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.180
 friendly atmosphere and when everyone sang 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.470
 his songs raised their hands up 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.750
 let loose balls some lighters 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.580
 let on lyrical hits 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.960
 then it all looked like someone would say 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.000
 banal words flash mob 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.240
 but actually it seems to me that this 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.910
 just such a unison of the soul, so I 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.900
 also not left behind, so to speak 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.130
 Here I took such a Ukrainian flag in the role and 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.800
 waved them for almost 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.310
 of the whole concert, but in general in good 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.560
 I'm hanging here in this position 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.600
 because well curtains make me vertical 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.229
 so I hang as a rule like this 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.760
 so what else is he from his leader for example 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:14.860
 dress dress or and or blouse 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.979
 heel and confused, or just such coils 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.169
 and go out and tell everyone here look at 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.780
 me dress from ukrainian fado in 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.479
 general and still my passion is cups i 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.810
 I collect cups when I collect lighters 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.810
 someone matches I play a cup of that 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.880
 little that I have in Kiev 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.389
 it was the last one I brought from 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.740
 los angeles i was always buying 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:43.090

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.479
 between photo sessions with my girlfriend 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.539

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.120
 bought when I went to the Donbass Arena 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.919
 city ​​of Donetsk and in general I live there 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.229
 relatives and they tell me sashi 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.000
 they say you want to see the Donbass arena 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.889
 I enjoyed watching it 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.780
 my grand building is very 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.810
 impressed I am very glad that we have 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.700
 such beautiful buildings are already under construction and 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.460
 I really want to get here for the match, I think 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.050
 that the Euro 2012 without me will not work but 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.450
 I bought this cup in Minsk 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:22.190
