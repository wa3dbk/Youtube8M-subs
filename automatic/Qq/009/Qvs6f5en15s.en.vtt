00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
adapters to be able to screw onto most

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.320 
adapters to be able to screw onto most
lenses<00:00:15.960> most<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.529> them<00:00:16.650> don't<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.490> threads

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
lenses most of them don't have threads

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.930 
lenses most of them don't have threads
thick<00:00:18.750> enough<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.440> order<00:00:20.190> to<00:00:20.310> screw<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> lens

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
thick enough in order to screw the lens

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.910 
thick enough in order to screw the lens
on<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.690> the<00:00:21.840> first<00:00:22.020> thing<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.529> need<00:00:22.710> when

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
on so the first thing that you need when

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.439 
on so the first thing that you need when
you<00:00:23.039> get<00:00:23.220> an<00:00:23.310> LA<00:00:23.550> 7200<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:25.880> 72<00:00:26.880> millimeter

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
you get an LA 7200 is a 72 millimeter

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.859 
you get an LA 7200 is a 72 millimeter
filter<00:00:28.670> you<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.789> use<00:00:29.910> any<00:00:30.150> kind<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.510> filter

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
filter you can use any kind of filter

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.689 
filter you can use any kind of filter
that<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.230> want<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:32.099> you're<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.579> is

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
that you want what you're going to do is

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.639 
that you want what you're going to do is
you're<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> remove<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.780> glass<00:00:34.139> from

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
you're going to remove the glass from

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
you're going to remove the glass from
the<00:00:34.769> filter<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.339> basically<00:00:36.120> use<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.749> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the filter and basically use it as a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.110 
the filter and basically use it as a
spacer<00:00:37.379> now<00:00:37.979> if<00:00:38.280> you're<00:00:38.519> lucky<00:00:38.760> enough<00:00:38.909> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
spacer now if you're lucky enough to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.049 
spacer now if you're lucky enough to
find<00:00:39.269> a<00:00:39.870> step<00:00:40.319> ring<00:00:40.679> that<00:00:41.069> will<00:00:41.429> mount<00:00:41.760> your

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
find a step ring that will mount your

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
find a step ring that will mount your
lens<00:00:42.859> to<00:00:43.859> the<00:00:43.889> LA<00:00:44.190> 7200<00:00:44.879> without<00:00:45.179> that<00:00:46.219> it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
lens to the LA 7200 without that it's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.699 
lens to the LA 7200 without that it's
better<00:00:47.729> but<00:00:48.659> I<00:00:48.690> doubt<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:49.260> gonna<00:00:49.319> find<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:49.709 
better but I doubt you're gonna find a

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:52.879 
better but I doubt you're gonna find a
step<00:00:49.920> ring<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.280> will<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.519> that<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:52.589> reason

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:52.889 
step ring that will do that the reason

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:54.439 
step ring that will do that the reason
it<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.249> better<00:00:53.459> is<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.119> closer

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it would be better is that the closer

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.469 
it would be better is that the closer
the<00:00:54.690> Animorph<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.709> the<00:00:55.949> lens<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:57.269> better

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
the Animorph is to the lens the better

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.809 
the Animorph is to the lens the better
quality<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.170> you'll<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.589> the<00:00:59.249> closer<00:00:59.519> it<00:00:59.729> is

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
quality that you'll get the closer it is

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:01.519 
quality that you'll get the closer it is
to<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> back<00:01:00.209> the<00:01:00.569> wider<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.229> can<00:01:01.350> get

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:01.529 
to the back the wider that you can get

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:03.799 
to the back the wider that you can get
on<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.769> zoom<00:01:01.949> lens<00:01:02.209> so<00:01:03.209> with<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.479> way<00:01:03.569> that<00:01:03.749> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
on the zoom lens so with the way that I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.370 
on the zoom lens so with the way that I
have<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.290> set<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.040> now<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:05.969> 14<00:01:06.600> 140<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
have this set up now with my 14 140 is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.219 
have this set up now with my 14 140 is
that<00:01:08.219> I<00:01:08.250> need<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.390> least<00:01:09.539> 17

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that I need to go to at least 17

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.959 
that I need to go to at least 17
millimeter<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.219> be<00:01:11.310> able<00:01:11.399> to<00:01:11.520> get<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.820> any

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
millimeter to be able to get out any

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.660 
millimeter to be able to get out any
vinay<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> picture<00:01:13.109> now<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.369> me<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
vinay on the picture now for me that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
vinay on the picture now for me that
doesn't<00:01:14.850> matter<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.210> wouldn't<00:01:15.539> go<00:01:15.840> wider

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
doesn't matter I wouldn't go wider

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.840 
doesn't matter I wouldn't go wider
because<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.829> you<00:01:16.920> go<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> widest<00:01:17.640> setting

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
because if you go to the widest setting

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.510 
because if you go to the widest setting
you're<00:01:18.719> using<00:01:18.929> a<00:01:19.109> little<00:01:19.320> too<00:01:19.649> much<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you're using a little too much of the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
you're using a little too much of the
Animorph<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.359> get<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.140> bad

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
Animorph and you get really really bad

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.730 
Animorph and you get really really bad
fringing<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.780> Y<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> an<00:01:25.439> angle

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
fringing at that at that Y of an angle

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.319 
fringing at that at that Y of an angle
so<00:01:25.859> 17<00:01:26.340> millimeter<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.939> me<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> fine<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
so 17 millimeter for me is fine so I

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.730 
so 17 millimeter for me is fine so I
have<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> variety<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.310> Steph<00:01:32.310> ratings<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
have a variety of Steph ratings and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.190 
have a variety of Steph ratings and
basically<00:01:35.210> what<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
basically what you want to do is you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.580 
basically what you want to do is you
want<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.590> least<00:01:37.969> you<00:01:38.969> don't<00:01:39.090> want<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:40.289> step

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
want at least you don't want to do step

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.410 
want at least you don't want to do step
ring<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.920> step<00:01:41.159> rings<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> 62

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
ring on step rings so this is a 62

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
ring on step rings so this is a 62
millimeter<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.289> 72<00:01:43.679> millimeter<00:01:44.249> you<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.030> not

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
millimeter or 72 millimeter you do not

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.340 
millimeter or 72 millimeter you do not
want<00:01:45.539> to<00:01:46.969> keep<00:01:47.969> stepping<00:01:48.569> these<00:01:48.749> say<00:01:49.109> if<00:01:49.170> you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
want to keep stepping these say if you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.249 
want to keep stepping these say if you
have<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.979> 52<00:01:50.549> millimeter<00:01:50.999> prime<00:01:51.780> lens<00:01:52.049> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
have a 52 millimeter prime lens you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
have a 52 millimeter prime lens you
don't<00:01:52.439> want<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.710> keep<00:01:52.859> stepping<00:01:53.310> 52<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.999> 55<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
don't want to keep stepping 52 to 55 and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.440 
don't want to keep stepping 52 to 55 and
55<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> 62<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.399> will<00:01:56.520> take<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.819> too<00:01:57.030> far<00:01:57.060> away

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
55 to 62 that will take it too far away

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.879 
55 to 62 that will take it too far away
