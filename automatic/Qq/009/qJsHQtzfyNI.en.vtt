that the first key that you hit is

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.340 
that the first key that you hit is
always<00:04:53.060> going<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.270> be<00:04:53.330> movement<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.110> left

move that button or sorry knob or fader
to<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:01.910> right<00:05:02.290> so<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.500> same<00:05:03.800> thing<00:05:04.280> works<00:05:04.550> for

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
to the right so the same thing works for

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.909 
to the right so the same thing works for
controllers<00:05:05.360> but<00:05:05.990> instead<00:05:06.350> of<00:05:06.410> obviously

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
controllers but instead of obviously

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.480 
controllers but instead of obviously
clicking<00:05:07.370> learn<00:05:08.530> cooking<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.830> button<00:05:10.190> and

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
clicking learn cooking the button and

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.970 
clicking learn cooking the button and
then<00:05:10.970> clicking<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.419> keyboard<00:05:11.930> shortcut<00:05:12.020> one<00:05:12.890> of

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
then clicking a keyboard shortcut one of

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.409 
then clicking a keyboard shortcut one of
the<00:05:13.040> keys<00:05:13.550> on<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:13.760> keyboard<00:05:13.940> that<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.270> want

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
the keys on the keyboard that you want

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.659 
the keys on the keyboard that you want
to<00:05:14.480> map<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:14.780> to<00:05:14.810> you<00:05:15.680> would<00:05:15.830> click<00:05:16.310> the

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
to map it to you would click the

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.430 
to map it to you would click the
function<00:05:17.150> on<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.360> controller<00:05:17.930> that<00:05:18.169> you<00:05:18.230> want

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
function on the controller that you want

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.010 
function on the controller that you want
to<00:05:18.500> map<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:18.980> so<00:05:19.880> if<00:05:20.090> it's<00:05:20.270> play<00:05:20.690> button

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
to map it to so if it's play button

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.570 
to map it to so if it's play button
obviously<00:05:21.290> you<00:05:21.770> would<00:05:21.919> then<00:05:22.010> click<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.430> play

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
obviously you would then click the play

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.719 
obviously you would then click the play
button<00:05:22.610> on<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.060> controller<00:05:23.570> and<00:05:24.550> cue<00:05:25.550> you

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
button on the controller and cue you

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.700 
button on the controller and cue you
would<00:05:25.850> click<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.360> cue<00:05:26.570> button<00:05:26.900> so<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.620> would

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
would click the cue button so you would

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.379 
would click the cue button so you would
map<00:05:27.889> all<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.220> functions<00:05:28.700> obviously<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.300> the

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
map all the functions obviously to the

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.700 
map all the functions obviously to the
functions<00:05:29.750> on<00:05:29.870> screen<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.290> make<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.560> most

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
functions on screen that make the most

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.330 
functions on screen that make the most
sense<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:31.600> for<00:05:32.600> first<00:05:33.020> faders<00:05:33.710> it's<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.100> same

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
sense and for first faders it's the same

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.100 
sense and for first faders it's the same
way<00:05:34.550> if<00:05:34.790> I<00:05:34.880> wanted<00:05:35.120> a<00:05:35.210> map<00:05:35.390> a<00:05:35.419> fader<00:05:35.750> when<00:05:36.080> I

way if I wanted a map a fader when I
first<00:05:36.440> click<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:36.740> fader<00:05:37.130> that<00:05:37.850> I<00:05:37.880> want<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.180> map

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
first click the fader that I want to map

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.620 
first click the fader that I want to map
on-screen<00:05:39.080> my<00:05:39.979> first<00:05:40.310> movement<00:05:40.910> on<00:05:41.090> the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
controller if it's an up-and-down fader

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.650 
controller if it's an up-and-down fader
should<00:05:44.150> be<00:05:44.240> down<00:05:44.510> and<00:05:44.810> then<00:05:45.350> up<00:05:45.850> if<00:05:46.850> it's<00:05:47.450> the

on<00:05:49.700> the<00:05:50.000> controller<00:05:50.660> left<00:05:51.169> and<00:05:51.440> then<00:05:51.860> right

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
on the controller left and then right

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.180 
on the controller left and then right
and<00:05:52.390> then<00:05:53.390> when<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.539> click<00:05:53.630> learn<00:05:54.020> it<00:05:55.010> will

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
and then when I click learn it will

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.710 
and then when I click learn it will
remember<00:05:55.400> those<00:05:55.640> features<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.360> you<00:05:56.570> only

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
remember those features and you only

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.200 
remember those features and you only
have<00:05:56.870> to<00:05:56.990> do<00:05:57.110> with<00:05:57.229> that<00:05:57.380> once<00:05:57.880> those<00:05:58.880> learning

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
have to do with that once those learning

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.080 
have to do with that once those learning
commands<00:05:59.510> are<00:05:59.710> kept<00:06:00.710> so<00:06:01.430> every<00:06:01.640> time<00:06:01.820> you<00:06:01.940> plug

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
commands are kept so every time you plug

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.610 
commands are kept so every time you plug
in<00:06:02.240> that<00:06:02.270> controller<00:06:02.720> again<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.260> you<00:06:03.320> open<00:06:03.560> up

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
in that controller again and you open up

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.260 
in that controller again and you open up
the<00:06:03.770> software<00:06:04.010> it<00:06:04.370> will<00:06:04.460> recognize<00:06:04.880> it<00:06:05.090> and

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
the software it will recognize it and

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.630 
the software it will recognize it and
remember<00:06:05.630> your<00:06:05.780> learn<00:06:05.960> commands<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:07.550> the

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
remember your learn commands and the

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.760 
remember your learn commands and the
same<00:06:07.850> as<00:06:08.000> can<00:06:08.210> be<00:06:08.300> said<00:06:08.450> for<00:06:08.510> the<00:06:08.720> keyboard<00:06:08.900> so

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
same as can be said for the keyboard so

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.440 
same as can be said for the keyboard so
that's<00:06:09.890> kind<00:06:10.070> of<00:06:10.130> a<00:06:10.190> unique<00:06:10.460> easy<00:06:10.789> very<00:06:11.330> easy

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
that's kind of a unique easy very easy

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.340 
that's kind of a unique easy very easy
way<00:06:12.050> to<00:06:12.650> map<00:06:12.860> controllers<00:06:13.720> some<00:06:14.720> functions<00:06:15.169> on

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
way to map controllers some functions on

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.350 
way to map controllers some functions on
controllers<00:06:15.919> like<00:06:16.220> jog<00:06:16.520> wheels<00:06:16.760> especially

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
controllers like jog wheels especially

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.230 
controllers like jog wheels especially
if<00:06:17.450> they're<00:06:17.570> motorised<00:06:18.020> platters<00:06:18.880> we<00:06:19.880> have<00:06:20.090> to

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
if they're motorised platters we have to

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.200 
if they're motorised platters we have to
map<00:06:20.419> ourselves<00:06:21.020> all<00:06:21.410> those<00:06:22.039> all<00:06:22.640> controllers

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
map ourselves all those all controllers

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.270 
map ourselves all those all controllers
aren't<00:06:23.390> created<00:06:23.780> equal<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.260> some<00:06:24.860> will<00:06:25.010> send

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
aren't created equal and some will send

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.400 
aren't created equal and some will send
more<00:06:26.210> points<00:06:26.630> or<00:06:26.720> you<00:06:27.080> know<00:06:27.169> higher

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
more points or you know higher

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.200 
more points or you know higher
resolution<00:06:28.039> let's<00:06:28.220> say<00:06:28.370> more<00:06:28.580> points<00:06:28.910> of<00:06:29.030> debt

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
resolution let's say more points of debt

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.240 
resolution let's say more points of debt
data<00:06:29.600> per<00:06:29.960> revolution<00:06:30.260> than<00:06:31.039> other

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.520 
data per revolution than other
controllers<00:06:31.960> therefore<00:06:32.960> it's<00:06:33.080> always<00:06:33.229> best

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
controllers therefore it's always best

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.250

that<00:06:33.740> we<00:06:33.830> map<00:06:34.039> those<00:06:34.479> but<00:06:35.479> all<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.840> basic

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
that we map those but all the basic

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.740 
that we map those but all the basic
functions<00:06:36.710> play<00:06:37.070> Paul's<00:06:37.460> cue<00:06:37.820> loop<00:06:38.150> all<00:06:38.450> those

effects<00:06:41.330> I<00:06:41.450> mean

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
effects I mean

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.960 
effects I mean
you've<00:06:41.750> got<00:06:41.900> effects<00:06:42.260> built<00:06:42.560> in<00:06:42.770> two<00:06:43.730> decks

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
you've got effects built in two decks

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.340 
you've got effects built in two decks
three<00:06:44.210> of<00:06:44.300> course<00:06:44.540> and<00:06:44.780> you<00:06:44.840> can<00:06:44.960> map<00:06:45.140> those

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
three of course and you can map those

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.860 
three of course and you can map those
using<00:06:45.740> learn<00:06:45.950> to<00:06:46.850> functions<00:06:47.240> on<00:06:47.360> a<00:06:47.390> controller

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
using learn to functions on a controller

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.350 
using learn to functions on a controller
so<00:06:48.740> hopefully<00:06:49.040> that<00:06:49.190> helps<00:06:49.550> and<00:06:49.820> keep

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
so hopefully that helps and keep

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:58.530 
so hopefully that helps and keep
checking<00:06:50.600> back<00:06:50.720> for<00:06:51.050> more<00:06:51.200> videos<00:06:51.530> thanks
