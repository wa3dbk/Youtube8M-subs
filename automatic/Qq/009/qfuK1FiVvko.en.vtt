it<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.989> are<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.320> throwing<00:00:37.829> another<00:00:38.309> spanner

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it we are not throwing another spanner

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.459

into the whole workings in international

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.750 
into the whole workings in international
economy<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:40.980> she's<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.219> looking<00:00:41.370> too<00:00:41.730> good

at<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> moment<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:43.320> go<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> 2012<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.640> think

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
at the moment as we go to 2012 I think

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.130 
at the moment as we go to 2012 I think
the<00:00:45.239> irony<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.219> 2003

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
the irony is is that you know in 2003

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.290 
the irony is is that you know in 2003
America<00:00:49.140> invaded<00:00:49.469> Iraq<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
America invaded Iraq with the of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.850 
America invaded Iraq with the of
controlling<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> reach<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> Middle<00:00:52.710> East

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
controlling the reach in the Middle East

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.639 
controlling the reach in the Middle East
and<00:00:53.129> controlling<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> oil<00:00:54.270> supplies<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:55.410> know

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and controlling the oil supplies we know

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.860 
and controlling the oil supplies we know
see<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.309> probably<00:00:56.640> an<00:00:56.879> American<00:00:57.420> control

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
see that probably an American control

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.779 
see that probably an American control
what<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> Middle<00:00:58.500> East<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.100> its<00:00:59.280> weakest

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
what the Middle East is is its weakest

what the Middle East is is its weakest
in<00:01:00.030> decades<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.870> lost<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.500> key<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> Mubarak

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
open the Straits of Hormuz but that

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.860 
open the Straits of Hormuz but that
would<00:02:23.080> mean<00:02:23.320> war<00:02:23.830> with<00:02:24.160> Iran<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.450> as<00:02:25.720> I

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
would mean war with Iran and that as I

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.280 
would mean war with Iran and that as I
say<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.230> would<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> huge<00:02:27.490> huge<00:02:28.360> escalation

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
say it would be a huge huge escalation

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.650 
say it would be a huge huge escalation
and<00:02:29.470> would<00:02:29.740> threaten<00:02:30.010> world<00:02:30.730> peace<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
and would threaten world peace and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.690 
and would threaten world peace and
therefore<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> Iranians<00:02:33.190> are

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
therefore I think the Iranians are

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.449 
therefore I think the Iranians are
really<00:02:33.910> challenging<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.630> Americans<00:02:35.459> sensing

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
be clear about that it's the West who

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.090

powers Britain France and America sense

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.900 
powers Britain France and America sense
that<00:04:08.470> economically<00:04:09.250> there<00:04:09.459> might<00:04:09.579> be<00:04:09.610> weak

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
that economically there might be weak

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.789 
that economically there might be weak
but<00:04:09.940> militarily<00:04:10.630> you<00:04:10.900> can<00:04:11.049> use<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.410> weight<00:04:11.620> to

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
but militarily you can use the weight to

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.800 
but militarily you can use the weight to
buttress<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.160> opposition<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.209> think<00:04:13.690> they're

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
buttress the opposition I think they're

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.479 
buttress the opposition I think they're
making<00:04:14.049> a<00:04:14.110> big<00:04:14.350> mistake<00:04:14.530> with<00:04:14.890> Iran<00:04:15.160> as<00:04:15.340> well

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
making a big mistake with Iran as well

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.979 
making a big mistake with Iran as well
because<00:04:15.820> relatively<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.390> Iranian<00:04:16.810> economy

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
because relatively the Iranian economy

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.530 
because relatively the Iranian economy
is<00:04:17.290> doing<00:04:17.410> well<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:18.100> Iran<00:04:18.760> is<00:04:19.030> in<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.359> position

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
is doing well and Iran is in a position

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.659 
is doing well and Iran is in a position
to<00:04:19.810> exert<00:04:20.169> more<00:04:20.350> influence<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.859> regional<00:04:21.250> basis

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
to exert more influence a regional basis

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.430 
to exert more influence a regional basis
as<00:04:21.820> we<00:04:22.090> saw<00:04:22.270> this<00:04:22.450> week<00:04:22.690> whether<00:04:23.110> it's<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.260> new

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
as we saw this week whether it's a new

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.140 
as we saw this week whether it's a new
agreements<00:04:23.890> in<00:04:23.950> Afghanistan<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:24.970> must

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
agreements in Afghanistan and that must

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.190 
agreements in Afghanistan and that must
hurt<00:04:25.390> the<00:04:25.570> Americans<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.169> see<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.500> Iranians

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
hurt the Americans to see the Iranians

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.100 
hurt the Americans to see the Iranians
an<00:04:27.440> influence<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:27.860> Iraq<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:29.110> Afghanistan

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
an influence in Iraq and in Afghanistan

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.080 
an influence in Iraq and in Afghanistan
I<00:04:30.140> think<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.590> was<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.890> sense<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.220> desperation<00:04:31.490> in

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
I think it was a sense of desperation in

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.810 
I think it was a sense of desperation in
Washington<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.140> I'm<00:04:33.950> on<00:04:34.100> its<00:04:34.220> allies<00:04:34.580> in

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
Washington and I'm on its allies in

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.400 
Washington and I'm on its allies in
