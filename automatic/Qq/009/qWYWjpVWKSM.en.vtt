00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
this rom 1.2 gigahertz is what is the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.140 
this rom 1.2 gigahertz is what is the
fastest<00:03:10.280> you're<00:03:10.400> going<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.580> get<00:03:10.700> which<00:03:10.880> isn't

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
fastest you're going to get which isn't

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.390 
fastest you're going to get which isn't
too<00:03:11.269> bad<00:03:11.420> because<00:03:11.690> 1.2<00:03:12.320> gig<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.830> fine<00:03:13.100> in<00:03:13.280> my

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
too bad because 1.2 gig is fine in my

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.000 
too bad because 1.2 gig is fine in my
opinion<00:03:13.810> then<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.900> also<00:03:15.050> have<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.530> amount<00:03:15.920> of

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.640 
opinion then you also have the amount of
RAM<00:03:16.570> task<00:03:17.570> killers<00:03:17.870> will<00:03:17.989> keep<00:03:18.140> in<00:03:18.290> memory<00:03:18.410> and

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
RAM task killers will keep in memory and

RAM task killers will keep in memory and
stuff<00:03:18.980> like<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:20.390> can<00:03:20.510> also<00:03:20.630> do<00:03:20.810> voltage

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
stuff like that you can also do voltage

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.120 
stuff like that you can also do voltage
controls<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.799> then<00:03:21.890> start<00:03:22.250> up<00:03:22.400> tweaks<00:03:24.100> what<00:03:25.100> I

is<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.030> very<00:03:41.420> handy<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.380> definitely<00:03:42.880> makes

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
is a very handy and it definitely makes

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.150 
is a very handy and it definitely makes
it<00:03:44.060> easier<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.390> use<00:03:44.690> if<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:44.900> like<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:45.290> then

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
it easier to use if you like and then
