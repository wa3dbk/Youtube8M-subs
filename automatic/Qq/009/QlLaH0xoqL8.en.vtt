okay<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:00.829> people<00:00:01.829> have<00:00:01.920> been<00:00:02.010> asking<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.639> few

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
okay so people have been asking a few

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.340 
okay so people have been asking a few
questions<00:00:02.820> about<00:00:03.179> how<00:00:03.480> fast<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.020> desire<00:00:04.319> is

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
questions about how fast the desire is

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.110 
questions about how fast the desire is
and<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:05.160> just<00:00:05.339> thought<00:00:05.460> I'd<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> comparison

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
and I just thought I'd do a comparison

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.410 
and I just thought I'd do a comparison
between<00:00:06.500> my<00:00:07.500> desire<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.400> my<00:00:08.490> hero<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.330> my

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
between my desire and my hero and my

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.020 
between my desire and my hero and my
brothers<00:00:10.139> nexus<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:10.980> we've<00:00:11.849> got<00:00:11.940> the

brothers nexus one so we've got the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.270 
brothers nexus one so we've got the
nexus<00:00:12.269> one<00:00:12.450> here<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.200> desire<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> hero

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
Android build so here we go on three one

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:50.290 
Android build so here we go on three one
two<00:00:34.649> three

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.900 

now<00:00:50.899> I<00:00:51.260> do<00:00:51.410> know<00:00:51.770> that<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.040> desire<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.879> desire

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
now I do know that the desire the desire

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.240 
now I do know that the desire the desire
is<00:00:53.180> very<00:00:54.020> very<00:00:54.350> much<00:00:54.620> quicker<00:00:54.829> than<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.040> hero

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
is very very much quicker than the hero

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.100 
is very very much quicker than the hero
but<00:00:55.550> I'm<00:00:55.730> not<00:00:56.120> really<00:00:56.329> sure<00:00:56.480> how<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:56.780> compares

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
but I'm not really sure how it compares

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.130 
but I'm not really sure how it compares
to<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.290> Nexus<00:00:57.620> sir<00:00:58.329> looks<00:00:59.329> like<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.660> Nexus<00:00:59.989> is

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
to the Nexus sir looks like the Nexus is

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.790 
to the Nexus sir looks like the Nexus is
winning<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:00.440> far<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.960> hero<00:01:03.260> will<00:01:03.470> be<00:01:03.590> left

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
winning so far and the hero will be left

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:15.030 
winning so far and the hero will be left
in<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:03.980> dust

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.490 

and<00:01:20.160> looks<00:01:21.160> like<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.580> Nexus<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.000> done<00:01:22.500> it's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
and looks like the Nexus is done it's

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.000 
and looks like the Nexus is done it's
unlocked<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:24.520> working<00:01:25.050> yep<00:01:26.050> the<00:01:26.530> next<00:01:26.890> is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
unlocked is it working yep the next is

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.590 
unlocked is it working yep the next is
one<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.530> vanilla<00:01:30.340> Android<00:01:30.850> definitely<00:01:31.450> is

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
one so vanilla Android definitely is

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.630 
one so vanilla Android definitely is
quicker<00:01:31.870> to<00:01:32.080> boot<00:01:32.260> let's<00:01:32.830> take<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.310> off<00:01:33.400> there

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
quicker to boot let's take it off there

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.890 
quicker to boot let's take it off there
the<00:01:34.540> desire<00:01:34.990> is<00:01:35.290> done<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:37.180> hero<00:01:37.510> really
