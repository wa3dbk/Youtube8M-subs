00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.399
 hello my name is eric pedredo 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.700
 guadarrama an engineering student 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.700
 mechatronics 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.670
 I have a canon printer in which with 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:21.480
 the time I could learn to be able 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.520
 reset is with this machine since I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.310
 marks an error in which it no longer me 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.329
 allows to have function on it neither 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.329
 much less print 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.800
 this means that the counting of 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.260
 impressions is over which has already 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.500
 reached its limit 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.780
 I have a software called being seen 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.610
 in which this helps us to be able 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.420
 retrieve those impressions that for now 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.420
 They are 1500 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.070
 there are many programs of these but 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.550
 the problem is that you do not follow the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.280
 Steps 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.500
 as they should be and that's why the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.619
 most say that you can not recite 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.310
 but really is that if you turn on the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.659
 machine what we see is that it marks us a 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.659
 error is in which is the 07 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.100
 well as first step is to turn off the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.740
 machine 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.170
 what we are going to do is put it in mode 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.619
 service or maintenance mode 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.009
 how is how we get to that step very 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:39.299
 easy as we press the red button that 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.299
 it says to restart 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.840
 we press it 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.460
 also but if we walk to the same good 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.930
 almost at the same time the button on 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.930
 without releasing the two 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.220
 okay 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.410
 let's go the stop button restart 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.100
 which is the red color that I have in the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.100
 downstairs 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:12.090
 without releasing this the on 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.629
 we do it five times 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.629
 two 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.910
 4 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.300
 and in the fifth we should appear this 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.300
 red triangle 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.370
 we release the power button 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.650
 and automatically the machine is going to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.650
 put in service or maintenance mode 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.770
 flower is I have it uncovered because 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.310
 I found another type of error in this 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.380
 printer 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.900
 that you have to move a sensor feel a 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.900
 little but that and then I'll explain 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.860
 then we have the printer in mode 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.860
 service we go to the program in the pc 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.450
 here I have the service tom 34 we open it 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.350
 obviously your printer must already be 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.350
 connected on the usb 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.700
 we open it 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.599
 and it shows us this menu in which 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.519
 that we are going to reset is the cartridge that 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.390
 this is the color one and the one below is the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.390
 black 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.170
 we go and we unfold this this menu 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.170
 we give in main color 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.790
 and here we see that on the right side there is 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.250
 an icon that says set what is going 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.879
 to reset they put a sheet in their 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.879
 printer because what he is going to do is 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.980
 reset the count of impressions and you 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.720
 will print that is in zeros that is 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.280
 as new 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.380
 Then we give in reset or set 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.410
 and we see that the machine is going to start 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.930
 pull one of the sheets and it will print 0 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.850
 that the machine is in being 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.800
 impression is like it's new 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.800
 short is working the program 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.730
 has traveled the sheet 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.920
 and it will print us what 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.920
 the color cartridge has been reset 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:40.499
 if we make a sun 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:44.039
 tells us that the print is so 0 color 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:45.870
 cl is color equal to 0 has been reset in 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.129
 the color cartridge and they sent us 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.129
 messages on the pc 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.420
 This means that effectively already 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.300
 resisted the machine 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:05.910
 and the impressions counter in the 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.910
 color cartridge and we give you to accept 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.980
 the same thing we're going to do with the cartridge 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.370
 black that is found here 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.370
 down 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.070
 that is the last icon on the menu that we 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.070
 deploy 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.969
 we go to menu and select the 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.849
 black 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:38.089
 we put another low in the printer and we 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.089
 let's go here where it says set or reset 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.140
 in this icon here 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.140
 we make another show 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.190
 it tells us that 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.700
 more has been completed in the change not 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.849
 I find the sheet to print gives us the 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.669
 the report that is at zero I hope 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.699
 If you do not pick up the sheet and it is not printed 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:10.060
 it does not matter as long as I say that the function 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:12.070
 has been finalized is correct 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.200
 to check this if you have 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.200
 properly prescribed we closed the 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.580
 the program 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.229
 we turn off the printer 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:36.240
 to check everything is then we go back 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.240
 to turn on the printer 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.629
 why 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:46.249
 so we see that it no longer marks us 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:48.710
 the fish the famous p07 agree then 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:51.129
 let's choose an image and the 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.129
 we print 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:42.680
 and here is the impression 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.810
 Well I hope you have served this 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.690
 tutorial I hope I have been a bit clear 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:50.860
 in any way in the description of 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.990
 video I will leave the program 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.849
 and I'm also going to make some screenshots of 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:58.080
 screen of how it was making way to 

00:07:54.849 --> 00:08:01.889
 step if you have a little more doubt 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.889
 I say goodbye good bye
