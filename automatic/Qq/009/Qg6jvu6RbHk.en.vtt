 without any error by the only one they have 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.490
 what to do to use the application is 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.799
 create an account they touch where it says 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.140
 donovan account sign up and create the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.100
 account the application has two functions 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.780
 a 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.450
 it's just record the screen of the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
 device and the other is record live 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.920
 so that other people can see what 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.960
 what are you doing that's why you need 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.869
 create an account 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.700
 and ready where it says to be world casting 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.070
 is to record live which does not 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.860
 we will use and where it says I am record in is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.510
 to record only on the screen it 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.759
 can change some settings of the 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.650
 application as the format I'm going to 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.970
 change it to mp4 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.009
 orientation 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.850
 landscape is when the device is 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.340
 A) Yes 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.940
 this other option of the cns that is when 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.640
 is on the other side and porter is with 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.420
 device is normal 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.510
 I'll change the resolution to 1080 on 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.140
 which is the best resolution and bug and the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.450
 I'm going to change to 16 for all games 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.370
 and some applications is necessary 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.320
 activate the assistant so that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.500
 serious application without any problem 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.800
 to activate it only go to settings 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.840
 general and accessibility and look for where 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.600
 he says to attend touch 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.490
 and they understand 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.410
 they can do it aside so that the 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.380
 time to record do not bother them 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.900
 and now to start recording alone 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.240
 playing a says being recording and like 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:01.720
 come I'm already recording 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:04.830
 they touch ok ok well I'll try to 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.830
 below an application 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.810
 to try with simple with winters is a 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.990
 extremely difficult game good for 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.990
 my 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:24.540

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.569
 again we invent good friend flies 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.490
 enough for today and now we're heading 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.200
 to the application and stop recording 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.010
 to see the recording they made 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.070
 they can spot recordings and if they touch it 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.630
 can play it can open in 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.570
 another place to store it in your camera 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.750
 photos and delete it in this case is going to 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.750
