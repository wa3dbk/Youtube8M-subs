00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hi Guys, good afternoon, we're on the site. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 los angeles in the municipality of ribeirão 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 gravel in the mato grosso 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.570
 This is a video lesson on how you do it. 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.619
 the seed and tomato planting to 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.660
 commercial sale 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 well here I made a bed of two 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.050
 meters and a half in length as you 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 can see by 90 centimeters wide 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.539
 I put some boards the fan was the land 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.840
 and those white dots that you 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.930
 in the image on earth is the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.440
 fertilizer I used that npk in the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.210
 formula 4 14 8 I made these little ones 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.090
 risks is following the 90 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.180
 centimeters from the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.219
 you can see a spacing and from 3 to 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 4 centimeters a risk from the other in this 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.320
 risk for this has an average of 45 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.080
 centimeters which is more or less the basics 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.020
 that we always leave and the depth 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.380
 his is not so strong current is more or 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.590
 one centimeter and a half at most 27 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.299
 This you can do with the help is 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.170
 I use a normal piece of wood , right? 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.799
 risk 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.619
 in this way, the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.280
 risk of placing the seeds of the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.540
 tomato 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 Okay, well, let's go back to this 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.079
 you can see that these 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.979
 dots are whiter are manure as 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.110
 I should have said before in formula 4 14 today 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.299
 you can see that jazz 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.439
 seed need not be very much in each 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.390
 risk and staff more or less there 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.579
 seed with the other is not 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.869
 very easy to put on but we avoid 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.950
 putting excess is even to save 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.570
 given the fact that the seed is the input more 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.780
 face on tomato planting 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.200
 You can see all the risks are already 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.480
 with the red dots that are the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.710
 seeds that you buy there 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.330
 water houses 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.330
 the cattle rancher in the city across the country 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.990
 is after putting all do all the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.450
 scratchs 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.700
 It is a tip that staff first 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.160
 You play there seeing this does not exist. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.200
 risk points throw fertilizer 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.260
 You need not be very average half 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.090
 kg of fertilizer 4 14 8 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.610
 in this way every square meter is the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.090
 first you throw a fertilizer and then 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.820
 You do the risk there and we're going 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:56.060
 back home when it comes to cover 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:59.280
 it is important to you is to collect at all is 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.320
 who always has a corner and 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.940
 after we the cute that are the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.580
 roots ne 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.700
 the rotten pieces of wood underneath 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.180
 from the land we take all of them because 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.160
 because at the time the tomato has 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:19.770
 germinating it is a plant as I can 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.860
 tell you to understand it a lot better 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.460
 sensitive at the time of germination then 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.370
 you withdraw all is mainly from the 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.560
 area of risk né 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.110
 Okay, good. You're going to start covering. 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.270
 these risks can do this in a 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:42.150
 way that's playing 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.220
 only a little bit of land because the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.680
 tomato he likes to germinate 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:53.250
 it is at a depth of a belt a 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:56.130
 centimeter and a half a certain good did 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.620
 so you can see that the fertilizer already 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.540
 covered that he had a risk he is already 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.590
 can not see the seed but it gives 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.350
 to see a doubt 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.760
 so it's more or less then you should 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.350
 to do is want to want to thank everyone 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.620
 of the city los angeles channel 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.549

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.600
 and we will be back soon with more 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.980
 videos 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.760
 I'll be betting weekly or 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.240
 every 15 days the planting video of 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.910
 tomato 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.360
 here in the city ​​los angeles i am xavier and 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.240
 I speak of the site los angeles that has as 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.560
 research and development in the 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.160
 tomato planting 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.160
 See you
