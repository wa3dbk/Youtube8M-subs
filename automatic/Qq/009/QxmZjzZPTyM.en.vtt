00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.730
 the life of the good means a new 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.680
 I really like a lot of video 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.510
 very much be a new video and I tell you 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.340
 that we are taking advantage of the bottle 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.200
 with the sexiest curves in the world is 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.880
 turning 100 years old and I'm going to 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.680
 tell my story that I have with a 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.110
 cocacola I tell you that it takes my best 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.060
 friend from far away does a lot 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.590
 time I do not see it then what is going to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.930
 to happen is that we are going to receive it with a 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.239
 surprise with a gift and what better than 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.340
 receive with sweet milestones 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.410
 they happened to me Coca-Cola will remember 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.090
 that that was how we met off 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.620
 that I do not know how to do any of that 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.540
 chocolates well then there is not the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.760
 perfection but the important thing is the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.500
 detail so I put this video 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.050
 good the materials that we need are 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.850
 a pound of dark chocolate and that 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.530
 Black chocolate should be yours because if 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.510
 It's semi bitter because it does not taste so good 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.519
 then better if it's sweet we need 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.170
 a mold of coca cola bottles that what 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.870
 they get in the stores where they sell 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.360
 chocolates and pastries and cookies and 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.920
 that and we need a prescription from 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.380
 Ear ear for us to stay super 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.570
 super rich this mini recipe super course 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.030
 The first thing we should do is have 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.420
 super super clean hands because no 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.119
 we want the person who goes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.220
 for the gift you suddenly get a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.869
 women milestone out there or to go to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.299
 get sick or something then it's very 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.280
 important to have hands so super 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.450
 super clean and you prefer them 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.460
 They can remove the nail polish 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.700
 But, sorry, if someone were to eat 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.759
 these chocolatitos with one arm 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.490
 then what they should do is place in 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.799
 a glass mold all the chocolates 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.049
 and crushed and chocolate is important 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.630
 that the mold is made of glass because the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.350
 glass concentrates pretty much the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.909
 heat then they will melt 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.310
 much easier while I go 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.259
 grinding the chocolatito I tell you that 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.330
 I put my already met in a store 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.060
 that gave the last bottle of coca-cola 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.830
 and then what happens is that I wanted 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.720
 taking out the tail and equipment is like 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.000
 for not good with tuna or good for 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.670
 put is a good candidacy then 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.229
 as we are collaborative people 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.450
 she said as good then better 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.739
 we share the cocacola pressures like 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.420
 the first story but good I follow 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.730
 counting all five is the same if they are 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.560
 for her and the second thing we have to 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.390
 do is take and that chocolatito 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.970
 crushed we take it to a 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.560
 chorus waves to melt in this 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.990
 microwave that I'm using here is going 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.220
 to place a 15 minute that is approximate 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.520
 for the amount that we are using 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.740
 like that is to the eye is not like 2.5 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.110
 chocolate not but just a minute 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.120
 15 is super good to melt 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.220
 this amount of chocolate that after 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.080
 that you take them out of the microwave 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.660
 to have a part where you are going to give 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.730
 I want to eat all the chocolate because 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.190
 you have to stir it stir until it 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.040
 is about to and look at those pretty 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.530
 and how it looks moment but do not remember 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.820
 which is for a gift for whom you 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.530
 they want is for a gift so 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.630
 after the end if you scrape the pot 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.820
 scrape what they want so we have 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.650
 what to expect that is about to thread and 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.080
 after that, what we are going to do is 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.540
 pass it on to the concepts of coca with the 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.840
 things patiently we are going to fill one 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.769
 for one we are going to go throwing 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.140
 we can carefully distribute a 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.420
 spoonful from top to bottom and 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.550
 after it is completely full the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.590
 mold cited we give you little touches 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.269
 this is to make sure that we do not 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.900
 there are air bubbles because if not 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.760
 after 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.790
 and this is going to be a problem just 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.739
 they tap him and they continue 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.110
 filling the others so we fill this 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.510
 and we have taken more but remember 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.549
 that this is for a gift so I do not know 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.379
 you can eat it after 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.230
 we have all the molds and all 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.700
 beautiful systems and all beautiful 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.220
 we proceed to put them in the fridge and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.950
 when this happens we will leave it there 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.439
 about 15 to 20 minutes like we can 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.900
 be looking at chairs after that 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.640
 we take it out of the fridge that one says or 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.040
 I already got the little month but remember that 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.379
 we can eat let's find a 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.879
 cute little box anywhere they sell 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.459
 pretty boxes and you know how to make 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.530
 little boxes to gala or search on youtube there 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.510
 many tutorials on how to make boxes 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.060
 cute for a gift or just if you 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.829
 appear as they go to me and buy a 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.989
 box the nearest store in all 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.000
 These pretty cute parts and things like that 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.000
 cheesy and what they're going to do is they're going to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.340
 Carefully remove the knife with latex 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.430
 of the mold and they will start placing 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.919
 In the box 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.380
 as you like them and the 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.330
 can decorate to your liking and so 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.889
 they will surprise the person who 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.720
 true that you most want a 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.130
 person they do not see a long time ago and 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.539
 what better way than to receive it with 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.539
 cocacola and chocolates 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.069
 for me because of light I hope that they have 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.659
 very much liked this video 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.909

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.069
 Much dedication is chocolate has 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.439
 hence the touch of love hope you have 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.360

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.479
