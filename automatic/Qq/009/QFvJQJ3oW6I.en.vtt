00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.229 
recently did a ironlak and that when I
feel<00:02:04.989> was<00:02:05.200> like<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.649> little<00:02:06.069> bit<00:02:06.280> more<00:02:06.549> epic

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
feel was like a little bit more epic

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.359 
feel was like a little bit more epic
only<00:02:07.509> because<00:02:07.810> like<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.530> scale<00:02:09.069> of<00:02:09.100> the

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
only because like the scale of the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.460 
only because like the scale of the
imagery<00:02:09.759> was<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.060> big<00:02:10.329> and<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.899> was<00:02:10.989> like<00:02:11.109> crop

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
imagery was so big and it was like crop

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.300 
imagery was so big and it was like crop
so<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.400> don't<00:02:12.970> want<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.569> do<00:02:14.200> more<00:02:14.470> stuff<00:02:15.220> like

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
so I don't want to do more stuff like

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.680 
so I don't want to do more stuff like
that<00:02:15.459> that's<00:02:15.880> why<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.060> piece<00:02:16.329> kind<00:02:16.600> of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
that that's why this piece kind of

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.950 
that that's why this piece kind of
similar<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.500> it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.870 

this<00:02:23.170> one<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.500> particular<00:02:23.650> I'd<00:02:24.370> use<00:02:24.850> a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
this one in particular I'd use a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.450 
this one in particular I'd use a
projector<00:02:25.150> till<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.140> get<00:02:26.380> my<00:02:26.500> sketch<00:02:27.220> down

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
projector till I get my sketch down

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.530 
projector till I get my sketch down
because<00:02:27.700> that's<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:27.970> think<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.360> most

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
because that's I think the most

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.510 
because that's I think the most
important<00:02:29.050> part<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.410> make<00:02:29.650> sure<00:02:29.680> proportions

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
important part is make sure proportions

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.590 
important part is make sure proportions
are<00:02:30.640> all<00:02:30.760> good<00:02:30.970> especially<00:02:31.210> when<00:02:31.420> you're

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
are all good especially when you're

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.200 
are all good especially when you're
doing<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.870> logo<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.070> projector<00:02:33.880> makes<00:02:34.090> it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
doing a logo so projector makes it

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.030 
doing a logo so projector makes it
extremely<00:02:34.480> easy<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:35.680> don't<00:02:35.710> have<00:02:35.980> a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
extremely easy you don't have a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.800 
extremely easy you don't have a
projector<00:02:36.190> or<00:02:36.910> you're<00:02:37.120> not<00:02:37.240> able<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.600> use<00:02:37.780> a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
projector or you're not able to use a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.840 
projector or you're not able to use a
projector<00:02:38.080> for<00:02:38.320> some<00:02:38.560> reason<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:38.920> grid<00:02:39.520> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
projector for some reason I grid and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.060 
projector for some reason I grid and
gridding<00:02:40.330> also<00:02:40.750> helps<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.320> takes<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.920> little

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
gridding also helps to it takes a little

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.120 
gridding also helps to it takes a little
bit<00:02:42.220> longer<00:02:42.460> but<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.750> gets<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.470> same<00:02:44.800> kind<00:02:45.070> of

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
bit longer but it gets that same kind of

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.190 
bit longer but it gets that same kind of
precision<00:02:45.520> I<00:02:45.910> mean<00:02:46.120> other<00:02:46.330> guys<00:02:46.540> are<00:02:46.720> good<00:02:47.080> at

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
precision I mean other guys are good at

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.020 
precision I mean other guys are good at
just<00:02:47.350> free<00:02:47.620> handing<00:02:47.980> but<00:02:48.220> when<00:02:48.670> messing<00:02:48.940> with

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
just free handing but when messing with

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.640 
just free handing but when messing with
logos<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.570> me<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:49.780> particular<00:02:49.900> when<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.530> do

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
logos and me in particular when I do

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.130 
logos and me in particular when I do
design<00:02:51.130> i<00:02:51.160> want<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.580> look<00:02:51.730> as<00:02:51.930> accurate<00:02:52.930> to

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
design i want to look as accurate to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.190 
design i want to look as accurate to
that<00:02:53.320> design<00:02:53.770> as<00:02:53.920> possible<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.960> uh

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
that design as possible so I just uh

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.570 
that design as possible so I just uh
these<00:02:57.130> grids<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:57.640> projectors<00:02:58.920> James<00:02:59.920> huh<00:03:00.160> and

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
these grids and projectors James huh and

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.240 
these grids and projectors James huh and
I<00:03:00.850> gotta<00:03:01.240> get<00:03:01.390> back<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.750> work<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.410> I'll<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.220> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
I gotta get back to work so I'll see you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:18.309 
I gotta get back to work so I'll see you
guys<00:03:03.340> later

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319
