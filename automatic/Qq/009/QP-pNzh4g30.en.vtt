00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.049
 and appointments from the metropolis 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.330
 we tested for it's gone to test 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.130
 the clip and clyde the attraction of the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.660
 new climbed room what's up that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 has just opened its doors to lesquin 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.050
 so it's a climbing room that 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 is for those who want to climb 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.859
 summits whether they are beginners or 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.050
 confirmed but corner is reserved for 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.820
 clips climb a fun course for 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.420
 attract a wider audience than 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.610
 sports 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 explanations with patrice stievenard 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.440
 co-manager of whatsup lesquin then whose 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.879
 clip in fact we find different 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 course so 25 different courses 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.590
 so of course climbs of course but on 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.370
 equipment that differs from what 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.860
 could currently 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.230
 so we can climb we can climb on 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 walls at this match we can climb on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.430
 colorful walls moving walls 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.320
 so here are several more 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.359
 different courses here for all 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 world then the highest courses 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.000
 are told m the names to program the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 height while you want but before 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.990
 rush on the walls and must first 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.229
 think about security and equip yourself with a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.229
 sling 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 benefit to see appear two is 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.170
 all these people like it's in the final on 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.800
 can therefore has tested the legs 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.800
 icefall 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.270
 the little woodpecker we're going to plant like that for 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.549
 climb okay and there we notice a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.689
 little hangar that's accessible too 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.880
 to children we can make that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.130
 much more difficult if we use 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.730
 only and dark blue runway is this 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.020
 so we will try to do obviously 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:57.899
 it is or not a little bit because yes 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.719
 oh yes yes it's still good or 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.110
 it's guillaume on its side will test 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.039
 bombs or a balanced test 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.429
 do you want to do it with your eyes 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.590
 closed the small challenge 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.979
 you see you come from the wind what if you do 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.979
 the mutineers 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.260
 sax 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.040
 now it's a little palm 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.110
 decide how do I see I have 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.240
 sure the extreme we find that there is a 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.340
 very good a very good stop elsewhere 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.800
 those below can can fall 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.160
 it does not hurt otherwise it's for 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.160
 families 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.500
 future generations gentlemen 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.690
 sir gentlemen because that's 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.580
 really really good but on the other hand 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.310
 does it more children after it's not 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.799
 possible it's a little too much there 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.370
 we will do that we will remove it in 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.349
 case of damage 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.599
 beginners can therefore get started 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.829
 without problem it is very accessible and 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.360
 those who are more comfortable do 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.610
 will not be bored either 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.200
 start small challenge go 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:48.209
 we wanted to launch one last 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:49.560
 tent and the angel jump this message to 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.569
 all my climbing friends who know to 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.840
 how naked I am in throwing I have a 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.840
 little taboo 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.840
 saint-jérôme izik to the east 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.000
 and when we think it's over - we have 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.280
 yet another jump higher and higher 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.170
 difficult good rest l one is all in 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.170
 up there yes we can see it 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.500
 his goal jump into the void and 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.500
 catch this end of a good chance 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.230
 no, but it's too late 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.710
 it's a metropolis
