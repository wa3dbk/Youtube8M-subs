hi Jack Bennett here welcome to the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.110 
hi Jack Bennett here welcome to the
lesson<00:00:10.920> in<00:00:11.219> today's<00:00:11.610> lesson<00:00:11.790> I'm<00:00:12.000> gonna

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
lesson in today's lesson I'm gonna

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.150 
lesson in today's lesson I'm gonna
continue<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.019> linear<00:00:13.200> concept<00:00:13.769> in

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
continue on with the linear concept in

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.609 
continue on with the linear concept in
the<00:00:14.790> previous<00:00:15.179> lesson<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.509> did<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> linear<00:00:16.440> beat

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the previous lesson I did a linear beat

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.810 
the previous lesson I did a linear beat
that<00:00:16.740> was<00:00:16.859> basically<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> straight

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
that was basically in a straight

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760 
that was basically in a straight
halftime<00:00:18.330> feel<00:00:18.630> where<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> snare<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.439> coming

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
halftime feel where the snare was coming

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.570 
halftime feel where the snare was coming
in<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:19.920> beat<00:00:20.130> 3

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
in on beat 3

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:35.360 
in on beat 3
so<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.029> was<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.300> money<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:34.010> today<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:35.250> gonna

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
so it was like money and today I'm gonna

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.720 
so it was like money and today I'm gonna
go<00:00:35.610> back<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> more<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.390> backbeat<00:00:37.140> theme

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
go back to more of a backbeat theme

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.920 
go back to more of a backbeat theme
playing<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.879> sort<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> funk<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> fusion

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
playing in sort of the funk the fusion

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.410 
playing in sort of the funk the fusion
or<00:00:40.140> funk<00:00:40.350> fusion<00:00:40.500> context<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> beat<00:00:42.329> I'm

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
or funk fusion context so the beat I'm

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:59.750 
or funk fusion context so the beat I'm
gonna<00:00:42.570> play<00:00:42.750> today<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.730> see

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
gonna play today is this so you can see

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
gonna play today is this so you can see
in<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.239> beat<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.250> basically

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
in that beat there that basically

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.000 
in that beat there that basically
everything<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.840> accent<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
everything that is not the accent on the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.649 
everything that is not the accent on the
snare<00:01:05.220> drum<00:01:05.280> I'm<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.450> really

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
snare drum I'm going for really really

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.800 
snare drum I'm going for really really
soft<00:01:07.020> ghost<00:01:07.350> notes<00:01:08.390> dropping<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> stick<00:01:09.689> from

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
soft ghost notes dropping the stick from

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.929 
soft ghost notes dropping the stick from
2<00:01:10.049> centimeters<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.830> probably<00:01:11.280> no<00:01:11.670> higher

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
2 centimeters and probably no higher

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.789 
2 centimeters and probably no higher
than<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.930> important<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> said

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
than that really important as I said

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.490 
than that really important as I said
that<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.360> dynamic<00:01:15.869> contrast<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that we do get that dynamic contrast the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.539 
that we do get that dynamic contrast the
light<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.890> shade<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> groove

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
light and the shade in the groove

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.600 
light and the shade in the groove
because<00:01:17.970> these<00:01:18.840> beats<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.770> busy<00:01:20.009> there's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
because these beats are so busy there's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.160 
because these beats are so busy there's
so<00:01:20.759> many<00:01:20.880> notes<00:01:21.150> being<00:01:21.330> played<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.780> compared

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
so many notes being played as compared

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.100 
so many notes being played as compared
to<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.500> basic<00:01:22.830> rock<00:01:22.979> beat<00:01:23.810> which<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.960> lot

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
to just a basic rock beat which is a lot

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380 
to just a basic rock beat which is a lot
simpler<00:01:25.520> because<00:01:26.520> there's<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.790> much<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.000> on

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
simpler because there's so much going on

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.880 
simpler because there's so much going on
if<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.659> don't<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> light<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> shade

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
if we don't have the light in the shade

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
if we don't have the light in the shade
and<00:01:29.100> also<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.460> sound<00:01:29.700> contrast<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.390> know

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and also the sound contrast you know

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.460 
and also the sound contrast you know
little<00:01:30.720> things<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> difference

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
little things like the difference

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.289 
little things like the difference
between<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.860> way<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.009> hi-hat<00:01:32.490> sound<00:01:32.790> when

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
between the way the hi-hat sound when

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.399 
between the way the hi-hat sound when
you<00:01:33.390> play<00:01:33.420> them<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> shoulder<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you play them with the shoulder on the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
you play them with the shoulder on the
edges<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.920> opposed<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> tip<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> top

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
edges as opposed to the tip on the top

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.929 
edges as opposed to the tip on the top
as<00:01:36.290> or<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> snare<00:01:37.950> drum<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.159> sound<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
as or with the snare drum the sound of a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.020 
as or with the snare drum the sound of a
rimshot<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:40.280> compared<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> sound<00:01:41.880> when

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
rimshot as compared to the sound when

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.420 
rimshot as compared to the sound when
you<00:01:42.090> hit<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.390> center<00:01:43.369> irrespective<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
you hit it in the center irrespective of

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.819 
you hit it in the center irrespective of
volume<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.570> don't<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
volume if we don't have that then the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.920 
volume if we don't have that then the
patterns<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.610> sound<00:01:47.939> really<00:01:48.030> dense<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
patterns can sound really dense and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.270 
patterns can sound really dense and
monotonous<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.619> everything<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> same

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
monotonous see if everything is the same

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.480 
monotonous see if everything is the same
volume<00:01:50.549> like

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.280 

it<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.729> doesn't<00:01:56.909> groove<00:01:57.240> anywhere<00:01:57.990> near<00:01:58.170> as

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it just doesn't groove anywhere near as

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
it just doesn't groove anywhere near as
well<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> put<00:01:59.100> other<00:01:59.549> dynamics<00:02:00.150> in

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
well as if you put other dynamics in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.930 
well as if you put other dynamics in
there<00:02:05.690> okay<00:02:06.690> now<00:02:07.069> one<00:02:08.069> thing<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.340> really<00:02:08.789> like

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
there okay now one thing I really like

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
there okay now one thing I really like
to<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.810> think<00:02:09.869> something<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.560> our

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
to do and I think something that our

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.680 
to do and I think something that our
linear<00:02:11.220> beats<00:02:11.400> really<00:02:11.970> lend<00:02:12.300> themselves<00:02:12.630> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
linear beats really lend themselves to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.750 
linear beats really lend themselves to
is<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.319> put<00:02:13.620> either<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.130> right<00:02:14.310> or<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.610> left

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
is to put either the right or the left

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760 
is to put either the right or the left
hand<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.540> will<00:02:15.720> do<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> right<00:02:16.170> hand<00:02:16.500> on

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
hand and I will do it the right hand on

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.070 
hand and I will do it the right hand on
another<00:02:17.220> voice<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.450> I'm<00:02:18.540> gonna<00:02:18.660> go<00:02:18.870> with<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
another voice so I'm gonna go with the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.010 
another voice so I'm gonna go with the
cowbell<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.560> start<00:02:19.830> with<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.510> pattern

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
cowbell to start with so that pattern

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:33.620 
cowbell to start with so that pattern
would<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.260> become<00:02:31.700> okay<00:02:32.700> they<00:02:33.209> just<00:02:33.239> start

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
would then become okay they just start

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.120 
would then become okay they just start
to<00:02:33.690> sound<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.290> funky<00:02:34.620> when<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:34.860> mix

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
to sound really funky when you mix

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.040 
to sound really funky when you mix
particularly<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.180> right<00:02:36.390> hand<00:02:36.630> parts<00:02:36.930> is

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
particularly the right hand parts is

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.630 
particularly the right hand parts is
around<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.890> kit<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.190> could<00:02:38.280> do<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.459> on<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
around the kit you could do it on the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.550 
around the kit you could do it on the
rim<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.060> could<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.690> Bell<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.380> do

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
rim you could do it on the Bell you do

00:02:40.560 --> 00:03:01.729 
rim you could do it on the Bell you do
it<00:02:40.620> on<00:02:40.709> wood<00:02:40.860> block<00:03:00.590> okay

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
it on wood block okay

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.259 
it on wood block okay
so<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.280> think<00:03:02.400> that's<00:03:02.670> something<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.940> linear

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
so I think that's something that linear

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.000 
so I think that's something that linear
beats<00:03:03.450> really<00:03:03.630> lend<00:03:03.900> themself<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.650> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
beats really lend themself to is to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.890 
beats really lend themself to is to
mixing<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.519> voicings<00:03:05.880> around<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.570> different

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
mixing the voicings around on different

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.630 
mixing the voicings around on different
parts<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> kit<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.280> that's<00:03:08.459> another

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
parts of the kit so that's another

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.720 
parts of the kit so that's another
linear<00:03:08.850> beat<00:03:09.120> check<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.570> out
