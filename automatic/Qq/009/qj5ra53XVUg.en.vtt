00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.310
 we put in the hands of the new zombie nation camera there are signs of risk 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.539
 which was presented at Headquarters 6 million 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.829
 with fourteen points 6 megapixels sensor aec senior and the operation quite 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.720
 similar to the current 23 parks 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.789
 it's a single camera 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.789
 the first impression you have is to hold the camera 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.519
 be with a delight he is and put in the hands 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.149
 but despite the aesthetic similarities there are many differences 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.280
 both kind of camera 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 company customers 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.830
 her look is very similar to the traditional ones of being a doctor. 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.190
 professional and semi-professional reflex cameras that 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.830
 currently in the market but the manufacturer has been able to adapt its design to the 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.240
 our surprisingly small size 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.180
 the actors in the front at the back are very firmly relying on 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.080
 more friction than the rest of the body 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.340
 the movable parts as much as that of cardboard sd the batteries and the inputs 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.420
 of the cameras also insistent syphilis which will be safe but easy to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.250
 Open 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.800
 The body of the camera is quite solid on your penis is considerably smaller than 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.380
 the current cameras 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.540
 the quality of the images and the customer doing justice to the fourteen points 6 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.700
 megapixels 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.630
 your sms service is more sensitive to light making the photos 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.310
 quality even in low-light environments when 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.780
 increase the rates 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.780
 manual controls are similar to a professional camera 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.409
 including priority modes 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.770
 the video quality was also seized and it is possible to record in 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.070
 720p 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.730
 in addition an interesting quick-view function that allows cutting in 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.890
 adjust videos on the camera itself 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.470
 one of the best very difficult features was also present in 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.740
 other nikon cameras three parts and the approach of any camera makes the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.219
 object photographed with normal shape 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:17.579
 if you want to change an object that is far away point the mind to it exiled 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.639
 hungry the camera enjoy the object and you can adjust the focus without fear of 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:23.339
 err 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.119
 pressing my mind button August shooting and back to show the 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.819
 fair picture 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.230
 Amoled screen is a great factor joke as it improves the quality of the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.719
 image generates brighter colors in real and works well even in very 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.749
 clear 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:42.609
 matter also benefits from it the thing most consume less energy 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.329
 traditional lcd keach 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.959
 the very visceral proximity sensor themed mind when you bring the 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.659
 food near the post showing the images show smaller 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.790
 the problem is that any object that passes close to it already makes that change 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.629
 those two did not work the same time 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.310
 this can be important because if you pass the finger by hand you have to 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.459
 wait until then to return to the plateau to continue wearing the shirt 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.829
 Another problem is that because it is a camera built in the same model of 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.260
 the only three pieces she needed to show very easily 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:23.850
 during the exchange of goods and the inner part of the camera is exposed 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.809
 and entering dust can damage sense 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.999
 unfortunately this is still a general problem of this new technology 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.809
 will not be exclusive of the 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.859
 the price is another negative factor mainly here in Brazil its value 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.680
 varies approximately 20 thousand and 700 until 2008 six reais 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.680
 which may not be much compared to a professional camera 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.390
 but it's still pretty 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.829
 made for people who want to take a step further in search of better 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:56.949
 photos 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.789
 the insistence paid off 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:03.419
 the experiment weighs km / h after the good results that the effects are not 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.829
 enough to take your shine 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.540
 professionals who want a lighter and 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.229
 tragedy but without compromising quality you also feel 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.640
 it leaves almost nothing to be desired in relation to the 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.829
 advanced 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.060
 assumption once again showed that ten countries 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.930
 that it is surprising and that is causing changes in the world of 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.130
 photography
