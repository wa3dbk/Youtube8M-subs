00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.180
 my dear caro my pain is like that 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.180
 great that I know no way out 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.890
 I can not accept that 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.890
 you now with the big love 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.980
 You are my sister and I love 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.689
 me too 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.699
 That's why I do not want your luck in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.199
 Stand away if someone deserves it 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.680
 to be happy 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.119
 landing you always have to be there for me 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.119
 I would do the same close 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.500
 I just have a different life 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.690
 presented 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.490
 I did not ask any more, what does that mean ? 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.540
 now 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.780
 max shows all signs of a serious 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.780
 poisoning 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.470
 that she is all alone now 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.100
 By now it's not all about anymore 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.880
 that's what you want me to do 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.880
 create 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.190
 And it has a great decision 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.190
 the father's last 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.350
 then it says that after my am 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.310
 best a follower 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.660
 this job is definitely too large 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.940
 because here they go what are they doing 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.560
 does not do anything 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.970
 I did not order 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.930
 but not that works 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.900
 I told you that I did not 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:53.760
 only as a fixed that's nice 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.760
 The man you are reading and experiencing recently 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.660
 I think that we are not the right one 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.160
 Handling the gripping I think 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.810
 that you only stand up for your money 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.460
 and I think that's it 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.930
 It would be better if she disappeared before she did 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.240
 watch the fight but continue to 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.190
 cheer they are dismissed 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.530
 this matter is the last word 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.459
 not yet spoken elisabeth needs 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.400
 not anymore 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.230
 I'm taking care of her now I realize 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.750
 doubt that they know what 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.750
 look at all means marry as 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.879
 the man has several months of 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.879
 spent psychiatry 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.520
 stand no movement no 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.850
 behind the head and very slowly above 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.950
 turn every friday no handle you 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.440
 longer you hold on to when they 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.330
 a rescuer named someone who they 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.220
 meanwhile know very well and 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.230
 the apparently prepared a lot of positive 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.790
 learned alexa excuse that they do 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.180
 I did not have anything of my own 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.180
 my reasons 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.250
