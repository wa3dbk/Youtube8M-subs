00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.480
 still worth starting to beginner 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.389
 to master the specialist to attract 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.389
 first of all it will certainly stop 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.469
 you can first especially often 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.759
 viewers control 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.650
 watching the ball 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.300
 but the main thing you need to come is 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.179
 prevents their limits of control 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.609
 but those moments you can just find your 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.629
 leg means you can look at the clock well 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:32.900
 and then 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 n we will come to the conclusion that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.690
 therefore these papers are mandatory 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.340
 control 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 n 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.350
 in modern basketball of course 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.730
 time the singer speaks for himself 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.239
 much and so we 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.050
 let's not forget which way 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.690
 will have the right left hand 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.410
 and therefore the same exercise is the same 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.760
 amount of time or maybe even 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.620
 more 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 there is a weak 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.560
 Yu 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.640
 Yu 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.870
 So 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.880
 but of course sales growth we 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.899
 come here to the site 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.619
 rubles will execute the child 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.079
 Approximately in public a date 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.579
 built the main rack 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.529
 basketball players but in order to 

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:24.640
 feel yourself 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.560
 to own control but I will note 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.590
 you can drive early anytime 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.930
 any number 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.330
 on any balts judge this can 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.400
 anticipate 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.040
 in any position 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.340
 experience only long 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.230
 workout 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.770
 can merge 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.920
 as a player equipped now i want to give 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.480
 one tip for beginners 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.030
 first of all the prime minister like 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.020
 you should start the prime 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.820
 any situation on the site after school 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.440
 on the street have become 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.760
 used to 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.420
 find a common language with the ball and he will answer you 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 on this understanding and will do next 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.659
 this is important only the core 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.759
 only now if everything goes well 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.850
 km h 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.839
 result in the development of 3 thousand 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:16.370
 fruitful training for you 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.930
 neighbors
