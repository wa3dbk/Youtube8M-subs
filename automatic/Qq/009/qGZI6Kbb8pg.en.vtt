00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
mainframe in the middle there which is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.100 
mainframe in the middle there which is
on<00:01:28.799> elevation<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.750> below<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
on elevation to and then below that

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.980 
on elevation to and then below that
would<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.799> elevation<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.720> kind

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
would be elevation one so this is kind

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.960 
would be elevation one so this is kind
of<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.340> there's<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.700> no

center<00:01:38.009> area<00:01:38.119> which<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.270> kind<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.540> neat<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.900> lot

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
center area which is kind of neat a lot

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.469 
center area which is kind of neat a lot
of<00:01:40.350> walls<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:41.430> hitter<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.759> taurine<00:01:42.090> this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
of walls some hitter and taurine this

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.780 
of walls some hitter and taurine this
looks<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.869> fun<00:01:43.290> map<00:01:43.560> though<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
looks like a fun map though so here the

any square within her range and line of
fire<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.510> awesome<00:03:44.220> she<00:03:45.220> has<00:03:45.400> six<00:03:45.760> range

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
fire that is awesome she has six range

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.260 
fire that is awesome she has six range
so<00:03:46.330> that<00:03:46.360> means<00:03:46.660> she<00:03:46.840> can<00:03:47.020> do<00:03:47.200> quake<00:03:47.890> at<00:03:48.430> range

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
so that means she can do quake at range

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.290 
so that means she can do quake at range
if<00:03:49.810> she<00:03:50.380> has<00:03:50.680> line<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.459> fire<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:51.970> square

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
if she has line of fire to that square

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.890 
if she has line of fire to that square
very<00:03:53.170> very<00:03:53.410> cool<00:03:53.770> she<00:03:54.340> does<00:03:54.700> have<00:03:55.000> TK<00:03:55.510> starting

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
unless they have two tokens on them but

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.780 
unless they have two tokens on them but
if<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.110> have<00:04:44.230> a<00:04:44.340> someone<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.490> can<00:04:45.610> put

if you have a someone that can put

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.960 
if you have a someone that can put
tokens<00:04:46.180> on<00:04:46.330> them<00:04:46.540> which<00:04:47.640> there's<00:04:48.640> you<00:04:48.910> know

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
plenty of characters that can do that

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.410 
plenty of characters that can do that
then<00:04:50.500> you're<00:04:50.920> using<00:04:51.220> that<00:04:51.430> character<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:52.300> its

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
then you're using that character to its

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.660 
then you're using that character to its
fullest<00:04:52.810> then<00:04:53.290> we<00:04:53.410> have<00:04:53.530> thunder<00:04:54.100> with<00:04:54.640> a

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
trait keeping you safe sis when Thunder

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.490 
trait keeping you safe sis when Thunder
is<00:04:57.760> adjacent<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.390> a<00:04:58.480> character<00:04:58.930> named

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
is adjacent to a character named

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.370 
is adjacent to a character named
lightning<00:05:00.130> he<00:05:00.520> can<00:05:00.700> use<00:05:00.850> willpower<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:02.170> you're

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
lightning he can use willpower so you're

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.510 
lightning he can use willpower so you're
going<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.530> want<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.770> keep<00:05:02.860> those<00:05:03.070> two<00:05:03.310> together

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
going to want to keep those two together

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.210 
going to want to keep those two together
so<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.360> Thunder<00:05:04.810> can<00:05:05.020> have<00:05:05.320> willpower<00:05:05.590> also

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
so the Thunder can have willpower also

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.640 
so the Thunder can have willpower also
as<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.340> special<00:05:06.760> attack<00:05:07.290> concentrated<00:05:08.290> Thunder

as a special attack concentrated Thunder

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.850 
as a special attack concentrated Thunder
Thunder<00:05:09.310> can<00:05:09.580> use<00:05:09.850> energy<00:05:10.210> explosion<00:05:11.080> when<00:05:11.680> he

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
Thunder can use energy explosion when he

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.490 
Thunder can use energy explosion when he
does<00:05:12.160> a<00:05:12.190> hit<00:05:12.670> targets<00:05:13.210> given<00:05:13.510> an<00:05:13.600> action<00:05:14.080> token

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
does a hit targets given an action token

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.920 
does a hit targets given an action token
in<00:05:14.680> addition<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.400> normal<00:05:15.580> effects<00:05:16.150> see

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
in addition to the normal effects see

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.560 
in addition to the normal effects see
what<00:05:17.470> I<00:05:17.500> mean<00:05:17.590> use<00:05:18.370> energy<00:05:18.580> explosion<00:05:19.360> and

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
what I mean use energy explosion and

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.450 
what I mean use energy explosion and
then<00:05:19.780> you<00:05:20.020> can<00:05:20.200> give<00:05:20.380> them<00:05:20.530> an<00:05:20.680> action<00:05:21.040> token

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
then you can give them an action token

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.520 
then you can give them an action token
so<00:05:21.730> that's<00:05:21.940> where<00:05:22.300> Thunder<00:05:23.170> can<00:05:23.350> give

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
so that's where Thunder can give

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.740 
so that's where Thunder can give
