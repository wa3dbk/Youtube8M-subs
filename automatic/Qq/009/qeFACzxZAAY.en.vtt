00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
wheels on and off more easily than in

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.999 
wheels on and off more easily than in
the<00:05:03.550> past<00:05:03.759> and<00:05:05.430> also<00:05:06.430> accept<00:05:06.789> standard<00:05:07.360> sized

the past and also accept standard sized
rollerblade<00:05:09.009> wheels<00:05:11.099> that's<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.279> pro<00:05:12.490> roller

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
rollerblade wheels that's the pro roller

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.519 
rollerblade wheels that's the pro roller
X<00:05:12.969> series<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:13.809> three<00:05:14.020> sizes

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.139 

these<00:05:18.529> are<00:05:18.739> in<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:18.949> 300<00:05:19.369> dollar<00:05:19.549> range

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:20.149 
these are in the 300 dollar range

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:24.069 
these are in the 300 dollar range
I<00:05:20.269> believe<00:05:20.559> low<00:05:21.559> 300s<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:22.579> the<00:05:22.699> 100<00:05:23.299> the<00:05:23.809> 200

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:24.079 
I believe low 300s for the 100 the 200

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:27.549 
I believe low 300s for the 100 the 200
is<00:05:24.469> up<00:05:24.679> around<00:05:25.239> 390<00:05:26.239> and<00:05:26.929> then<00:05:27.079> I<00:05:27.110> believe<00:05:27.439> the

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:27.559 
is up around 390 and then I believe the

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.249 
is up around 390 and then I believe the
400<00:05:27.769> maybe<00:05:28.129> a<00:05:28.279> little<00:05:28.489> over<00:05:28.759> 3<00:05:29.089> over<00:05:29.299> the<00:05:29.449> $400

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
400 maybe a little over 3 over the $400

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.499 
400 maybe a little over 3 over the $400
range
