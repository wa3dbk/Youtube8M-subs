00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
do is draw some lines on brother so that

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.920 
do is draw some lines on brother so that
we<00:00:32.609> got<00:00:33.449> wasting<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> glue<00:00:34.289> and<00:00:34.530> only<00:00:34.770> put<00:00:35.010> glue

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
we got wasting it glue and only put glue

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.850 
we got wasting it glue and only put glue
bits<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.530> actually<00:00:37.620> need<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:39.649> go<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
bits that we actually need to go to the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.210 
bits that we actually need to go to the
bay

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.780 

let<00:00:50.220> me<00:00:50.310> put<00:00:50.520> some<00:00:50.550> equivalent<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> light

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
let me put some equivalent to the light

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.420 
let me put some equivalent to the light
you<00:00:53.790> spread<00:00:54.240> it<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.510> evenly

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.600 

make<00:00:59.850> sure<00:00:59.880> we've<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> edges

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
make sure we've got some on the edges

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:09.430 
make sure we've got some on the edges
that's<00:01:02.610> where<00:01:02.790> it's<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.060> to<00:01:03.150> come<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.420> first

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
two wires on the robbers sort of assures

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.160 
two wires on the robbers sort of assures
that<00:01:30.420> there's<00:01:31.420> no<00:01:31.600> peace<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:32.530> I've<00:01:32.650> missed

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that there's no peace that I've missed

too much and it's on my gun at first

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.730 
too much and it's on my gun at first
might<00:01:45.790> as<00:01:45.940> well<00:01:46.060> start<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.660> joy<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:50.320> next

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
might as well start to joy the next

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:59.790 
might as well start to joy the next
layer<00:01:54.600> shoulder<00:01:56.670> go<00:01:57.869> near<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.080> edges<00:01:59.260> it's

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
layer shoulder go near the edges it's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.500 
layer shoulder go near the edges it's
going<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.040> be<00:02:00.160> cool<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.790> edges<00:02:01.060> as<00:02:01.210> most

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
going to be cool the edges as most

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.080 
going to be cool the edges as most
important<00:02:02.080> what's<00:02:02.290> up<00:02:02.560> just<00:02:02.800> got<00:02:02.860> stuck<00:02:03.850> get

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
important what's up just got stuck get

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:20.700 
important what's up just got stuck get
back<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.630> these

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.710 

so<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> matter<00:02:21.640> if<00:02:21.790> you've<00:02:21.970> got<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.240> little<00:02:22.510> bit

so the matter if you've got a little bit

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.300 
so the matter if you've got a little bit
extra<00:02:23.430> some<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.610> bits<00:02:24.850> because<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:27.100> its

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
extra some of the bits because of its

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.130 
extra some of the bits because of its
waters<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:29.230> cup<00:02:29.530> pour<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.460> right<00:02:30.690> after<00:02:31.690> rule

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
waters so cup pour that right after rule

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.960 
waters so cup pour that right after rule
war<00:02:34.410> ok<00:02:35.410> now<00:02:35.710> we<00:02:35.770> wait<00:02:36.340> for<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.670> couple<00:02:36.940> of

war ok now we wait for a couple of

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.210 
war ok now we wait for a couple of
minutes<00:02:39.840> I'll<00:02:40.840> just<00:02:41.020> try<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.320> speed<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.710> up<00:02:41.950> for

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
minutes I'll just try to speed it up for

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.710 
minutes I'll just try to speed it up for
the<00:02:42.280> sake<00:02:42.490> of<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:42.700> video<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.090> little<00:02:43.300> bit<00:02:43.510> by

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
the sake of this video a little bit by

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.770 
the sake of this video a little bit by
waving<00:02:44.590> around<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:45.700> see<00:02:45.880> I've<00:02:46.030> got<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.270> fan<00:02:46.600> in

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
waving around you see I've got a fan in

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
waving around you see I've got a fan in
the<00:02:46.870> back<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.230> here<00:02:47.500> as<00:02:47.620> well<00:02:47.970> smell<00:02:48.970> Donnelly

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
the back on here as well smell Donnelly

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.890 
the back on here as well smell Donnelly
blows<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.070> toxic<00:02:51.610> fumes<00:02:51.970> away<00:02:52.330> from<00:02:52.540> her<00:02:52.630> face

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
blows the toxic fumes away from her face

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.860 
blows the toxic fumes away from her face
but<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.560> also<00:02:54.000> speeds<00:02:55.000> up<00:02:55.180> their<00:02:55.510> drawing

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
but it also speeds up their drawing

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.510 
but it also speeds up their drawing
process<00:02:56.140> move<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:58.710> just<00:02:59.710> making<00:03:00.070> sure<00:03:00.100> its

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
process move it just making sure its

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.869 
process move it just making sure its
pretty<00:03:00.760> much<00:03:00.850> dry

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:14.420 

10<00:03:06.879> why<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.890> bio<00:03:09.159> age<00:03:12.209> line<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.540> rubber<00:03:13.750> up

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
10 why the bio age line the rubber up

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.180 
10 why the bio age line the rubber up
just<00:03:15.430> about<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.879> aim<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.090> boost<00:03:17.970> straight<00:03:20.190> and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
just about the aim of boost straight and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.780 
just about the aim of boost straight and
we<00:03:21.430> put<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.730> on

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.490 

and<00:03:25.090> roll<00:03:25.420> words<00:03:25.719> make<00:03:25.989> sure<00:03:26.200> there's<00:03:26.379> no

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
and roll words make sure there's no

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.839 
and roll words make sure there's no
bubbles<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.219> makes<00:03:27.430> good<00:03:27.670> contact<00:03:27.939> every<00:03:28.480> way

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
bubbles and makes good contact every way

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.809 
bubbles and makes good contact every way
notice<00:03:30.849> how<00:03:31.030> I've<00:03:31.150> got<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.599> handle<00:03:32.170> sticking

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
notice how I've got the handle sticking

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.679 
notice how I've got the handle sticking
out<00:03:33.819> from<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.510> table<00:03:34.750> because<00:03:35.590> if<00:03:35.739> you<00:03:35.859> put<00:03:36.099> it

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
out from the table because if you put it

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.780 
out from the table because if you put it
on<00:03:37.689> here<00:03:38.079> and<00:03:38.439> you<00:03:38.620> push<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:39.099> how<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.400> could

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
on here and you push to how you could

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.000 
on here and you push to how you could
snap<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.180> bio<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:41.170> it's<00:03:41.319> good<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.590> have<00:03:41.709> just

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
snap the bio so it's good to have just

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.559 
snap the bio so it's good to have just
