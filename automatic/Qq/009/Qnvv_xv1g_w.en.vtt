00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:09.780
 namaste i'm seen brive welcome back to 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.620
 game dave pycon we immediately got one 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.049
 news that the wind is a very good one 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.160
 great success and therefore today what 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.529
 let 's do another good thing 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.390
 perfect game 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 ok so let's do another one moment 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.859
 gone we sell the research we have 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000
 the game for the series will be a bit of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.340
 new things 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.070
 even wild west like what today 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 we do very often you told me about 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.420
 wait for it to finish selling a 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.329
 game to make another one is not convenient 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.590
 I have to say why it is so says fairies 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.969
 make more games and sell them 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.379
 at the same time it means anyway 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.559
 have a market share 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.969
 the first thing I would do we give 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.390
 account cost to put everything 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.329
 within 120,000 we do our first 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.760
 engine angel I recommend not engine 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.710
 that I feel too much too many people of 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.710
 direct in and we do the first is then gen 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.479
 hamas engine 1 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.820
 indeed 1.0 that this is our first 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.470
 engine we build let's see how 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.960
 it works you see that there are gods 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 remaining that are here also comes to us 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.729
 explained is basically we turn off the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.479
 time I do two at a time because I am 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.009
 I 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 and in addition we are also accumulating a little 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.880
 of research 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.229
 we will have an engine that we can use for 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.700
 the next game I want to own 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.670
 to do so much awaited coals did 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.079
 28 thousand sales with 198 thousand therefore a 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.399
 quite a lot of pennies did do strength 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.049
 force we finish the new graphics engine 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.759
 game engine and even graphic let's say 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.259
 and here it is finished ok by now complete and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.810
 now we can use it for the next one 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.700
 so let's play let's make a new one 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.080
 game we call it had a lot of 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.979
 proposals and so I really like being able to 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.430
 do will be a 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.030
 a pilot ventures and made by chris sul 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.890
 his comment always for testing with the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.269
 our new namastè gene that comes 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.120
 comes and will be called boat of the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.519
 caribbean that maybe will also have a sequel 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.290
 later however it costs 40 thousand e 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.239
 let's see what we can do 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.840
 use as you see the version graphic 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:41.159
 2 x I had the new engine ok 1 and 1 e 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.690
 here as you can see we have the 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.230
 possibility to add the save 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.799
 of the game and the linear story then 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.340
 meanwhile we have to put for a game 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.640
 of adventure we put some history but 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.709
 not too much this high and this one 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.120
 let's put it here let's see how it turns out 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.120
 without focusing too much 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.349
 ok i see a 6 3 dialogues enough 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.120
 low because in any case a game 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.859
 adventure artificial intelligence 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.510
 we put it here very high level design 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:25.010
 so let's get this down and see if 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.010
 it works so hopefully well 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.109
 ok he stopped i was thinking born 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.769
 ok now the technology points arrive 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.090
 ok we are 88 and for the third we can 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.829
 put in place that basic sound 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.349
 we can put bonus sound that costs 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:44.669
 slightly more but it helps us a lot 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:47.370
 but let's pull down graphics and sound let's see 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:50.040
 immediately war design as it is structured 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.769
 or level award are level design lo 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.239
 we have seen before that architecture 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.019
 graphic of the world world instead 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.359
 just the graphics in general or better 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.139
 how it comes about as it is made 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.810
 we put more graphics and more sound is a bit 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:10.500
 less than word design 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.340
 let's see what turns up ok 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.599
 they are saying some exact some 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.389
 is having a bit of a slice of fun 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.260
 market is not simply a thing 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.060
 so 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.690
 and in fact we have target audiences like 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.140
 search possible research here we are 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.729
 doing a lot of points right now 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:36.750
 it is not the best of life yet 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:39.030
 we see the bugs to take off a little ok with 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.280
 18 14 maybe we did a new one 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.650
 no no record yet 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.099
 new combo and the combo is also fine 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.909
 so pirates and adventure works well 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.909
 let 's try to release the game 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.280
 while we sell we do a 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.789
 new research we make them target 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.650
 audience so we have a little something from in 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:03.150
 more to give for you let's see how it went 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:07.500
 carakan 8 of the caribbean ahi ahi ahi ah well 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:17.460
 by the six a bit low in fact from the data 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:20.969
 average plus 76 61 88 87 from the six and a half hours of 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.690
 media have already seen pirates written 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:29.940
 adventure works well together and there is 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:33.300
 the vein that would be the bad luck or saw that 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.950
 region you are and is going to release too 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.930
 she is a console that will be at the master 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.610
 system we'll see in a while so much we are 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.800
 all right 26 so we did a 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.900
 good mons killed and now practically 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.150
 when we develop a new game there 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.340
 I show you right because it makes us 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.870
 tutorial I don't do this 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.570
 episode I expect next we can 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.320
 choose whether to play everyone or play 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.870
 for only the 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.580
 immature or over 18 sixteen 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.860
 years I do n't remember or a game with 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.460
 a target only for young people 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:13.070
 ok with this is all i would say we can 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:15.470
 maybe search for the right gamepad for 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:21.070
 let a little time pass here 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:24.550
 working well from sales by 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.550
 strength boy 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.189
 ok we have the game pad now we can 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:40.839
 install it in the next engine for 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:44.110
 do it better show you a moment i 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:46.209
 topic that we still definitely have 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.619
 I will be racing soon I already have it 

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:49.929
 mind one but still keep on 

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:52.199
 write the comments below this video 

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:55.330
 I will choose what you get the more I like it 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.830
 and let's go on the gaming story to finish 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.509
 this was the caribbean boat 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.659
 made money if you're doing it 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:04.119
 earn again but they are on 63 thousand of 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:06.009
 gain for now we have 600 ago but 

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:08.499
 also and see you next episode 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:13.110
 of game that by with me are brive lists 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:13.110
 namastè and be breil
