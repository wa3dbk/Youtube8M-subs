all<00:00:02.040> right<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.429> early<00:00:02.700> July<00:00:03.140> and<00:00:04.640> what<00:00:05.640> we

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
all right this is early July and what we

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.259 
all right this is early July and what we
have<00:00:05.940> here<00:00:06.020> is<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.080> mixed<00:00:07.500> population<00:00:08.220> from<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
have here is a mixed population from a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.200 
have here is a mixed population from a
cross<00:00:09.660> between<00:00:10.139> an<00:00:10.710> exotic<00:00:11.070> naked<00:00:11.580> barley<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
cross between an exotic naked barley and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.890 
cross between an exotic naked barley and
a<00:00:12.929> British<00:00:13.139> barley<00:00:14.000> so<00:00:15.000> we've<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> mixture

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
a British barley so we've got a mixture

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.599 
a British barley so we've got a mixture
of<00:00:16.520> covered<00:00:17.520> or<00:00:17.910> hold<00:00:18.240> barley<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.430> make<00:00:20.430> it

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
of covered or hold barley and make it

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.730 
of covered or hold barley and make it
barley<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:23.119> problem<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:25.380> native

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
barley a problem we have with native

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.160 
barley a problem we have with native
barley<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.460> generally<00:00:27.090> poor<00:00:27.330> establishment

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
barley is generally poor establishment

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.460 
barley is generally poor establishment
especially<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.890> spring<00:00:29.779> when<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.019> soil<00:00:31.199> is

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
especially in spring when the soil is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.880 
especially in spring when the soil is
quite<00:00:31.740> cold<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.309> March<00:00:33.110> we<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.590> round

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
quite cold in March we can get round

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.889 
quite cold in March we can get round
that<00:00:35.780> by<00:00:36.780> sowing<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:37.649> later<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> spring

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
that by sowing a bit later in the spring

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.850 
that by sowing a bit later in the spring
perhaps<00:00:39.899> into<00:00:40.379> April<00:00:41.090> then<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.860> lower

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
perhaps into April then we have a lower

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.250 
perhaps into April then we have a lower
yield<00:00:44.250> potential<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.690> more<00:00:45.899> vulnerable

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
yield potential and it's more vulnerable

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.850 
yield potential and it's more vulnerable
to<00:00:46.320> drought<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:48.210> other<00:00:48.360> way<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:49.140> warmer

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to drought the other way to get warmer

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.240 
to drought the other way to get warmer
soil<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.430> better<00:00:50.940> crop<00:00:51.329> establishment<00:00:51.530> is<00:00:52.530> by

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
soil and better crop establishment is by

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.670 
soil and better crop establishment is by
sowing<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> autumn<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.500> course<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
sowing in the autumn of course that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.060 
sowing in the autumn of course that
means<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.070> need<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.520> winter<00:00:57.030> hardy<00:00:58.070> naked

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
means we need a a winter hardy naked

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
means we need a a winter hardy naked
barley<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.850> suitable<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.480> sowing<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
barley that's suitable for sowing in the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.439 
barley that's suitable for sowing in the
autumn<00:01:01.550> now<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> plants<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.359> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
autumn now all the plants in this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.020 
autumn now all the plants in this
population<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.470> survived<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.369> harsh<00:01:05.790> winter

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
population have survived a harsh winter

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.340 
population have survived a harsh winter
down<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.200> minus<00:01:07.560> 19<00:01:08.010> at<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.400> stage<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.170> what

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
down to minus 19 at one stage so what

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.429 
down to minus 19 at one stage so what
what<00:01:10.770> I'm<00:01:10.920> doing<00:01:11.220> today<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:12.290> selecting<00:01:13.290> out

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
what I'm doing today is selecting out

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.270 
what I'm doing today is selecting out
the<00:01:14.340> naked<00:01:14.760> grain<00:01:15.030> plants<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:17.009> know

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the naked grain plants that we know

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
the naked grain plants that we know
because<00:01:18.119> they've<00:01:18.270> gone<00:01:18.390> through<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> winter

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
because they've gone through the winter

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.039 
because they've gone through the winter
or<00:01:19.740> winter<00:01:20.070> hardy<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:21.960> be

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
or winter hardy and then these will be

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899 
or winter hardy and then these will be
grown<00:01:22.290> next<00:01:22.710> year<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> start<00:01:23.729> doing

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
grown next year and we can start doing

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.440 
grown next year and we can start doing
some<00:01:24.090> more<00:01:24.570> selections<00:01:25.080> from<00:01:25.200> those<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.360> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
some more selections from those so you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.090 
some more selections from those so you
can<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.979> naked<00:01:29.700> grain<00:01:30.590> hunt<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
can see this is a naked grain hunt and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.840 
can see this is a naked grain hunt and
that's<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.400> two<00:01:32.640> row<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.850> grains

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that's a two row you can see the grains

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.140 
that's a two row you can see the grains
just<00:01:36.180> starting<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.750> pop<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.759> these<00:01:41.880> two

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
just starting to pop out so these two

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.800 
just starting to pop out so these two
rows<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.200> go<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.560> bucket<00:01:43.799> together

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
rows they all go in the bucket together

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.770 
rows they all go in the bucket together
and<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.439> thrashed<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.780> sown

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and then these will be thrashed and sown

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.280 
and then these will be thrashed and sown
as<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> mixed<00:01:49.290> population<00:01:49.409> next<00:01:50.250> year<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:52.140> then

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
as a mixed population next year and then

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.469 
as a mixed population next year and then
we've<00:01:52.439> also<00:01:52.590> got

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.719 

six<00:01:56.479> rows<00:01:59.500> all<00:02:00.500> these<00:02:00.710> six<00:02:01.010> rows<00:02:01.250> because

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
six rows all these six rows because

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.730 
six rows all these six rows because
they've<00:02:02.060> got<00:02:02.210> six<00:02:02.600> rows<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:03.020> grains<00:02:03.290> in<00:02:05.740> threes

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
they've got six rows of grains in threes

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.920 
they've got six rows of grains in threes
here<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:09.020> three<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.800> side<00:02:10.690> through<00:02:11.690> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
here so three that side through the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.490 
here so three that side through the
other<00:02:12.020> side<00:02:12.320> sexy<00:02:13.010> get<00:02:13.190> more<00:02:13.610> grain<00:02:13.850> Spurrier

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
other side sexy get more grain Spurrier

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.199 
other side sexy get more grain Spurrier
but<00:02:15.500> generally<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.250> grains<00:02:16.490> are<00:02:16.730> smaller<00:02:17.060> and

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
but generally the grains are smaller and

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.320 
but generally the grains are smaller and
generally<00:02:20.209> get<00:02:20.450> fewer<00:02:20.870> ears<00:02:21.530> per<00:02:21.890> plant<00:02:22.330> so

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
generally get fewer ears per plant so

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.390 
generally get fewer ears per plant so
you<00:02:23.360> don't<00:02:23.870> necessarily<00:02:24.170> get<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.890> higher<00:02:25.130> yield

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
you don't necessarily get a higher yield

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.010 
you don't necessarily get a higher yield
off<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.790> six<00:02:26.030> rows<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:27.560> selecting<00:02:28.489> out<00:02:28.610> both

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
off the six rows but selecting out both

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:38.830 
off the six rows but selecting out both
six<00:02:30.020> row<00:02:30.200> time<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.680> row<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:36.170> row<00:02:36.730> so<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:37.970> one

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
six row time to row to row so just one

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
six row time to row to row so just one
row<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.170> grains<00:02:39.470> on<00:02:39.650> each<00:02:39.800> side<00:02:40.269> two<00:02:41.269> rows<00:02:41.860> so

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
row of grains on each side two rows so

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.900 
row of grains on each side two rows so
they'll<00:02:43.010> be<00:02:43.160> growing<00:02:43.370> as<00:02:43.519> separate

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
they'll be growing as separate

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.800 
they'll be growing as separate
populations<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.459> then<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:47.060> make<00:02:47.239> selections

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
populations and then we make selections
