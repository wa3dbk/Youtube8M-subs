00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
outside which I can actually hear really

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.789 
outside which I can actually hear really
clearly<00:03:20.409> I<00:03:21.280> can<00:03:21.489> hear<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.000> fine<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.799> you

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
also said in a comment that it's

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.910 
also said in a comment that it's
referring<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.659> the<00:03:25.810> meteor<00:03:26.170> which<00:03:26.379> isn't<00:03:26.680> a

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
referring to the meteor which isn't a

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.130 
referring to the meteor which isn't a
bad<00:03:27.340> interpretation<00:03:28.180> because<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.720> meteor<00:03:28.989> is

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
bad interpretation because the meteor is

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.259 
bad interpretation because the meteor is
outside<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.530> map<00:03:29.769> obviously<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:31.060> then<00:03:31.180> I

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
outside the map obviously but then I

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.170 
outside the map obviously but then I
came<00:03:31.329> up<00:03:31.930> with<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.140> theory<00:03:32.409> about<00:03:32.530> outer<00:03:32.889> space

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
came up with a theory about outer space

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.270 
came up with a theory about outer space
like<00:03:34.180> what<00:03:35.109> about<00:03:35.290> if<00:03:35.349> they<00:03:35.889> want<00:03:36.099> to<00:03:36.159> go

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
like what about if they want to go

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.160 
like what about if they want to go
bigger<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.819> then<00:03:37.180> they're<00:03:37.540> saying<00:03:37.780> like<00:03:37.959> it's

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
bigger and then they're saying like it's

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.879 
bigger and then they're saying like it's
outside<00:03:38.709> it's<00:03:39.489> outside<00:03:39.909> of<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.180> earth<00:03:40.359> it<00:03:40.599> sir

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
outside it's outside of the earth it sir

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.740 
outside it's outside of the earth it sir
it's<00:03:41.889> in<00:03:42.069> space<00:03:42.340> which<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:43.090> know<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.569> in

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
it's in space which you know it is in

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.300 
it's in space which you know it is in
space<00:03:43.959> we<00:03:44.170> went<00:03:44.379> to<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.560> moon<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:44.889> you've<00:03:45.280> got

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
space we went to the moon so you've got

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.460 
space we went to the moon so you've got
the<00:03:45.489> meter<00:03:45.700> you're<00:03:45.940> outside<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.750> map<00:03:46.930> as<00:03:47.139> well

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
the meter you're outside the map as well

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.009
