00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 the antarctic because of its frigid 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.069
 temperatures is a place where people 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.050
 think there is no life or the truth is 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 that there are few living beings that have been 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.849
 able to adapt to these 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.940
 such extreme temperatures but that's not 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.609
 means that there is no life today we are going to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.340
 talk about the five living beings 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.189
 stranger than a person could 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.439
 find yourself in good antarctica in the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.990
 hypothetical situation that could 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.730
 visit Antarctica obviously for 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.890
 being able to visit Antarctica is necessary 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.590
 A team of professionals have 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.200
 enough money and go well protected from 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.629
 cold because otherwise he would die jce 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.600
 frozen in a matter of a couple of 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.719
 minutes we go there with these species 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 which are tremendously resistant and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.329
 tremendously rare these are the five 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.300
 strangest animals that you can 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.149
 find in antarctica in the first 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.000
 place we have an animal known as 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.650
 the ice fish the continent walk 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.750
 Antarctic is home to a creature 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.050
 ordinary this hair 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.470
 it's practically transparent and instead 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.600
 of having red blood cells in your body 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.190
 It has glycoproteins which are 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.150
 adhere to the pieces of ice 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.680
 body and act as antifreeze 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.110
 very useful adaptation to survive in 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.900
 such a cold medium 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.790
 you can see it is a fish with 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.740
 natural antifreeze we have 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.260
 also the sea spider do not think 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.470
 that in Antarctica there are no spiders because 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.010
 if there are 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.900
 it's really about rare animal 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.450
 specimens that have holes in the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.940
 body where they inhale directly the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.150
 oxygen that is in the water that's why 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.370
 they grow so much over time in 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.370
 other parts of the world these creatures 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.280
 they are small and it is here in Antarctica 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.640
 where the spiders acquire dimensions 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.310
 extraordinary then on the other hand 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.800
 we have the maybe wall of antarctica is 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.600
 an insect belonging to a family 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.180
 that inhabits almost all areas 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.930
 geographic of the known planet also 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.020
 like silverfish the variant that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.990
 He lives in this place as you would expect 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.480
 has antifreeze adaptations yet 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.750
 measuring only 1 to 2 millimeters of 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.450
 long is the largest on land 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.090
 The most amazing thing about this animal is 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.550
 which becomes a frozen solid 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.650
 to thaw when there is a 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.629
 regular basic temperature 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.970
 but if what you have seen seems to you 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.739
 I hope weird to know why we have the 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.900
 crab jet and crab jet and it 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.299
 it's about an animal discovered so 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.819
 recently in a hydrothermal conduit 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.189
 that does not have the proper name yet 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.739
 nicknamed him as yeti crab but he was 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.780
 have to put a scientific name on it 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.900
 Feeds on reproducing bacteria 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.299
 in their chest their greatest rarity is that they live 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.870
 crammed into water vapor ducts 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.530
 in very deep areas of Antarctica to 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.840
 2.5 km or so is believed to be the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.640
 higher population density of animals 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.810
 all over the planet 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.569
 amazing 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.940
 and last of all we have the sponges 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.220
 glass 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.090
 the skeletons of these creatures are from 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.230
 silicone and they have very rare shapes 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.450
 they populate the seabed of the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.270
 continent giving home to other 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.400
 species are like big houses 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.950
 living are huge houses 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.910
 living where they can live 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.710
 thousands of beings as you can see are five 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.660
 very strange animals if I had to 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.020
 choose for me what is the strangest 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.760
 I would definitely choose the crab yeti a 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.620
 type of crab that can feed 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.620
 of the bacteria that your own body 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.830
 generates we are talking about an organism 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.240
 very advanced at the survival level and 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.300
 It is that after all all 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.490
 animals that I have commented to you because they are 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.799
 adapted to extreme levels of 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.580
 cold even many power produce 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.650
 natural substances that act as 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:26.100
 antifreeze because otherwise 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:28.230
 they would freeze and die awesome 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.600
 see how in Antarctica there are also 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.060
 living beings that are capable of resisting 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.060
 these extreme temperatures
