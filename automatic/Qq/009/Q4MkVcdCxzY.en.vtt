into an old whey protein tub makes a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.790 
into an old whey protein tub makes a
little<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.960> easier<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.640> mix<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.850> up<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.559> or<00:00:49.559> i

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
little bit easier to mix it up and or i

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.189 
little bit easier to mix it up and or i
should<00:00:49.950> say<00:00:50.100> scoop<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> that's

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
should say scoop it out and so that's

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.029
