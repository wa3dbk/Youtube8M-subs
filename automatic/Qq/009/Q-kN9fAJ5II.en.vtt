00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and two layers against the grain to make

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
and two layers against the grain to make
it<00:01:36.210> strong<00:01:38.509> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.350> not

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530

with<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.120> skate<00:02:39.390> tool<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:41.850> for<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
wooden ones you I think you have to use

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.330 
wooden ones you I think you have to use
a<00:02:44.970> one<00:02:45.930> sixteenth<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:47.420> drill<00:02:48.420> bit<00:02:49.340> for

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
a one sixteenth of drill bit for

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.050 
a one sixteenth of drill bit for
drilling<00:02:50.580> your<00:02:50.790> hole<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:52.730> that's<00:02:53.730> basically

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
drilling your hole and that's basically

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.290 
drilling your hole and that's basically
how<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.660> do<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.110> oh<00:02:55.550> here's<00:02:56.550> all<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
how you do it oh here's all the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:19.260 
how you do it oh here's all the
materials<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> are<00:02:58.050> going<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.380> need<00:03:00.320> ruler

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:26.830
