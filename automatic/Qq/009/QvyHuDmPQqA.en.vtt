00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
that's that'd be the most comfortable

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
that's that'd be the most comfortable
position<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:20.759> wasn't

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
position and it really wasn't

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.730 
position and it really wasn't
comfortable<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.720> transitioned<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> me

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
comfortable and then transitioned to me

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.990 
so everything's nice and comfy and that
really<00:01:33.810> made<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> huge<00:01:34.079> difference<00:01:34.939> in<00:01:35.939> my

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
really made a huge difference in my

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.620 
really made a huge difference in my
gameplay<00:01:37.640> last<00:01:38.640> night<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.240> playing<00:01:39.540> with

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
gameplay last night I was playing with

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
gameplay last night I was playing with
it<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> first<00:01:40.380> time

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it for the first time

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.610 
it for the first time
and<00:01:41.370> I<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.780> made<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.080> much<00:01:43.260> difference

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
and I really made that much difference

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.690 
and I really made that much difference
like<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.920> trip<00:01:44.160> feed<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
like this trip feed right here I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.860 
like this trip feed right here I
wouldn't<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.090> gotten<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.660> wasn't

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
wouldn't have gotten that if I wasn't

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.650 
wouldn't have gotten that if I wasn't
like<00:01:46.080> sitting<00:01:46.350> comfortably<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.450> makes

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
like sitting comfortably so that makes

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.750 
like sitting comfortably so that makes
all<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> difference<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.590> another<00:01:50.520> reason

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
all the difference and another reason

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.240 
all the difference and another reason
being<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.350> first<00:01:52.800> started

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
being is because when I first started

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.670 
being is because when I first started
another<00:01:53.970> reason<00:01:54.360> being<00:01:54.510> was<00:01:54.750> towards<00:01:55.320> why<00:01:55.650> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
another reason being was towards why I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.700 
another reason being was towards why I
didn't<00:01:56.210> adjust<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.420> fast<00:01:57.690> black<00:01:58.140> ops<00:01:58.320> II<00:01:58.590> was

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
didn't adjust so fast black ops II was

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.100 
didn't adjust so fast black ops II was
because<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.220> was<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.240> hoping<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
because I was really hoping that it

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.570 
because I was really hoping that it
would<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.470> monitor<00:02:01.830> for<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.160> like

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
would be like monitor for to like

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.580 
would be like monitor for to like
subconsciously<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.270> was<00:02:03.690> just<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.020> expecting

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
subconsciously I was just like expecting

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.290

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
like I was trying to make the game I was

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.790 
like I was trying to make the game I was
trying<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.540> force<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.960> game<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.470> like<00:02:07.590> mono

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
trying to force the game to be like mono

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
to adjust the game you have to be

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.110 
to adjust the game you have to be
open-minded<00:02:10.590> about<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.190> game<00:02:11.400> otherwise

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
you're not gonna get good at it so my my

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.120 
you're not gonna get good at it so my my
play<00:02:14.940> style<00:02:15.180> definitely<00:02:15.600> changed<00:02:16.020> right<00:02:16.950> here

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
you can you could see like I'm just not

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.780 
you can you could see like I'm just not
as<00:02:19.620> um<00:02:19.860> I'm<00:02:20.790> still<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.980> basically<00:02:23.400> towards

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
as um I'm still it's basically towards

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.240 
as um I'm still it's basically towards
the<00:02:23.880> same<00:02:24.120> way<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:24.930> wasn't<00:02:25.470> one<00:02:25.560> r42<00:02:25.980> but

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
the same way as that wasn't one r42 but

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.310 
the same way as that wasn't one r42 but
like<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.760> little<00:02:26.910> slower<00:02:27.270> because<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
like just a little slower because the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.830 
like just a little slower because the
game<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.739> slower<00:02:29.090> it's<00:02:30.090> not<00:02:30.239> as<00:02:30.360> fast<00:02:30.600> and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
game is slower it's not as fast and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.970 
game is slower it's not as fast and
finally<00:02:33.840> getting<00:02:34.020> my<00:02:34.140> groove<00:02:34.380> back

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.000
