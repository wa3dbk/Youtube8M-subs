carry two full-sized digital SLRs you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.440 
carry two full-sized digital SLRs you
know<00:01:50.100> that's<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.909> fair<00:01:51.150> amount<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
know that's that's a fair amount of

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.940 
know that's that's a fair amount of
weight<00:01:51.659> when<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> chuck<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.409> your<00:01:52.590> gear<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
weight when you chuck all your gear in a

weight when you chuck all your gear in a
bag<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.850> want<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.659> heavy-duty

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
bag like this so you want a heavy-duty

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.460 
bag like this so you want a heavy-duty
handle<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:57.060> take<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.689> weight<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.200> make<00:01:58.320> sure

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
handle to take that weight and make sure

heavy-duty<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.470> we<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:01.979> two<00:02:02.159> other

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
heavy-duty because we have two other

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.980 
heavy-duty because we have two other
bags<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:02.880> think-tank<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> foresight<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
bags from think-tank the foresight and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.870 
bags from think-tank the foresight and
the<00:02:04.200> take<00:02:04.439> off<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.070> noticed<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> handle

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the take off and I just noticed a handle

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.150 
the take off and I just noticed a handle
mechanism<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:07.020> little<00:02:07.380> beefier<00:02:07.799> than<00:02:07.829> those

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
mechanism is a little beefier than those

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.800 
mechanism is a little beefier than those
other<00:02:08.369> two<00:02:08.579> bags<00:02:08.850> which<00:02:09.149> i<00:02:09.269> think<00:02:09.329> is<00:02:09.570> a<00:02:09.600> good

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
other two bags which i think is a good

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.870 
other two bags which i think is a good
thing<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.829> other<00:02:10.950> thing<00:02:11.220> you'll<00:02:11.340> notice<00:02:11.640> too

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
thing the other thing you'll notice too

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.840 
thing the other thing you'll notice too
the<00:02:12.239> handle<00:02:12.540> mechanism<00:02:13.079> itself<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.850> external

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
the handle mechanism itself is external

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.569 
the handle mechanism itself is external

Sigma lens I find the tripod mount is a
little<00:05:31.229> bit<00:05:31.349> bulky<00:05:31.740> so<00:05:32.310> it's<00:05:32.520> easier<00:05:32.820> to<00:05:32.880> slide

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
little bit bulky so it's easier to slide

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.300 
little bit bulky so it's easier to slide
the<00:05:33.389> lens<00:05:33.599> in<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:33.990> out<00:05:34.110> without<00:05:34.349> this<00:05:34.710> on<00:05:35.009> and

the lens in and out without this on and

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.879 
the lens in and out without this on and
then<00:05:35.400> I<00:05:35.430> still<00:05:35.729> have<00:05:35.910> room<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.449> just<00:05:36.750> lay<00:05:37.710> the

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
then I still have room to just lay the

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.510 
then I still have room to just lay the
mount<00:05:38.099> off<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.699> side
