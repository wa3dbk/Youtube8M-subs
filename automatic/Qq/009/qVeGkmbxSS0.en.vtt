you're taking a look at a slightly
modified<00:00:04.640> train<00:00:05.640> yard<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.000> decided<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.569> take

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
modified train yard I decided to take

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.350 
modified train yard I decided to take
out<00:00:06.990> my<00:00:07.589> construction<00:00:08.309> crews<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.120> were

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
out my construction crews that were

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.890 
out my construction crews that were
along<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.500> line<00:00:11.250> here<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.389> decided<00:00:12.750> that

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
along this line here and I decided that

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.129 
along this line here and I decided that
this<00:00:13.740> whole<00:00:13.920> table<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.429> going<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.880> be<00:00:15.139> for

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this whole table is just going to be for

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.349 
this whole table is just going to be for
my<00:00:16.410> trains<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.520> train<00:00:17.880> engine<00:00:18.090> shed<00:00:18.270> has

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359

been<00:00:18.539> moved<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.199> there's<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.439> slightly

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
been moved here and there's a slightly

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.950 
been moved here and there's a slightly
different<00:00:19.980> configuration<00:00:20.390> for<00:00:21.390> all<00:00:21.539> the

into this lovely red train engine shed

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.060 
into this lovely red train engine shed
that<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:54.469> take<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> look<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.829> from

all<00:00:58.379> together<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.770> noticed<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.910> add

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
all together I noticed that I can add

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
all together I noticed that I can add
some<00:01:00.270> more<00:01:00.300> track<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> room

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
some more track a little bit of room

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.529 
some more track a little bit of room
right<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.000> add<00:01:03.090> some<00:01:03.270> more<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.510> I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
right there to add some more so I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.719 
right there to add some more so I
ordered<00:01:03.840> some<00:01:03.899> straight<00:01:04.260> track<00:01:04.589> never<00:01:05.460> have

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
ordered some straight track never have

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.280 
ordered some straight track never have
to<00:01:05.850> order<00:01:06.000> curved<00:01:06.270> track<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.960> sure<00:01:07.140> I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
to order curved track that's for sure I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.990 
to order curved track that's for sure I
always<00:01:07.409> got<00:01:07.650> plenty<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> sets

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
always got plenty of that in the sets

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.230 
always got plenty of that in the sets
that<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.299> buy<00:01:09.770> always<00:01:10.770> always<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.820> too<00:01:12.030> many

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that you buy always always have too many

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
that you buy always always have too many
of<00:01:12.390> them<00:01:12.510> actually<00:01:12.630> let<00:01:13.530> me<00:01:13.619> scoot<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.950> back

of them actually let me scoot you back
here<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
here and you can kind of see the the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.130 
here and you can kind of see the the
whole<00:01:16.950> length<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.939> train<00:01:18.150> yard<00:01:18.420> now

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
whole length here of the train yard now

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
whole length here of the train yard now
I've<00:01:19.290> done<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> few<00:01:19.920> different<00:01:20.189> configurations

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
I've done a few different configurations

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
I've done a few different configurations
here<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> unfortunately<00:01:22.140> no<00:01:22.259> matter<00:01:22.350> how<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
here and unfortunately no matter how I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.520 
here and unfortunately no matter how I
can<00:01:22.799> figure<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.130> cannot<00:01:23.670> add<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.780> trains<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
can figure I cannot add more trains and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
can figure I cannot add more trains and
I<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> add<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.520> trains<00:01:26.820> because<00:01:27.060> Lego

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
I want to add more trains because Lego

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.480 
I want to add more trains because Lego
obviously<00:01:28.080> continues<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> come<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:28.979> with

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
obviously continues to come out with

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
obviously continues to come out with
good<00:01:29.670> trains<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> some<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:30.869> some<00:01:31.110> excellent

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
good trains and some good some excellent

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.890 
good trains and some good some excellent
and<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:32.790> two<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.000> them<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> have

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and I want one or two of them but I have

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.090 
and I want one or two of them but I have
nowhere<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.259> put<00:01:34.409> them

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
nowhere to put them

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
nowhere to put them
that<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.850> problem<00:01:36.329> unless<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.780> create<00:01:37.140> some

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that is my problem unless I create some

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.410 
that is my problem unless I create some
sort<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.590> new<00:01:38.280> train<00:01:38.670> yard<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.270> don't

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
sort of new train yard and I just don't

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.840 
sort of new train yard and I just don't
have<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.049> space<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:41.130> yes<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.700> have

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
have the space and now I know yes I have

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.280 
have the space and now I know yes I have
a<00:01:41.880> complete<00:01:42.270> basement<00:01:42.689> full<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.869> Lego<00:01:43.140> I've

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
a complete basement full of Lego I've

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.370 
a complete basement full of Lego I've
got<00:01:43.439> plenty<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> space<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> am<00:01:45.030> out<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
got plenty of space but I am out so the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.780 
got plenty of space but I am out so the
only<00:01:46.560> option<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.710> expand<00:01:49.790> into

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
only option really is to expand into

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.859 
only option really is to expand into
other<00:01:50.970> parts<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.509> my<00:01:52.229> basement

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.200 

okay<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.159> what<00:01:56.490> I'm<00:01:56.609> thinking<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:57.060> my

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
okay so here is what I'm thinking in my

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.620 
okay so here is what I'm thinking in my
basement<00:01:57.450> next<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> lego<00:01:58.469> city<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
basement next to the lego city here is a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.779 
basement next to the lego city here is a
wall<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.929> is<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.109> load-bearing<00:02:01.530> wall<00:02:01.829> my<00:02:02.579> home

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
wall this is a load-bearing wall my home

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.399 
wall this is a load-bearing wall my home
has<00:02:03.000> there's<00:02:03.329> two<00:02:03.450> more<00:02:03.600> floors<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:04.049> above<00:02:04.259> it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
has there's two more floors up above it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.490 
has there's two more floors up above it
so<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.729> necessary<00:02:06.719> otherwise<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.170> would

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
so this is necessary otherwise I would

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.109 
so this is necessary otherwise I would
have<00:02:07.530> removed<00:02:07.859> it<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.099> expanded<00:02:08.819> my<00:02:08.940> Lego

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
have removed it and expanded my Lego

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.600 
have removed it and expanded my Lego
City<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.989> other<00:02:10.140> side<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> don't<00:02:11.519> really

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
City on the other side so I don't really

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
City on the other side so I don't really
like<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> fact<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.450> having<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.140> table<00:02:13.319> over

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
like the fact of having a table over

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.259 
like the fact of having a table over
there<00:02:13.739> all<00:02:13.860> by<00:02:13.980> its<00:02:14.129> lonesome<00:02:14.489> separated<00:02:15.120> from

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
there all by its lonesome separated from

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.940 
there all by its lonesome separated from
the<00:02:15.390> city<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:16.140> I've<00:02:16.260> never<00:02:16.530> bothered<00:02:16.920> to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the city so I've never bothered to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.550 
the city so I've never bothered to
expand<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.790> however<00:02:18.290> because<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.319> my

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
expand it however because of my

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.070 
expand it however because of my
situation<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.459> train<00:02:20.730> yard<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.180> think

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
situation with the train yard I think

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.680 
situation with the train yard I think
I'm<00:02:22.290> gonna<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:23.129> it<00:02:23.160> which<00:02:23.610> means<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.480> gonna

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
I'm gonna do it which means I'm gonna

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.680 
I'm gonna do it which means I'm gonna
get<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.230> very<00:02:25.560> large<00:02:25.950> table<00:02:26.510> put<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.569> together

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
get a very large table put it together

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.630 
get a very large table put it together
and<00:02:28.049> put<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.650> room<00:02:29.010> right<00:02:29.190> here<00:02:29.250> which

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
and put it in this room right here which

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.009 
and put it in this room right here which
is<00:02:29.670> supposed<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.239> be<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.540> future<00:02:31.349> bathroom<00:02:32.130> and

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
is supposed to be a future bathroom and

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.319 
is supposed to be a future bathroom and
so<00:02:34.019> that's<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:35.730> would<00:02:35.819> have<00:02:36.030> on<00:02:36.060> it

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
so that's and all that would have on it

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.210 
so that's and all that would have on it
is<00:02:36.510> all<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.049> trains<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.620> if<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.860> can<00:02:38.040> get<00:02:38.160> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
is all the trains so if I can get a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.420 
is all the trains so if I can get a
table<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.750> know<00:02:39.870> maybe<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.590> third<00:02:41.099> of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
table that is you know maybe a third of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.009 
table that is you know maybe a third of
the<00:02:41.579> size<00:02:41.760> larger<00:02:42.209> than<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.540> whole<00:02:42.720> area

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
the size larger than that whole area

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.140 
the size larger than that whole area
right<00:02:43.049> there<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.310> holding<00:02:44.670> trains

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
right there and it's just holding trains

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.259 
right there and it's just holding trains
man<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.349> would<00:02:46.500> look<00:02:46.650> good<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.579> if<00:02:47.700> those<00:02:47.940> if

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
man that would look good so if those if

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.210 
man that would look good so if those if
all<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.629> area<00:02:49.170> right<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.560> cleared<00:02:50.010> out

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
all this area right here is cleared out

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.309 
all this area right here is cleared out
of<00:02:50.459> all<00:02:51.030> these<00:02:51.150> trains<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.079> train

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
of all these trains and in the train

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.500 
of all these trains and in the train
yard<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.739> loading<00:02:53.220> over<00:02:53.400> there<00:02:53.549> then<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.239> have

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
yard the loading over there then I have

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.090 
yard the loading over there then I have
a<00:02:55.079> pretty<00:02:55.739> large<00:02:55.980> area<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.849> I<00:02:56.879> can<00:02:57.620> use<00:02:58.620> with

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
a pretty large area that I can use with

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.770 
a pretty large area that I can use with
other<00:02:59.280> stuff<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.819> I<00:02:59.880> have<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> lot<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.209> Lego<00:03:00.480> in

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
other stuff and I have a lot of Lego in

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.629 
other stuff and I have a lot of Lego in
storage<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.280> storage<00:03:02.519> just

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
storage that I have in storage just

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.270 
storage that I have in storage just
because<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:02.910> don't<00:03:03.150> have<00:03:03.389> any<00:03:03.660> room<00:03:03.989> for<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.440> as

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
because I don't have any room for it as

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.819 
because I don't have any room for it as
you<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.549> imagine<00:03:05.639> there's<00:03:06.600> it's<00:03:06.959> pretty<00:03:07.290> it's

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
you can imagine there's it's pretty it's

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.870 
you can imagine there's it's pretty it's
pretty<00:03:09.920> packed<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.280> here

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
pretty packed in here

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.199 
pretty packed in here

hi James yes he agrees anyway so that's

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.470 
hi James yes he agrees anyway so that's
my<00:03:15.720> thoughts<00:03:16.620> anyway<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.519> what<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.030> do<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.359> of

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
my thoughts anyway of what to do and of

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.879 
my thoughts anyway of what to do and of
course<00:03:18.690> if<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:18.989> guys<00:03:19.079> have<00:03:19.230> an<00:03:19.319> ideas<00:03:19.560> on<00:03:19.739> what

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
course if you guys have an ideas on what

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.229 
course if you guys have an ideas on what
maybe<00:03:20.400> should<00:03:20.670> go<00:03:20.700> here<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.030> was<00:03:21.209> thinking

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
maybe should go here I was thinking

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.940 
maybe should go here I was thinking
maybe<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.720> airport<00:03:22.170> or<00:03:22.380> maybe<00:03:22.560> even<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
maybe the airport or maybe even the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.940 
maybe the airport or maybe even the
racetrack<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.669> could<00:03:24.180> go<00:03:24.299> over<00:03:24.329> there<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
racetrack I could go over there and

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.740 
racetrack I could go over there and
maybe<00:03:25.950> even<00:03:26.099> work<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.609> way<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.970> have<00:03:27.269> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
maybe even work out a way to have the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.140 
maybe even work out a way to have the
rails<00:03:28.230> come<00:03:29.010> through<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.579> ocean<00:03:29.880> area

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
rails come through to the ocean area
