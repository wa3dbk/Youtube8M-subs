00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 m 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.470
 she's big on the side where a 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.320
 internal challenge made of humility 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.840
 what's this 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.380
 aulas 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.380
 it's mine 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.960
 so we had the chance to try 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.640
 for an hour to splinter cell 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.619
 blacklist so the next tier of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.900
 adventures of sam fisher sam fisher 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 obviously knows since the first 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 xbox and black list here is a new 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.020
 episode that will stage it in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.970
 the lineage a bit of what we had seen 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.739
 with sprint cell conviction hours but 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.390
 also with some new products 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 we will detail you in this near 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:52.079
 of ten thousand people obviously 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.089
 infiltration it's true the goal is 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.030
 knock out the enemies doubt not be done 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.619
 spot despite everything here are some 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.000
 little sprains to the rule because 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.979
 here we must still please 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 players let's say he does not have 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.040
 necessarily the usual regional filtration 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.080
 and even less to splinter cell 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.760
 so there are several optics that are 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.200
 to ss developers 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.610
 that is to say that in fact it's okay 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.189
 match three gauges on the screen 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.659
 so there is a stealth gauge and 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.880
 a gauge they call the gauge of 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.880
 panther ie the slightest 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.049
 enemy shot down while remaining unobtrusive 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.030
 is going to be a bit like the proa 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.799
 they conceal who eliminates his 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.869
 adversary and who returns in the shadow 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.130
 there is a gauge really a third 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.249
 touch for the nags so the gauge 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.539
 faso is really here if we decide 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.619
 to really fart the lead and 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.329
 lines and all the faults the sites 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.619
 which is on the way and that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.700
 actually corresponds to three play styles 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.679
 to be more or less rewarded 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.539
 because as and when 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.819
 the progress of the level the points we are going 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.920
 get following the adopted style are going 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.299
 fill this up and at the end of the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 mission not only the score is going to be 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.189
 taken into account in relation to the actions 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.200
 of the player and at the same time 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.850
 rewards if we get to optimize at 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.159
 maximize a gauge are going to be 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 different and therefore understand adapt 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.100
 finally also hostile of the player this 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.639
 which makes it different 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.439
 approaches 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.880
 over the missions because here are the 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.899
 missions that we could play we could 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.030
 effectively address several 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.709
 different ways 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.239
 it's a killer 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.239
 the aesthetic sculptures of this control 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.750
 for this session of taking in hand the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.010
 game we were entitled to done to two 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.520
 missions from the first in libya to 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.319
 benghazi 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.200
 that's where it was to infiltrate 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.099
 in a time a police center 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.000
 finally we find very quickly 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.530
 marks it is true that one has 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.170
 displayed it knows it crouching forward 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.970
 we know about the manip and we 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.440
 also finds the execution system 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.319
 was the basis of beliefs that's at 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.030
 to say that in fact every time we 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.280
 does not hit a target with bare hands there is a 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.650
 performance gauge that will fill 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.110
 up to a maximum of three and that's it 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.790
 possible then to mark each 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.560
 guard that appears in the field of 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.709
 vision to execute them at once 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.150
 automatically by pressing y or 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.530
 a triumph then it may seem a 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.140
 small and it's true that it was going in 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.810
 the facts despite all this offers a side 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.360
 action a way out in the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.310
 situations a little bit more delicate 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.240
 which is not negligible in particular 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.890
 especially in this first mission 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.750
 in libya sometimes there were dogs 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.100
 even though they know how to sniff 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.390
 spot and it's true that when we 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.010
 we are well hidden that we expect 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.170
 really not to be discovered 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.360
 can still really serve because 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.740
 must see that in splinter cell 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.760
 still there are some small 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.900
 limits it's not really a game 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.030
 action as soon as we find ourselves in 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.890
 position 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.990
 here is to have a little forced the passage 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.120
 well the viewfinder he leaves a little bit a 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.210
 peanuts it's very difficult really 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.230
 to be very efficient we will say everything 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.970
 simply in the method 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.070
 aso and so it's still these little ones 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.330
 constraints sees this anyway 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.810
 tend to favor the style 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.810
 infiltration 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.870
 the other small innovation of black list 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.790
 beyond the novelties of scenario it is 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.270
 the fact that this is sam evolved into a team 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.220
 and so he has a kind of qg here is a 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.590
 little bit pretty enough done that it's going to be 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.780
 possible to wander to interact with 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.549
 the different npc that make up 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.380
 the team it's going to unlock bonuses to 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.620
 unlock missions and then 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.570
 in fact it serves as the central part of 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.160
 hub to different modes of play it's up to 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.720
 to say that's how it's going to look 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.100
 on the map that will have access to the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.300
 times to solo missions both to 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.400
 cooperative missions that are 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.100
 different and at the same time to missions to 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.990
 versus so it's the famous spy mode 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.340
 against mercenaries is actually the purpose of 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.660
 game it 's a lighter all these elements 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.550
 together that is to say that the slightest 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.140
 least mission to score the least 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.580
 two mythical parties we will do that 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.990
 to unlock funds 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.640
 and these funds will be used for both 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.770
 buy works help for weapons 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.180
 because here it made me fischer has the right to 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.890
 several types of equipment killed early 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.900
 possible to customize the weapons 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.300
 finally a whole lot of options of 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.300
 customization and this money is also going 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.210
 serve to optimize that's the aircraft so 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.760
 the paladin it goes for example if we 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.930
 decides to push the infirmary 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.760
 I'm going to be tougher on mission 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.980
 etc there are all these species 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.260
 of interaction both between the party 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.310
 solo and multi that looks rather 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.310
 interesting for black list 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.229
 graphically hungry I confess 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.699
 to have been pleasantly surprised wind 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.409
 it is true that the version turned on 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.699
 a well equipped pc so obviously 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.919
 it will be necessary to see if on the versions 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.009
 consoles the game also remains fluid too 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.119
 beautiful as detailed so that if you know 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.330
 maybe not the most beautiful game 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:47.379
 infiltration that was given to me to see 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.879
 that's it but it's still in the 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.919
 technical top of the basket 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:53.169
 with really a pretty leak and 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.269
 beautiful effects of management including 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.459
 really really very attitudes 

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:59.439
 worked especially in the simple fact 

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:00.789
 the sam fisher animations that are 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.800
 enough pop following the way 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.929
 he's going to scratch the enemy here so 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.789
 the enemy comes in front of back and that's 

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:08.589
 really a whole range of animations 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.899
 which was worked to take in 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:13.059
 account here are the collisions the 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:15.489
 different the different strangling 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:18.009
 possible so it really gives a game 

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:19.360
 very neat in visual terms and that's 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:30.489
 what is expected of an asthma 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:31.989
 Universal generation hungry after 

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:35.130
 obviously it's not about two missions 

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:36.760
 we can see the potential of the game 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.990
 to express oneself ie to go 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.460
 even wait because there is still 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.569
 already some small details that we 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.029
 have a little bit 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.740
 put off especially in the fact of 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:46.569
 mission building that is when 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.550
 even relatively linear ie 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:50.349
 that we progress a little bit small 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.429
 area by small dense and horse areas 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.649
 actually splinter cell that 

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:55.539
 allows different approaches following 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:56.800
 the angle the path they chose 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.020
 but it's still often 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.119
 let's progress in pretty places 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.919
 confined so yes the methods can 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:05.770
 differ but we have a little impression 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.779
 to be guided by the hand that the game 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.399
 is still a little bit too linear a 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:11.169
 little bit in the line of conviction 

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:12.580
 it also means that there is 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:13.930
 places where you can not go without 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.369
 reason ie that for example in 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.990
 missions in libya had a grid 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:18.099
 opened 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.629
 I thought I could when we're there 

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:21.520
 down no the camera froze is 

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:23.099
 impossible to progress in the 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.969
 second mission on the rooftops in full 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.949
 in the middle of a storm 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:28.719
 there was a part like that a 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:30.279
 inclined disorder where I could 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.849
 strictly not go because it was 

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:32.360
 unforeseen 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.819
 so c 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.199
 these little details that make us a 

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:37.430
 little bit ticked that because here are five 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.389
 fischer he's capable of a lot of 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.680
 things and then all of a sudden they get 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:41.060
 find themselves struggling with the wall 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.610
 invisible and that's the invisible wall is 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.069
 stronger than him so we're still going 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.810
 wait to see on the length but

 the solo and the multi is a lighter so 

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:59.949
 rather good vibrations for 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.949
 Nothing 

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:10.920
