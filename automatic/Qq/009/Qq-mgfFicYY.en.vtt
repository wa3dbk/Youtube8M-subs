00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
old cake recipe on the block is I think

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.430 
old cake recipe on the block is I think
there's<00:00:38.700> more<00:00:38.940> sugar<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> ones

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
there's more sugar in this in the ones

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.560 
there's more sugar in this in the ones
that<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.710> eat<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> studio<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that you eat here at the studio so the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
that you eat here at the studio so the
reason<00:00:42.899> why<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.200> started<00:00:43.530> doing<00:00:43.620> oak<00:00:43.890> case<00:00:44.129> is

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
reason why we started doing oak case is

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.549 
reason why we started doing oak case is
because<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> strong<00:00:45.930> Nova<00:00:46.230> Scotia

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
because it was like a strong Nova Scotia

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.790 
because it was like a strong Nova Scotia
tradition<00:00:47.160> really<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.750> people<00:00:49.079> when

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
tradition really and when people when

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.319 
tradition really and when people when
people<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.190> used<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> studio<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.210> my

want<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> lose<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.469> feeling<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.159> had

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
want to lose that feeling that we had

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.249 
want to lose that feeling that we had
when<00:01:59.850> we<00:01:59.880> were<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> house<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
when we were in the house you know and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.530 
when we were in the house you know and
so<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.670> took<00:02:03.210> some<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
so I I took some of it here and

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.570 
so I I took some of it here and
and<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:05.230> know<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.500> oak<00:02:05.620> cakes<00:02:05.950> are<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.190> symbol

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
and you know the oak cakes are a symbol

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.280 
and you know the oak cakes are a symbol
of<00:02:06.730> that<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:06.940> guess<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.600> symbol<00:02:07.900> of<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.140> way

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
of that I guess it's a symbol of the way

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.660 
of that I guess it's a symbol of the way
