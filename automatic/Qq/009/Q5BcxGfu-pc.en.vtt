going to break this down first then I'm

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
going to break this down first then I'm
going<00:00:30.650> to<00:00:30.680> go<00:00:30.800> ahead<00:00:30.860> and<00:00:31.070> do<00:00:31.160> it<00:00:31.310> and<00:00:31.490> then

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
break it down at the end so we're

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.799 
break it down at the end so we're
probably<00:00:33.829> going<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.100> use<00:00:34.160> I'd<00:00:34.520> say<00:00:35.030> a<00:00:35.059> 3<00:00:35.629> and

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
probably going to use I'd say a 3 and

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.569 
probably going to use I'd say a 3 and
3/4<00:00:36.320> guard<00:00:36.559> which<00:00:36.710> is<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:36.949> longest<00:00:37.219> start<00:00:37.460> I

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
3/4 guard which is the longest start I

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.599 
3/4 guard which is the longest start I
have<00:00:37.789> up<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.719> about<00:00:38.839> right<00:00:38.899> here<00:00:39.609> throughout

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
have up to about right here throughout

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:43.239 
have up to about right here throughout
the<00:00:40.969> whole<00:00:41.149> sides<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.780> this<00:00:42.679> eye<00:00:42.859> too<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.159> the

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:43.249 
the whole sides and this eye too in the

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.669 
the whole sides and this eye too in the
back<00:00:43.429> then<00:00:43.969> we'll<00:00:44.120> blend<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.449> all<00:00:44.629> by<00:00:45.140> hand<00:00:45.379> and

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
back then we'll blend it all by hand and

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.079 
back then we'll blend it all by hand and
probably<00:00:45.949> end<00:00:46.159> up<00:00:46.190> cutting<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.579> top<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.059> where

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089
