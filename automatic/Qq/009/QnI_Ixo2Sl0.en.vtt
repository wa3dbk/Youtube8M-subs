00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
there's nothing really else in it yet if

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:04.430 
there's nothing really else in it yet if
you<00:06:57.360> have<00:06:57.539> together<00:06:57.780> they're<00:07:03.139> not<00:07:04.139> show<00:07:04.380> you

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
you have together they're not show you

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.830 
you have together they're not show you
the<00:07:04.680> inside<00:07:04.860> cutter<00:07:05.280> out<00:07:05.639> she<00:07:06.150> seemed<00:07:06.419> that<00:07:06.690> it

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
the inside cutter out she seemed that it

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:17.450 
the inside cutter out she seemed that it
is<00:07:14.960> so<00:07:15.960> it's<00:07:16.139> not<00:07:16.319> war<00:07:16.620> than<00:07:16.830> I<00:07:16.919> just<00:07:17.159> glued
