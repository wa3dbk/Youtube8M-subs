00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
today's project is we ran install a work

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.450 
today's project is we ran install a work
desk<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.629> shelfing<00:00:07.620> above<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> work<00:00:08.189> desk

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
desk and shelfing above the work desk

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.400 
desk and shelfing above the work desk
this<00:00:09.000> particular<00:00:09.360> work<00:00:09.660> desk<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.170> pretty

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
this particular work desk is pretty

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.549 
this particular work desk is pretty
heavy<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.309> we're<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.580> put<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:12.030> some

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
heavy so we're going to put it on some

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.709 
heavy so we're going to put it on some
actual<00:00:13.559> heavy-duty<00:00:14.190> shelf<00:00:14.610> brackets<00:00:15.150> in

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
actual heavy-duty shelf brackets in

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.840 
actual heavy-duty shelf brackets in
order<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.170> install<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.710> shelf<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.609> need<00:00:17.760> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
order to install this shelf we need to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.820 
order to install this shelf we need to
determine<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> height<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.619> going<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
determine the height and we're going to

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.830 
determine the height and we're going to
put<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.130> brackets<00:00:20.609> while<00:00:21.150> typical<00:00:21.660> work

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
put the brackets while typical work

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380 
put the brackets while typical work
shelf<00:00:22.170> or<00:00:22.980> desk<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.550> 30<00:00:23.820> inches<00:00:24.150> off<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
shelf or desk is 30 inches off the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.599 
shelf or desk is 30 inches off the
ground<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.560> need<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> make<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> mark<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
ground so we need to make a mark on the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.710 
ground so we need to make a mark on the
wall<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.890> 30<00:00:28.890> inches<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.580> then<00:00:30.510> we're<00:00:30.630> going

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
wall at 30 inches and then we're going

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.900 
wall at 30 inches and then we're going
to<00:00:30.810> come<00:00:31.050> down<00:00:31.230> inch<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> quarter<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to come down inch and a quarter that the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.139 
to come down inch and a quarter that the
shelf<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.200> our<00:00:34.320> shelf<00:00:34.620> brackets<00:00:35.149> will

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
are 32 inches that's what we expect is a

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.970 
are 32 inches that's what we expect is a
stud<00:01:21.670> every<00:01:21.700> 16<00:01:22.090> inches<00:01:22.590> we're<00:01:23.590> going<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.800> take

stud every 16 inches we're going to take

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.060 
stud every 16 inches we're going to take
when<00:01:24.220> I<00:01:24.310> drill<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.550> pilot<00:01:24.640> hole<00:01:28.800> first<00:01:29.800> we<00:01:29.950> have

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
when I drill a pilot hole first we have

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:39.390 
when I drill a pilot hole first we have
to<00:01:30.190> set<00:01:30.370> our<00:01:30.400> height

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.640 

that's<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.210> top<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.630> our<00:01:40.750> two<00:01:40.930> brackets<00:01:41.470> we

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
that's the top of our two brackets we

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:53.260 
that's the top of our two brackets we
can<00:01:41.800> put<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:41.980> bracket<00:01:42.430> here<00:01:43.860> mark<00:01:44.860> our<00:01:45.160> holes

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.069 

Oh

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.420 

I'll<00:01:59.500> attach<00:01:59.920> those<00:02:00.159> brackets<00:02:00.759> using<00:02:02.430> pilot

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
I'll attach those brackets using pilot

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.580 
I'll attach those brackets using pilot
hole<00:02:03.579> these<00:02:04.240> large<00:02:04.540> screws<00:02:04.930> that's<00:02:05.320> going<00:02:05.530> to

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
hole these large screws that's going to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.370 
hole these large screws that's going to
hold<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.860> bracket<00:02:06.070> time<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:07.479> now<00:02:07.659> we<00:02:08.140> want<00:02:08.319> to

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
hold the bracket time and now we want to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.460 
hold the bracket time and now we want to
put<00:02:08.530> these<00:02:08.649> pilasters<00:02:09.630> up<00:02:10.630> above<00:02:10.959> this<00:02:11.170> shelf

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
put these pilasters up above this shelf

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.940 
put these pilasters up above this shelf
now<00:02:12.250> these<00:02:12.430> don't<00:02:12.760> necessarily<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.750> be

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.830 

using<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.069> studs<00:02:18.370> because<00:02:18.819> quite<00:02:19.300> often<00:02:19.510> when

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
using the studs because quite often when

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440 
using the studs because quite often when
we<00:02:19.959> install<00:02:20.440> these<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:20.860> want<00:02:21.010> these<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.640> be<00:02:21.700> at

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
we install these we want these to be at

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.229 
we install these we want these to be at
a<00:02:22.599> particular<00:02:22.780> location<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.920> aesthetics<00:02:24.760> not

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
a particular location of aesthetics not

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.900 
a particular location of aesthetics not
just<00:02:25.569> where<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> studs<00:02:26.200> are<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.310> we<00:02:27.489> can<00:02:27.519> take

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
just where the studs are so we can take

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.850 
just where the studs are so we can take
and<00:02:28.330> locate<00:02:28.930> where<00:02:29.230> these<00:02:29.380> are<00:02:29.500> going<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.650> go

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
and locate where these are going to go

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.289 
and locate where these are going to go
above<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.550> shelf<00:02:35.010> mark<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.190> hole<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.700> then

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
above the shelf mark a hole and then

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.970 
above the shelf mark a hole and then
when<00:02:37.480> we<00:02:37.630> figure<00:02:38.140> out<00:02:38.260> where<00:02:38.500> our<00:02:38.650> other<00:02:38.860> one

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
when we figure out where our other one

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.280 
when we figure out where our other one
is<00:02:39.069> going<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.430> all<00:02:39.730> we<00:02:40.000> have<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.330> do<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.750> we

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
is going to be all we have to do is we

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.670 
is going to be all we have to do is we
have<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.530> keep<00:02:41.709> them<00:02:41.920> level<00:02:43.110> over<00:02:44.110> here<00:02:44.319> to<00:02:44.560> our

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
have to keep them level over here to our

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.620 
have to keep them level over here to our
aesthetic<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.540> pleasing<00:02:46.930> other<00:02:47.530> location<00:02:48.340> is

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.060 

and<00:02:53.110> we're<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.410> put<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.650> those<00:02:53.830> two

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
and we're going to put in those two

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.550 
and we're going to put in those two
acres<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.760> hold<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> toppings<00:02:55.570> pilasters<00:02:56.350> in

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
acres to hold the toppings pilasters in

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.160 
acres to hold the toppings pilasters in
place<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.670> use<00:02:57.820> two<00:02:58.120> shelf<00:02:58.420> brackets<00:02:58.960> to

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
place when you use two shelf brackets to

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.810 
place when you use two shelf brackets to
hold<00:02:59.200> up<00:02:59.500> our<00:02:59.680> lower<00:02:59.860> shelf<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:00.460> I<00:03:00.490> was<00:03:00.670> up

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
hold up our lower shelf but I was up

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.430 
hold up our lower shelf but I was up
above<00:03:01.240> we're<00:03:01.750> going<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.930> put<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.200> three

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
above we're going to put on three

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.180 
above we're going to put on three
pilasters<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:04.120> where<00:03:04.450> we<00:03:04.630> put<00:03:04.660> them<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.950> going

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
pilasters and where we put them is going

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.370 
pilasters and where we put them is going
to<00:03:06.280> happen<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.790> be<00:03:07.000> different<00:03:07.360> than<00:03:08.020> where<00:03:08.260> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
to happen to be different than where the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.050 
to happen to be different than where the
studs<00:03:08.680> are<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.370> we're<00:03:09.490> going<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.670> use<00:03:09.760> some

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
studs are so we're going to use some

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.620 
studs are so we're going to use some
what<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:10.840> call<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.260> trade<00:03:11.410> easy<00:03:11.980> anchors

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
what we call in the trade easy anchors

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.000 
what we call in the trade easy anchors
but<00:03:13.630> first<00:03:13.930> we<00:03:14.140> have<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.380> keep<00:03:14.560> our<00:03:14.770> three

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
but first we have to keep our three

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.140 
but first we have to keep our three
pilasters<00:03:15.850> level<00:03:17.340> which<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.490> just<00:03:18.760> achieved

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
pilasters level which I just achieved

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.950 
pilasters level which I just achieved
here<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.750> Center<00:03:20.080> pilaster<00:03:20.830> right<00:03:21.040> there

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
here is the Center pilaster right there

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.240 
here is the Center pilaster right there
check<00:03:22.960> out<00:03:23.170> these<00:03:23.380> anchors<00:03:23.890> we're<00:03:24.040> going<00:03:24.160> to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
check out these anchors we're going to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.800 
check out these anchors we're going to
grab<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> drill<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:27.850> is<00:03:28.060> an<00:03:28.180> easy<00:03:28.360> anchor

end when you drive this in when it hits
the<00:03:53.560> wall<00:03:56.370> stop<00:03:57.570> perfect

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
the wall stop perfect

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.810 
the wall stop perfect
easy<00:04:01.360> anchors<00:04:04.170> okay<00:04:05.170> we<00:04:05.320> have<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.650> anchors<00:04:06.640> in

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
easy anchors okay we have the anchors in

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.840 
easy anchors okay we have the anchors in
the<00:04:06.910> wall<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:08.800> get<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> nice<00:04:09.250> plumb<00:04:09.640> line

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
the wall and to get a nice plumb line

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.910 
the wall and to get a nice plumb line
coming<00:04:10.210> down<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.690> wall<00:04:10.900> we're<00:04:11.650> going<00:04:11.770> to<00:04:11.830> let

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
coming down the wall we're going to let

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.120 
coming down the wall we're going to let
the<00:04:12.100> pilaster<00:04:12.880> be<00:04:13.030> our<00:04:13.150> plumb<00:04:13.450> force<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:15.010> we

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
the pilaster be our plumb force so we

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.950 
the pilaster be our plumb force so we
run<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.430> pilasters<00:04:15.670> through<00:04:16.420> it<00:04:16.540> in<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.810> easy

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:16.960 
run the pilasters through it in the easy

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.980 
run the pilasters through it in the easy
anchor<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:19.980> then<00:04:20.980> now<00:04:21.130> when<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.489> hangs<00:04:21.990> it's

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
anchor and then now when it hangs it's

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.230 
anchor and then now when it hangs it's
going<00:04:23.230> to<00:04:23.290> plumb<00:04:23.500> itself<00:04:23.920> so<00:04:24.730> we<00:04:24.850> could<00:04:25.000> mark

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
going to plumb itself so we could mark

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.220 
going to plumb itself so we could mark
the<00:04:25.300> holes<00:04:25.630> for<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.140> other<00:04:26.260> anchors<00:04:28.230> using

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
the holes for the other anchors using

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.140 
the holes for the other anchors using
the<00:04:29.350> pile<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.860> store<00:04:30.190> as<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.310> plumb<00:04:30.580> bob

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.010 

mm-hmm<00:04:36.050> like<00:04:37.010> that<00:04:37.310> now<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.360> finish<00:04:38.750> our

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
mm-hmm like that now to finish our

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.400 
mm-hmm like that now to finish our
project<00:04:39.500> would<00:04:39.890> install<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:41.030> big<00:04:41.240> shelf<00:04:41.510> so

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
project would install the big shelf so

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.260 
project would install the big shelf so
what<00:04:42.650> we<00:04:42.800> have<00:04:42.980> is<00:04:43.160> we<00:04:43.370> marked<00:04:43.610> our<00:04:43.730> holes<00:04:43.940> for

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
what we have is we marked our holes for

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.360 
what we have is we marked our holes for
the<00:04:44.330> brackets<00:04:44.780> into<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.110> wall<00:04:45.320> we<00:04:46.130> have<00:04:46.250> our

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
the brackets into the wall we have our

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.600 
the brackets into the wall we have our
big<00:04:46.580> screws<00:04:46.940> we<00:04:47.630> found<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.560> drill<00:04:48.800> bit<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.460> is

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
big screws we found a drill bit that is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.880 
big screws we found a drill bit that is
about<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.000> right<00:04:50.150> sized<00:04:50.450> pilot<00:04:51.050> for<00:04:51.770> our

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
about the right sized pilot for our

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.110 
about the right sized pilot for our
screws<00:04:53.230> one<00:04:54.230> that<00:04:54.440> matched<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:55.370> body<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.940> the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
screws one that matched the body of the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.470 
screws one that matched the body of the
screw<00:04:56.620> so<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.860> t<00:04:58.040> stuck<00:04:58.430> out<00:04:58.640> past<00:04:59.270> the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
screw so that the t stuck out past the

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.140 
screw so that the t stuck out past the
drill<00:04:59.720> bit<00:04:59.930> but<00:05:00.740> not<00:05:00.950> very<00:05:01.250> much<00:05:01.610> so<00:05:03.760> we<00:05:04.760> marked

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
drill bit but not very much so we marked
