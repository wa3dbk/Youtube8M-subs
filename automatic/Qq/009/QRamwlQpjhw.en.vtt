00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.310
 civil construction and other sectors of the economy 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.440
 lean of the shack 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.049
 the relationship 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.589
 it's expensive is how it's going to stay 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:12.219
 that's how it goes. 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.560
 when it is well made it is cheaper is a smaller investment in the real return 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.579
 on the four wheels to 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.400
 Look, he's there in February. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 of land will depend on the project will depend on the intention we have to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.620
 market for the target audience and everything else is a market language 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.850
 but we'll see that for example when you replace 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.850
 system 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.460
 you might be able to bring superficial to you boss colony of almost 40% 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.070
 technical 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.940
 other costs that are 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.170
 wants you to pay off over time when you produce 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.270
 an ecovillage 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.979
 to be for 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.140
 that is when you reverse the ine 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.700
 of the occupation of people who are not talking about minimizing impacts 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.010
 in your speech 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.950
 They are wanting India has odd 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.170
 When do you draw for this? 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.330
 the reduction of this impact on the currently blue has a more balanced mind 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.610
 that you own is kept more cheaply 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.000
 the maintenance courses of a system are decreasing 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 that contrary to what we have with him 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.980
 At first glance it sounds more like a closed condominium. 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.880
 spread over an area of ​​almost 200 employees the concept of housing that has 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 attracted more and more people 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.160
 not in the sense of the end of the race 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.300
 looks sold we have 82% shipping 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.730
 as heir with handouts every two years we have around 30 fighters 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.680
 and in May 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.860
 the sales success of the venture is in fact this is not just another good 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 Sunday actually from a huge queue 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.240
 it is the first time that it makes a sustainable disarmament 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.210
 of a place 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.690
 then transformed into an ecovillage generally the ecovillages are formed 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.880
 for people 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.960
 who decide to live together and then pass by 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.529
 so we do not say 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:13.199
 if we made a place and put it on the market so people could 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.579
 find common people may be interested in the option of living in a place 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.269
 seated 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.469
 Brazil already has a prejudice with that confidence that I spoke with the pound 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.799
 people remember people resemble wealth 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.799
 Actually, there's no such thing. 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.709
 do not form a group of selected 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.280
 now in place but that is place that had environmental improvement has to 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.789
 select these people 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:44.749
 built in full cerrado in goiânia and brasília, there bovine is interim 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.699
 previously intended for livestock 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.479
 just over 20 years of use 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:54.479
 dairy cow is a covered and brachial place and with very 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.529
 under the one chosen precisely because of this 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.589
 because we wanted to choose the place where we could make a pact 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.239
 positive in the environment 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.950
 if you choose a forest it is much easier to sell but you would already be knocking over 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.019
 the duo says that they were settlers 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.379
 instead of saved 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.609
 you can 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.519
 all water working biodiversity in the marshes seventy-two thousand trees 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.790
 Come on, let's go outside and fish for the soil. 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.859
 the trees begin to contrast with the right car when drawing 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.749
 the scenario that many residents came to seek 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:32.839
 hilda was a bailiff in rondônia close the deal by phone 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.519
 also in the parish of são paulo subway 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.579
 on the fifth he does not have more margin in the pact full of in the air this time of 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.230
 trading floor 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.129
 I'm already seeing azores 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.419
 so he 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.939
 everything you want everything loses to this and will try to be here ready from here 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.909
 five years to prevent anything 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.439
 but me too, on the phone 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.179
 of cultures also contributions 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:01.749
 is an international rescue to live with nature with animals have in the 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.389
 Barradão said that he had everything 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.549
 with the work 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.609
 to the improvement of the relationship 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.919
 I am satisfied with this in the same period 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.719
 I know that I will love you if the lack of infrastructure and look I am crazy 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.170
 adapted to the new iolanda routine caring for the garden forests 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.170
 grows a vegetable garden that she herself told 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.770
 well for the reservation bank 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.830
 after staying here 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.990
