00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.280
 [Music] 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.030
 hello hello this is the cost of creating my website 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.210
 welcome to a new tutorial in this 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.220
 opportunity I will show you how to change or 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.859
 increase the ram memory of your 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.609
 laptop or laptop one 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.949
 very easy way first I should clarify that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.890
 you should use an antistatic band 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.090
 to prevent your memory from being damaged 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.610
 due to static energy 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.800
 another thing is that you should know what type 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.840
 specific ram memory uses your 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.640
 system and for that I'll show you how 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:50.250
 doing it going to the internet you go to the 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.860
 official page of crucial dotcom and there 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.000
 you will find how to know what kind of 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.100
 memory you have presents you two ways 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.920
 This is the manual where you choose your 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.920
 computer or you can download the scan 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.399
 to scan to your computer and it will tell you 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.160
 what memory does your computer have to me? 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.920
 like to use the manual more because here 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.229
 you choose everything for example this computer 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:24.270
 it's hp pavilion dv6 from the series of you see 6 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:28.649
 I repeat you and then you choose the model 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.740
 in this case it would be this one here once 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.979
 already enter all your data you find 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.259
 and there will tell you what kind of memory 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.189
 specific has your computer in this 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.060
 case ddr2 which is the type of memory that 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.909
 uses this laptop and this laptop has 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.600
 maximum memory of up to 8 gigabytes and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.959
 has two slots so that 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.509
 information you must write it down or the part 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.539
 right shows you if you want to buy it 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.880
 immediately if the notes you take to 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.039
 your favorite store there you tell them that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.640
 sell you that memory so you're 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.160
 ready and increase the memory your system 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.860
 once all these steps are done 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.709
 you should have your new memory then 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.540
 you start and disconnect all the cables 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.120
 especially the electricity in your 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.819
 computer you make sure everything is 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.330
 disconnected the covers in this way and you 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.600
 you turn the first step that we are going to 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.570
 from this moment is to take away the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.400
 battery because that's very important not 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.550
 you want is to damage your components 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.260
 you remove the battery first once done 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.500
 that you will proceed to look for what is 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.590
 where is the memory should have a 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.510
 icon but before doing that you should 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.910
 make sure you no longer have energy 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.880
 stored in what is the computer and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.910
 for that you press the power button for 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.040
 at least 10 seconds to be eliminated 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.590
 all the energy left after 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.510
 that you take out the battery and we will use 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.390
 this small screwdriver because the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.810
 screws are a little smaller and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.910
 you look where I show you where the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.160
 memory varies from computer but so 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.670
 general must have an image there 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.209
 near the screw you remove the screw 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.640
 to remove the cover in this way and 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.250
 there you will find what is the place where 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.590
 RAM memory is stored in this 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.520
 specific computer has two 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.260
 modules 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.520
 you see on both sides you have these tabs 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.100
 where there is a metal that is 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.470
 holding then the pressures the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:49.120
 two metals to the side in this way 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.070
 immediately the memory module 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.569
 will go up and there you can 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.450
 take out this way out 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.730
 as you can see and it's ready now 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.489
 removed the first module as you see has 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.829
 one slot and one side is longer than the 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.180
 another one must be taken into account when 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:14.299
 you're going to put the new one in the slot and 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.199
 this is the second you do the same and so 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.120
 you take them out once everything is ready 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.820
 to be able to install the memories you 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.060
 make sure you install it in the way 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.150
 correct not to damage it and put it on 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.789
 what is the computer slot 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.160
 so you press it once it's okay 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.039
 inserted press it down until 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.800
 make a sound like a click and 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.930
 is ready after installing the second 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.560
 module in this way 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.410
 you press it and press it down 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.759
 and click and you have it installed 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.070
 as you see it is very easy and after 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.110
 next step and expose what is the 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.979
 screw at turbo speed how can you 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:05.070
 see after you put what is the battery 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:07.410
 back on the computer and the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.229
 turn on to prove that everything has gone 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.180
 well and see that the computer detects and 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.240
 you right click on what is the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.180
 computer icon and there you give yourself go 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.000
 to properties and should detect the 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.669
 new memory that you have installed to your 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.639
 computer if you do not see it there then you've 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.669
 done something wrong make sure everything 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.490
 is connected correctly and this 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.360
 concludes what is this tutorial thanks 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.880
 by watching this video 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.490
 this is jose do not forget to subscribe and 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.180
 to like the video we will see in the 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.180
 next
