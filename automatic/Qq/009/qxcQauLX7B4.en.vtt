rollers<00:01:53.460> at<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> bottom<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.299> they<00:01:54.570> had

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
rollers at the bottom so that they had

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.520 
rollers at the bottom so that they had
um<00:01:55.280> just<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> nice<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.729> wave<00:01:57.600> or<00:01:57.990> flip<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
um just a nice like wave or flip to the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.160 
um just a nice like wave or flip to the
hair<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.310> style<00:02:00.149> was<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> shoulders

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
hair the style was more at the shoulders

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.200 
hair the style was more at the shoulders
and<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.469> flipped<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> up<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and they flipped it up and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
and they flipped it up and
I<00:02:03.299> didn't<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.409> want<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.650> cut<00:02:04.950> my<00:02:05.070> hair<00:02:05.250> for

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
I didn't really want to cut my hair for

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.469 
I didn't really want to cut my hair for
this<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> just<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.000> wanted<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.330> give

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
this one I just kind of wanted to give

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.270 
this one I just kind of wanted to give
you<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.930> an<00:02:07.290> idea<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.830> what<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> would<00:02:08.160> look

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
you more an idea of what it would look

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.790 
you more an idea of what it would look
like<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.850> just<00:02:09.170> smoothing<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.560> pieces

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
like so just smoothing out the pieces

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.120 
like so just smoothing out the pieces
and<00:02:11.540> flipping<00:02:12.540> at<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> ends<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.890> most

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
and flipping at the ends the most

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.670 
and flipping at the ends the most
important<00:02:14.640> part<00:02:14.850> about<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.780> 60s<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
important part about the 60s and the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.970 
important part about the 60s and the
hair<00:02:16.890> styles<00:02:17.370> was<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.030> volume<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.990> 60s<00:02:19.440> was

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
hair styles was the volume the 60s was

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.210 
hair styles was the volume the 60s was
all<00:02:20.310> about<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.780> big<00:02:21.989> pouf<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> back<00:02:22.830> and

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
all about the big pouf in the back and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.699 
all about the big pouf in the back and
the<00:02:23.520> higher<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.819> better<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.930> we're<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.650> to

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
the higher the better so we're going to

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.640 
the higher the better so we're going to
try<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.010> achieve<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.370> today<00:02:26.970> with<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.989> lot<00:02:28.410> of

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
try and achieve that today with a lot of

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:47.360 
try and achieve that today with a lot of
teasing<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.580> lot<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.090> hairspray<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.310> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
teasing and a lot of hairspray so you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.530 
teasing and a lot of hairspray so you
can<00:02:47.489> just<00:02:47.610> see<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.910> difference<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.330> this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
can just see the difference that this

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.050 
can just see the difference that this
side<00:02:48.750> has<00:02:48.989> more<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.380> sleek<00:02:49.769> smooth<00:02:50.550> look<00:02:50.850> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
side has more of a sleek smooth look and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.840 
side has more of a sleek smooth look and
this<00:02:51.330> side<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.750> kind<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.459> messy<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.700> a

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
this side is just kind of messy and a

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.610 
this side is just kind of messy and a
little<00:02:54.060> frizzy<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.019> we're<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.320> going<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.470> do

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
little frizzy so we're just going to do

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.110 
little frizzy so we're just going to do
the<00:02:55.739> exact<00:02:55.980> same<00:02:56.010> thing<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.519> did<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.910> side

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the exact same thing we did on this side

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:12.270 
the exact same thing we did on this side
to<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.630> side

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.380 

so<00:03:13.280> once<00:03:13.460> you're<00:03:13.610> done<00:03:13.640> with<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.090> I'm<00:03:14.360> just

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
so once you're done with that I'm just

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.350 
so once you're done with that I'm just
going<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:14.720> kind<00:03:14.960> of<00:03:15.050> brush<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.470> out<00:03:15.800> so<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.400> it

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
going to kind of brush it out so that it

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.420 
going to kind of brush it out so that it
has<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.630> little<00:03:18.080> bit<00:03:18.260> more<00:03:18.320> silkiness<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:19.250> it

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
has a little bit more silkiness to it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.550 
has a little bit more silkiness to it
and<00:03:19.670> it's<00:03:19.850> easier<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.360> manage<00:03:20.540> for<00:03:21.350> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
and it's easier to manage for the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.560 
and it's easier to manage for the
teasing<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.340> I'm<00:03:22.670> not<00:03:22.940> going<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.150> keep<00:03:23.270> my<00:03:23.390> hair

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
teasing so I'm not going to keep my hair

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.240 
teasing so I'm not going to keep my hair
middle<00:03:23.810> parted<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.200> could<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.710> then<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:25.100> do

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
middle parted you could and then just do

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.860 
middle parted you could and then just do
like<00:03:25.460> a<00:03:25.490> whole<00:03:25.730> bunch<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.060> easing<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.630> then

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
like a whole bunch of easing and then

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.260 
like a whole bunch of easing and then
just<00:03:27.170> brush<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.560> back<00:03:27.710> I'm<00:03:28.490> going<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.730> do<00:03:28.910> a

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
just brush it back I'm going to do a

little<00:03:29.840> bit<00:03:30.050> of<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.530> side<00:03:30.980> part<00:03:31.370> right<00:03:32.210> in<00:03:32.270> the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
little bit of a side part right in the

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.460 
little bit of a side part right in the
front<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.970> really<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.240> smooth<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.260> out

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470
