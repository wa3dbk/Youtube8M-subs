00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
I think privacy is important because we

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.140 
I think privacy is important because we
all<00:00:06.899> want<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.259> feel<00:00:07.529> like<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.730> control

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
of our own lives and what people know

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.520 
of our own lives and what people know
about<00:00:12.389> us<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.900> what<00:00:13.019> people<00:00:13.139> don't<00:00:13.410> know

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
about us and what people don't know

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.430 
about us and what people don't know
about<00:00:13.620> us<00:00:13.980> actually<00:00:14.759> easy<00:00:15.150> technology<00:00:16.080> that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
about us actually easy technology that

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.429

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
we have inside our bags that is

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.300 
we have inside our bags that is
basically<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.189> prison<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.300> radio<00:00:21.900> waves<00:00:22.310> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
basically a prison for radio waves and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.550 
basically a prison for radio waves and
nothing<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.119> get<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.960> thing<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.320> get

nothing can get in on a thing and get

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.109 
nothing can get in on a thing and get
out<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> lot<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> people<00:00:26.340> assume<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.970> I

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
out so a lot of people assume that I
