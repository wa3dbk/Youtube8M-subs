00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.580
 or 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.139
 or the p phobic today I bring you a new 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.389
 video reviews I come to talk about the virus 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.070
 a Spanish game a filler from 2 to 6 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.109
 players in which we should be the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.109
 first player to have a healthy body 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.770
 here we have the game box is a 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.540
 box manufactured here in in do in 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.100
 madrid and good is a new format of 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.990
 box that the truth is that I'm really cool 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.970
 the size it has in terms of 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.529
 good box material is not very very 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.500
 resistant but good enough 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.740
 for the type of game that is 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.900
 brings a manual in English and Spanish 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.370
 how are you looking so simple as 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.540
 it's the good game 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.550
 here you have it 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.370
 and on the other side 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.989
 but let's go very simple and then here 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.579
 we have a small crib with all the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.480
 letters the material of the letters is 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.390
 pretty good the truth 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.180
 come back that all to show you a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.520
 little artwork, so here 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 we have a virus, a brain virus 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.519
 we can say brain blue vale here 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.760
 you have it 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.740
 good here medicines more medicines here 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.880
 we have special letters as you see the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.590
 art of the game I think it's pretty 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.040
 suitable for the theme not the game 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.930
 try to send viruses to the contrary 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.700
 sick their bodies and save our 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.590
 bodies then well that less than 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 do it with this aesthetic so 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.310
 horny we can say here you have the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.409
 body with its organs the heart 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.600
 because imagine what I know they did 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.149
 this realistic roll game with photos of 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.009
 organs really good because the name 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.289
 here transplanting stealing better said 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.570
 a good heart would not be something very very 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.590
 very nice to see or play so 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.970
 aesthetically it is very good 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.560
 very cool illustrations here we have the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.390
 wildcard virus 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.920
 and in terms of component quality 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.920
 It is also very good 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.930
 I will explain the game that is very 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.670
 simple to explain and play which 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.890
 is the goal of the game to have our 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.510
 four organs at the table but the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.160
 organs have to be free of viruses 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.720
 you have to be healthy not in this case the 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.000
 player who gets this wins the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.350
 starting as you play in your hand we have 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.750
 three letters we always have to have 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.540
 three cards in hand in our turn 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.040
 we can play one of these cards or 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.500
 we can discard us from so many letters 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.290
 as we want and steal that same number 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.030
 of letters is as simple as that is the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.440
 basic mechanics of the game how to 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.270
 they get organs how they get 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.550
 healthy organs how organs get infected 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.990
 from others it's very easy to imagine 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.040
 that this is my body my two organs and 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.180
 these are those of a opposing player 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.800
 then in our turn we can play 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.750
 virus letters that are here 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.090
 which are the same color as the organs 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.270
 but with little drawings of viruses and it's so 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.220
 simple as we download a letter 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.440
 we have these three as we go down one by one 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 organ of an opponent therefore this 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.860
 organ right now does not count as a 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.750
 organ alone does not count to win the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.630
 game because it has a virus besides it 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.030
 it may be the case that I another player 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.440
 play a second virus in it 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.230
 organ at that time that body is 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.180
 extirpated that player 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.159
 in that organ but calm that this 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.349
 can be remedied with vaccines this is 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.400
 a vaccine this is another vaccine you see 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.400
 in the landmark icon that's here, it's worth 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.730
 vaccine organs in this case these 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.650
 organs are in addition to healthy vaccinated 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.790
 it's worth what they serve to avoid 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.400
 virus at the moment when a player 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.260
 we get a virus simply remove the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.180
 vaccine with the virus and the organ will remain 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.400
 this organ remains healthy worth 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.349
 he simply has taken the vaccine 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.849
 also if we put a second vaccine that 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.220
 is the opposite of putting two alive what 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.650
 otherwise to stretch what we do is 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.329
 immunize that organ we rotate this for 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.860
 show that you are immunized and this 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.510
 organ can no longer be attacked by viruses 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.950
 and can not be attacked by any of 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.450
 the letters that I will later show you 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.980
 modify the game a bit this organ 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.180
 is ours is one of the best 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.500
 sensations of the game at the moment and 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.260
 which immunizes is an organ you know that 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.819
 is yours that moment of relaxation apart from 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.319
 this we have three more letters that 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.760
 interesting that are the wilds these 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.829
 three wild cards as you can see they have all 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.709
 the wildcard virus colors we can 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.560
 cast in letter in an organ of any 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.940
 color wildcard medicine the same in a 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.859
 organ of any color and even 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.140
 would serve to put it here and immunize 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.270
 this body and then we have 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.880
 as it simply counts as a 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.650
 any organ in this case 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.300
 we would have three organs if we had 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.980
 also lowered be here at this moment 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.209
 we would have won the game because 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.890
 we have four organs since this one 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.060
 account as the one we do not have is very 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.040
 It is also important to know that you do not know 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.630
 can play two equal organs worth 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.010
 this can not be done because both 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.840
 brains because at the moment it has not 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.270
 got done in medicine so 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.290
 this is an invalid play for 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.690
 finish I will teach the letters 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.910
 specials that are in the game we have 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.470
 On the one hand the transplant what it does is 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.390
 simply exchange an organ of yours 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.470
 by an organ of the contrary remember that 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.669
 it can not be done with organs 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.160
 immunized if you have the organ 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.600
 immunity or you can not change it we have 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.130
 also directly the thief of 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.140
 organs that what it does is steal the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.910
 another player's organ and put it in your 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.400
 side of the table in your body either 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.200
 can do with immune organs we have 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.150
 the contagion a very funny letter that 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.440
 what it does is spread your viruses by 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.580
 the other players take all the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.020
 virus that is in your organs and the 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.669
 spaces by the organs of others 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.100
 players taking into account that only 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.930
 You can do it in free organs. 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.910
 this way you can not get to extirpate 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.139
 organs because it would be quite chaotic and 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.030
 pretty crazy staying 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.560
 the latex glove that what it does is 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.849
 Charge the hand of other players 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.039
 have to discard and steal a 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.050
 new hand and finally the medical error 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.719
 which is a letter that I personally hate 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.810
 because what it does is exchange 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.729
 completely your body with that of 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.680
 another player and in this case yes that 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.419
 you can also exchange the organs 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.460
 immunized voucher is the only letter with 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.529
 which you can exchange the organs 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.669
 immunized and even with this already 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.319
 determine the explanation these are the 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.749
 special letters and as I said the 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.219
 player who has a healthy body the 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.080
 first player to have a healthy body 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:43.610
 is the winner we are going with my 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.900
 impressions the first thing I wanted 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.060
 comment about this virus is that it is 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.050
 being a success especially by mouth to 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.509
 mouth because it's a game that either 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.800
 I had a lot of promotion and it's 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.659
 being quite successful in stores 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.279
 I visit many stores here local 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.240
 madrid is telling me that you are 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:58.430
 selling enough that you're liking 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.779
 much in between among gamers and not 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.009
 gamers the truth that is a very thriller 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.360
 funny is a film that can draw 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.069
 any player or any non 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.509
 player because it is explained in two minutes 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.310
 you have seen a second ago that 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.930
 quick is explained and the truth is that the 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.419
 thematic helps a lot to enter the 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.069
 game, not this, of destroying the 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.839
 orders from others trying to save 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:15.320
 yours because people get very 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:16.490
 easy 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.470
 and go very quickly in the game 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.780
 mechanically as you have seen is ultra 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.010
 simple download letter and little more e 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.510
 try to save our organs 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.490
 try to annoy the organs of the 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.810
 others and then all these letters that 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.790
 they modify the game a bit and that 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.590
 they make everything more intense and more fun 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.850
 not especially change now give to me 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.830
 is one of those that I like the most 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.470
 As a hit, the only thing I can say is 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.850
 something that usually happens in these files that 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.320
 when playing six players make a game 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.970
 which is quite random depends a lot 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.290
 of what others do when you 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.360
 your turn has changed the same 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.620
 radical departure is not something that 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.210
 you had planned to do, it's going to be 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.460
 totally impossible to do then 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.430
 I prefer at least me in these 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.900
 games play that to 434 players for 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.180
 have a little more control though 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.860
 is a filler is a game that has chance 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.480
 it's a quick game then it gives a 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.790
 little bit like you do not have a 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.100
 control of the game the truth is that 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.810
 highly recommended has a good price is 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.220
 fun as I say you can take it out 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.300
 I hope anyone has served you 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.950
 this video reviews if you have played it 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.450
 remember to put in the comments that you 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.650
 it seems to you this virus and see you 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.650
