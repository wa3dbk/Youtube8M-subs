00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.649 

not<00:01:46.280> much<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.490> an<00:01:46.670> elevator<00:01:47.060> thing<00:01:47.329> but<00:01:47.570> it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
not much of an elevator thing but it

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.569 
not much of an elevator thing but it
just<00:01:47.840> shows<00:01:48.079> you<00:01:48.680> how<00:01:48.829> much<00:01:48.860> easier<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.490> makes

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
just shows you how much easier it makes

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.120 
just shows you how much easier it makes
it<00:01:49.880> instead<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.270> having<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.990> climb<00:01:51.619> all<00:01:51.920> these

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
it instead of having to climb all these

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:03.929 
it instead of having to climb all these
stairs<00:01:56.079> keep<00:01:57.079> going<00:01:57.470> up<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.890> huge<00:01:58.189> tower<00:02:00.880> go

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.899 

yeah<00:02:05.229> so<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.530> one<00:02:06.679> of<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> few<00:02:07.250> mods<00:02:07.610> out
