00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it was cool to have braces and then

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
it was cool to have braces and then
every<00:01:34.170> time<00:01:34.380> I'd<00:01:34.680> go<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.009> once<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.369> month<00:01:35.520> you'd

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
I think the obsession started when I had

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.970 
I think the obsession started when I had
braces<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.020> was<00:02:37.050> always<00:02:37.620> worried<00:02:37.890> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
braces and I was always worried that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.320 
braces and I was always worried that
there<00:02:38.280> was<00:02:38.400> something<00:02:38.610> stuck<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.090> my<00:02:39.240> teeth

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
and a lot of times were I remember once

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.199 
started brushing as usual regularly and
my<00:03:45.600> teeth<00:03:45.840> weren't<00:03:46.049> as<00:03:46.230> white<00:03:46.590> as<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.100> wanted<00:03:47.850> so

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
my teeth weren't as white as I wanted so

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.000 
my teeth weren't as white as I wanted so
I<00:03:48.510> used<00:03:49.110> crest<00:03:50.010> white<00:03:50.280> strips<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:51.830> for<00:03:52.830> some

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
I used crest white strips and for some

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.500 
I used crest white strips and for some
reason<00:03:53.310> if<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:53.459> still<00:03:53.880> have<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.150> box<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:56.510> I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
reason if I still have the box and I

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.199 
reason if I still have the box and I
mean<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:58.410> was<00:03:58.620> Premium<00:03:59.130> Plus<00:03:59.280> now<00:03:59.670> they<00:03:59.880> have<00:04:00.060> I

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
mean it was Premium Plus now they have I

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.320 
mean it was Premium Plus now they have I
think<00:04:00.390> even<00:04:00.690> better<00:04:00.840> ones<00:04:01.080> but<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:02.310> use<00:04:02.940> Clarion

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
think even better ones but I use Clarion

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.050 
think even better ones but I use Clarion
Plus<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.230> 10-day<00:04:04.680> one<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.730> didn't

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
Plus and it's a 10-day one and I didn't

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.940 
Plus and it's a 10-day one and I didn't
use<00:04:06.180> them<00:04:06.360> all<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.780> think<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.230> use<00:04:07.380> seven<00:04:07.769> days

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
use them all I think I use seven days

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.240 
use them all I think I use seven days
because<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:09.390> made<00:04:09.630> my<00:04:09.810> teeth<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.470> sensitive

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
because it made my teeth so sensitive

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.890 
because it made my teeth so sensitive
and<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.700> don't<00:04:11.760> have<00:04:11.970> sensitive<00:04:12.330> teeth<00:04:12.360> but

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
and I don't have sensitive teeth but

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.900 
and I don't have sensitive teeth but
just<00:04:13.290> using<00:04:13.470> those<00:04:13.739> like<00:04:14.250> even<00:04:14.610> if<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.790> would

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
just using those like even if I would

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.250 
just using those like even if I would
just<00:04:15.000> touch<00:04:15.209> them<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.570> really<00:04:15.780> hurts<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.229> I

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
just touch them it really hurts so I

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.699 
just touch them it really hurts so I
only<00:04:16.440> use<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.830> seven<00:04:17.130> days<00:04:17.280> but<00:04:18.229> it<00:04:19.229> seemed<00:04:19.560> to

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
only use the seven days but it seemed to

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.319 
only use the seven days but it seemed to
work<00:04:19.799> quite<00:04:20.160> well<00:04:20.190> and

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
work quite well and

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.029 
work quite well and

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
because it's been most session now after

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.559 
because it's been most session now after
my<00:05:17.099> braces<00:05:17.460> but<00:05:17.610> also<00:05:17.759> I<00:05:17.909> really<00:05:18.270> like<00:05:18.300> that
