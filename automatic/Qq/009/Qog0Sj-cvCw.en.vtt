are<00:00:19.050> not<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> game<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.070> think<00:00:20.130> they

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
are not in the game and I think they

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.400 
are not in the game and I think they
should<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.760> added<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.119> coming<00:00:21.480> year<00:00:21.689> number

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.050 
one we're gonna start with Terrell Owens
obviously<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:26.340> know<00:00:26.430> only<00:00:26.640> had<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> couple

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
obviously you know only had a couple

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.480 
obviously you know only had a couple
years<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.689> Philadelphia<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.650> controversial

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
years in Philadelphia some controversial

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.429 
years in Philadelphia some controversial
to<00:00:29.789> say<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.000> least<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:30.810> he<00:00:30.900> debatably<00:00:31.289> has

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to say the least but he debatably has

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.170 
to say the least but he debatably has
been<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> best<00:00:31.890> wide<00:00:32.040> receiver<00:00:32.369> legal<00:00:33.059> have

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
been the best wide receiver legal have

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850 
been the best wide receiver legal have
had<00:00:33.329> since<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.200> know<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.380> started<00:00:34.680> since

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
had since you know they started since

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
had since you know they started since
like<00:00:35.040> Andy<00:00:35.489> Reid<00:00:35.670> era<00:00:35.880> took<00:00:36.239> Chip<00:00:36.450> Kelly<00:00:36.660> area

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
like Andy Reid era took Chip Kelly area

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.049 
like Andy Reid era took Chip Kelly area
so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> mean<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.129> see<00:00:38.340> him<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> carried<00:00:38.969> it'd

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
so I mean I see him get a carried it'd

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.639 
so I mean I see him get a carried it'd
probably<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.570> debate<00:00:40.050> will<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.230> between<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
probably be debate will be between the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.549 
probably be debate will be between the
Eagles<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.129> San<00:00:41.430> Francisco<00:00:41.730> 49ers

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
Eagles and San Francisco 49ers

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
Eagles and San Francisco 49ers
but<00:00:43.559> yeah<00:00:43.710> or<00:00:44.399> maybe<00:00:44.550> even<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> Cowboys

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
but yeah or maybe even the Cowboys

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.430 
but yeah or maybe even the Cowboys
Cowboys<00:00:45.390> deserve<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> shell<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.289> one

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
Cowboys deserve a shell in that one

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.400 
Cowboys deserve a shell in that one
number<00:00:47.160> two<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.700> Donovan<00:00:48.210> McNabb<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.200> wounds

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410

have healed I have now come to accept
that<00:00:51.120> he's<00:00:51.270> probably<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> best<00:00:51.840> quarterback

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that he's probably the best quarterback

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470 
that he's probably the best quarterback
I've<00:00:53.280> ever<00:00:53.579> seen<00:00:53.789> then<00:00:54.030> he<00:00:54.149> will<00:00:54.270> definitely

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I've ever seen then he will definitely

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.880 
I've ever seen then he will definitely
is<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> best<00:00:54.960> quarterback<00:00:55.140> says<00:00:55.530> I've<00:00:55.739> been

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
is the best quarterback says I've been

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.260

watching<00:00:56.219> football<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> Philadelphia

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
watching football that the Philadelphia

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.549 
watching football that the Philadelphia
Eagles<00:00:57.449> ever<00:00:57.690> had<00:00:57.899> hopefully<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> changed

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
Eagles ever had hopefully that changed

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.340 
Eagles ever had hopefully that changed
it<00:00:58.620> was<00:00:58.710> Sam<00:00:58.859> Bradford<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.399> probably<00:00:59.850> not<00:01:00.350> but

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it was Sam Bradford but probably not but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
it was Sam Bradford but probably not but
you<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.469> stats<00:01:02.190> were<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.520> there<00:01:02.760> probably

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you know stats were all there probably

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.969 
you know stats were all there probably
will<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:04.019> end<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.470> actually<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:04.830> you'd

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
will be end up I actually think you'd

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.260 
will be end up I actually think you'd
see<00:01:05.189> him<00:01:05.280> being<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.519> hall-of-famer<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
see him being a hall-of-famer because I

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.820 
see him being a hall-of-famer because I
mean<00:01:06.420> he<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.260> most<00:01:07.560> successful

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
mean he is one of the most successful

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
mean he is one of the most successful
black<00:01:08.340> quarterbacks<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.240> history<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
black quarterbacks in the history of the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.039 
black quarterbacks in the history of the
NFL<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:12.240> deserves<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.720> show<00:01:12.900> for

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
NFL and I think he deserves a show for

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.539 
NFL and I think he deserves a show for
the<00:01:13.140> Hall<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.260> Fame<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.369> maybe

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the Hall of Fame when you know maybe

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.130 
the Hall of Fame when you know maybe
maybe<00:01:14.820> once<00:01:15.210> some<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> bigger<00:01:15.750> names<00:01:15.930> get

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
maybe once some of the bigger names get

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.300 
maybe once some of the bigger names get
off<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> board<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.680> start<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> thin<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
off the board and start to thin down I

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.039 
off the board and start to thin down I
could<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.549> McNab<00:01:17.909> making<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.330> hey<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> last

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
could see McNab making it hey the last

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.990 
could see McNab making it hey the last
one<00:01:19.350> that's<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.159> ranked<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> Jerome

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
one that's not to be ranked is Jerome

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
one that's not to be ranked is Jerome
Brown<00:01:21.390> served<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.950> always

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
Brown served to the do that always

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.789 
Brown served to the do that always
comments<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.700> Jerome<00:01:24.060> Brown<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.770> my
