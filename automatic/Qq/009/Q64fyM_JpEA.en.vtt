so today I'm going to be looking at the

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.570 
so today I'm going to be looking at the
be<00:00:02.370> quiet<00:00:02.850> silent<00:00:03.689> wings<00:00:03.840> USC<00:00:04.560> case<00:00:04.950> fan<00:00:05.310> and

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
be quiet silent wings USC case fan and

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.030 
be quiet silent wings USC case fan and
the<00:00:05.790> fan<00:00:05.819> I<00:00:06.029> have<00:00:06.150> here<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.960> 140<00:00:07.859> male

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
the fan I have here is the 140 male

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.790 
the fan I have here is the 140 male
version<00:00:08.280> but<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.150> is<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.570> course<00:00:09.870> available<00:00:10.620> in

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
version but it is of course available in

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.610 
version but it is of course available in
various<00:00:11.370> different<00:00:11.580> sizes<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:13.290> I'll<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.530> a

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
various different sizes so I'll have a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.079 
various different sizes so I'll have a
quick<00:00:13.830> look<00:00:13.980> at<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> back<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.670> box<00:00:14.880> just

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
quick look at the back of the box just

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.750 
quick look at the back of the box just
to<00:00:15.240> see<00:00:15.389> what<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.599> has<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.900> say<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:16.410> itself<00:00:16.760> so

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
to see what it has to say for itself so

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.880 
to see what it has to say for itself so
here<00:00:17.940> are<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.210> specifications<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.410> spins<00:00:19.740> at

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
here are the specifications it spins at

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.400 
here are the specifications it spins at
a<00:00:19.920> thousand<00:00:20.400> rpm<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.779> noise<00:00:21.960> level<00:00:22.320> is

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
a thousand rpm and the noise level is

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.460 
a thousand rpm and the noise level is
sixteen<00:00:22.830> point<00:00:22.859> five<00:00:23.369> DBA<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.019> puts<00:00:25.260> out

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
sixteen point five DBA and that puts out

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.330 
sixteen point five DBA and that puts out
sixty<00:00:26.189> point<00:00:26.430> four<00:00:26.730> CFM<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.660> airflow<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
sixty point four CFM of airflow so that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.490 
sixty point four CFM of airflow so that
specification<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.300> pretty<00:00:30.660> good<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
specification is pretty good so it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.580 
specification is pretty good so it
should<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.920> fairly<00:00:32.340> decent<00:00:32.669> fan<00:00:33.469> so<00:00:34.469> there

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
should be a fairly decent fan so there

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.720 
should be a fairly decent fan so there
are<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:34.770> other<00:00:34.860> things<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> front<00:00:35.579> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
are some other things in the front of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.459 
are some other things in the front of
the<00:00:35.790> box<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> are<00:00:36.329> unique<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.020> fan<00:00:37.290> it

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the box that are unique to this fan it

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.100 
the box that are unique to this fan it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
icy anti vibration fittings which I'll

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.510 
icy anti vibration fittings which I'll
look<00:00:43.260> at<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.680> minute<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.399> also

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
look at in a minute and it also

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.029 
look at in a minute and it also
streamlined<00:00:45.300> fan<00:00:45.690> blades<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.289> easy

streamlined fan blades and easy
screwless<00:00:47.730> installation<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:49.920> just

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
screwless installation and I will just

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.389 
screwless installation and I will just
focus<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.829> descriptions<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.309> if

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
focus on the descriptions there so if

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.830 
focus on the descriptions there so if
you<00:00:53.489> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> read<00:00:53.940> them<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.449> pause<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you want to read them you can pause the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.410 
you want to read them you can pause the
video<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> does<00:00:55.649> explain<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.309> more

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
video and it does explain a bit more

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
video and it does explain a bit more
about<00:00:57.420> those<00:00:57.690> features<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.100> terms<00:00:59.340> of

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
about those features so in terms of

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.639 
about those features so in terms of
accessories<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.539> molex<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> three

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
accessories we have this molex to three

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.920 
accessories we have this molex to three
pin<00:01:01.920> adaptor<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.449> allow<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> run

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
pin adaptor so that will allow to run

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.479 
pin adaptor so that will allow to run
the<00:01:04.080> fan<00:01:04.290> directly<00:01:04.769> from<00:01:04.860> your<00:01:05.010> power<00:01:05.280> supply

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the fan directly from your power supply

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.990 
the fan directly from your power supply
is<00:01:06.000> full<00:01:06.420> rpm<00:01:06.900> which<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.290> thousand<00:01:07.710> rpm<00:01:08.070> we

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
is full rpm which is a thousand rpm we

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
is full rpm which is a thousand rpm we
also<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.510> seven<00:01:09.869> volt<00:01:10.080> reducer<00:01:10.560> adapter

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
also have a seven volt reducer adapter

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429 
also have a seven volt reducer adapter
this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.700> seven<00:01:12.090> volts<00:01:12.360> there<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> will

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
this is a seven volts there so that will

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.170 
this is a seven volts there so that will
ensure<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> fan<00:01:14.250> spins<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:15.030> bit

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
ensure that the fan spins a little bit

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.320 
ensure that the fan spins a little bit
slower<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.439> mean<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.830> quieter<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.180> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
slower and I mean it's quieter so if you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.390 
slower and I mean it's quieter so if you
what's<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.810> already<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.530> three<00:01:20.100> pin

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
what's out already this is a three pin

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700 
what's out already this is a three pin
fan<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.420> I've<00:01:21.570> look<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> fan<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.530> little

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
fan so I've look at the fan and a little

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
fan so I've look at the fan and a little
bit<00:01:22.860> more<00:01:23.009> detail<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> frame<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
bit more detail now so the frame of the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.660 
bit more detail now so the frame of the
fan<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.080> sturdy<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:26.040> quite<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> chunky

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
fan is very sturdy it's quite a chunky

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.510 
fan is very sturdy it's quite a chunky
frame<00:01:26.939> very<00:01:27.930> solid<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.500> high-quality<00:01:28.920> feel

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
frame very solid very high-quality feel

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
frame very solid very high-quality feel
to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> front<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.200> I'll<00:01:31.409> mention<00:01:31.590> these

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to the front and I'll mention these

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
to the front and I'll mention these
streamlined<00:01:32.460> blades<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.090> are<00:01:33.180> ridged<00:01:33.450> so

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
streamlined blades so they are ridged so

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.270 
streamlined blades so they are ridged so
that<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.380> supposed<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> help<00:01:34.890> streamline

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
that it's supposed to help streamline

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.609 
that it's supposed to help streamline
the<00:01:35.640> air<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.119> better<00:01:36.390> over<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> blades

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the air a little better over the blades

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.100 
the air a little better over the blades
making<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> quieter<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:38.909> efficient<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
making it quieter and more efficient and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
making it quieter and more efficient and
we<00:01:40.170> also<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.590> unique<00:01:40.979> mounting<00:01:41.490> system

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
we also have this unique mounting system

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.280 
we also have this unique mounting system
so<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.570> rubber<00:01:42.930> sort<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so there are these rubber sort of

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.590 
so there are these rubber sort of
grommets<00:01:43.619> built<00:01:43.860> into<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> frame<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.450> fan

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
grommets built into the frame of the fan

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
grommets built into the frame of the fan
itself<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.229> all<00:01:46.290> four<00:01:46.530> corners<00:01:46.799> obviously

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
itself and all four corners obviously

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.789 
itself and all four corners obviously
and<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.420> these<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:49.079> push

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and you get these little them push

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
and you get these little them push
through<00:01:50.130> with<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.000> fan<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.960> follow<00:01:52.290> them<00:01:52.470> on

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
through with the fan just follow them on

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.319 
through with the fan just follow them on
they<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.890> little<00:01:53.100> washer<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.880> you

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
they have a little washer on and you

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.520 
they have a little washer on and you
basically<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.869> hold<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> phone<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> place

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
basically just hold the phone in place

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
basically just hold the phone in place
and<00:01:56.009> push<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.610> through<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.119> locks<00:01:57.329> in

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and push these through and it locks in

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810 
and push these through and it locks in
place<00:01:57.829> because<00:01:58.829> they're<00:01:59.189> identical<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.790> both

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
place because they're identical on both

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.580 
place because they're identical on both
sides<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.479> mount<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.899> either<00:02:01.200> way

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
sides you can mount this either way

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
sides you can mount this either way
we're<00:02:01.829> committed<00:02:02.189> very<00:02:02.369> handy<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.909> I'll<00:02:03.689> show

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
we're committed very handy so I'll show

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
we're committed very handy so I'll show
you<00:02:03.899> how<00:02:04.020> easy<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.829> install<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.399> fan<00:02:05.640> so

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
you how easy is to install the fan so

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.130 
you how easy is to install the fan so
obviously<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.479> have<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.630> make<00:02:06.750> sure<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
obviously you have to make sure you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.749 
obviously you have to make sure you
thread<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.560> washers<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> these<00:02:08.459> push

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
thread the washers on to these push

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.290 
thread the washers on to these push
through

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
through

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.030 
through
so<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.050> then<00:02:11.230> simply<00:02:11.970> place<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.390> fan<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.110> now

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
so you then simply place the fan in now

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.260 
so you then simply place the fan in now
make<00:02:15.280> sure<00:02:15.400> you've<00:02:15.520> got<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.820> way<00:02:15.970> around

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
make sure you've got it the way around

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.350 
make sure you've got it the way around
you<00:02:16.390> want<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:18.010> line<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.580> holes<00:02:18.820> up<00:02:19.060> like

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
you want it just line the holes up like

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.500 
you want it just line the holes up like
so<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.400> then<00:02:21.580> these<00:02:21.790> simply<00:02:22.600> push<00:02:23.200> through

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.000 

may<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.810> hold<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.470> corners<00:02:29.950> just

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
may have to hold it in the corners just

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.010 
may have to hold it in the corners just
to<00:02:30.160> get<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.520> I'll<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.210> put<00:02:31.540> two<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:31.870> to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
to get it in I'll just put two in to

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.330 
to get it in I'll just put two in to
show<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:32.500> obviously<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.070> quite<00:02:33.310> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
show you but obviously that is quite a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.460 
show you but obviously that is quite a
sturdy<00:02:33.670> mount<00:02:33.850> even<00:02:34.210> with<00:02:34.330> just<00:02:34.540> two<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.900> and

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
sturdy mount even with just two in and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.000 
sturdy mount even with just two in and
it<00:02:35.950> should<00:02:36.160> stop<00:02:36.430> vibration<00:02:37.180> completely<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.980> I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
it should stop vibration completely so I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.650 
it should stop vibration completely so I
want<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.250> do<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> quick<00:02:39.700> noise<00:02:39.940> test<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.540> this

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
want to do a quick noise test so this

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.339 
want to do a quick noise test so this
first<00:02:40.990> test<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.530> with<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.830> fan<00:02:42.100> out<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.700> rpm

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.289 

don't<00:02:48.950> mind<00:02:49.159> me<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.459> funds<00:02:49.670> are<00:02:49.879> running<00:02:50.209> in

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
don't mind me the funds are running in

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.149 
don't mind me the funds are running in
my<00:02:50.390> PC<00:02:50.870> at<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.080> moment<00:02:51.470> they<00:02:51.680> should<00:02:51.890> quiet

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
my PC at the moment they should quiet

00:02:52.159 --> 00:03:04.130 
my PC at the moment they should quiet
down<00:02:52.340> any<00:02:52.670> second<00:02:53.090> there<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:53.930> go

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.590 

and<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.650> now<00:03:05.860> running<00:03:06.250> with<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.550> 7<00:03:07.270> volt

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
and this is now running with the 7 volt

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.709 
and this is now running with the 7 volt
adapter

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.789 

so<00:03:14.719> if<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:14.959> hasn't<00:03:15.140> given<00:03:15.409> you<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.590> very<00:03:15.680> good

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
so if that hasn't given you a very good

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.619 
so if that hasn't given you a very good
idea<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.430> noise<00:03:16.640> level<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.180> can<00:03:17.359> tell<00:03:17.569> you

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
idea of the noise level I can tell you

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.660 
idea of the noise level I can tell you
that<00:03:17.750> at<00:03:17.900> full<00:03:18.319> speed<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.650> thousand<00:03:19.159> rpm<00:03:19.519> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
that at full speed a thousand rpm the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.119 
that at full speed a thousand rpm the
fan<00:03:19.879> is<00:03:20.060> only<00:03:20.239> slightly<00:03:20.659> audible<00:03:21.079> I'm<00:03:21.739> with

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
fan is only slightly audible I'm with

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.920 
fan is only slightly audible I'm with
these<00:03:22.250> seven<00:03:22.609> volt<00:03:22.819> adapter<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.450> fan<00:03:23.689> is

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
these seven volt adapter the fan is

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.619 
these seven volt adapter the fan is
completely<00:03:24.650> silent<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.939> wrap<00:03:26.060> up<00:03:26.269> this<00:03:26.450> is

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
completely silent so to wrap up this is

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.630 
completely silent so to wrap up this is
a<00:03:26.659> very<00:03:26.870> high<00:03:27.079> quality<00:03:27.140> fan<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.099> manages<00:03:28.489> to

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
a very high quality fan it manages to

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.240 
a very high quality fan it manages to
stay<00:03:28.819> quiet<00:03:29.060> even<00:03:29.599> at<00:03:29.719> its<00:03:29.840> maximum<00:03:30.230> rpm<00:03:30.799> while

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
stay quiet even at its maximum rpm while

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.640 
stay quiet even at its maximum rpm while
still<00:03:31.609> putting<00:03:31.790> out<00:03:32.000> good<00:03:32.299> airflow<00:03:32.510> I<00:03:33.019> did

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
still putting out good airflow I did

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.229 
still putting out good airflow I did
forget<00:03:33.889> to<00:03:34.069> mention<00:03:34.159> that<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.639> cable<00:03:35.090> is

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
forget to mention that the cable is

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.789 
forget to mention that the cable is
braided<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.200> means<00:03:36.439> there's<00:03:36.620> less

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
braided so that means there's less

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.890 
braided so that means there's less
chance<00:03:36.829> which<00:03:37.250> snagging<00:03:37.730> on<00:03:37.849> anything<00:03:38.090> so

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
chance which snagging on anything so

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.059 
chance which snagging on anything so
that's<00:03:39.049> another<00:03:39.260> good<00:03:39.439> thing<00:03:39.500> they've<00:03:39.829> added

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
that's another good thing they've added

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.250 
that's another good thing they've added
I<00:03:40.280> have<00:03:40.760> no<00:03:40.939> problems<00:03:41.420> with<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.599> mounting

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
I have no problems with the mounting

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.780 
I have no problems with the mounting
system<00:03:42.439> on<00:03:42.769> this<00:03:42.950> fan<00:03:43.159> it's<00:03:43.400> very<00:03:43.609> high

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
system on this fan it's very high

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.390 
system on this fan it's very high
quality<00:03:43.819> very<00:03:44.359> robust<00:03:45.049> very<00:03:45.379> solid<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:46.370> I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400
