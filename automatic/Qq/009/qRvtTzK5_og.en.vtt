you lose a bit of breathability so when

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.359 
you lose a bit of breathability so when
you<00:01:18.869> put<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.140> unit<00:01:19.440> in<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:19.800> often<00:01:20.130> water

still on the same aterial and that can

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.469 
still on the same aterial and that can
lead<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> mildew<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.610> mold<00:01:23.670> well<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.300> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
breathability another feature that we do

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.700 
breathability another feature that we do
on<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.789> our<00:01:29.880> tents<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.390> Bingo<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:31.560> do

on all of our tents here at Bingo we do
use<00:01:31.890> double<00:01:32.280> stitching<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.270> our<00:01:33.450> competitors

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
use double stitching so our competitors

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
use double stitching so our competitors
are<00:01:34.140> using<00:01:34.470> single<00:01:34.770> stitching<00:01:35.250> obviously

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
are using single stitching obviously

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.450 
are using single stitching obviously
double<00:01:36.450> stitching<00:01:36.840> forms<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.289> much<00:01:37.470> tighter

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
double stitching forms a much tighter

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.290 
double stitching forms a much tighter
stronger<00:01:39.330> seams<00:01:40.020> between<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:40.830> pieces<00:01:41.300> okay

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
stronger seams between these pieces okay

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.850 
stronger seams between these pieces okay

important<00:03:52.860> feature<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.420> we<00:03:54.450> were<00:03:54.630> going<00:03:54.780> to

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
important feature so we were going to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.080 
important feature so we were going to
add<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.319> rubberized<00:03:55.890> suspension<00:03:56.489> all<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.940> our

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
add a rubberized suspension all of our

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.030 
add a rubberized suspension all of our
jay<00:03:57.420> feather<00:03:57.600> products<00:03:58.170> we're<00:03:58.799> now<00:03:58.890> at<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
jay feather products we're now at the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.470 
jay feather products we're now at the
workstation<00:03:59.370> where<00:03:59.790> we<00:03:59.910> install<00:04:00.269> the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
workstation where we install the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.390 
workstation where we install the
sidewalls<00:04:00.959> which<00:04:01.380> go<00:04:01.560> through<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.799> process<00:04:01.980> we

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
sidewalls which go through a process we

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.789 
sidewalls which go through a process we
call<00:04:02.430> vacuum<00:04:03.000> bonded<00:04:03.180> lamination<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:04.620> how

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
call vacuum bonded lamination then how

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.080 
call vacuum bonded lamination then how
about<00:04:04.950> telling<00:04:05.160> us<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.370> little<00:04:05.459> bit<00:04:05.609> about<00:04:05.850> how

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
about telling us a little bit about how

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.240 
about telling us a little bit about how
that<00:04:06.359> process<00:04:06.630> adds<00:04:07.109> true<00:04:07.530> value<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:07.920> the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
that process adds true value to the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.330 
that process adds true value to the
table<00:04:08.549> in<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.299> industry<00:04:09.720> there<00:04:09.900> are<00:04:10.019> two

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
table in the industry there are two

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.610 
table in the industry there are two
different<00:04:11.340> kinds<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.900> laminating

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
different kinds of laminating

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.319 
different kinds of laminating
we've<00:04:14.620> got<00:04:14.800> vacuum<00:04:15.310> bonding<00:04:15.760> which<00:04:16.030> is<00:04:16.150> what

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
we've got vacuum bonding which is what

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.229 
we've got vacuum bonding which is what
