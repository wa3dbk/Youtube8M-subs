00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.649
 hello i'm arthur this male kitchen judging by 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.540
 make it very simple and tasty 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.679
 healthy and nutritious dish called 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.679
 draniki itself 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.830
 Look at the card hello so for 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.510
 preparations of these very pancakes are great 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.080
 runes we need potatoes onion egg 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.490
 and a few spoons of flour 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.949
 amount of potatoes from arbitrary a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.630
 because it all depends on what 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.219
 the number of dranik you want 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.760
 cook here i will cook out 5 here 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.090
 such here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.160
 medium sized potatoes for them 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.440
 need an onion or if she 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.879
 big pretty half one egg 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.399
 potatoes can grate 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.430
 You can use a kitchen grinder 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.899
 harvester that you like more personally I 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.769
 I will 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.420
 grind potatoes for duck meat 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.990
 in principle, along with potatoes 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.320
 but I will miss the market milk onion where the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.660
 I will add this whole mix which has received from egg 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.640
 but here it seems we have turned 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.000
 after all through the meat grinder 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.570
 missed to crit formed a little 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 liquid to liquid excess but also 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:39.500
 merge u jack with people now we are what 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.500
 turned out to be salted to taste 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.180
 add pepper to taste black too 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.170
 and break the egg there 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.710
 and mix it all up 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.860
 here 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.180
 after everything is thoroughly mixed 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.640
 Apparently this is all pretty fluid and 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.900
 therefore it will be diluted and royal for that 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.500
 to more precisely so that this does not happen we 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.500
 add flour here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.680
 I will fill up this spoonful of cookies 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.170
 you shane 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.560
 add more 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.200
 word 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.200
 interfere 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.690
 and not yet 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.370
 perhaps probably enough 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.360
 everything can now be fried 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.230
 we will fry in sunflower oil 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.500
 pour it enough 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.880
 to cover the bottom of the pan 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.880
 draniki will not burn 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.370
 after the oil is enough 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.510
 warmed up 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:15.060
 on the pan begin frying pancakes 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:18.060
 take a spoon and spread on 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.060
 pan 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.840
 thread with plus new light 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:04.090
 and leave to fry until with not 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.090
 fry merchants until golden here 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:17.010
 draniki our fried 3-4 minutes side 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.010
 they are ready turning over 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.980
 Here is such a beautiful roast 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.670
 research 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.600
 but another three or four minutes backward 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.190
 to the side 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.190
 In principle, I think it will be ready 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.340
 all the time is out 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.330
 draniki ready to lay out on a plate 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.580
 draniki is supposed to eat 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:54.780
 with sour cream in this must add 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.780
 sour cream like this 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.379
 but still 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.300
 crushed garlic cloves of garlic and 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:09.180
 this garlic rubbed draniki notes 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:12.030
 for those who love garlic, you can still 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:19.229
 can decorate a little bit like that 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:20.849
