00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:10.510
 Hello everyone in today's issue I want 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.360
 talk to you about things like goal 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.280
 and tasks of the wedding photographer 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.890
 features of working with a videographer and about 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.380
 that lazy wedding photography is not 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.599
 place among young wedding photographers 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.609
 there is an opinion that the best pictures 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.679
 obtained during the filming 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.989
 when people don't know the way out 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.119
 it will be better 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.130
 channing but it is not always so on my 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.230
 look your goal and 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.630
 to take such photos 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.380
 which will excite people when 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.930
 watching 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.990
 them and after five after ten after 20 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.530
 years cause them the same emotion feelings 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.360
 how to do it well first you need 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.570
 get rid of the crowd 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.630
 the fact is that when you work with 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.630
 a pair of ladies in general display them on a whale 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.240
 feelings on emotions and behind your back site 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.460
 20 people of the graphics themselves are already drunk 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.560
 starts to comment out loud or 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.790
 just how to watch them but not 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.220
 get guys show some 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.730
 good feelings they will be a little 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.470
 shy will be clamped constrained nothing 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.870
 sensible with not work what do you 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.370
 first you need to do it 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.890
 need to get rid of the crowd of onlookers and 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.140
 working with the guys alone logisticians in 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.120
 friendships and all the time their 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.190
 praise during the shooting because the class 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.010
 in general, great fine and feel 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.270
 lacie super and when you say so you 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.610
 You can even complete nonsense. 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.170
 take pictures but they surely don't look that 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.760
 you shoot will not be very split not 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.500
 Immediately begins to show everything 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.799
 your feelings and that's it at this moment 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.690
 getting case footage is very important 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.850
 Remember this is a very important point and 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.799
 the second will often be nasadi 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.840
 attend a videographer and i will say 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.780
 you one thing that he will always be you 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 get in the way but what do the operators do 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.909
 There are two types of 1 are removed on a wide 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.369
 the angle they stand behind the meter from the young and they 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.170
 so much so that it is impossible at all 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.600
 nothing else to shoot others know how 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.119
 use the zoom and can shoot due to 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.300
 your shoulder or side and basically 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.780
 special problems will arise important 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.550
 that it is important not to clash under any circumstances 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.040
 with the videographer because if you 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.740
 start to clash then your on cheese is not 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.660
 spoils the couple sees that how would you 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.180
 the conflict they also spoil the mood 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.980
 and already very very sharply reduced 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.530
 the quality of your product is already hard on them 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.160
 withdraw no feelings get busy 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.290
 that you would like to leave this out of this 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.880
 situation just arrange just sit 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.980
 by the operator if it is really removed on 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.050
 wide angle with a meter from them to 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.970
 shoot all two passes first takes 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.790
 he then she leaves you do not interfere 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.890
 you shoot what you wanted in general 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.980
 try to keep friendly 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.590
 relationship and with the operator especially with 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.450
 guests it is very important I know that you have 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.300
 will always annoy a lot 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.830
 a lot of things but go over yourself and 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.080
 it's very important to learn how to 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.510
 go over yourself and be friendly 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.350
 remember this truth is very important and 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.810
 Third, I wanted to say that work 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.940
 wedding photographer this is on the very 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.050
 Indeed, the work is not for the lazy why 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.530
 that firstly I wind 15-20 meters 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.320
 in during the shooting there is a wedding before the start 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.320
 you run around young for a walk 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.120
 looking for the right angle good light x 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.829
 somehow you put young tired they 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.500
 are given you will pass three times 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.780
 I promise you more and then you come 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.250
 to the banquet and about lasts there six hours it's 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.920
 all this time the loops are working on 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.269
 legs and again you run to read 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.709
 so that there is a boy and angles 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.720
 It turned out very very very much 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.070
 move if you understand what is going 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.660
 three kilometers of your tank is shortness of breath 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.200
 there are guys do not even go on this 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.660
 profession 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.280
 first take care of your health 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.840
 develop there as a sport and 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.880
 try to develop first 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.440
 not that muscular strength endurance 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.650
 notice running or something 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.109
 and plus something else to say that I do not 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.030
 just running around with me as if hanging my 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.310
 my reflector backpack I somehow exit on 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.799
 do it yourself weigh my backpack with 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.570
 instrument reflector weighed 12 grams 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.910
 700 grams I imagine a whole 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.590
 day ran with such a load then the truth 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.870
 besides the apparatus were there chocolate and 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.970
 water how to say it is also very you 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.829
 I recommend to have it because it is not always 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.989
 feed you she needs to eat something before 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.930
 shkolota very quickly replenishes energy 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.460
 as if he always fits and for some reason 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.890
 I am recommended to pay type drinks 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.280
 coke or burn there well because they 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.560
 are sitting 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.870
 from caffeine to hair dryer, as if sorry for 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.870
 expression diuretics how would you be 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.139
 colored particles in the toilet and you can always 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.520
 do so I just when you have 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.430
 water up at the banquet you can of course 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.710

 cups mugs because there pro will give 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.130
