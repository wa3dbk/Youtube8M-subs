too<00:02:51.140> bad<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:51.620> think<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.340> one<00:02:52.610> was<00:02:52.820> all<00:02:53.420> along<00:02:53.960> a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
too bad I think this one was all along a

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.780 
too bad I think this one was all along a
perfect<00:02:54.980> DX<00:02:55.970> DVD<00:02:56.420> probably<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.470> best<00:02:57.800> DX<00:02:58.310> DVD

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
perfect DX DVD probably the best DX DVD

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.860 
perfect DX DVD probably the best DX DVD
from<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.330> 3d<00:03:00.230> X<00:03:00.410> DVDs<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.010> came<00:03:01.220> out

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
from the 3d X DVDs that came out

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.360 
from the 3d X DVDs that came out
excluding<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.960> VHS<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.590> think<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.800> VHS<00:03:04.190> was

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
excluding the VHS I think the VHS was

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.760 
excluding the VHS I think the VHS was
better<00:03:04.690> but<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.840> DVD<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.440> VHS<00:03:07.030> was<00:03:08.200> too

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
were very they weren't entertaining at

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.190 
were very they weren't entertaining at
all<00:04:36.830> they<00:04:37.730> lacked<00:04:38.060> charisma<00:04:38.690> that's<00:04:38.930> for<00:04:39.050> sure

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
all they lacked charisma that's for sure

but uh I think they were a little bit
underrated<00:04:43.070> they<00:04:43.370> could<00:04:43.550> have<00:04:43.640> done<00:04:43.730> a<00:04:43.790> little

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
underrated they could have done a little

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.240 
underrated they could have done a little
bit<00:04:44.240> more<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:45.410> know<00:04:45.500> they<00:04:45.650> got<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.890> tag<00:04:46.070> team

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
they could have been a lot better but uh

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.210

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
stuff that's happened in 2006 in my

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.090 
stuff that's happened in 2006 in my
opinion<00:06:24.880> 2006<00:06:25.880> was<00:06:26.210> probably<00:06:26.919> one<00:06:27.919> of<00:06:27.950> the

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
opinion 2006 was probably one of the

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.140 
opinion 2006 was probably one of the
top-five<00:06:28.820> best<00:06:29.169> years<00:06:30.790> that<00:06:31.790> I've<00:06:31.940> ever

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
top-five best years that I've ever

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.770 
top-five best years that I've ever
experienced<00:06:32.960> in<00:06:33.050> wrestling<00:06:34.000> you<00:06:35.000> know<00:06:35.180> there

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
experienced in wrestling you know there

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.240

were<00:06:35.870> so<00:06:36.110> many<00:06:36.200> great<00:06:36.500> years<00:06:36.710> but<00:06:36.979> I<00:06:37.039> think

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
were so many great years but I think

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.740 
were so many great years but I think
2006<00:06:37.789> was<00:06:37.940> one<00:06:38.120> of<00:06:38.210> the<00:06:38.300> best<00:06:38.510> years

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
2006 was one of the best years

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.950 
2006 was one of the best years
simply<00:06:40.560> because<00:06:40.740> of<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:40.979> list<00:06:41.849> of<00:06:42.030> numbers<00:06:42.689> of
