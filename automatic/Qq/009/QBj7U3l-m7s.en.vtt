00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.920 

hi<00:00:05.130> it's<00:00:05.310> Allison<00:00:05.700> from<00:00:05.850> Mahalo<00:00:06.240> comm<00:00:06.720> and

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
hi it's Allison from Mahalo comm and

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.390 
hi it's Allison from Mahalo comm and
today<00:00:07.259> we're<00:00:07.440> going<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.680> talk<00:00:07.859> about<00:00:08.130> writing

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
today we're going to talk about writing

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.970 
today we're going to talk about writing
whole<00:00:08.730> numbers<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.269> expanded<00:00:09.570> form<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.679> let's

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
whole numbers in expanded form so let's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.959 
whole numbers in expanded form so let's
look<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> whole<00:00:11.460> number

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
look at a whole number

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.090 
look at a whole number
let's<00:00:12.599> take<00:00:13.820> 213<00:00:14.870> now<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> base<00:00:16.710> 10

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
let's take 213 now we have a base 10

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.760 
let's take 213 now we have a base 10
number<00:00:17.520> system<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.930> use<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.470> place

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
number system and we use the place

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.859 
number system and we use the place
values<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> numbers<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.119> determine<00:00:21.300> their

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
values of the numbers to determine their

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.290 
values of the numbers to determine their
value<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.830> determine<00:00:23.310> how<00:00:23.789> big<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
value so we can determine how big of a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.009 
value so we can determine how big of a
number<00:00:24.439> 213<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.820> actually<00:00:27.420> all<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
number 213 is but it's actually all in

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
number 213 is but it's actually all in
powers<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.769> 10

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
powers of 10

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.950 
powers of 10
so<00:00:29.400> let<00:00:29.609> me<00:00:29.640> show<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.939> how<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.240> write<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
so let me show you how you write this in

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.090 
so let me show you how you write this in
expanded<00:00:31.349> form<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.910> actually<00:00:33.300> equal<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
expanded form this is actually equal to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:43.130 
expanded form this is actually equal to
2<00:00:35.100> times<00:00:35.820> 100<00:00:37.250> plus<00:00:38.250> 1<00:00:38.940> times<00:00:39.600> 10<00:00:40.489> plus<00:00:41.489> 3<00:00:42.210> times

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
2 times 100 plus 1 times 10 plus 3 times

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.790 
2 times 100 plus 1 times 10 plus 3 times
1<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.940> just<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.030> prove<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.660> 2<00:00:46.500> times

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
1 and just to prove it to you 2 times

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
1 and just to prove it to you 2 times
100<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.640> 200<00:00:48.920> 1<00:00:49.920> times<00:00:50.160> 10<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.460> 10<00:00:50.809> 3<00:00:51.809> times<00:00:52.050> 1<00:00:52.230> is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
100 is 200 1 times 10 is 10 3 times 1 is

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.310 
100 is 200 1 times 10 is 10 3 times 1 is
3<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.039> add<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.320> 213

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
3 and when we add all that up we get 213

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.740 
3 and when we add all that up we get 213
our<00:00:55.770> original<00:00:56.340> number<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.360> might<00:00:57.539> sort

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
our original number now this might sort

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.029 
our original number now this might sort
of<00:00:57.809> seem<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:57.989> we're<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.469> backwards<00:00:58.680> we

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
of seem like we're going backwards we

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.470 
of seem like we're going backwards we
have<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.309> nice<00:00:59.460> simple<00:00:59.730> number<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.390> we

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
have this nice simple number and then we

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
have this nice simple number and then we
write<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.809> complicated<00:01:01.410> thing<00:01:01.559> but

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
write this complicated thing but

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
write this complicated thing but
actually<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.539> how<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.840> determine<00:01:04.320> how<00:01:05.129> we

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
actually this is how we determine how we

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.520 
actually this is how we determine how we
use<00:01:05.549> whole<00:01:05.820> numbers<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.479> our<00:01:06.720> base<00:01:06.930> 10<00:01:07.170> number

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
use whole numbers in our base 10 number

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.160 
use whole numbers in our base 10 number
exists<00:01:07.890> 'm<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.790> number<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.659> position

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
exists 'm the number in this position

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
exists 'm the number in this position
the<00:01:10.290> digit<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> position<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.430> always

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
the digit in this position is always

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.050 
the digit in this position is always
just<00:01:12.150> multiplied<00:01:12.720> by<00:01:13.020> 1<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.369> digit<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.909> this

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
just multiplied by 1 the digit in this

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.660 
just multiplied by 1 the digit in this
position<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.689> multiplied<00:01:16.229> by<00:01:16.259> 10<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
position is multiplied by 10 and the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
position is multiplied by 10 and the
digit<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> position<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.020> multiplied<00:01:19.530> by

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
digit in this position is multiplied by

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.929 
digit in this position is multiplied by
100<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.270> those<00:01:21.720> place<00:01:22.259> values<00:01:22.490> help<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.729> give

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
100 so those place values help to give

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.600 
100 so those place values help to give
you<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.450> value<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.140> number<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:26.100> example

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
you the value of the number for example

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.080 
you the value of the number for example
if<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> number<00:01:28.040> 123<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.909> wrote

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
if we have the number 123 and we wrote

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.929 
if we have the number 123 and we wrote
it<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.299> expanded<00:01:30.869> form<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.920> would<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.220> 1<00:01:32.579> times

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it in expanded form we would get 1 times

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.130 
it in expanded form we would get 1 times
100<00:01:33.930> plus<00:01:34.680> 2<00:01:35.310> times<00:01:35.790> 10<00:01:36.409> plus<00:01:37.409> 3<00:01:37.860> times<00:01:38.430> 1<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.780> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
100 plus 2 times 10 plus 3 times 1 so in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.039 
100 plus 2 times 10 plus 3 times 1 so in
this<00:01:40.320> case<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:41.189> only<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.490> 1<00:01:42.180> times<00:01:42.600> 100

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
this case we only have 1 times 100

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.800 
this case we only have 1 times 100
whereas<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.369> 2<00:01:44.670> times<00:01:45.060> 100

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
whereas here we have 2 times 100

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.440 
whereas here we have 2 times 100
so<00:01:46.079> expanded<00:01:46.979> form<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:48.270> has

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
so expanded form is actually what has

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.719 
so expanded form is actually what has
led<00:01:48.780> us<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.020> begin<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.920> being<00:01:50.159> able<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.430> write

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
led us to begin with being able to write

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.819 
led us to begin with being able to write
our<00:01:50.909> numbers<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.170> that's<00:01:52.560> what

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
our numbers like that and that's what

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.550 
our numbers like that and that's what
expanded<00:01:53.280> form<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:54.290> thanks<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.439> learning
