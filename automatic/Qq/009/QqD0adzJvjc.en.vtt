00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
the e-type today don't know any other

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.340 
the e-type today don't know any other
way<00:02:03.740> them<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.280> go<00:02:04.400> fast<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:05.720> cars<00:02:05.960> events

way them to go fast the cars events

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.380 
way them to go fast the cars events
actually<00:02:06.530> perform<00:02:07.010> incredibly<00:02:07.520> well<00:02:07.730> despite

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
actually perform incredibly well despite

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.620 
actually perform incredibly well despite
very<00:02:08.780> difficult<00:02:09.200> conditions<00:02:09.710> but<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.399> think

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
very difficult conditions but I think

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.380 
very difficult conditions but I think
it's<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:11.720> British<00:02:12.340> enduring<00:02:13.340> spirit<00:02:13.970> that

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
it's that British enduring spirit that

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.030 
it's that British enduring spirit that
actually<00:02:14.750> ever<00:02:15.200> want<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.530> go<00:02:15.620> quick<00:02:15.860> in<00:02:15.980> a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
actually ever want to go quick in a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.680 
actually ever want to go quick in a
Jaguar<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:16.700> that's<00:02:16.940> exactly<00:02:17.060> what<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.480> done

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
Jaguar and that's exactly what it done

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:30.130 
Jaguar and that's exactly what it done
