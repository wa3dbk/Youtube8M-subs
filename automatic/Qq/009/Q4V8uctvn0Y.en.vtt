he was actually I wasn't gonna pick him
up<00:01:04.540> but<00:01:04.659> I<00:01:04.720> found<00:01:04.930> him<00:01:05.019> for<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.140> pretty<00:01:05.260> good

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
knocked me on the team for much longer

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.890

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
though and we go up to 1 late in the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.060 
though and we go up to 1 late in the
third<00:02:02.110> well<00:02:02.290> not<00:02:02.409> too<00:02:02.560> late<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.890> third

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
third well not too late in the third

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.430

about<00:02:03.310> halfway<00:02:03.460> through<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.850> third<00:02:04.060> and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
about halfway through the third and

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.870 
about halfway through the third and
honestly<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.620> upgrades<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.370> scheme<00:02:06.700> were

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
honestly the upgrades to the scheme were

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.279 
honestly the upgrades to the scheme were
so<00:02:07.120> worth<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.540> i<00:02:07.630> thought<00:02:07.810> i<00:02:07.870> could<00:02:08.049> play<00:02:08.200> with

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
so worth it i thought i could play with

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.990 
so worth it i thought i could play with
the<00:02:08.379> bronze<00:02:08.560> team<00:02:08.860> through<00:02:09.099> div<00:02:09.280> 9<00:02:09.549> up<00:02:09.879> to

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
the bronze team through div 9 up to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.550 
the bronze team through div 9 up to
about<00:02:10.209> like<00:02:10.450> div<00:02:10.629> eight<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.170> definitely

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
about like div eight I definitely

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.890 
about like div eight I definitely
couldn't<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.220> couldn't<00:02:12.250> take<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.670> anymore<00:02:13.060> but

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
couldn't I couldn't take it anymore but

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.539 
couldn't I couldn't take it anymore but
this<00:02:14.290> actually<00:02:14.560> helps<00:02:14.860> out<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.159> ton<00:02:15.190> this

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
this actually helps out a ton this

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.070 
this actually helps out a ton this
team's<00:02:15.849> a<00:02:15.970> lot<00:02:16.180> better<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.629> they<00:02:16.720> didn't<00:02:16.959> cost

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
team's a lot better and they didn't cost

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.869 
team's a lot better and they didn't cost
too<00:02:17.260> much<00:02:17.349> like<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.709> said<00:02:17.920> 10-k<00:02:18.340> for<00:02:18.400> basically

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
too much like I said 10-k for basically

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.479 
too much like I said 10-k for basically
a<00:02:19.000> full<00:02:19.299> team<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.500> worth<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.220> that's

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
a full team is so worth it and that's

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.009 
a full team is so worth it and that's
just<00:02:21.670> from<00:02:21.940> playing<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.299> couple<00:02:22.569> games<00:02:22.659> i<00:02:22.870> think

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
just from playing a couple games i think

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.509 
just from playing a couple games i think
it<00:02:23.080> was<00:02:23.170> five<00:02:23.379> games<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.220> flipped<00:02:24.430> a

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.630 
it was five games in and just flipped a
couple<00:02:24.790> cards<00:02:25.120> great<00:02:25.989> like<00:02:26.349> oh<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:27.430> just

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640

great<00:02:27.849> honestly<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.390> love<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.719> scheme<00:02:28.930> and

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
great honestly I love the scheme and

great honestly I love the scheme and
this<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.379> team<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.680> can<00:02:29.859> compete<00:02:30.129> with

this is a team that can compete with

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.089 
this is a team that can compete with
probably<00:02:31.629> some<00:02:31.779> indie<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.230> speed<00:02:32.889> is<00:02:32.980> very

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
probably some indie to speed is very

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.170 
probably some indie to speed is very
important<00:02:33.549> in<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:33.790> game

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180

go to work like see that Cogley I know
that's<00:02:49.150> not<00:02:49.329> gonna<00:02:49.450> happen<00:02:49.659> if<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:49.959> have<00:02:50.079> a

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
that's not gonna happen if you have a

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.059 
that's not gonna happen if you have a
bronze<00:02:50.379> player<00:02:50.590> they<00:02:50.769> were<00:02:50.829> just

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
bronze player they were just

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.949 
bronze player they were just
continuously<00:02:51.639> missing<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> net<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.480> that

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
continuously missing the net and that

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.629 
continuously missing the net and that
was<00:02:53.109> I<00:02:53.139> think<00:02:53.500> even<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:53.920> problem<00:02:54.310> more<00:02:54.489> than

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
was I think even the problem more than

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.149 
was I think even the problem more than
speed<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.469> like<00:02:56.469> I<00:02:56.620> could<00:02:56.769> get<00:02:56.920> around

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
speed I just like I could get around

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.399 
speed I just like I could get around
people<00:02:57.579> but<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.480> shots<00:02:58.719> they<00:02:59.049> just<00:02:59.260> weren't

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
people but the shots they just weren't

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.990 
people but the shots they just weren't
hitting<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.859> net<00:02:59.980> at<00:03:00.159> all<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.579> there<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:00.879> go

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
hitting the net at all and there we go

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.089 
hitting the net at all and there we go
our<00:03:01.389> second<00:03:01.959> goal<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.260> game<00:03:02.379> sweep<00:03:02.920> the

from this game which is crazy like just
think<00:03:58.720> about<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.959> normally<00:03:59.829> you<00:03:59.949> can<00:04:00.069> get

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
think about that normally you can get

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.710 
think about that normally you can get
about<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.459> thousand<00:04:00.909> max<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.239> doubling

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
about a thousand max is doubling

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.869 
about a thousand max is doubling
basically<00:04:02.590> you're<00:04:02.739> taking<00:04:03.099> half<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.310> time<00:04:03.669> to

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
basically you're taking half the time to

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.149 
basically you're taking half the time to
make<00:04:04.169> the<00:04:05.169> same<00:04:05.349> amount<00:04:05.379> of<00:04:05.739> pucks<00:04:05.949> it's
