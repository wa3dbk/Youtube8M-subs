we<00:00:00.329> have<00:00:00.630> become<00:00:00.930> very<00:00:01.140> familiar<00:00:01.290> with<00:00:01.740> the

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
we have become very familiar with the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.740 
we have become very familiar with the
military<00:00:02.100> uses<00:00:02.580> for<00:00:02.879> drones<00:00:03.149> but<00:00:03.419> what<00:00:03.540> about

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
military uses for drones but what about

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.900 
military uses for drones but what about
specifically<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.560> case<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.520> report

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
specifically in the case of this report

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.000 
specifically in the case of this report
that<00:00:06.480> Facebook<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.049> interested<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.620> Titan

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
that Facebook is interested in Titan

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.910 
that Facebook is interested in Titan
aerospace<00:00:08.250> what<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:08.970> tight<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.480> make<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.170> how

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
aerospace what is tight and make and how

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.330 
aerospace what is tight and make and how
could<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.370> potentially<00:00:11.490> be<00:00:11.940> used<00:00:11.969> by<00:00:12.420> Facebook

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
could it potentially be used by Facebook

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.430 
could it potentially be used by Facebook
well<00:00:14.340> what<00:00:14.549> Titan<00:00:14.880> aerospace<00:00:15.059> has<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:16.199> an

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
well what Titan aerospace has is an

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.380 
well what Titan aerospace has is an
unmanned<00:00:16.740> aircraft<00:00:17.160> system<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.910> can<00:00:18.090> fly

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
unmanned aircraft system that can fly

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.370 
unmanned aircraft system that can fly
above<00:00:19.490> 65,000<00:00:20.490> feet<00:00:21.080> therefore<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.289> they're

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
above 65,000 feet therefore what they're

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.890 
above 65,000 feet therefore what they're
going<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.590> use<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.359> deal<00:00:24.630> that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
going to use it for if this deal that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.359 
going to use it for if this deal that
has<00:00:24.990> been<00:00:25.140> rumored<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.560> happen<00:00:25.890> goes<00:00:26.039> through

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
has been rumored to happen goes through

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.419 
has been rumored to happen goes through
is<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.599> allow<00:00:28.080> them<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.439> have<00:00:28.470> communications

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
is to allow them to have communications

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.179 
is to allow them to have communications
with<00:00:30.119> many<00:00:30.810> different<00:00:31.289> parts<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.099> world

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
with many different parts of the world

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.490 
with many different parts of the world
so<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.510> particular<00:00:33.690> case<00:00:34.230> this

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
so in this particular case this

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.160 
so in this particular case this
technology<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.399> been<00:00:35.579> demonstrated<00:00:36.300> back<00:00:36.989> in

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
technology has been demonstrated back in

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.369 
technology has been demonstrated back in
2010<00:00:38.270> dopper<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.480> Department<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.320> Defense

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
2010 dopper the Department of Defense

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.650 
2010 dopper the Department of Defense
had<00:00:41.309> worked<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> program<00:00:42.000> called<00:00:42.120> vulture

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
had worked on a program called vulture

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.250 
had worked on a program called vulture
that<00:00:43.260> actually<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.100> fly<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.399> five<00:00:44.910> years

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
that actually was to fly for five years

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.750 
that actually was to fly for five years
at<00:00:46.260> high<00:00:46.530> altitudes<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
at high altitudes and this is really a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.729 
at high altitudes and this is really a
low-orbit<00:00:48.239> satellite<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.410> we're<00:00:49.559> talking

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
low-orbit satellite that we're talking

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
low-orbit satellite that we're talking
about<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.000> allow<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.629> have

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
about and this would allow them to have

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.229 
about and this would allow them to have
internet<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:53.010> countries<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:54.180> do

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
internet in countries that right now do

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
internet in countries that right now do
not<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.899> that's<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.140> two-thirds<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
not and that's about two-thirds of the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
not and that's about two-thirds of the
world<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> without<00:00:57.300> us<00:00:57.539> getting<00:00:57.600> too

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
world so without us getting too

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.020 
world so without us getting too
technical<00:00:58.320> we're<00:00:58.920> thinking<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.670> drone

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
technical we're thinking about a drone

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.299 
technical we're thinking about a drone
that<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.390> provide<00:01:00.750> Internet<00:01:01.109> access<00:01:01.469> we

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that can provide Internet access we

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.050 
that can provide Internet access we
should<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> satellite

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
should think of it like a satellite

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.660 
should think of it like a satellite
exactly<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> low<00:01:06.840> flying<00:01:07.250> low<00:01:08.250> orbit

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
exactly this is a low flying low orbit

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.539 
exactly this is a low flying low orbit
satellite<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:10.110> has<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.799> ability<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
satellite that has the ability to

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.840 
satellite that has the ability to
maneuver<00:01:12.799> within<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.010> band<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.610> want

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
maneuver within the band that they want

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
maneuver within the band that they want
to<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.330> allow<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.290> connectivity<00:01:16.950> of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
to to allow for the connectivity of

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.670 
to to allow for the connectivity of
communications<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> look<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.200> Africa

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
communications so if you look at Africa

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.109 
communications so if you look at Africa
and<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> look<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> third<00:01:20.970> world

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and you look at some of the third world

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.840 
and you look at some of the third world
countries<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.110> skip<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> generation<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
countries that skip the generation of

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.020 
countries that skip the generation of
cell<00:01:24.119> phones<00:01:24.390> they<00:01:24.990> went<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.470> never<00:01:26.030> put

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
cell phones they went they never put

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810 
cell phones they went they never put
power<00:01:27.390> lines<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:28.080> hard<00:01:28.950> cable<00:01:29.310> lines<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
power lines or hard cable lines in the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
power lines or hard cable lines in the
ground<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.020> cell<00:01:31.560> coverage

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
ground but now they have cell coverage

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.260 
ground but now they have cell coverage
well<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> exact<00:01:32.909> same<00:01:33.090> thing

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
well this is the exact same thing

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.249 
well this is the exact same thing
they're<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.900> internet

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
they're going to do with the internet

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.929 
they're going to do with the internet
they'll<00:01:34.770> skip<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> generation<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
they'll skip a generation of the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
they'll skip a generation of the
internet<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.509> go<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.200> ability<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:37.890> do

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
internet and go to the ability to now do

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.450 
internet and go to the ability to now do
it<00:01:38.310> through<00:01:38.549> these<00:01:39.150> low<00:01:39.540> flying<00:01:40.460> orbital

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it through these low flying orbital

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.789 
it through these low flying orbital
satellites<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.810> now<00:01:43.140> called<00:01:43.470> unmanned

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
satellites that are now called unmanned

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.460 
satellites that are now called unmanned
aircraft<00:01:44.159> systems<00:01:44.490> or<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> call<00:01:44.909> them<00:01:45.030> drones

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
aircraft systems or you call them drones

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.620 
aircraft systems or you call them drones
how<00:01:46.470> would<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.890> compared<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.149> Google's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
how would this compared to what Google's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
how would this compared to what Google's
been<00:01:49.350> focused<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.979> they<00:01:50.640> call<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.939> project

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
been focused on they call it project

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.880 
been focused on they call it project
loon<00:01:51.659> both<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.200> these<00:01:52.259> companies<00:01:52.530> obviously

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
loon both of these companies obviously

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.280 
loon both of these companies obviously
interested<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.149> more<00:01:54.270> people<00:01:54.450> using<00:01:54.960> the

interested in more people using the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
interested in more people using the
internet<00:01:55.590> around<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> globe<00:01:56.329> right<00:01:57.329> well

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
internet around the globe right well

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.719 
internet around the globe right well
project<00:01:58.079> moon<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.649> what<00:01:58.860> Google<00:01:59.399> was<00:01:59.520> doing

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
project moon and what Google was doing

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.310 
project moon and what Google was doing
is<00:01:59.820> they<00:01:59.909> were<00:01:59.969> looking<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.450> balloons<00:02:00.869> that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is they were looking at balloons that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.469 
is they were looking at balloons that
would<00:02:01.439> fly<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:01.829> those<00:02:02.070> higher<00:02:02.790> altitudes

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
would fly at those higher altitudes

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
would fly at those higher altitudes
actually<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> stratosphere<00:02:04.850> that<00:02:05.850> would

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
actually in the stratosphere that would

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.570 
actually in the stratosphere that would
allow<00:02:06.270> them<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:07.049> able<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.680> again<00:02:07.950> use<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.459> as

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
allow them to be able to again use it as

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.669 
allow them to be able to again use it as
a<00:02:08.610> relay<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.149> con<00:02:09.509> relay<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.410> allow

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
a relay a con relay that would allow

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.660 
a relay a con relay that would allow
them<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.009> connectivity<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
them to have connectivity so that

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.270 
them to have connectivity so that
could<00:02:12.819> provide<00:02:13.030> internet<00:02:13.569> service<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.620> places

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
could provide internet service to places

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.100 
could provide internet service to places
right<00:02:15.430> now<00:02:15.490> that<00:02:16.000> are<00:02:16.030> denied<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.660> because

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
right now that are denied that because

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.630 
right now that are denied that because
there<00:02:17.349> is<00:02:17.470> no<00:02:17.620> infrastructure<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.489> allows

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
there is no infrastructure that allows

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.140 
there is no infrastructure that allows
that<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.000> happen<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.599> I<00:02:20.230> think<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.819> Titan

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
that to happen so I think the the Titan

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.089 
that to happen so I think the the Titan
aerospace<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> better<00:02:23.260> model<00:02:23.560> because<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
aerospace is a better model because it

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.430 
aerospace is a better model because it
has<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.430> ability<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.819> maneuver<00:02:25.270> whereas<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
has the ability to maneuver whereas the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.830 
has the ability to maneuver whereas the
balloons<00:02:26.739> basically<00:02:27.489> are<00:02:27.640> floating<00:02:28.599> along

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
balloons basically are floating along

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.800 
balloons basically are floating along
basically<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.010> space<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:31.660> before

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
basically just in the space just before

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.050 
basically just in the space just before
we<00:02:32.020> go<00:02:32.170> Michael<00:02:32.590> where<00:02:33.069> do<00:02:33.280> government's<00:02:33.880> come

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
we go Michael where do government's come

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.479 
we go Michael where do government's come
into<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.540> story<00:02:34.959> especially<00:02:35.410> if<00:02:35.980> Facebook

is<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.000> be<00:02:37.180> using<00:02:37.750> these<00:02:37.989> drones<00:02:38.350> in

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
is going to be using these drones in

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.559 
is going to be using these drones in
parts<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.280> Africa<00:02:39.790> where<00:02:40.330> does<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
parts of Africa where does the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.120 
parts of Africa where does the
government<00:02:40.840> have<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.140> say<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.680> how<00:02:41.980> does<00:02:42.040> that

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
government have a say and how does that

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.120 
government have a say and how does that
all<00:02:42.340> play<00:02:42.519> out<00:02:42.959> well<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.290> FAA<00:02:44.620> which<00:02:44.980> is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
all play out well the FAA which is

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.220 
all play out well the FAA which is
regulatory<00:02:45.400> is<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.790> national<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.840> air

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
regulatory is the national the the air

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.500 
regulatory is the national the the air
space<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.709> we<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:48.340> exist<00:02:48.489> in<00:02:48.880> only

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
space that we that we exist in only

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.930 
space that we that we exist in only
regulates<00:02:49.930> up<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.230> about<00:02:50.319> 60,000<00:02:51.220> feet<00:02:51.459> so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
regulates up to about 60,000 feet so

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.789 
regulates up to about 60,000 feet so
these<00:02:52.180> systems<00:02:52.630> would<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:52.930> flying<00:02:53.200> above<00:02:53.560> that

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
these systems would be flying above that

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.430 
these systems would be flying above that
in<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.340> in<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:54.940> really<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.660> sub<00:02:55.930> orbital

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
in the in the really the sub orbital

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.590 
in the in the really the sub orbital
phase<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:57.400> therefore<00:02:57.730> there<00:02:58.030> wouldn't<00:02:58.330> be<00:02:58.420> any

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
phase so therefore there wouldn't be any

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.360 
phase so therefore there wouldn't be any
regulation<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.440> only<00:02:59.560> difficulty<00:03:00.190> would

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
regulation so the only difficulty would

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.440 
regulation so the only difficulty would
be<00:03:00.519> or<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.760> only<00:03:00.880> thing<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.090> they<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.330> to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
be or the only thing that they have to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.539 
be or the only thing that they have to
contend<00:03:01.810> with<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.110> getting<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.370> that

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
contend with is getting up to that

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.390 
contend with is getting up to that
altitude
