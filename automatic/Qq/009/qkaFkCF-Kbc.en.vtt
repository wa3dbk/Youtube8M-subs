00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hacking hello my other friends with you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.759
 needle and in this release we will do 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.830
 small 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.219
 or the same mean fountain that will 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 supplement your building 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.760
 that is, a house or something else that is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
 we have a small bonus today and 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.560
 it was possible to build this fountain 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.970
 quickly and without too much cost and effort is not 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.740
 let's get started 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 you will need to start quartz 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.750
 columns we put them like this in one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.239
 block or move standing on 2 blocks and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 this time die here two 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.050
 now again in one block set 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.540
 2 blocks 1 that is, we repeat that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:50.820
 the same design is still pretty easy 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:53.399
 here 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2, we will turn 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.760
 vodka rounded design showing 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.309
 on top of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.260
 here we look and now 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.900
 here is no better 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.960
 yes here and so 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:10.260
 they no let's take by 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.860
 carved quartz block here so here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.140
 and the bottom we put the blocks of carved quartz and 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.550
 here in these crotchs we insert here 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.880
 so that way the steps so now 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.110
 here 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.930
 and here it is excellent and now we are here 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.079
 let's put what are they called us plates 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.479
 that is, we through one mouth with us 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:41.460
 will turn out 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.110
 damn get 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.030
 like this 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:52.600
 so and so here is such a form now we 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.850
 take the cobblestone and heads here inside u 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.500
 us all space ie we its 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.710
 just break and close the cobble and y 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.770
 you will make some 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.209
 what space for water here if 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.130
 do you want to make a medieval contact 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.680
 I advise you to replace the quartz blocks 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.640
 on cobblestone blocks respectively 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.450
 steps there are semi-blocks or whatever else there 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.959
 to the middle group 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.120
 well stone steps up or food on 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.690
 if you build an ancient style there 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.750
 Egypt and in general I thought 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.550
 try yourself in the style of such an ancient 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.000
 Egypt when still 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.530
 empty pro or Arabs and they tried and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.740
 such as here 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.730
 such beautiful houses and would like myself 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.490
 try exactly here in this style not 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.370
 I know how it will turn out like this 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.280
 it turned out and now we find the middle 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.650
 I neatly stand in this middle 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.920
 end of the column and checks adolescence on 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.950
 mid you lift to 4 blocks 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.730
 so here is the hot behind the parking lot 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.580
 quartz steps so its so well here 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.450
 we will put quartz plate 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.200
 that's how its so 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.569
 great now here we stand 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.769
 quartz steps like this 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:26.560
 way and take quartz blocks here 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:31.120
 here I'm standing here 6 RF 1 and the withdrawal of 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.799
 three blocks so here aside 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.319
 and like that but that's such a cross from 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.280
 we are now we are like this 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.830
 we put on one block 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.800
 from each line we get 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.660
 small here is such a cross and now 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:55.530
 here is the space so close so 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:00.000
 you're all very easy what you promised like this 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.880
 so great and now we are doing well 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.670
 now here here we put in the court 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.590
 your knee and here are the columns 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:14.180
 here and here here and here more 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.389
 also put let's go like this yes 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.500
 you don't touch anything here, let's 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:26.270
 replace on quartz steps blocks 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:32.280
 so that everything is not very square on 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:36.240
 it looked so here now take 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.270
 court your plate and so on 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.520
 we will arrange these two ours and columns and 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.810
 we flow through these spaces 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.470
 water and now we raise 1 2 3 4 4 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.720
 block up and here we have to say so 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.160
 the final version of the fountain to me 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.289
 give signs to the case of the gift 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:02.069
 and dachshund dachshund 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.700
 yes here here so here we put 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:08.680
 So 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:11.440
 so and so and here and here in two 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.840
 block that's what we did and let's 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.620
 Now let's fill it all with water from here and 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.510
 let's see what we get here 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.790
 went pampa as you can see and 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.120
 now i'm on top if you don't want here 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.740
 such irregularities here then you better 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:32.009
 put water here 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.520
 here it is 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:38.759
 here here here is also possible 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.069
 see because there is little water here 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.919
 so here we are making not as you see with us 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:47.939
 It turned out such a beautiful and drone 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:50.789
 so easy to build such a fountain yes here 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:54.059
 but there is a bottom here you can 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:58.110
 add more steps to better 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:06:00.569
 we looked yes that is like that 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.699
 perhaps that's all if you liked it 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.580

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.389
 the buildings are gray if you and the builder 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.139
 then join our i 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.599
 architectural team 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.230
 we on it I say goodbye to you 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:45.880
