00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
complete so I'm not really considering a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
complete so I'm not really considering a
definitive<00:01:10.770> version<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> good<00:01:12.240> first

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
definitive version but it's a good first

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.910 
definitive version but it's a good first

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
peek and a blaster that should be in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.410 
with two of them we just kind of slapped
one<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.090> there<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> other<00:01:48.090> one

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
one in there and you put the other one

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.539 
one in there and you put the other one
up<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.530> you're<00:01:49.680> curious<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.310> can't

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
up there and if you're curious you can't

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.969 
up there and if you're curious you can't
actually<00:01:50.759> put<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> other<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.899> too

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
actually put it in the other way too

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.200 
actually put it in the other way too
however<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.490> putting<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.000> there

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
however if you like putting it in there

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
however if you like putting it in there
and<00:01:54.930> pull<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.860> great<00:01:56.280> trigger<00:01:57.560> box<00:01:58.560> here<00:02:00.740> not

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and pull that great trigger box here not

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.709 
and pull that great trigger box here not
bad<00:02:02.840> size-wise<00:02:04.579> it's<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.270> bigger

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
bad size-wise it's a little bit bigger

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.330 
bad size-wise it's a little bit bigger
than<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.829> old<00:02:07.860> triad<00:02:08.580> there<00:02:09.379> but<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> lot

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
than the old triad there but it's a lot

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.360 
than the old triad there but it's a lot
cooler<00:02:11.550> looking<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
cooler looking and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.470 
cooler looking and
what<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.640> heck<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:12.909> thing's<00:02:13.180> supposed<00:02:13.269> to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
what the heck this thing's supposed to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.229 
what the heck this thing's supposed to
be<00:02:13.599> some<00:02:13.870> kind<00:02:14.019> of<00:02:14.080> futuristic<00:02:14.409> pepper<00:02:14.860> box

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
be some kind of futuristic pepper box

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.789 
be some kind of futuristic pepper box
but<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.420> guy<00:02:16.659> definitely<00:02:17.230> looks<00:02:17.440> really

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
but this guy definitely looks really

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.860 
but this guy definitely looks really
really<00:02:18.040> menacing<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.730> lot<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.390> 2015

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
really menacing a lot of the 2015

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.570 
really menacing a lot of the 2015
blasters<00:02:20.230> look<00:02:20.409> amazing<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.280> no

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
blasters look amazing and this is no

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.780 
blasters look amazing and this is no
exception<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.040> only<00:02:24.190> other<00:02:24.400> thing<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.610> do

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
exception so the only other thing to do

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.420 
exception so the only other thing to do
is<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.209> compare<00:02:25.659> it<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.080> madness<00:02:26.860> which

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
is to compare it to the madness which

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.710 
is to compare it to the madness which
was<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> previous<00:02:27.909> smallest<00:02:28.480> thing<00:02:28.690> that

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
was the previous smallest thing that

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.059 
was the previous smallest thing that
shot<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.019> mega<00:02:29.290> dart<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:30.780> man<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:32.379> it<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.769> lot

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
shot a mega dart and man is it a lot

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.880 
shot a mega dart and man is it a lot
smaller<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.640> use<00:02:33.819> them<00:02:34.120> by<00:02:34.810> big<00:02:35.200> shock<00:02:35.530> than<00:02:35.799> it

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
smaller to use them by big shock than it

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.399 
smaller to use them by big shock than it
is<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.129> use<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.370> Magnus<00:02:36.819> but<00:02:37.090> how<00:02:38.019> does<00:02:38.079> it

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
is to use the Magnus but how does it

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:47.610 
is to use the Magnus but how does it
compare<00:02:41.760> find<00:02:42.760> out<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.930> hopefully<00:02:47.109> by<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
compare find out so hopefully by the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.220 
compare find out so hopefully by the
sound<00:02:48.129> of<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.579> hitting<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:49.000> box<00:02:49.329> and<00:02:49.629> how<00:02:49.930> far

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
sound of it hitting the box and how far

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.780 
sound of it hitting the box and how far
the<00:02:50.379> dart<00:02:50.620> bounced<00:02:51.099> you<00:02:51.190> can<00:02:51.340> kind<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.609> tell

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
the dart bounced you can kind of tell

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.030 
the dart bounced you can kind of tell
that<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:52.060> Magnus<00:02:52.390> does<00:02:52.720> indeed<00:02:53.140> punch<00:02:53.560> harder

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
that the Magnus does indeed punch harder

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.099 
that the Magnus does indeed punch harder
that<00:02:54.670> isn't<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.030> say<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.209> this<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.690> slouch

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
that isn't to say that this is a slouch

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.589 
that isn't to say that this is a slouch
the<00:02:56.980> great<00:02:57.220> trigger<00:02:57.489> version<00:02:57.970> again<00:02:58.209> if<00:02:58.450> we

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
the great trigger version again if we

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.789 
the great trigger version again if we
get<00:02:58.780> an<00:02:58.900> orange<00:02:59.140> trigger<00:02:59.409> version<00:02:59.680> that

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
get an orange trigger version that

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.289 
get an orange trigger version that
should<00:02:59.980> be<00:03:00.099> more<00:03:00.250> powerful<00:03:00.819> although<00:03:01.000> this

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
should be more powerful although this

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.479 
should be more powerful although this
box<00:03:01.659> does<00:03:01.900> not<00:03:01.930> claim<00:03:02.500> any<00:03:02.709> ranges<00:03:03.069> whatsoever

should be more powerful another thing to

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.360 
should be more powerful another thing to

that<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.239> will<00:03:40.419> have<00:03:40.599> two<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.989> them<00:03:41.790> until<00:03:42.790> we

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
that I will have two of them until we

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.339 
that I will have two of them until we
get<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.180> old<00:03:43.359> trigger<00:03:43.660> version<00:03:44.049> I'm<00:03:44.139> just

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
get that old trigger version I'm just

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.780 
get that old trigger version I'm just
gonna<00:03:44.500> keep<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.829> one<00:03:44.889> nice<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.220> safe<00:03:45.519> um

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
gonna keep this one nice and safe um

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.979 
gonna keep this one nice and safe um
when<00:03:45.940> we<00:03:46.030> get<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.299> orange<00:03:46.449> trigger<00:03:46.720> version

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
when we get that orange trigger version

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.119 
when we get that orange trigger version
I'm<00:03:47.079> gonna<00:03:47.260> cut<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.620> open

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
I'm gonna cut it open

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.879 
I'm gonna cut it open
so<00:03:48.819> overall<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.810> ergonomics<00:03:50.410> are<00:03:50.560> pretty

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
so overall the ergonomics are pretty

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.650 
so overall the ergonomics are pretty
decent<00:03:51.400> this<00:03:51.549> bar<00:03:51.790> does<00:03:52.000> get<00:03:52.239> in<00:03:52.359> the<00:03:52.449> way<00:03:52.599> but

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
decent this bar does get in the way but

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.569 
decent this bar does get in the way but
kind<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.709> gets<00:03:53.859> in<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.069> way<00:03:54.160> on<00:03:54.310> all<00:03:54.459> these

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
kind of gets in the way on all these

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.309 
kind of gets in the way on all these
other<00:03:54.730> blasters<00:03:55.239> -<00:03:55.449> I<00:03:55.480> like<00:03:55.750> how<00:03:55.870> this<00:03:55.989> one<00:03:56.049> has

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
other blasters - I like how this one has

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.710 
other blasters - I like how this one has
like<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> nice<00:03:56.739> ringing<00:03:57.340> part<00:03:57.579> right<00:03:57.790> here<00:03:58.120> so

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
like a nice ringing part right here so

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.819 
like a nice ringing part right here so
it<00:03:58.810> feels<00:03:58.959> a<00:03:59.079> little<00:03:59.199> bit<00:03:59.379> better<00:03:59.530> but<00:03:59.709> the

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
it feels a little bit better but the

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.309 
it feels a little bit better but the
edges<00:04:00.250> are<00:04:00.430> certainly<00:04:00.849> sharper<00:04:01.389> this<00:04:01.750> well

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
edges are certainly sharper this well

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.710 
edges are certainly sharper this well
this<00:04:02.470> is<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.680> flat<00:04:03.310> there's<00:04:03.940> no<00:04:04.060> economics

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
this is just flat there's no economics

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.809 
this is just flat there's no economics
in<00:04:04.870> it<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:05.500> these<00:04:05.620> edges<00:04:06.099> are<00:04:06.190> much<00:04:06.430> thicker

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
in it but these edges are much thicker

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.420 
in it but these edges are much thicker
so<00:04:07.090> doesn't<00:04:07.269> hurt<00:04:07.480> my<00:04:07.599> hand<00:04:07.840> at<00:04:07.989> all<00:04:08.109> and<00:04:08.430> yes

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
so doesn't hurt my hand at all and yes

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.550 
so doesn't hurt my hand at all and yes
one<00:04:10.060> more<00:04:10.209> time<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.720> blaster<00:04:11.079> does<00:04:11.260> look

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
one more time the blaster does look

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.500 
one more time the blaster does look
really<00:04:12.010> really<00:04:12.400> cool<00:04:12.639> it's<00:04:12.819> got<00:04:12.879> that<00:04:13.150> kind<00:04:13.449> of

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
really really cool it's got that kind of

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.750 
really really cool it's got that kind of
digital<00:04:13.900> camo<00:04:14.230> thing<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.739> Nerf<00:04:15.250> blasters

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
digital camo thing that Nerf blasters

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.689 
digital camo thing that Nerf blasters
have<00:04:15.910> had<00:04:16.060> recently<00:04:16.889> but<00:04:17.889> overall<00:04:18.190> what<00:04:18.579> do<00:04:18.639> I

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
have had recently but overall what do I

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.899 
have had recently but overall what do I
think<00:04:18.789> well<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:19.720> love<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:21.489> gray<00:04:21.669> trigger

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
think well I love the gray trigger

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.120 
think well I love the gray trigger
version<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:22.450> far<00:04:22.719> it's<00:04:23.229> not<00:04:23.380> super<00:04:23.770> powerful

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
version so far it's not super powerful

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.700 
version so far it's not super powerful
shoots<00:04:24.789> far<00:04:25.060> enough

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
shoots far enough

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.950 
shoots far enough
and<00:04:25.889> it's<00:04:26.100> amazingly<00:04:26.669> accurate<00:04:26.970> it's<00:04:27.780> also

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
and it's amazingly accurate it's also

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.200 
and it's amazingly accurate it's also
nice<00:04:28.259> and<00:04:28.500> healthy<00:04:28.710> easy<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.699> prime<00:04:29.940> although

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
nice and healthy easy to prime although

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.340 
nice and healthy easy to prime although
I<00:04:30.240> do<00:04:30.330> want<00:04:30.539> to<00:04:30.630> try<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.840> figure<00:04:31.050> out<00:04:31.199> a<00:04:31.229> way<00:04:31.320> to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
I do want to try to figure out a way to

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.840 
I do want to try to figure out a way to
switch<00:04:31.770> this<00:04:32.039> around<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.699> other

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
switch this around to the other

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.550 
switch this around to the other
direction<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.600> I'm<00:04:33.720> pulling<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.139> this

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
direction so I'm pulling it like this

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.930 
direction so I'm pulling it like this
but<00:04:35.490> it's<00:04:35.850> very<00:04:36.270> very<00:04:36.690> very<00:04:37.169> nice<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:37.860> for<00:04:38.639> 11

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
but it's very very very nice and for 11

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.550 
but it's very very very nice and for 11
bucks<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.419> little<00:04:39.720> steep<00:04:39.990> you<00:04:40.229> can<00:04:40.410> get<00:04:40.530> a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
bucks it's a little steep you can get a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.469 
bucks it's a little steep you can get a
double<00:04:40.860> shock<00:04:41.250> or<00:04:41.460> probably<00:04:41.820> even<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.180> strong

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
double shock or probably even a strong

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.050 
double shock or probably even a strong
arm<00:04:42.720> for<00:04:42.930> that<00:04:42.960> price<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:44.070> still<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:44.940> really

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
arm for that price but still it's really

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.969 
arm for that price but still it's really
nice<00:04:45.539> it<00:04:45.810> shoots<00:04:46.139> mega<00:04:46.380> darts<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:46.949> a

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
nice it shoots mega darts and is a

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.680 
nice it shoots mega darts and is a
perfect<00:04:47.220> way<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.520> get<00:04:47.699> into<00:04:47.910> using<00:04:48.060> mega<00:04:48.389> darts

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
perfect way to get into using mega darts

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.129 
perfect way to get into using mega darts
I<00:04:48.900> personally<00:04:49.830> liked<00:04:50.190> mega<00:04:50.490> darts<00:04:50.850> I've<00:04:51.600> never

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
I personally liked mega darts I've never

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.490 
I personally liked mega darts I've never
had<00:04:52.440> an<00:04:52.560> issue<00:04:52.740> with<00:04:53.130> these<00:04:53.630> I've<00:04:54.630> stepped<00:04:55.289> on

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
had an issue with these I've stepped on

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.189 
had an issue with these I've stepped on
them<00:04:55.680> all<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:55.949> time<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.880> just<00:04:57.210> mangled<00:04:57.870> them

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
them all the time and just mangled them

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.749 
them all the time and just mangled them
and<00:04:58.380> they've<00:04:58.470> always<00:04:58.740> flown<00:04:59.160> straight<00:04:59.490> every

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
and they've always flown straight every

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.129 
and they've always flown straight every
single<00:05:00.000> time<00:05:00.150> for<00:05:00.389> me<00:05:00.539> unlike<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:00.930> standard

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
single time for me unlike a standard

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.719 
single time for me unlike a standard
leap<00:05:01.650> dart<00:05:01.889> where<00:05:02.070> if<00:05:02.160> it<00:05:02.250> gets<00:05:02.400> stepped<00:05:02.610> on

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
leap dart where if it gets stepped on

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.320 
leap dart where if it gets stepped on
once<00:05:02.970> it's<00:05:03.479> practically<00:05:04.259> useless<00:05:04.849> but<00:05:05.849> I<00:05:06.060> have

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
once it's practically useless but I have

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.850 
once it's practically useless but I have
not<00:05:06.509> used<00:05:06.630> this<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.020> war<00:05:07.199> yet<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:07.620> hopefully

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
not used this in a war yet and hopefully

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.089 
not used this in a war yet and hopefully
I<00:05:08.190> will<00:05:08.520> soon<00:05:09.500> thank<00:05:10.500> you<00:05:10.560> very<00:05:10.740> much<00:05:10.919> for
