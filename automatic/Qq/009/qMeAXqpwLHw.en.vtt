00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 here I want to say a few words about the small screen 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.540
 that is what this screen shows 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.059
 that is, the temperature at the left above the right 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.230
 time from below we see the gear shift 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.480
 one metro total mileage and in the middle how 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.390
 would be a screen that changes information 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 now this case is the power reserve here 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 gas mileage average speed is possible and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.009
 zero hold down the button and pro up 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.969
 Again , this is 4 mileage those three who have 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.920
 us there is a total of 1 meter 1 meter b yet 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.710
 I do not know one run, but also 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.140
 handy thing travel time that is if 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.090
 you're leaving just temporarily knocking down 0 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.289
 example you go where do you know how much 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.110
 time is enough for a second you go 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.559
 plus the limit is displayed here that is 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.360
 speed limit expose 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.980
 set mode 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.070
 information and the power reserve is nowhere 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 leaves it moves a little lower or us 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.710
 interested in cruise expose cruise cruise 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.439
 only at the speed will turn on then 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.510
 there is again a very convenient screen on 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.740
 He has a lot of different information plus 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.450
 We can go to the setup menu 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.229
 hold and there we can adjust 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.180
 watch plus what fact watch still here 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.520
 son magnitollu now show different 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.590
 time from 1411 here 1412 we can do a little 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.960
 whether not in different time zones to exhibit 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.990
 different different times on these screens on 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.909
 the screen 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.390
 maintenance units 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.430
 alerts language alert here can 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.110
 be alert negative 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.979
 temperature outside that is with us 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.799
 starts blinking 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.159
 temperature sensor 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.290
 temperatures and let's say 1 there is 5-7 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.140
 seconds when we say it's cold outside 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.460
 that is, it is a warning what 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.100
 overall the panel is quite good 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.780
 done very high quality 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.450
 Liked by these chrome 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.790
 the end of the top is ordinary wooden 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.100
 plastic we on the sides are already our soft 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.959
 polyurethane then he comes here then 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.350
 eat all day action bends all 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.000
 soft door cards as it should be in 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.209
 the japanese are softer ahead 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.489
 they are a little bit behind 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.160
 ok what else would like to point this out . 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.820
 when leaving the car 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.170
 we don't call pants we have with us 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.790
 the door completely closes the lower threshold 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.880
 planned two planes principle 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.310
 there is nothing special here 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:55.489
 lumbar adjustment that 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:58.209
 surprising for such a machine and everything to everyone 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.209
 Thanks for attention
