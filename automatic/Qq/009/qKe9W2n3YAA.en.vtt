 hello youtube friends a long time ago 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.670
 I've uploaded a video so for this 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.480
 special occasion I will show you how 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.400
 download the is san andreas for your pc 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 well we open our browser and now 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.679
 we copy the description of the link that 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.679
 leave 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.820
 clarified that this link is not mine but that 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.820
 it does not matter while serving 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.600
 well now we will put in the button that 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.570
 says download and we will get a window 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.820
 that we must close now will take us to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.980
 this page where we will download 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 free but before I clarify that we should 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.200
 have an account in 4 shared to be able 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.000
 download the file we hope the 20 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.350
 seconds for the download but I the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.960
 canceled because I already have the file 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.030
 now we go to where we put the download 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.030
 that in my case I left it on the desk 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.030
 now we will create a new folder 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.770
 where will we put the ta san andreas for 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.770
 extract the game in the same folder 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.950
 well now we give double click high san 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.020
 andreas and then we click to extract 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.329
 good as you will see it will begin to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.789
 extract the game but this can be a 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.939
 not very slow so I will pause the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.009
 video as you can see it's almost done 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.840
 extract the game and we wait a bit 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.840
 letting other files come out 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.330
 well now we will try the game to 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.780
 make sure that serve our CTAs san 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.780
 andreas 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.410
 We wait a bit because my fucking pc 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.410
 it's a bit slow 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.640
 Amadita PC already puts the game 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.380
 good as we can see is us 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.909
 serving very well from the beginning 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.080
 but let's keep looking to see if we 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.080
 works well 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.540
 here we click on start game and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.540
 new game 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.750
 we skip this since we do not care 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.390
 Well, the game started, so now 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.310
 we check that if it works well 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.330
 I'm going for my bicycle and I'm going to give 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.330
 very short ride 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.590
 I do not know if it shows but it's the game 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.720
 slow but in another link I will leave you as 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.610
 accelerate it and well this was all 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.610
