00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.420 

so<00:00:07.450> I<00:00:07.480> was<00:00:07.600> when<00:00:07.750> I<00:00:07.780> read<00:00:08.020> the<00:00:08.290> book<00:00:08.470> Born<00:00:09.280> to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.430 
so I was when I read the book Born to

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.730 
so I was when I read the book Born to
Run<00:00:09.460> that<00:00:10.059> I<00:00:10.120> realized<00:00:10.510> that<00:00:10.570> there<00:00:10.780> was<00:00:10.900> you

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
Run that I realized that there was you

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.090 
Run that I realized that there was you
know<00:00:11.770> a<00:00:12.160> more<00:00:12.790> efficient<00:00:13.210> way<00:00:13.240> of<00:00:13.330> running<00:00:13.660> and

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
know a more efficient way of running and

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.980 
know a more efficient way of running and
it<00:00:15.100> didn't<00:00:15.459> explain<00:00:15.820> how<00:00:16.209> to<00:00:16.270> it<00:00:16.630> kind<00:00:16.810> of<00:00:16.870> gave

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
it didn't explain how to it kind of gave

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.590 
it didn't explain how to it kind of gave
a<00:00:17.050> few<00:00:17.260> little<00:00:17.380> tips<00:00:17.920> or<00:00:18.280> a<00:00:18.310> few<00:00:18.610> little<00:00:18.730> sneak

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
a few little tips or a few little sneak

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.810 
a few little tips or a few little sneak
peeks<00:00:19.930> about<00:00:20.289> about<00:00:20.890> what<00:00:21.130> it<00:00:21.220> could<00:00:21.250> be<00:00:21.490> and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
peeks about about what it could be and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.450 
peeks about about what it could be and
but<00:00:22.780> basically<00:00:22.990> it<00:00:23.590> took<00:00:23.860> you<00:00:24.100> know<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.310> next

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
but basically it took you know the next

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.350 
but basically it took you know the next
a<00:00:24.760> year<00:00:25.420> to<00:00:25.840> start<00:00:26.110> developing<00:00:27.030> you<00:00:28.030> know<00:00:28.120> and

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
a year to start developing you know and

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.970 
a year to start developing you know and
learning<00:00:28.780> just<00:00:29.170> through<00:00:29.410> trial<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:29.830> error

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
learning just through trial and error

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.980 
learning just through trial and error
chatting<00:00:30.790> along<00:00:31.030> on<00:00:31.150> my<00:00:31.240> long<00:00:31.450> runs<00:00:31.690> with<00:00:31.870> one

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
chatting along on my long runs with one

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.450 
chatting along on my long runs with one
of<00:00:32.079> my<00:00:32.140> good<00:00:32.290> mates<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:32.710> we<00:00:32.860> were<00:00:32.980> just<00:00:33.010> chat

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
of my good mates and we were just chat

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.029 
of my good mates and we were just chat
for<00:00:33.489> hours<00:00:33.790> about<00:00:34.090> running<00:00:34.540> and<00:00:34.950> that's<00:00:35.950> how

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
for hours about running and that's how

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.730 
for hours about running and that's how
we<00:00:36.190> developed<00:00:36.789> our<00:00:36.879> own<00:00:37.110> sense<00:00:38.110> of<00:00:38.320> what<00:00:38.530> of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
we developed our own sense of what of

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.890 
we developed our own sense of what of
what<00:00:38.770> good<00:00:39.190> technique<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.120> how<00:00:40.510> we<00:00:40.570> could

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
what good technique is and how we could

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.230 
what good technique is and how we could
improve<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.440> way<00:00:41.560> that<00:00:41.590> we<00:00:41.800> ran<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:43.030> key

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
improve the way that we ran the key

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.370 
improve the way that we ran the key
points<00:00:43.630> that<00:00:43.660> where<00:00:43.870> we<00:00:44.290> realized<00:00:45.100> with<00:00:45.400> it

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
points that where we realized with it

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.080 
points that where we realized with it
posture<00:00:47.380> is<00:00:47.560> most<00:00:48.040> important<00:00:48.610> you<00:00:48.820> know<00:00:48.940> if

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
posture is most important you know if

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.690 
posture is most important you know if
you<00:00:49.510> drop<00:00:49.930> your<00:00:50.079> hips<00:00:50.170> back<00:00:50.500> you<00:00:51.190> slow<00:00:51.460> down<00:00:51.640> a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
you drop your hips back you slow down a

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.880 
you drop your hips back you slow down a
lot<00:00:51.970> so<00:00:52.360> you've<00:00:52.510> got<00:00:52.540> to<00:00:52.720> stand<00:00:52.930> tall<00:00:53.260> run

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
lot so you've got to stand tall run

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.100 
lot so you've got to stand tall run
proud<00:00:54.220> with<00:00:54.520> your<00:00:54.640> chest<00:00:54.880> up<00:00:55.060> and<00:00:55.239> feel<00:00:55.899> as<00:00:56.079> if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
proud with your chest up and feel as if

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.720 
proud with your chest up and feel as if
you<00:00:56.350> are<00:00:56.380> very<00:00:56.739> light<00:00:57.040> on<00:00:57.220> your<00:00:57.340> feet<00:00:57.520> that

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
you are very light on your feet that

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.069 
you are very light on your feet that
something's<00:00:58.059> pulling<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.510> up<00:00:58.660> into<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:59.050> air

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
something's pulling you up into the air

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.740 
something's pulling you up into the air
so<00:00:59.829> postures<00:01:00.340> first<00:01:00.640> thing<00:01:00.940> next<00:01:01.480> most

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
so postures first thing next most

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.780 
so postures first thing next most
important<00:01:02.170> thing<00:01:02.320> was<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.610> where<00:01:03.610> you're

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
important thing was that where you're

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.850 
important thing was that where you're
landing<00:01:04.000> on<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.719> ground<00:01:04.989> where<00:01:05.379> your<00:01:05.530> foots

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
landing on the ground where your foots

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.560 
landing on the ground where your foots
impacting<00:01:06.640> what's<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.030> what's<00:01:07.210> happening

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
impacting what's that what's happening

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.899 
impacting what's that what's happening
and<00:01:07.770> basically<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.250> for<00:01:09.399> it<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.579> be<00:01:09.670> landing

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
and basically to it for it to be landing

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.020 
and basically to it for it to be landing
underneath<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:12.010> know<00:01:12.130> he'll<00:01:12.460> for<00:01:12.820> foot

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
underneath you you know he'll for foot

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.450 
underneath you you know he'll for foot
landing<00:01:13.390> at<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.570> same<00:01:13.780> time<00:01:14.080> but<00:01:14.890> with<00:01:15.250> more

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
landing at the same time but with more

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.670 
landing at the same time but with more
weight<00:01:15.729> in<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.030> forefoot<00:01:16.510> was<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.320> way<00:01:17.470> that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
weight in the forefoot was the way that

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.800 
weight in the forefoot was the way that
body<00:01:17.979> was<00:01:18.190> meant<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.610> mentor<00:01:19.150> work<00:01:19.299> or<00:01:19.600> does

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
body was meant to mentor work or does

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.760 
body was meant to mentor work or does
way<00:01:20.049> that<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.380> evolved<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.900> vastly<00:01:22.900> cadence

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
way that we evolved so vastly cadence

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.310 
way that we evolved so vastly cadence
was<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.010> most<00:01:24.190> important<00:01:24.729> thing<00:01:24.940> and<00:01:25.320> cadence

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
was the most important thing and cadence

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.830 
was the most important thing and cadence
was<00:01:26.500> defined<00:01:26.890> by<00:01:27.159> your<00:01:27.490> arm<00:01:27.850> carry<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.479> if

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
was defined by your arm carry and if

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.230 
was defined by your arm carry and if
your<00:01:28.960> arms<00:01:29.290> move<00:01:29.470> slowly<00:01:29.830> or<00:01:30.220> hung<00:01:30.729> low<00:01:30.970> and

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
your arms move slowly or hung low and

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.090 
your arms move slowly or hung low and
move<00:01:31.390> slow<00:01:31.659> you<00:01:32.290> know<00:01:32.409> your<00:01:32.590> cadence<00:01:32.860> was

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
move slow you know your cadence was

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.250 
move slow you know your cadence was
going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.340> be<00:01:33.430> slow<00:01:33.670> also<00:01:34.119> so<00:01:34.360> we<00:01:34.869> realize<00:01:35.229> that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
going to be slow also so we realize that

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.789 
going to be slow also so we realize that
cadence<00:01:35.799> was<00:01:36.040> driven<00:01:36.520> by<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.880> arms<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.799> just

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
cadence was driven by the arms and just

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.520 
cadence was driven by the arms and just
having<00:01:39.070> really<00:01:39.670> good<00:01:39.700> arm<00:01:40.000> carry<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.810> short

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
having really good arm carry and a short

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.770 
having really good arm carry and a short
little<00:01:41.760> chopping<00:01:42.760> motion<00:01:43.030> with<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.390> islands

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
little chopping motion with the islands

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.690 
little chopping motion with the islands
kept<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.080> cadence<00:01:44.439> up<00:01:44.590> high<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.040> if<00:01:45.580> you're

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
kept the cadence up high and if you're

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.280 
kept the cadence up high and if you're
just<00:01:45.850> running<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.360> sort<00:01:46.570> of<00:01:46.630> marathon<00:01:47.049> pace

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
just running it sort of marathon pace

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.320 
just running it sort of marathon pace
you<00:01:47.950> know<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.460> want<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:48.729> keep<00:01:48.880> them<00:01:49.030> really

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
you know you want to keep them really

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.450 
you know you want to keep them really
close<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.600> relaxed<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.470> keep<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.100> cadence

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
close and relaxed and keep the cadence

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.719 
close and relaxed and keep the cadence
up<00:01:51.610> high<00:01:52.170> specifics<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.350> got<00:01:53.530> me<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.920> work<00:01:54.549> on

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
up high specifics that got me to work on

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.160 
up high specifics that got me to work on
those<00:01:54.880> three<00:01:55.060> points<00:01:55.330> pretty<00:01:55.600> much<00:01:55.780> every

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
those three points pretty much every

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.620 
those three points pretty much every
single<00:01:56.350> stride<00:01:56.740> I'm<00:01:56.950> thinking<00:01:57.369> about<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
single stride I'm thinking about that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.810 
single stride I'm thinking about that
I'm<00:01:58.750> relaxing<00:01:59.409> those<00:01:59.590> muscles<00:02:00.130> that<00:02:00.430> don't

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
I'm relaxing those muscles that don't

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.090 
I'm relaxing those muscles that don't
need<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.090> be<00:02:01.330> tensed<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:02.650> can<00:02:02.890> feel

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
need to be tensed so I can feel

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.679 
need to be tensed so I can feel
everything<00:02:03.430> jiggling<00:02:03.939> I<00:02:04.000> can<00:02:04.150> feel<00:02:04.299> my<00:02:04.450> lats

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
everything jiggling I can feel my lats

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.260 
everything jiggling I can feel my lats
my<00:02:04.990> biceps<00:02:05.560> my<00:02:05.770> forearms<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.549> can<00:02:06.970> feel<00:02:07.150> the

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
muscles jiggling that don't need to be

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.069 
muscles jiggling that don't need to be
working<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.000> only<00:02:10.239> muscle<00:02:10.390> that's<00:02:10.659> working

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
working the only muscle that's working

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.500 
working the only muscle that's working
is<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.349> core<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.920> that's<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.909> that<00:02:13.239> was<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
is the core so that's the that was the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.620 
is the core so that's the that was the
main<00:02:13.780> thing<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.220> worked<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:16.000> relaxing

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
main thing that I worked on is relaxing

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.300 
main thing that I worked on is relaxing
everything<00:02:17.020> else<00:02:17.200> while<00:02:17.739> just<00:02:17.980> having<00:02:18.190> the

everything else while just having the
core<00:02:18.520> switched<00:02:18.819> on<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.330> way<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.630> foot<00:02:19.959> can

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
core switched on that way the foot can

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.520 
core switched on that way the foot can
land

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
land

all comes back to just having the core
switched<00:02:31.330> on<00:02:31.569> and<00:02:32.130> having<00:02:33.130> that<00:02:33.160> belly<00:02:33.459> button

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
switched on and having that belly button

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.460 
switched on and having that belly button
sucked<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.240> little<00:02:34.510> bit<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:35.140> helps

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
sucked in a little bit that helps

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.290 
sucked in a little bit that helps
everything<00:02:35.830> else<00:02:36.220> kind<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.520> find<00:02:36.700> its<00:02:36.880> place<00:02:37.030> a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
everything else kind of find its place a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.630 
everything else kind of find its place a
lot<00:02:37.540> easier<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.890> then<00:02:39.069> just<00:02:39.250> thinking

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
lot easier so and then just thinking

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.479 
lot easier so and then just thinking
about<00:02:39.930> kind<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:41.020> systems<00:02:41.650> check<00:02:41.920> constantly

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
about kind of systems check constantly

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.550 
about kind of systems check constantly
while<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:42.910> ran<00:02:43.270> every<00:02:43.750> single<00:02:44.020> stride<00:02:44.319> I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
while I ran every single stride I

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.550 
while I ran every single stride I
thought<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.819> do<00:02:45.880> think<00:02:46.270> about<00:02:46.600> what's

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
thought and I do think about what's

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.620 
thought and I do think about what's
happening<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.130> I'd<00:02:48.370> go<00:02:48.610> from<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.000> feet<00:02:49.209> up<00:02:49.239> to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
happening and I'd go from the feet up to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.479 
happening and I'd go from the feet up to
my<00:02:49.750> top<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.110> my<00:02:50.170> head<00:02:50.380> nearly<00:02:51.069> every<00:02:51.340> single

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
my top of my head nearly every single

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.699 
my top of my head nearly every single
stride<00:02:51.940> where<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.810> improve<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.470> what's

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
stride where I can improve and what's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.190 
stride where I can improve and what's
getting<00:02:53.980> tired<00:02:54.280> what<00:02:55.030> do<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.239> need<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.480> work

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
getting tired what do I need to work

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.440 
getting tired what do I need to work
more<00:02:56.230> on<00:02:56.560> as<00:02:57.040> another<00:02:57.670> map<00:02:57.940> other<00:02:58.150> than<00:02:58.239> as
