00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.969
 yes I think it was the expected hard 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.200
 work so we knew that the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.000
 mine can play his good football 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.830
 So just front should with the two 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.940
 strikers can be very dangerous 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.320
 that they stand low and on the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.949
 situation wait with long balls 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.420
 in the beginning and it was always quite good 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.150
 dangerous we did it well though 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070
 we are lucky to be in the lead 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.349
 they had to go a bit 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.270
 but we do not have it like that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.190
 completely done always to the last 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.969
 third but then with the 200 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.320
 at the time thank you I done think 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.420
 she has us general until the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.100
 security given 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.360
 only one hit has projection then is 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.250
 Of course, always a bit 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.020
 tremble to the closing today but 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.280
 Doubt must be made early on 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.100
 do the 3 0 then that's the thing 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 completely failed chance on the net too 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.719
 let was already the third of this year 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.730
 a lot for me a nonsense but we 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.559
 practice this in training and thank god 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.100
 first in the situation in the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.200
 position two spent and bloody and 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.780
 Do not talk anymore , and off and me 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.740
 I felt good and then all the more 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.939
 Of course I am happier that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.780
 thing went in and not so 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.369
 could help the team 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.990
 for me it was clear that for me the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.360
 The beginning is not easy after almost 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.619
 three years injury break and from 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.030
 that's why I think that's somewhere 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.610
 normal thing that I gradually 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.409
 will increase and now the last 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.549
 three games start each to zero 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.970
 played and won 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.900
 then I would have to build on it 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.880
 Of course it is with the 2 0 one 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.049
 little 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.560
 It's going to be a little quieter 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.759
 safety the whole but of course must 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.170
 you can still do that 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.700
 had to keep playing football 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.950
 hold against it because the mainzer always in 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.329
 able to score a goal we are 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.240
 of course glad that the bad times 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.429
 could follow play at all null and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.560
 something good to do with ours 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.560
 distance worst home game shown 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.700
 In the round of the hall was good now 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.069
 not so home strong 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.670
 yet they have individually I think 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.110
 a very high class and we have to 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.520
 drive and full from the first minute 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.810
 concentrate and then I think 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.789
 we have the chance to take something with you 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.679
 until the winter break as possible pick 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.679
 no matter how the points come about 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.060
 Yes
