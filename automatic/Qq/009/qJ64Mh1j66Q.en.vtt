seconds<00:01:01.740> pretty<00:01:01.950> low<00:01:02.130> because<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.610> we<00:01:02.730> load

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
seconds pretty low because if we load

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.109 
seconds pretty low because if we load
slow<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.660> damage<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.170> huge<00:01:04.549> great<00:01:05.549> damage<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
slow the damage is huge great damage I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.230 
slow the damage is huge great damage I
like<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> again<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.649> as<00:01:07.859> good<00:01:08.159> as<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.670> gallops

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
like it again not as good as a gallops

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240 
like it again not as good as a gallops
rifle<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.079> it<00:01:10.200> has<00:01:10.350> some<00:01:10.649> things<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.219> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
rifle but it has some things here that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.209 
rifle but it has some things here that
are<00:01:11.700> nice<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> ammunition<00:01:13.109> that<00:01:13.979> give

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
are nice with the ammunition that give

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.889 
are nice with the ammunition that give
it<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.429> little<00:01:14.579> bit<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.850> an<00:01:14.939> extra<00:01:15.179> edge<00:01:15.359> what<00:01:15.869> I

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
it a little bit of an extra edge what I

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.959 
it a little bit of an extra edge what I
mean<00:01:16.200> by<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.950> use<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.219> AP<00:01:17.729> rounds

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
mean by that if you use the AP rounds

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.690 
mean by that if you use the AP rounds
here<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> minus<00:01:19.499> 15<00:01:20.039> for<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.310> damage

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
here you get a minus 15 for the damage

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.690 
here you get a minus 15 for the damage
of<00:01:21.499> threshold<00:01:22.499> for<00:01:22.710> their<00:01:22.829> enemy<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> can

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
of threshold for their enemy so you can

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760

to tell you more about this pretty cool

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.610 
to tell you more about this pretty cool
lon<00:03:06.580> I<00:03:06.790> like<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:07.720> really<00:03:07.930> cool<00:03:08.230> you've

lon I like it it's really cool you've
got<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.920> pretty<00:03:09.310> easy<00:03:09.730> access<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.650> some<00:03:11.650> ammo

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
got a pretty easy access to some ammo

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.880 
got a pretty easy access to some ammo
out<00:03:12.160> there<00:03:12.400> now<00:03:12.580> as<00:03:12.790> i<00:03:13.480> showed<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.319> clip<00:03:14.620> I

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
out there now as i showed in the clip I

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.390 
out there now as i showed in the clip I
think<00:03:15.549> it's<00:03:15.730> best<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.209> use<00:03:16.269> this<00:03:16.690> with<00:03:17.019> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
think it's best to use this with the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.130 
think it's best to use this with the
additional<00:03:18.400> special<00:03:19.120> ammo<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.870> can<00:03:20.019> go

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
additional special ammo that you can go

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.080 
additional special ammo that you can go
so<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> either<00:03:20.890> go<00:03:21.190> for<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.489> armor-piercing

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
so I either go for the armor-piercing

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.750 
so I either go for the armor-piercing
rounds<00:03:22.720> which<00:03:23.140> basically<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:24.129> know<00:03:24.280> blows

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
rounds which basically you know blows

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.420 
rounds which basically you know blows
through<00:03:25.120> most<00:03:25.360> armor<00:03:25.870> which<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.590> little<00:03:27.280> bit

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
through most armor which is a little bit

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.420 
through most armor which is a little bit
off<00:03:27.549> on<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.849> damage<00:03:28.200> negligible<00:03:29.200> or<00:03:29.430> even

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
off on the damage negligible or even

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.699 
off on the damage negligible or even
better<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.940> incendiary<00:03:31.510> rounds<00:03:32.170> which<00:03:32.319> gives

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
better the incendiary rounds which gives

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.500 
better the incendiary rounds which gives
you<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.950> fire<00:03:33.160> damage<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:33.970> kind<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.209> blows

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
you the fire damage to and kind of blows

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.259
