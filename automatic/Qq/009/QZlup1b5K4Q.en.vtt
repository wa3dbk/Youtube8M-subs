00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
apparent when you look at the mix this

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.799 
apparent when you look at the mix this
has<00:00:36.140> actually<00:00:36.260> got<00:00:36.560> a<00:00:36.590> high<00:00:37.120> very<00:00:38.120> high<00:00:38.390> level

of food particles inside it as you can

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.049 
of food particles inside it as you can
see<00:00:42.469> it's<00:00:42.770> not<00:00:42.920> just<00:00:42.980> an<00:00:43.370> attractor<00:00:43.879> there's

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
to stay in your swim rather than just a

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.490 
to stay in your swim rather than just a
big<00:00:58.399> cloud<00:00:59.180> of<00:00:59.480> Attraction<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.170> no<00:01:00.289> actual

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
look at the fish mix for example I mean

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.630 
look at the fish mix for example I mean
straightaway<00:01:30.619> as<00:01:30.710> soon<00:01:30.920> as<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:31.100> open<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.460> lid
