00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.070
 Hello everyone, today I want with you 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.280
 share experiences in the automotive 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.689
 subject matter a few months ago to my 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.250
 car was installed 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.510
 gas equipment second 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 generation after that there was a setting 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:38.649
 my system will have to cut was 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.070
 a setting that did not lead to 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:46.329
 the final result I have in motion 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.719
 the car started to stall did not hold 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.890
 idle 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.920
 candles of which much time was spent 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.989
 I was prompted by what was needed 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.980
 and deploy the air duct before 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:07.299
 That was directed by the movement of the car 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.720
 that is, the oncoming air flow was blowing 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.940
 like a filter 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.340
 after that i turned this air a 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.350
 But in the side so that it was not 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.090
 incident flow and after that i have 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.200
 stabilized gas consumption machine 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.740
 began to behave perfectly on the track in 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.020
 the city has to keep idle during 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.689
 time of movement let's you 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.720
 demonstrated what i mean here 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:41.810
 we started the car on gas 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.270
 forgot to mention at the very beginning that this 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.250
 the effect is very good when 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.750
 car warmed up to work 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:55.070
 temperature when the car is cold 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.940
 due to the fact that the valve is open 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.130
 gas overrun 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.410
 accordingly not so much this effect 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.360
 manifested but on the road on the highway when 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:11.370
 speed 5040 car still glohla 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.230
 here is the air here 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.230
 we take just mouth blown 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.640
 car stalls now we have a car 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:30.730
 runs on gasoline that's the same 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.420
 air here is something and what not let the momentum 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.600
 even 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.550
 don't even sit down on it all 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.280
 I hope this video was useful for you. 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.280
 thank you all yes meeting bye bye
