00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
late decreasing radius turn and I want

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.960 
late decreasing radius turn and I want
to<00:01:52.950> make<00:01:53.040> sure<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> come<00:01:53.369> all<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> way<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to make sure you come all the way out to

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
to make sure you come all the way out to

the outside through there turn ten and
eleven<00:01:56.220> are<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.670> bit<00:01:56.910> dangerous<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.510> because

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
eleven are a bit dangerous just because

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.870 
eleven are a bit dangerous just because
there's<00:01:57.960> that

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
there's that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.490 
there's that
I'm<00:01:59.329> sorry<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.689> entire<00:01:59.930> wall<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.380> the

that so make sure that you see between

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.429 
that so make sure that you see between
the<00:02:04.820> two<00:02:05.030> sets<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.479> tires<00:02:05.719> before<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.259> make

the two sets of tires before you make
the<00:02:06.560> right<00:02:06.799> it's<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.310> easiest<00:02:07.670> way<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:07.939> do<00:02:08.149> it

right-hand side here this left-hand turn

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.850

you<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.630> kind<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.900> aim<00:02:24.050> at<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.410> cone<00:02:24.650> that's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
you can kind of aim at that cone that's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.580 
you can kind of aim at that cone that's
fallen<00:02:25.220> over<00:02:25.430> on<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.670> right<00:02:25.849> there<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.590> then

fallen over on the right there and then

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.870 
fallen over on the right there and then
these<00:02:27.769> last<00:02:28.040> two<00:02:28.220> turns<00:02:28.459> are<00:02:28.670> about

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
these last two turns are about

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.640 
these last two turns are about
two-thirds<00:02:29.330> throttle<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:29.989> nice<00:02:30.170> easy

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
two-thirds throttle and nice easy

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.530 
two-thirds throttle and nice easy
left-hand<00:02:31.310> turn<00:02:31.549> coming<00:02:32.030> out<00:02:32.150> over<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.450> front

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
left-hand turn coming out over the front

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.180 
left-hand turn coming out over the front
straight

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.160 

when<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.760> reach<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.090> front<00:02:36.210> straight<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.870> as

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
when you reach the front straight it as

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.350 
when you reach the front straight it as
you<00:02:37.380> notice<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.310> about<00:02:38.550> five<00:02:38.820> lanes<00:02:39.060> wide

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
you notice is in about five lanes wide

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.940 
you notice is in about five lanes wide
so<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.720> kind<00:02:39.960> of<00:02:40.050> be<00:02:40.140> where<00:02:40.290> everyone<00:02:40.710> here

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
so you kind of be where everyone here

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.160 
so you kind of be where everyone here
traditionally<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:42.210> isn't<00:02:42.540> really<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.720> NASCAR

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
traditionally this isn't really a NASCAR

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.660 
traditionally this isn't really a NASCAR
race<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.590> don't<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.340> all<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.640> way

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
race so you don't have to be all the way

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.380 
race so you don't have to be all the way
on<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> outside

turn two depending on what car you in or

turn two depending on what car you in or
you're<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.670> may<00:02:53.850> want<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.120> let<00:02:54.240> off<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> bit

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
you're in you may want to let off a bit

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.240 
you're in you may want to let off a bit
some<00:02:55.020> cars<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.410> go<00:02:55.500> run<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.830> full<00:02:56.010> throttle

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
some cars can go run in full throttle

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.430 
some cars can go run in full throttle
for<00:02:56.460> students<00:02:56.970> I'd<00:02:57.090> recommend<00:02:57.570> dropping<00:02:58.110> down

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
for students I'd recommend dropping down

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.990 
for students I'd recommend dropping down
to<00:02:58.560> about<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.740> half<00:02:58.920> throttle<00:02:59.280> staying<00:02:59.790> about<00:02:59.940> a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
to about a half throttle staying about a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.180 
to about a half throttle staying about a
hundred<00:03:00.270> miles<00:03:00.450> an<00:03:00.660> hour<00:03:00.750> sort<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.770> turn<00:03:01.920> to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
hundred miles an hour sort of turn to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.240 
hundred miles an hour sort of turn to
here<00:03:03.230> really<00:03:04.230> no<00:03:04.410> reason<00:03:04.710> as<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> student<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> be

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
here really no reason as a student to be

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.180 
here really no reason as a student to be
going<00:03:05.490> too<00:03:05.610> much<00:03:05.700> faster<00:03:06.120> than<00:03:06.270> that<00:03:07.190> coming

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
going too much faster than that coming

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
up to turn three again just make sure

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.060 
up to turn three again just make sure

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
one cone if they do it's usually set up

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.220 
one cone if they do it's usually set up
to<00:03:14.910> make<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> left-hand<00:03:15.390> turn<00:03:15.570> up<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.870> one<00:03:16.050> but

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
to make a left-hand turn up to one but

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.110 
to make a left-hand turn up to one but
remember<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.590> cones<00:03:16.980> are<00:03:17.550> not<00:03:17.790> stable

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
remember that cones are not stable

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.360 
remember that cones are not stable
throughout<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.560> race<00:03:19.740> course<00:03:19.980> sometimes

throughout the race course sometimes

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.530 
throughout the race course sometimes
they'll<00:03:20.520> get<00:03:20.610> knocked<00:03:20.760> over<00:03:20.970> sometimes

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
they'll get knocked over sometimes

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.540 
they'll get knocked over sometimes
people<00:03:21.840> will<00:03:21.960> take<00:03:22.140> them<00:03:22.290> off<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.800> it's<00:03:23.370> much

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
people will take them off so it's much

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.600 
people will take them off so it's much
better<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.850> use<00:03:24.410> scrapes<00:03:25.410> all<00:03:25.890> anything<00:03:26.430> else

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
better to use scrapes all anything else

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.980 
better to use scrapes all anything else
that<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.820> can<00:03:26.850> use<00:03:27.120> beside<00:03:27.510> something<00:03:27.870> that

that you can use beside something that

for<00:04:39.600> a<00:04:39.630> good<00:04:39.750> top<00:04:40.020> speed<00:04:40.380> here<00:04:40.710> we<00:04:41.160> really<00:04:41.400> want

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
for a good top speed here we really want

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.740 
for a good top speed here we really want
to<00:04:41.580> make<00:04:41.730> sure<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:42.030> go<00:04:42.120> through<00:04:42.150> those<00:04:42.510> two

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
to make sure to go through those two

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.680 
to make sure to go through those two
turns<00:04:43.050> as<00:04:43.410> fast<00:04:43.620> as<00:04:43.800> we<00:04:43.890> can<00:04:44.240> especially<00:04:45.240> in

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
turns as fast as we can especially in

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.080 
turns as fast as we can especially in
the<00:04:46.530> higher<00:04:46.800> race<00:04:47.070> groups<00:04:47.370> because<00:04:47.760> if<00:04:47.970> you

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
the higher race groups because if you

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.670 
the higher race groups because if you
can<00:04:48.240> get<00:04:48.390> 10<00:04:48.660> miles<00:04:48.870> an<00:04:49.020> hour<00:04:49.140> faster<00:04:49.440> than

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
can get 10 miles an hour faster than

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.360 
can get 10 miles an hour faster than
someone<00:04:50.130> else<00:04:50.310> around<00:04:50.640> those<00:04:50.790> two

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
someone else around those two

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.460 
someone else around those two
you<00:04:51.910> are<00:04:52.060> 10<00:04:52.270> miles<00:04:52.449> an<00:04:52.630> hour<00:04:52.720> faster<00:04:53.020> than<00:04:53.260> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
you are 10 miles an hour faster than the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.110 
you are 10 miles an hour faster than the
other<00:04:53.590> cars<00:04:53.680> all<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.610> way<00:04:54.730> around<00:04:55.000> that

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
other cars all the way around that

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.490 
other cars all the way around that
straightaway<00:04:55.600> that's<00:04:55.870> why<00:04:55.990> those<00:04:56.169> two<00:04:56.199> points

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
straightaway that's why those two points

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.090 
straightaway that's why those two points
are<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:56.949> important<00:04:57.400> so<00:04:58.680> again<00:04:59.680> coming<00:04:59.889> into

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
are so important so again coming into

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.280 
are so important so again coming into
this<00:05:00.280> turn<00:05:00.490> you'll<00:05:00.699> stay<00:05:00.880> on<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.030> outside<00:05:01.290> you

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
this turn you'll stay on the outside you

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.550 
this turn you'll stay on the outside you
can<00:05:02.470> basically<00:05:03.000> make<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.180> around<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:05.380> outside

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
can basically make it around the outside

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.350 
can basically make it around the outside
with<00:05:05.889> the<00:05:05.919> inside<00:05:06.280> of<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:06.550> for<00:05:07.270> good

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
with the inside of this for good

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.879 
with the inside of this for good
practice<00:05:07.540> I<00:05:07.870> would<00:05:07.990> come<00:05:08.139> down<00:05:08.169> to<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.560> inside

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
practice I would come down to the inside

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.060 
practice I would come down to the inside
here<00:05:09.190> and<00:05:10.080> generally<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.229> wait<00:05:11.590> until<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:11.919> can

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
here and generally I wait until I can

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.040 
here and generally I wait until I can
see<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.310> Chevy<00:05:12.639> sign<00:05:12.880> which<00:05:13.750> is<00:05:13.780> when<00:05:14.020> I

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
see that Chevy sign which is when I

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.939 
see that Chevy sign which is when I
start<00:05:14.410> breaking<00:05:14.560> out<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:15.010> the<00:05:15.070> right<00:05:15.250> again

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
start breaking out to the right again

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.379 
start breaking out to the right again
again<00:05:17.949> for<00:05:18.130> this<00:05:18.250> last<00:05:18.460> lap<00:05:18.699> we<00:05:18.910> will<00:05:19.060> stay<00:05:19.240> all

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
through the turn and then start turning

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.040 
through the turn and then start turning
you<00:05:39.760> will<00:05:39.970> turn<00:05:40.210> where<00:05:40.510> you're<00:05:40.630> going<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.930> be

all<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:43.840> way<00:05:44.289> out<00:05:44.440> I<00:05:44.680> noticed<00:05:45.010> a<00:05:45.220> lot<00:05:45.430> of

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
all the way out I noticed a lot of

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.890 
all the way out I noticed a lot of
students<00:05:45.910> would<00:05:46.000> not<00:05:46.270> bring<00:05:46.479> it<00:05:46.600> all<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.780> way

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
students would not bring it all the way

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.050 
students would not bring it all the way
out<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.410> outside<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.950> that<00:05:48.070> turn<00:05:48.340> there's

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
out to the outside of that turn there's

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.120 
out to the outside of that turn there's
even<00:05:49.360> concrete<00:05:49.720> well<00:05:50.080> past<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.620> so<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:50.889> can

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
even concrete well past that so you can

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.950 
even concrete well past that so you can
go<00:05:51.220> past<00:05:51.400> if<00:05:51.610> you<00:05:51.729> need<00:05:51.880> to<00:05:52.000> but<00:05:52.180> definitely

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
go past if you need to but definitely

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.969 
go past if you need to but definitely
even<00:05:53.080> if<00:05:53.169> you're<00:05:53.289> not<00:05:53.410> going<00:05:53.590> fast<00:05:53.770> enough

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
even if you're not going fast enough

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.980 
even if you're not going fast enough
drive<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.729> car<00:05:54.910> out<00:05:55.150> there<00:05:55.389> because<00:05:55.630> when

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
drive the car out there because when

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.640 
drive the car out there because when
you're<00:05:56.110> going<00:05:56.229> faster<00:05:56.770> no<00:05:56.979> pollution

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
you're going faster no pollution

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.749 
you're going faster no pollution
there<00:05:58.750> turn<00:05:59.750> nine<00:06:00.020> again<00:06:00.430> this<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.610> where

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
there turn nine again this is where

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:02.950 
there turn nine again this is where
you're<00:06:01.880> breaking<00:06:02.210> a<00:06:02.270> little<00:06:02.479> bit<00:06:02.690> through<00:06:02.870> the

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
you're breaking a little bit through the

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.080 
you're breaking a little bit through the
turn<00:06:03.169> pass<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.949> one<00:06:04.130> cone<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:04.669> then<00:06:04.759> bring<00:06:04.970> it

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
turn pass the one cone and then bring it

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.400 
turn pass the one cone and then bring it
all<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.210> way<00:06:05.330> in<00:06:05.509> to<00:06:05.600> the<00:06:05.630> inside

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
all the way in to the inside

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.110 
all the way in to the inside
bring<00:06:06.830> it<00:06:06.919> all<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.130> way<00:06:07.520> out<00:06:07.610> to<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:08.000> outside

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
bring it all the way out to the outside

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.340 
bring it all the way out to the outside
you're<00:06:08.479> going<00:06:08.570> to<00:06:08.660> want<00:06:08.840> to<00:06:08.930> hit<00:06:09.050> that<00:06:09.080> outside

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
you're going to want to hit that outside

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.110 
you're going to want to hit that outside
but<00:06:09.770> I'm<00:06:09.889> at<00:06:09.979> about<00:06:10.070> the<00:06:10.250> last<00:06:10.460> third<00:06:10.820> that's

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
but I'm at about the last third that's

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.390 
but I'm at about the last third that's
what<00:06:11.270> you<00:06:11.360> don't<00:06:11.509> have<00:06:11.600> done<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.840> turn<00:06:11.990> right

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
what you don't have done the turn right

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.830 
what you don't have done the turn right
turning<00:06:13.790> through<00:06:14.000> these<00:06:14.180> two<00:06:14.360> tyre<00:06:14.570> walls

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
turning through these two tyre walls

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.750 
turning through these two tyre walls
here<00:06:15.139> a<00:06:15.320> lot<00:06:15.560> of<00:06:15.710> people<00:06:15.949> wanted<00:06:16.250> to<00:06:16.340> force<00:06:16.580> the

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
here a lot of people wanted to force the

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.189

car immediately back over onto the left
hand<00:06:18.530> side<00:06:18.770> there's<00:06:19.010> really<00:06:19.160> no<00:06:19.400> reason<00:06:19.610> to<00:06:19.820> do

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
hand side there's really no reason to do

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.340 
hand side there's really no reason to do
that<00:06:20.000> you<00:06:20.270> can<00:06:20.419> bring<00:06:20.540> it<00:06:20.690> all<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:20.840> way<00:06:21.169> wide

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
that you can bring it all the way wide

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.620 
that you can bring it all the way wide
through<00:06:21.710> there<00:06:21.889> just<00:06:22.760> eventually<00:06:23.270> make<00:06:23.449> sure

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
through these two turns here at about

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.730 
through these two turns here at about
half<00:06:41.030> throttle<00:06:41.300> it's<00:06:41.600> a<00:06:41.660> big<00:06:41.840> nice<00:06:42.080> sweeping

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740
