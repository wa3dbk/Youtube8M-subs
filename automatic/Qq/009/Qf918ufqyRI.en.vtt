five million eight and five meters five
meters<00:01:53.520> away<00:01:54.320> then<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.560> flip<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
faster and this is little handy like on

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
faster and this is little handy like on
sports<00:02:00.329> such<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.540> football<00:02:00.740> where<00:02:01.740> they're

never really getting you know back to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.270 
never really getting you know back to
your<00:02:05.579> 105<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.840> 70<00:02:07.259> range<00:02:08.929> your<00:02:09.929> VR<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.739> know

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
your 105 to 70 range your VR you know

off and on

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.010 
off and on
and<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.820> turns<00:02:13.030> vibration<00:02:13.600> reduction<00:02:13.720> on

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
and that turns vibration reduction on

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.820 
and that turns vibration reduction on
