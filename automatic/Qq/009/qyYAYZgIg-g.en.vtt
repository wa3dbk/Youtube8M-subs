Oh<00:01:22.049> 12<00:01:23.049> years<00:01:23.439> I<00:01:23.710> guess<00:01:23.979> that's<00:01:24.310> all<00:01:24.490> this<00:01:24.789> has

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
Oh 12 years I guess that's all this has

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.859 
Oh 12 years I guess that's all this has
really<00:01:25.240> come<00:01:25.569> to<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.869> head<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:28.630> going

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
really come to a head we're going

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
thinning that we did last summer it they

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.139 
thinning that we did last summer it they
went<00:01:34.420> through<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:34.959> thin<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.119> stand<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.329> trees

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
went through and thin the stand of trees

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.060 
went through and thin the stand of trees
took<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.930> some<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.350> them<00:01:40.619> they'll<00:01:40.799> grow

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
took out some of them they'll grow

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.730 
took out some of them they'll grow
better<00:01:41.399> this<00:01:41.729> way

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.219 

when<00:01:48.070> we<00:01:48.219> go<00:01:48.399> up<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.909> landing<00:01:49.329> all<00:01:49.899> the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
when we go up to the landing all the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.480 
when we go up to the landing all the
time<00:01:50.469> at<00:01:51.159> least

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
time at least

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.279 
time at least
majority<00:01:52.210> of<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.360> time<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.780> trailer<00:01:53.229> is

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
majority of the time the trailer is

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.920 
majority of the time the trailer is
depth<00:01:53.680> on<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.759> trucks<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.420> can<00:01:55.630> maneuver

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
depth on the the trucks you can maneuver

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.660 
depth on the the trucks you can maneuver
around<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.530> lot<00:01:56.680> better<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.159> gives<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.490> better

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
around a lot better it gives you better

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:09.449 
around a lot better it gives you better
traction<00:02:07.679> then<00:02:08.679> when<00:02:08.860> you<00:02:08.950> get<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
traction then when you get to the

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.790 
traction then when you get to the
landing<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:10.030> loader<00:02:10.330> comes<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.590> there's<00:02:11.739> a

landing the loader comes and there's a

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.120 
landing the loader comes and there's a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.089 
strap here that eat grab and lift it off
and<00:02:15.489> then<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.730> hook<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.090> trailer<00:02:16.239> back<00:02:16.630> up

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099

what<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:02.940> needed<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.360> that's<00:03:03.450> also<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:04.650> give

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
what is needed and that's also we give

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.800 
what is needed and that's also we give
them<00:03:04.920> weight<00:03:05.160> readings<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.849> way<00:03:06.090> too

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
them weight readings that way too

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.020

you can adjust logs forward and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.470 
you can adjust logs forward and
backwards<00:03:09.569> to<00:03:09.989> accommodate<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:11.480> it's

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
backwards to accommodate that it's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.870 
important to keep it weighed the weight
distributed<00:03:15.900> right<00:03:16.140> because<00:03:16.650> they<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:17.580> have

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
distributed right because they do have
