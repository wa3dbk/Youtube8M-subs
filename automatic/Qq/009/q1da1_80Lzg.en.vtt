00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
for just a couple years ago because I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.110 
for just a couple years ago because I
read<00:01:47.200> in<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.410> magazine<00:01:47.560> how<00:01:48.490> this<00:01:48.760> woman<00:01:49.030> who

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
read in a magazine how this woman who

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.340 
read in a magazine how this woman who
was<00:01:49.240> 42<00:01:49.720> years<00:01:49.930> old

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
was 42 years old

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.140 
was 42 years old
I'm<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.710> Caucasian<00:01:51.250> woman<00:01:51.280> she<00:01:51.730> was<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.850> swimmer

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
I'm a Caucasian woman she was a swimmer

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.850 
I'm a Caucasian woman she was a swimmer
and<00:01:52.510> her<00:01:52.750> skin<00:01:53.050> looked<00:01:53.260> absolutely<00:01:53.440> beautiful

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
and her skin looked absolutely beautiful

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.280 
and her skin looked absolutely beautiful
and<00:01:54.400> I<00:01:54.550> think<00:01:54.730> that<00:01:54.850> we<00:01:54.940> all<00:01:55.060> know<00:01:55.270> about<00:01:55.390> how

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
and I think that we all know about how

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.140 
and I think that we all know about how
harsh<00:01:56.680> swimming<00:01:57.100> can<00:01:57.220> be<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.430> our<00:01:57.520> skin<00:01:57.790> but

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
harsh swimming can be on our skin but

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.760 
harsh swimming can be on our skin but
she<00:01:58.300> said<00:01:58.450> issues<00:01:58.750> aquaphor<00:01:59.200> every<00:01:59.470> night<00:01:59.620> and

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
she said issues aquaphor every night and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.110 
she said issues aquaphor every night and

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.559 
know that some estheticians probably
wouldn't<00:03:25.310> agree<00:03:25.430> with<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:25.849> I'm<00:03:26.299> not<00:03:26.540> a

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
wouldn't agree with this I'm not a

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.030 
wouldn't agree with this I'm not a
cetacean<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:27.440> like<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.620> do<00:03:27.739> what<00:03:27.860> works

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
cetacean I just like to do what works

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
cetacean I just like to do what works
for<00:03:28.160> me<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.579> something<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:28.849> I've<00:03:29.030> learned

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
for me it's something that I've learned

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.940 
for me it's something that I've learned
when<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.480> was<00:03:29.569> a<00:03:29.660> little<00:03:29.720> girl<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.260> believe<00:03:30.799> in

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
when I was a little girl I believe in

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.650 
when I was a little girl I believe in
traditional<00:03:31.459> remedies<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:31.970> concoctions<00:03:32.569> and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
traditional remedies and concoctions and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.050 
traditional remedies and concoctions and
it<00:03:33.049> works<00:03:33.260> for<00:03:33.410> me<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:33.829> one<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.670> things<00:03:34.910> I

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
it works for me so one of the things I

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.410 
it works for me so one of the things I
will<00:03:35.269> say<00:03:35.299> is<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:36.849> for<00:03:37.849> some<00:03:38.000> people<00:03:38.329> if

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
will say is that it for some people if

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.120 
will say is that it for some people if
you<00:03:38.540> exfoliate<00:03:38.750> often<00:03:39.380> if<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:39.650> do<00:03:39.829> this<00:03:39.950> very

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
you exfoliate often if you do this very

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.009 
you exfoliate often if you do this very
often<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.760> can<00:03:40.970> have<00:03:41.299> an<00:03:41.480> adverse<00:03:41.630> reaction

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
often and can have an adverse reaction

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.710 
often and can have an adverse reaction
so<00:03:42.890> if<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:43.430> have<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.730> do<00:03:43.849> it<00:03:44.000> at<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.329> most<00:03:44.540> I

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
so if you have to do it at the most I

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.289 
so if you have to do it at the most I
would<00:03:44.870> recommend<00:03:45.290> maybe<00:03:45.380> once<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.799> week<00:03:46.299> so

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
would recommend maybe once a week so

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.229 
would recommend maybe once a week so
here<00:03:47.450> we<00:03:47.540> go<00:03:51.430> okay<00:03:52.430> so<00:03:52.489> remember<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:53.000> you

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
here we go okay so remember that you

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.120 
here we go okay so remember that you
just<00:03:53.389> want<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.630> if<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.170> do<00:03:54.380> for<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.680> minute<00:03:54.950> just

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
just want to if you do for a minute just

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.740 
just want to if you do for a minute just
about<00:03:55.280> 30-second<00:03:55.940> increments<00:03:56.120> if<00:03:56.450> it's<00:03:56.600> too

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
about 30-second increments if it's too

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.390 
about 30-second increments if it's too
hot<00:03:56.959> don't<00:03:57.319> burn<00:03:57.530> yourself<00:03:57.920> take<00:03:58.069> yourself
