00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 they say to get what they never 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.370
 have you gotten you should try what you 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.380
 you have never tried how to make a truck 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.380
 of tnt in just 3 seconds 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.740
 one 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:33.629
 with about 270 boys and less to a new 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.750
 video and good you have that is beautiful 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.489
 I have an exceptional look welcome to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 a new video today you will find me with a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.840
 animal said let's make a challenge 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.220
 historical we are going to do something that is not 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.140
 can we do let's make a cannon 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.390
 decent in three seconds said in three 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.250
 impossible seconds he told me I have not 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.470
 done let's try it and this is what 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.510
 has happened if you like a law that rules 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.640
 a big hug helps me a lot, we are already 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.159
 five thousand I hope you like it as much as 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.409
 I liked to record it and we see what 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.839
 is what has happened I leave with the video the 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.690
 first step to get something is to give it 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.380
 hard work and perseverance whatever 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.380
 what happens 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 below him but watch out no bastard 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.750
 the pruning 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.740
 no time is coming 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.740
 since 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.310
 no no 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.310
 again a guy 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.149
 and three we go I say the water is good table 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.979
 but can not be 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.260
 no runs runs runs runs 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:07.820
 and if it does not work you can always try 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.470
 new techniques and some may be that 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.470
 give you a better result 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.520
 today we're going backwards studies 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.480
 so it was not 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.680
 it has not happened 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.379
 now yes do not go down by hand 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.379
 of people things well 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.390
 he is dead already 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.220
 the fined the dead list we're 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.340
 doing is the dead but I do not I do not 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.550
 I do not I'm not going to do the same thing is the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.550
 same faces and then 3 2 1 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.890
 or if 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.830
 repetition of the same face yes I think 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:23.450
 water 23 20 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.450
 I do not know , I was given 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.220
 yes 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.040
 let's move on 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.040
 there is no calculation 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.890
 but this is not here can be done 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.320
 the canyon without water saying that 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.660
 washington is having and paying for a scrubber or 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.400
 not what you're going to believe the bitch lava I'll 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.680
 you can stop that the sand of that 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:00.650
 do not 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.650
 if it is the soul sand I never 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.200
 Yes yes yes yes yes yes 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.940
 when you want to put it under pressure 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.940
 the plate when you want 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:39.120
 is ready when 3 2 1 2 3 4 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:46.130
 but it's not electric 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.130
 I will go to 55 if we look at our world 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.889
 like at night 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:02.370
 since 2002 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.050
 the boy we just have to put in we're going to 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.140
 put is here worth that we need that 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.300
 put one here here another here here 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.980
 and another one here we do a study 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.400
 closed then good when we pulled out of 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.070
 close 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.870
 we need a pressure plate not 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.740
 it can be good because wood or what 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.310
 another one block and the pressure plate what 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.470
 we put we create 123 45 seconds we jump 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.470
 and we will reach the middle 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.230
 then 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:42.060
 and a half 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.060
 but
