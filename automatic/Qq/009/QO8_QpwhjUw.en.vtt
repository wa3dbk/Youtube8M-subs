00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.699
 actually been looking for a platform of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.870
 thanks in the very masculine side 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.030
 the masculine attitude that a person 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.829
 can have when I masculine it's more 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 anchored more powerful flora this is 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.800
 was often looking for a moment of grace 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.970
 all cases the bond is more anchored 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.070
 and because the last one was so 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.110
 full mine is so much going for 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.610
 is what I will be stronger there 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100

 just taste but I loved playing well 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 with that are stolen moments 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.899
 often stolen moments that you're 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.000
 in the bar you're just a story 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.130
 loving that you are you are dating in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.630
 nobody or that of a corner of the street that 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.179
 are celebrating these are just stolen moments 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.630
 sacred but looking for elegance 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.630
 experts 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.840

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.050
 see the gods though 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.690

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.939
 ah ah 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.100
 but 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.160
 a fan not forbidden madness of 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:21.280
 twelve dead in the ships but this 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:21.280
 evening is now the lattes and leila 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.490
 1 100 kg also in France 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.200
 when we are in the place the place 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.900
 of the Communist Party obviously 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.730
 beautiful which is a building that has been 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.950
 built by an energetic and awesome 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.049
 ten best here that is actually in 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.629
 the years so I think it's early 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.099
 70 this place that absolutely extraordinary 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.870
 validated that matches completely with the 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.790
 collection it was clothes a little 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.190
 futuristic but also mix with 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.860
 the aspiration the English tradition ca the 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.549
 kilt all things how will they do 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.930
 that counted com and hispanics as well 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.090
 cook them nails all this but reviewed 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.280
 in a way to ghlin dips barth where he 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.120
 used to make volumes almost 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.489
 adrenaline a few votes for the team 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.930
 renewed kilt and then and then and then 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.699
 the special side there was of 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.829
 transparent transparency of clothing 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.510
 sometimes even to be at this moment this 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.580
 which showed the construction what 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.289
 had for example jackets so the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.570
 mutu fabric was transparent and one 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.979
 saw all the interlining all is not 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.000
 says where all things regret in 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.160
 different materials 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.350
 it was quite a game with regard to the 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.750
 relationship between roasts and 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.430
 drugs like it's our love and hate 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.810
 what have at the same time what in everything in 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.729
 fully respecting and teaching in 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.010
 ultimately very well egality 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.460
 liberty frivolity 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.460
 what can they 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.780
 Oh 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.470
 my inspiration was john lilly who 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.479
 is one of the favorite illustrators apart 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.949
 we lose her heroine gwendoline who will 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.720
 at las vegas so it was very magical 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.919
 cabaret it was a bit more sophisticated 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.240
 that usually there was news 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.639
 shapes of his who had the hat bag 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.259
 with the rabbit ears there was the 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.789
 matchbox otherwise there is still 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.530
 minaudiÃ¨res in the shape of a book 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.090
 this is my sister who spoke out of 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.090
 hat at the end in white rabbit 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:43.580
