00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:13.429
 and it is already 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.920
 let's play 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.620
 for all of you who ask if I left the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.320
 loquendo not do not leave me cago in your 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.910
 fucking mother this time let's see 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.239
 the evolution of the budokai saga 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 tenkaichi of the ps2 let's start with this 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.570
 thing 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.600
 first let's go to the most important thing by 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.850
 at least for me the gameplay me 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.100
 love the arcade style of the budokai 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.320
 but the playability of you have and you 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.210
 they go to hell I had orgasms every time 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.060
 that he played them more than anything in the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.280
 third delivery instead in the budokai 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.700
 it reminded me of the deadly kombat the street 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.950
 fighter to the classic now yes at once 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.950
 let's all start with this thing 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.380
 everything started in December 2002 it arrived 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 to the stores a game called a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.510
 wait it's complicated to say it with 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.380
 I count so I got textually dragon 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.900
 ball z 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.740
 or see dragon ball z in the west 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.560
 it was called dragon ball z budokan 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.140
 he budokai went to the ps2 and then a 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.060
 year later for the gamecube in each 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.890
 game of the series the player controls 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.780
 one or more characters directly 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.850
 based on its counterpart of the series 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.979
 dragon ball z as in most of the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.930
 Fight games players face 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.119
 your character against other characters 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.030
 controlled by either another player or 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.319
 by the artificial intelligence of the game 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.959
 depending on the game mode in which 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.580
 is the player also has the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.410
 possibility of seeing two characters 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.019
 controlled by the computer to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.730
 face something totally useless anymore 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.299
 that who the fuck is going to see the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.489
 screen 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.400
 unless you make bets with your friends 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.530
 x in battles you have a bar 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.569
 energy that increases if you charge 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.420
 energy and it is spent if you make a super 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.910
 kamehameha the game has 23 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.530
 characters from the beginning of de bz 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.530
 until the end of the happy saga 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.760
 and this was the first budokai I played 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.280
 that arcade rpg style and I found it very 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.440
 good in its time was not lost to 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.690
 nothing the essence of the first is more what 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.310
 they improved a lot like for example the cel 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.230
 shading that served so that 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.480
 characters are more like those of 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.580
 anime the game was used until the saga 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.820
 of edu brings a staff of wrestlers 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.160
 of 34 and around 50 if they count 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.950
 transformations and mergers has been 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.690
 improved fighting system 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.760
 simplifying it mostly mode 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.950
 dragon world history takes a radical turn 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.230
 compared to the previous version 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.360
 since it does not follow the original story and 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.820
 includes mergers never seen as 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.220
 goku will endow him with goku and mister satan and 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.140
 think fusion of jump site in xinjiang 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.140
 if they went to hell 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.769
 I warn you that the video will have two parts 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.170
 if they did not pay attention in the 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.000
 title this is the last game of the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.189
 budokai saga since the budokai 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.170
 Tenkaichi have nothing to do just 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.810
 they gave them that title in the west 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.870
 to please the fans let's start with 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.030
 this thing in the dragon ball z budokai 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.159
 there were characters up the android saga 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.439
 and in the dragon ball z budokai 2 there was 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.810
 characters up to the voodoo saga and in the 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.730
 dragon ball z budokai 3 has characters 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.730
 of dragon ball dragon ball movies 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.560
 z and dragon ball gt budokai 3 works 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.230
 on the same graphic engine as your 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.269
 predecessor budokai 2 that was modified to 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.859
 give more prominence to cell shading with 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.769
 regarding what was seen in the first 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.079
 title of the saga the graphic changes to 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.240
 technical level exist but they are minimal and 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.680
 the improvements are more focused on 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.449
 add or polish details or in 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.460
 perfect some facets with 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.900
 regarding what was previously seen as 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.910
 the characters scenarios and sequences 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.919
 with the characters there has been a 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.020
 titanic effort since all the 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.759
 fighters included have all the 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.820
 costumes that they use throughout the 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.860
 series each in each of its stages 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.930
 for example goian boy starts with the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.669
 itchy suit but when traveling to 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.009
 ahmed changes it for the armor of 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.199
 combat in addition to brand new haircut 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.880
 vegueta happens to use armor with 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.250
 shoulder pads to the vest variant and 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.259
 finally to the suit fitted with gloves 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.720
 and boots and finally pico can fight 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.630
 with or without coat and also with the suit 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.610
 nail for transformations the same 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.470
 you have to discover yourself by the work done 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.590
 because all the 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.970
 transformations of all the characters 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.830
 this means that now some 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.570
 fighters like frizer will have a 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.150
 authentic recital of change of 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.550
 appearance frizer with armor freezer 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.710
 in first transformation in second in 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.590
 final form final form to one hundred 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.180
 hundred and even metal freezer the same 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.660
 to continue with what you can fight 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.090
 in all its states in summary a game 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.220
 of fucking mother if they wonder why 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.050
 the graphics look so good it's because 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.050
 it is a mixture and of the edition 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.900
 3 in part 2 I'll talk about the saga 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.470
 budokai tenkaichi now I retire up 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.470
 the next
