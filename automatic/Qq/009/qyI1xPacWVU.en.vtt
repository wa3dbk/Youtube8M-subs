00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.219
 hi guys did in miguel view this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.259
 video because there are a lot of people 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.599
 looking wanting to know how my 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.270
 pedal free and I think the first thing 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.160
 that you have to keep in mind in the battery 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.990
 adjusting height adjustments on parts 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.609
 there the bank, this is all very personal 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.070
 including pedal adjustment 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.920
 so I'll show here how the return of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.100
 pedal for me works well for me okay 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.100
 working 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.899
 it may be that for many of you 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 also broke other honey that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 So much to play then so everything. 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.629
 depends on the technique you use that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.230
 old story you're going to play 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.449
 Anyway, I 'm here with my 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 own pacheco pereira and mitchell is a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.690
 double pedal I 'm here just because it's 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.699
 his right 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.910
 the first thing I chose forgiveness 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.479
 It was the pulley it comes with the white police. 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.140
 19 one black red choose black 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.189
 one was to form a perfect circle 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.590
 huh 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.100
 So I got used to this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.900
 choice is if it is this is another one 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.780
 regulation that I realized works 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 well to me is this pedal if 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.530
 You can regulate their lack of it but 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.799
 met shorter 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.750
 so who thinks that the regulation of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.520
 factory right in the middle you have three 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 I ended up choosing the last one. 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.810
 stage which is just shorter miss 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.810
 I think it worked for me better. 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.689
 I ended up changing the beaters of the world. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.930
 the pedal because the originals by the 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.780
 comes in the mangaio 's because I 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.420
 this heavier sound a little like more 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.579
 since it comes in the original pedal 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 Wonderful commission to say a lot 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.950
 time and then switched for example 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.950
 here is the batter here 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.170
 I leave now with more or less three 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:16.610
 memory mark and below it 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.980
 ok the ox is left is only a Pokemon 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.700
 I want to like it, I think it's a footprint. 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.580
 legal and becomes so heavy that criminal law 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.350
 the nearest regulated batsman and he 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.209
 It's really all we need is a good thing. 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.880
 important that you pay attention to 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.300
 slope of the batter relative to the ground 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.590
 huh 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.690
 for example you imagine a line here 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.489
 My vote is about 45 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.940
 degrees to the floor 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.790
 if you leave him another brother-in-law with 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.390
 less years in relation to the floor 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.790
 he will have more power will give a 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.980
 little more footprint but will get one 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.580
 little slower does not get heavier 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.050
 also one of the most important things to 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.390
 regularity spring tension 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.329
 I played very tight ball totally 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.489
 right in the car but nowadays I do not 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.670
 I participate so much she advises to do 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.980
 it does not let more or less one of 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.980
 Slack does not lose on the bike. 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.989
 something else that I switched from the regulation 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.739
 factory was that inverter this plaquinha 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.260
 of the shoe that has rubbery 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.970
 original factory he came to me like this 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.970
 the good chances up 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.519
 careful how it was intercepted in a baby 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.519
 rubber sack 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.440
 he said he came like that just like me 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.960
 I like to step on the pedal more pro 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.890
 hurt I do not like does not make colleague in 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.240
 pedal one thing my daughter I reversed 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.650
 times 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.650
 I will not go down
