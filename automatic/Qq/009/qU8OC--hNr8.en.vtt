00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.830
 yes 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello everyone that such good I bring a 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.309
 new video of this new collection of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.230
 a recommended product and in this case 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.540
 it is another product that I have 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.700
 using enough time not 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.460
 I knew in which video and how to get it out because 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.680
 it seems to me that it is of special mention 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.970
 I deserved a video so I'm delighted 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.300
 with this one product just 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.399
 recommended and is a hairbrush 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.620
 I do not usually speak in fact I think that never 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.059
 I have spoken in no video of a brush 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.910
 for the hair but I think that this 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.109
 really deserves the mention and it comes 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.109
 of the tan the teaser 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.570
 this is the box and the little brush 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.420
 question is this has this form so 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.210
 rare that you see the barbs does not have any 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.270
 type of handle but it adapts very well to 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.450
 the hand you see is taken like this 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.760
 and it fits very well because it's a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.410
 brush especially recommended good 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
 in the indications it says it's a 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.360
 brush that takes care of the cuticle of the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.400
 hair that I really can not either 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.650
 tell you because I do not know very well if I 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.410
 I do not care for me well but what does 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.260
 I can tell you, it's a miracle 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.240
 untangling can be used in wet 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.520
 and dry on wet hair on 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.979
 dry hair I use mostly 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.680
 on damp hair and I tell you that 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.050
 I can not untangle my hair with a 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.910
 brush like this quietly if I do not use 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.590
 Conditioner needs conditioner 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.710
 let's say for the brush to slip and 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.869
 to be able to develop without tearing 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.530
 half of the hair good with this 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.119
 brush I do not need conditioner me 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.790
 I wash my normal hair I do not need 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.369
 put a conditioner or anything and I 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.020
 He brushed the brush and unraveled me 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.869
 directly I do not even have to go 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.119
 as to pulls directly I put the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.220
 brush above it slides down and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.950
 I untangle all the hair that is 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.970
 amazing has two types of barbs like 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.180
 you can see some 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.880
 more the routes and other shorter ones I do not 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.450
 I know if this system helps a help the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.900
 case is that they are very flexible tines 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.900
 Behold 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.660
 at the same time rigid enough 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.300
 why unravel the unraveling the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.050
 hair I say that I do not dry it 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.900
 I use, but in the wet, it is 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.170
 incredible the result for me a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.440
 brush that untangle the hair of a 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.350
 passed without tearing me good well if 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.140
 some hair like 1 or 2 come on I think 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.600
 highly recommended also I put it in these 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.000
 videos of a recommended product because 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.560
 the price right now the 'news of the web 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.320
 of rada beauty and right now I just 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.530
 look to be able to say it is 11 with 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.010
 89 before it was 13 and peak we recorded round 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.319
 there 11 euros 12-13 there is a web 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.970
 official that I'll leave it here under the 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.489
 video and if not we also downloaded the website of 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.680
 rada beauty and tell you that there are 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.090
 There are different models to carry in 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.120
 the bag tucked into some super homes 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 cute but come on this is the basic one already 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.580
 several colors come out and it's a little brush 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.050
 very light does not weigh anything means 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.420
 to carry it in the bag between 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.150
 size and how light that is very comfortable 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.910
 although it has no handle is super practical 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.470
 it grabs very well but come on you 're going to 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.930
 see the fundamentals is very good of 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.030
 price untangle the hair that is a 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.099
 wonder also I tell you that says that 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.680
 take care of the cuticles, you know that 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.110
 cuticles if instead of being open 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970
 damaged are well closed and well 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.590
 sealed apart will be the healthiest hair 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.170
 makes it shine more with which also 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.180
 It helps to make it look better and 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.160
 in addition you can apply you can 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.349
 use dry like I'm doing 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.940
 with normal hair but 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.580
 above all, it seems like a marvel to me 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.620
 using it in the wet also indicates that 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.810
 can be used to apply the 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.310
 masks you already know to be this way 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.019
 plastic can be put in the shower and 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.330
 as I said you know that 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.549
 masks to the conditioners are 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.870
 apply from means to points and instead of 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.330
 apply them with your hands we can 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.579
 Apply them with a brush distributing 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.500
 so much better the product for the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.359
 I do nothing but brush in that 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.580
 mirror then that this store with the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.250
 good brush 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.560
 then we apply the conditioner 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.439
 means to tips and with a brush this or 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.150
 any other we apply it like this and 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.009
 we make the product is distributed 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.659
 much better for the hair I for 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.460
 apply masks neither am I 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.560
 using and I say that only for 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.419
 unravel but only for that I think 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.250
 an investment that is worth it 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.020
 nothing like I'm saying in this 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.020
 type of videos of a product 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.229
 recommended I really hope so 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.449
 you taste that you like it a lot and that you 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.219
 so be as good as me 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.539
 that's all I hope you liked and 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.539
