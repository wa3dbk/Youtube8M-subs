it's<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.300> facts<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.930> then

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
it's just the facts of it then

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.170 
it's just the facts of it then
are<00:02:13.650> not<00:02:13.980> going<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> keep<00:02:14.459> on<00:02:14.610> supporting<00:02:14.819> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
are not going to keep on supporting a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.240 
are not going to keep on supporting a
cdma<00:02:15.780> network<00:02:16.170> they<00:02:16.349> would<00:02:16.500> just<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.800> dumping

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
cdma network they would just be dumping

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.339 
cdma network they would just be dumping
money<00:02:17.459> into<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.209> basically<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.750> killed<00:02:19.230> a

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
money into it it basically just killed a

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.949 
money into it it basically just killed a
brand<00:02:19.590> off<00:02:19.830> how<00:02:20.489> I<00:02:20.519> mean<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.269> believe<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.840> was

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
brand off how I mean I believe it was

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.690 
brand off how I mean I believe it was
probably<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> die<00:02:22.680> without<00:02:23.099> support

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
probably going to die without support

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.110 
probably going to die without support
anyways<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.720> going<00:02:25.560> over<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> gsm<00:02:26.760> networks

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
anyways so going over to a gsm networks

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.550 
anyways so going over to a gsm networks
probably<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.720> best<00:02:27.959> thing<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.349> could<00:02:28.470> have

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
probably the best thing that could have

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.220 
probably the best thing that could have
ever<00:02:28.800> happened<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:30.209> craig<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.540> wireless<00:02:31.019> and

18 to use network which is much stronger
now<00:02:50.730> let's<00:02:51.630> uh<00:02:51.840> let's<00:02:52.170> try<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.590> compare<00:02:52.950> this

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
now let's uh let's try to compare this

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.740 
now let's uh let's try to compare this
to<00:02:53.280> something<00:02:53.519> if<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.090> wait<00:02:54.360> with<00:02:54.569> your

the s6 might already be out by then or

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.940 
the s6 might already be out by then or
it<00:03:02.970> might<00:03:03.269> be<00:03:03.510> upcoming<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.530> means<00:03:04.709> your

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
it might be upcoming that means your

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.940 
it might be upcoming that means your
device<00:03:05.430> will<00:03:05.670> be<00:03:05.700> two<00:03:06.090> generations<00:03:06.989> old<00:03:07.170> now

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
device will be two generations old now

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.819 
device will be two generations old now
let's<00:03:08.310> see<00:03:09.239> what<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.900> device<00:03:10.319> there's<00:03:10.620> two

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
let's see what if a device there's two

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.069 
let's see what if a device there's two
generations<00:03:11.459> old<00:03:11.700> goes<00:03:12.060> for<00:03:12.329> let's<00:03:12.810> look<00:03:12.930> at

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
generations old goes for let's look at

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.910 
generations old goes for let's look at
some<00:03:13.260> sprint<00:03:13.680> galaxy<00:03:13.920> s3's<00:03:14.959> 130<00:03:15.959> by<00:03:16.170> now<00:03:16.639> 140

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
some sprint galaxy s3's 130 by now 140

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.160 
some sprint galaxy s3's 130 by now 140
136<00:03:19.920> right<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.700> mean<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.660> device<00:03:21.930> is

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
136 right there I mean the device is

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.530 
136 right there I mean the device is
going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.680> be<00:03:22.769> old<00:03:23.040> by<00:03:23.340> March<00:03:23.639> anyways<00:03:24.180> most

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
going to be old by March anyways most

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.479 
going to be old by March anyways most
people<00:03:25.079> probably<00:03:25.440> would<00:03:25.829> have<00:03:25.889> given<00:03:26.100> up<00:03:26.310> that

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
people probably would have given up that

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.970 
people probably would have given up that
device<00:03:26.819> already<00:03:27.359> I<00:03:28.109> don't<00:03:28.290> know<00:03:28.380> how<00:03:28.500> long<00:03:28.769> you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
device already I don't know how long you

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.099 
device already I don't know how long you
keep<00:03:29.190> your<00:03:29.370> devices<00:03:29.819> maybe<00:03:30.599> don't<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:30.989> to

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
keep your devices maybe don't like to

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.970 
keep your devices maybe don't like to
spend<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.410> lot<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.560> money<00:03:31.829> on<00:03:31.920> devices<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:33.000> they

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
spend a lot of money on devices but they

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.220 
spend a lot of money on devices but they
devaluate<00:03:34.980> at<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> pretty<00:03:35.730> quick<00:03:36.420> rate<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.079> you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
devaluate at a pretty quick rate and you

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.039 
devaluate at a pretty quick rate and you
would<00:03:37.380> have<00:03:37.440> lost<00:03:37.650> money<00:03:37.980> anyways<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.780> is

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
would have lost money anyways so this is

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.659 
would have lost money anyways so this is
