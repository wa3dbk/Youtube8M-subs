looked like online because the most

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.109 
looked like online because the most
disappointing<00:00:25.679> thing<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.949> me<00:00:26.070> was<00:00:26.759> that<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
disappointing thing to me was that this

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.730 
disappointing thing to me was that this
color<00:00:27.390> did<00:00:27.630> not<00:00:27.839> look<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.259> color<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
color did not look like the color that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.450 
color did not look like the color that
was<00:00:28.859> online<00:00:29.130> which<00:00:29.669> is<00:00:29.820> very<00:00:30.089> frustrating<00:00:30.269> um

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
was online which is very frustrating um

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.970 
was online which is very frustrating um
it's<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.880> nice<00:00:33.030> color<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.720> on<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.740> feel

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980

is Dolce Vita the seduction it's might

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.920 
is Dolce Vita the seduction it's might
be<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.530> little<00:01:05.160> bit<00:01:05.430> darker<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.300> not<00:01:06.690> much

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
be like a little bit darker but not much

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.620 
be like a little bit darker but not much
not<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.950> warrant<00:01:08.250> me<00:01:08.340> keeping<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.910> both<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
not to warrant me keeping them both and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.930 
not to warrant me keeping them both and
I<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> darn<00:01:11.370> good<00:01:11.460> blush

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
I think that this is a darn good blush

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.630 
I think that this is a darn good blush
but<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.390> feel<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.890> Dolce<00:01:14.400> Vita

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
but I feel like if you have Dolce Vita

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.980 
but I feel like if you have Dolce Vita
you<00:01:14.790> don't<00:01:14.940> need<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.780> you're<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
you don't need this if you're a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.160 
you don't need this if you're a
fair-skinned<00:01:16.610> um<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.990> like

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
fair-skinned um if you just like

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.110 
fair-skinned um if you just like
collecting<00:01:19.380> blushes<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.580> maybe<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.940> would

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
collecting blushes then maybe you would

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.730 
collecting blushes then maybe you would
if<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.810> subtle<00:01:22.170> difference<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
if you like a subtle difference but I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.230 
if you like a subtle difference but I
think<00:01:22.980> I'm<00:01:23.130> actually<00:01:23.280> gonna<00:01:23.490> return<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
think I'm actually gonna return this and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.970 
think I'm actually gonna return this and
get<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> different<00:01:24.720> one

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
get a different one

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.490 
get a different one
um<00:01:26.480> it<00:01:27.480> is<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.720> good<00:01:27.900> blush<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.260> very

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
um it is a good blush it's very

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
um it is a good blush it's very
pigmented<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.340> pretty<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:30.420> just

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
pigmented it's pretty I'm just

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
pigmented it's pretty I'm just
disappointed<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> fact<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:31.979> didn't

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
disappointed in the fact that it didn't

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.370 
disappointed in the fact that it didn't
really<00:01:32.340> look<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.850> picture<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.420> me<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
really look like the picture to me so I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.010 
really look like the picture to me so I
think<00:01:34.620> that<00:01:35.040> neck<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.729> mean<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.600> ordered<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
think that neck I mean I ordered it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
think that neck I mean I ordered it
offline<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.770> hard<00:01:38.010> to<00:01:38.040> tell<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.640> should

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
offline so it is hard to tell I should

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.370 
offline so it is hard to tell I should
have<00:01:39.150> looked<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.479> person<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:39.960> I've<00:01:40.080> ordered

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
have looked in person but I've ordered

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.350 
have looked in person but I've ordered
other<00:01:40.620> NARS<00:01:41.159> blushes<00:01:41.550> online<00:01:41.880> before<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
other NARS blushes online before and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.990 
other NARS blushes online before and
I've<00:01:42.680> um<00:01:43.680> thought<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> picture<00:01:44.970> quality

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I've um thought that the picture quality

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.510 
I've um thought that the picture quality
was<00:01:45.570> did<00:01:46.229> them<00:01:46.380> justice<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.280> no<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
was did them justice but this one no I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
was did them justice but this one no I
just<00:01:48.030> feel<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:49.200> pictures<00:01:49.560> online<00:01:51.140> did

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
just feel like the pictures online did

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810 
just feel like the pictures online did
not<00:01:52.320> look<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.010> blush<00:01:53.250> looked<00:01:53.640> like

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
not look like what the blush looked like

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.260 
not look like what the blush looked like
so<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.500> think<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> very<00:01:56.430> pretty<00:01:56.940> blog

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so I think that it is a very pretty blog

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.880 
so I think that it is a very pretty blog
wasn't<00:01:57.690> for<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.900> fact<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.320> had<00:01:58.560> Dolce

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
wasn't for the fact that I had Dolce

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.500 
wasn't for the fact that I had Dolce
Vita<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.280> might<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.760> this<00:01:59.880> one<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.150> little<00:02:00.360> bit

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
Vita I might like this one a little bit

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.930 
Vita I might like this one a little bit
more<00:02:00.900> but<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> fact<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.220> have<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.700> one

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
more but the fact that I have this one

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.469 
more but the fact that I have this one
and<00:02:03.890> I'm<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.220> going<00:02:05.610> through<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.880> very<00:02:06.090> fast

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and I'm not going through it very fast

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.809 
and I'm not going through it very fast
I<00:02:06.540> haven't<00:02:06.720> even<00:02:06.840> hit<00:02:06.990> pan<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.580> just<00:02:08.580> don't<00:02:08.729> need

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
I haven't even hit pan I just don't need

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.360 
I haven't even hit pan I just don't need
to<00:02:08.879> keep<00:02:09.060> them<00:02:09.239> both<00:02:09.389> so<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.979> don't<00:02:11.159> have

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to keep them both so if you don't have

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.860 
to keep them both so if you don't have
Dolce<00:02:11.700> Vita<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.329> fair<00:02:12.510> skin<00:02:12.540> I

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
Dolce Vita and you have fair skin I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.380 
Dolce Vita and you have fair skin I
would<00:02:12.959> recommend

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
would recommend

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.100 
would recommend
getting<00:02:13.630> seduction<00:02:14.080> but<00:02:15.600> otherwise<00:02:16.600> if<00:02:17.020> you

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
getting seduction but otherwise if you

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.010 
getting seduction but otherwise if you
do<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:18.069> might<00:02:18.250> need<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.660> skip<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:19.959> time

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
do you might need to skip it this time

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.559 
do you might need to skip it this time
because<00:02:20.440> it's<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.640> very<00:02:21.880> similar<00:02:22.180> to

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
because it's it's very similar to

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.330 
because it's it's very similar to
another<00:02:22.690> one<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.230> those<00:02:23.920> are<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.160> my

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
another one but those are just my

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.980 
another one but those are just my
opinions<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.590> I'll<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.830> guys<00:02:26.920> later
