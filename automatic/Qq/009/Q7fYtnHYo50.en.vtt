00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.480
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.439
 Well today I come to do an analysis of 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.590
 the current situation of what are the 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.349
 geomagnetic storms that lately 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:31.369
 they are lashing the earth with some 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.700
 tremendous intensities and nothing what 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.460
 it may be the maximum solar that prevented 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.530
 for 2012 and we 're feeling it in the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.370
 2013 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.949
 but good in any case 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.730
 let's investigate to see what it is that 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.270
 what happens happens 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.550
 up there because lately we're 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.420
 suffering several geomagnetic storms 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.220
 and this may be the prelude to something 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.600
 much worse sunspots are 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.519
 immense of great as big as 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.000
 Jupiter 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.649
 and well I think that this requires 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.810
 at least an investigation to see 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.049
 what is happening and well I 'm going to 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.329
 do an analysis I think I think I think 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.299
 I want to think that will not happen anything 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:26.159
 of the sun will remain stable this year and 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:29.610
 that next year will diminish a bit 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.380
 even then its activity up to 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.750
 mid or late 2014 as it begins 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.610
 again he like who says a cycle 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.489
 low there are many people say that there will be 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.709
 an ice age I do not think it's so 

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:49.380
 severe but something can happen because 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.950
 this maximum cycle of the sun then it is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.950
 quite 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.020
 let's say it's not as strong as 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.939
 I expected 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.970
 and that is what I am going to show you now in 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.130
 these images as you can see them 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.399
 and good here you have what is the index 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.220
 of sunspots as you can check 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:14.100
 every year there are fewer sunspots and 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.740
 maximum cycles of the sun are becoming more 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.650
 small what would support the theory of 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:24.120
 a possible glacial era at the end of 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.250
 2014 the magnetic field suffers though 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.460
 keeps intact and for now the earth 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.280
 it is not in danger as you see the auroras 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.870
 At the dawn of the month of June 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.330
 they keep in their places without having 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.310
 too many alterations and doing that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.930
 continue to be an incredible show 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.969
 for those who live in those latitudes 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.629
 someday the truth I would like 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:50.500
 contemplate some northern lights like the 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.500
 this photo for example 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.909
 and good the northern lights like 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.280
 we know they are being quite frequent 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.209
 this year already because of the storms 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.300
 geomagnetic we are suffering 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.280
 same days these days 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.860
 geomagnetic storms that I show you 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.210
 on this graph where it is very important 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.190
 interpret the coffee index 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.260
 that tells us if a storm 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.769
 geomagnetic is minor major or severe 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.420
 if one day the coffee reaches 8 could 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.480
 have a global alert and the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.970
 communications would be affected 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.120
 also the flow of electrons affects 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.819
 pronounced north of brazil and 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.420
 It seems to take some time affecting 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.000
 to that area of Latin America 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.220
 and good honestly it seems that the sun 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.230
 he wants to give us a truce although this does not 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.580
 It is a good sign, it could be 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.890
 suddenly suffer a change 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.600
 quite drastic but anyway 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.960
 if he continues on this path we 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.770
 we will face in 2014 at the beginning of a 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:03.530
 colder weather and maybe a small one was 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.530
 glacial although it is unlikely 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.220
 even so what is clear is that the sun 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.950
 it tends to decrease its activity every time 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.890
 more and that will affect us 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.620
 a greeting and thanks for watching another video 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.620
 more amazing news until then
