00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
right here that's the main branch right

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.440 
right here that's the main branch right
there<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:41.690> originally<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.960> had<00:00:43.320> topped<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.450> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
there and originally I had topped it the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.880 
there and originally I had topped it the
top<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.840> coming<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.200> right<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.649> don't

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
top is coming out right there I don't

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.209 
top is coming out right there I don't
know<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.789> right<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:49.219> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
know if you can see that right there so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.270 
know if you can see that right there so
originally<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:52.070> this<00:00:53.070> main

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
originally it was like this this main

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.250 
originally it was like this this main
branch<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.850> these<00:00:54.149> two<00:00:54.480> French<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.020> coming

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
branch here these two French is coming

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.830 
branch here these two French is coming
out<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> top<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> did

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
out and in the top so what I did

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.189 
out and in the top so what I did
down<00:00:58.289> there<00:00:58.590> when<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> looked<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
down there when it looked like that is I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.539 
down there when it looked like that is I
cut<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:02.270> this<00:01:03.270> part<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.280> about<00:01:05.280> down

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
cut off this part right here about down

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.359 
cut off this part right here about down
as<00:01:05.760> far<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.180> could<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.040> result

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
as far as I could get it and the result

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
as far as I could get it and the result
is<00:01:10.430> see<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> other<00:01:11.729> branch<00:01:12.240> coming<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:12.780> here

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
is see this other branch coming up here

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.429 
is see this other branch coming up here
so<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:13.650> has<00:01:13.920> two<00:01:14.159> tops<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> that's

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so it actually has two tops and that's

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.010 
so it actually has two tops and that's
what<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> originally<00:01:16.920> intended<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.869> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
what I originally intended so as this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.890 
what I originally intended so as this
plant<00:01:19.350> grows<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.159> should<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.720> two<00:01:21.720> main

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
plant grows up it should have two main

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
plant grows up it should have two main
types<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.439> being<00:01:22.650> more<00:01:22.830> dominant<00:01:23.220> than<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
types one being more dominant than the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.859 
types one being more dominant than the
other<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> didn't<00:01:26.040> expect<00:01:26.159> is

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
other and what I didn't expect is

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.780 
other and what I didn't expect is
another

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
another

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.540 
another
top<00:01:29.390> shoot<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.080> come<00:01:30.260> out<00:01:30.410> you<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.040> see<00:01:31.190> that<00:01:31.370> I

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
top shoot to come out you can see that I

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.400 
top shoot to come out you can see that I
don't<00:01:31.700> know<00:01:31.760> if<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:31.880> can<00:01:31.970> see<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:32.300> oh<00:01:32.600> yeah

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
don't know if you can see that oh yeah

don't know if you can see that oh yeah
that<00:01:33.590> one<00:01:33.710> right<00:01:33.860> there<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:34.490> see<00:01:34.550> the

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
that one right there so you see the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:42.160 
that one right there so you see the
branch<00:01:34.880> coming<00:01:35.210> out<00:01:35.300> there<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:40.720> but<00:01:41.720> yeah<00:01:41.870> so

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
branch coming out there and but yeah so

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.440 
branch coming out there and but yeah so
I<00:01:42.230> actually<00:01:42.410> have<00:01:43.780> three<00:01:44.780> tops<00:01:46.300> coming<00:01:47.300> out

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
I actually have three tops coming out

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.510 
I actually have three tops coming out
and<00:01:47.870> I'm<00:01:48.560> not<00:01:48.710> sure<00:01:48.920> if<00:01:49.040> I'm<00:01:49.130> gonna<00:01:49.310> let<00:01:49.490> that

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
and I'm not sure if I'm gonna let that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.450 
and I'm not sure if I'm gonna let that
one<00:01:49.700> go<00:01:49.970> out<00:01:50.180> cuz<00:01:50.510> it's<00:01:51.020> growing<00:01:51.290> a<00:01:51.710> lot<00:01:52.130> slower

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
one go out cuz it's growing a lot slower

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.700 
one go out cuz it's growing a lot slower
than<00:01:52.580> that<00:01:52.910> one<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.390> I<00:01:53.660> don't<00:01:54.410> know<00:01:54.470> if<00:01:54.590> it'll

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
than that one so I don't know if it'll

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.410 
than that one so I don't know if it'll
be<00:01:54.770> beneficial<00:01:55.370> to<00:01:55.400> keep<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.850> or<00:01:56.000> not<00:01:56.150> we'll

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
be beneficial to keep it or not we'll

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.580 
be beneficial to keep it or not we'll
see<00:01:56.600> I'll<00:01:56.960> let<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.170> grow<00:01:57.350> over<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.530> next

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
see I'll let it grow over the next

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.280 
see I'll let it grow over the next
couple<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:58.040> weeks<00:01:58.300> but<00:01:59.300> as<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.600> stands<00:01:59.870> this

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
couple of weeks but as it stands this

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.719 
couple of weeks but as it stands this
plant<00:02:00.560> being<00:02:00.740> roughly<00:02:01.100> about<00:02:01.190> seven<00:02:01.610> weeks

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
plant being roughly about seven weeks

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.320 
plant being roughly about seven weeks
old<00:02:01.970> topping<00:02:02.900> it<00:02:03.610> it's<00:02:04.610> fairly<00:02:04.790> bushy<00:02:05.150> and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
old topping it it's fairly bushy and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.990 
old topping it it's fairly bushy and
it's<00:02:08.330> only<00:02:08.479> about<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.520> don't<00:02:10.520> know<00:02:10.580> about<00:02:10.700> nine

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
it's only about I don't know about nine

and a half less than ten inches tall
it's<00:02:15.770> doing<00:02:16.040> pretty<00:02:16.070> well<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
it's doing pretty well and

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.539 
it's doing pretty well and
and<00:02:18.329> see<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.629> little<00:02:18.829> area<00:02:19.829> here<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.249> have<00:02:20.459> it

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
and see my little area here I have it

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.149 
and see my little area here I have it
all<00:02:20.640> decked<00:02:20.909> out<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.090> mylar<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:22.560> it's<00:02:22.709> making

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
all decked out in mylar so it's making

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.959 
all decked out in mylar so it's making

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
familiar with CFL glow lights yeah so

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.920 
familiar with CFL glow lights yeah so
far<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.650> good<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:03.469> I'm<00:03:04.469> shooting<00:03:04.829> for<00:03:05.250> about

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
far so good and I'm shooting for about

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.670 
far so good and I'm shooting for about
roughly<00:03:07.609> 30<00:03:08.609> 35<00:03:09.150> inches<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.780> then<00:03:10.469> I'll

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
roughly 30 35 inches and then I'll

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.159 
roughly 30 35 inches and then I'll
harvest<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.340> plant<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:12.109> originally<00:03:13.109> I

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
harvest the plant and originally I

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.199 
harvest the plant and originally I
planned<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.530> make<00:03:13.680> powder<00:03:13.919> but<00:03:14.579> I<00:03:14.819> think<00:03:15.120> I'm

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
planned to make powder but I think I'm

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.640 
planned to make powder but I think I'm
just<00:03:15.299> gonna<00:03:15.419> harvest<00:03:15.689> it<00:03:15.930> for<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.139> leaves<00:03:16.319> and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
just gonna harvest it for the leaves and

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.740 
just gonna harvest it for the leaves and
continue<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.069> buy<00:03:17.299> them<00:03:18.299> bring<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.540> powder

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
continue to buy them bring the powder

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.619 
continue to buy them bring the powder
from<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.139> source<00:03:19.349> that<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.530> found<00:03:20.219> online<00:03:21.919> yeah

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
from a source that I found online yeah

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.059 
from a source that I found online yeah
so<00:03:24.629> far<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.019> plant<00:03:25.259> so<00:03:25.409> good<00:03:25.759> and

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.929 

I<00:03:29.159> don't<00:03:29.760> know<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:29.849> made<00:03:30.290> top<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.469> again<00:03:31.739> as<00:03:32.700> it

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:32.939 
I don't know I made top it again as it

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.390 
I don't know I made top it again as it
girls<00:03:33.150> up<00:03:33.439> maybe<00:03:34.439> let<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.769> branch<00:03:35.010> out<00:03:35.249> one

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
girls up maybe let it branch out one

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.309 
girls up maybe let it branch out one
more<00:03:35.519> time<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.879> top<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.239> again<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.870> I'll<00:03:37.049> have

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
more time to top it again so I'll have

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.199 
more time to top it again so I'll have
like<00:03:38.189> a<00:03:38.219> total<00:03:38.639> of<00:03:38.930> four<00:03:40.760> main<00:03:41.760> branches

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
like a total of four main branches

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.039 
like a total of four main branches
coming<00:03:42.450> up<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.980> let's<00:03:44.159> see<00:03:44.480> but<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.629> you<00:03:45.840> want

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
coming up so let's see but if you want

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.069 
coming up so let's see but if you want
to<00:03:46.139> know<00:03:46.230> how<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.769> increase<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.780> production

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
to know how to increase the production

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.449 
to know how to increase the production
of<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.290> plant<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.799> definitely<00:03:50.099> one<00:03:50.340> way

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
of the plant this is definitely one way

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.020 
of the plant this is definitely one way
to<00:03:50.519> do<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:52.129> another<00:03:53.129> way<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.340> help<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.700> to

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
to do it and another way to help it to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.709 
to do it and another way to help it to
push<00:03:54.209> out<00:03:54.389> is<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.689> actually<00:03:54.989> trim<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.349> ends

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:56.719 
push out is you actually trim the ends

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.280 
push out is you actually trim the ends
see<00:03:57.719> that<00:03:57.870> right<00:03:58.019> there<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:59.310> actually<00:04:00.290> came

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
see that right there it actually came

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.849 
see that right there it actually came
out<00:04:01.439> further<00:04:02.329> I'll<00:04:03.329> leave<00:04:03.450> out<00:04:03.540> here<00:04:04.049> so<00:04:04.319> I<00:04:04.409> cut

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
out further I'll leave out here so I cut

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.589 
out further I'll leave out here so I cut
that<00:04:05.010> off<00:04:05.219> same<00:04:06.060> thing<00:04:06.269> on<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.419> other<00:04:06.450> side

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
that off same thing on the other side

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.159 
that off same thing on the other side
and<00:04:07.409> I<00:04:08.010> may<00:04:08.159> do<00:04:08.370> that<00:04:08.579> for<00:04:09.480> other<00:04:09.599> branches<00:04:10.019> as

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
and I may do that for other branches as

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.349 
and I may do that for other branches as
it<00:04:10.290> grows<00:04:10.439> up<00:04:10.709> if<00:04:10.829> it<00:04:10.949> gets<00:04:11.129> too<00:04:11.489> wide<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:14.359> as

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
it grows up if it gets too wide and as

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.509 
it grows up if it gets too wide and as
for<00:04:15.629> my<00:04:15.719> other<00:04:15.750> plant<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.979> out<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.250> my<00:04:17.310> last

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
for my other plant that out of my last

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.430 
for my other plant that out of my last
update<00:04:17.880> was<00:04:18.000> probably<00:04:18.840> well<00:04:19.019> over<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.259> month

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
update was probably well over a month

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.189 
update was probably well over a month
ago<00:04:19.759> well<00:04:20.759> I<00:04:20.789> actually<00:04:21.030> cut<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.840> one<00:04:22.019> down

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
ago well I actually cut that one down

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.939 
ago well I actually cut that one down
that<00:04:22.470> one<00:04:22.620> was<00:04:22.770> about<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:24.750> was<00:04:24.930> over<00:04:25.289> 30<00:04:25.740> inches

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
that one was about it was over 30 inches

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.480 
that one was about it was over 30 inches
it's<00:04:26.460> probably<00:04:26.759> about<00:04:26.880> three<00:04:27.150> feet<00:04:28.130> but<00:04:29.130> I'll

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
it's probably about three feet but I'll

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.390
