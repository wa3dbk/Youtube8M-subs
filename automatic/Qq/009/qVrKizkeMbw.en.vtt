00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.080 
Choice I don't know but my little niece
is<00:00:42.239> very<00:00:42.840> intrigued<00:00:43.530> by<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.309> cartoon

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

is very intrigued by this little cartoon
and<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.750> thought<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.530> when<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.710> send<00:00:47.100> her

and so I thought that when I send her

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
and so I thought that when I send her
little<00:00:47.460> packages<00:00:48.120> i<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:49.110> some

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.349 
and these might be this one might be a
little<00:04:10.769> bit<00:04:10.980> dark<00:04:11.190> but<00:04:11.280> certainly<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:12.030> one

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
little bit dark but certainly this one

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.750 
little bit dark but certainly this one
and<00:04:12.599> this<00:04:12.720> one<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.019> this<00:04:13.379> one<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.950> then<00:04:14.579> of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
and this one and this one and then of

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.129 
and this one and this one and then of
course<00:04:14.819> it's<00:04:15.239> just<00:04:15.450> for<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.629> little<00:04:15.780> pop<00:04:15.989> of

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
course it's just for a little pop of

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.379 
course it's just for a little pop of
color<00:04:16.380> but<00:04:17.039> anyway<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.340> here's<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.269> question

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
color but anyway so here's the question

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.600 
color but anyway so here's the question
okay<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:20.690> have<00:04:21.690> never<00:04:22.530> used<00:04:22.919> profusion

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
okay I have never used profusion

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.270 
okay I have never used profusion
palettes<00:04:24.389> and<00:04:24.750> when<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.620> looked<00:04:25.919> at<00:04:26.100> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
palettes and when I looked at the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.939 
palettes and when I looked at the
ingredients<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:27.120> there's<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.870> part<00:04:28.229> of<00:04:28.320> me<00:04:28.380> that

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
ingredients I there's a part of me that

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.339 
ingredients I there's a part of me that
because<00:04:29.310> it<00:04:29.699> uses<00:04:29.880> parabens<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> don't

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
because it uses parabens that I don't

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.370 
because it uses parabens that I don't
want<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.710> use<00:04:31.949> them<00:04:32.250> but<00:04:33.240> then<00:04:33.419> again<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:34.110> know

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
want to use them but then again you know
