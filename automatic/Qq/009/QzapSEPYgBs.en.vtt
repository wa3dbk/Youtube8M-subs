00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.330
 to show how to make pancakes 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.010
 healthy have absolutely nothing 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.960
 that envy the normal pancakes 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.599
 they are super rich here they are practically 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.390
 same and I promise you that once the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.279
 try you will not want to try and come back 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.600
 to the previous ones so I hope 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.699
 You sincerely like this video 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 especially because it is super nutritious 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.010
 and you will start the day with great force 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.170
 very healthy and what else can you ask for? 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.630
 super healthy is true so I hope 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.230
 You sincerely like this video and good 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.230
 let's start 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.740
 we're going to need is half of a 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 banana 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.000
 an egg that we will only use the clear 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.140
 not the yolk so that it does not give so many 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.350
 calories to the pancakes 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.890
 avn half a cup a bit of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.590
 milk just a little bit a blender for 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.150
 that we can liquefy everything very well and a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.370
 kitchen where we can fry the 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.370
 pancakes being putting oats 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.870
 half the cup then let's go uia 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.340
 then we are going to chop the clear one that is already 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.070
 separated here and separate it from the yolk 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.320
 then we're going to apply half of the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 banana 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.790
 and a little bit of milk just a little 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.800
 because I do not want it to be too thick or 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.479
 I'm not very liquid either, I want him to have a 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.520
 consistency in fact still thick 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.950
 because if it's too liquid it's not going to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.479
 fry very well and it is going to be at the end 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.000
 of a pancake if it's not going to be like that 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.369
 a mess in the kitchen so I'm going to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.369
 calculate and I will start to beat 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.530
 now the dough is ready here 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.080
 as you can see it is very thick it is thick 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.369
 thick and what I like about the dough that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.110
 when it is thick you will be able to work 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.350
 very good with the pancakes so 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.750
 now I warmed the pan on low heat 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.610
 I put some coconut oil or 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.990
 any oil that you want to put and 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.990
 I'm going to start putting the pancakes 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.850
 the pancake you have to flip it over 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.009
 fast because if you do not have much time 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.860
 like any pancake box that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.080
 you use the normal one you burn so this is 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.640
 you have to try to flip it too 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.530
 fast when you see that you already have a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.470
 consistency aguirre appointment to the edges 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.140
 of the pancake 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.960
 let's try to make a circle and 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.480
 and we're going to let him cook there 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.930
 the pancake is cooking now 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.450
 let's see you have to make sure that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.400
 be ready to hit him but also 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.400
 that is not burning at the same time 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.129
 we're going to have to check the edges 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.019
 because the packages as you see is very very 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.409
 sometimes complicated to turn it over and there 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.989
 is and as you can see it is a super package 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.230
 simple just like normal you do not have anything 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.240
 that envy to normal so they're 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.690
 almost ready to serve 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.690
 Y 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.790
 and effects packages and is the result 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.220
 you can already put dulce de leche 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.050
 bananas fruits strawberries whatever you want 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.720
 and they are totally pancakes 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.400
 healthy I hope you liked it for
