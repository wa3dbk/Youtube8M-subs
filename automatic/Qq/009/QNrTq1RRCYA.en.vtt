00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 hey viewers of minecraft pipa nl 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.560
 today i explain here how you 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.029
 can make creative blocks quickly because 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 as you may already know it is like you 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.480
 A creative profession is also about it 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.889
 takes a long time and that they are so slow 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.139
 is going 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.420
 And yes, knowing a lot is not yet possible 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.650
 know that filter 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.690
 at least you fix a child like that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.550
 had that suddenly you could do things very quickly 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.900
 heel and link how thick that one is 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.900
 time you don't know how you want it done 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 I'm not going very well now how it should be 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.109
 And so I only mind you 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.789
 stupid press three times so I 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.920
 backpack and that and soon goes that works 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.969
 not at all but it is kind of one 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 way it 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.559
 actually distance themselves from the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.210
 block because if you fly close and and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.239
 for example, you start chopping then it takes 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.100
 you also see that importance if you go fast 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.180
 that yes, it skips many blocks 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.489
 just like me 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 doing this then worries he leaves it best 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.390
 lots of blocks left but what you have to do 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.890
 is what I just said distance that goes 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 just fly up with you I'm looking for 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.410
 just a place becomes with your flat 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.969
 like here 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.379
 and then you go now I hold with thumb now 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.359
 pressed to the display if I am not 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.449
 go down so go so well and so 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.790
 immediately a block broken and yes not one 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.170
 block broken and you have to go to that position 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.430
 and if you just stay there really 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.500
 dear 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270
 everything will be chopped very quickly like 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.790
 You see it just gets in a line 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.860
 line chopped and so you can just 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.729
 super fast and for example a mountain road 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.250
 Heels 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.369
 and so it works from above and as 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.090
 you have to do this up close 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.680
 other side must be just so then goes and so 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.329
 so that is not good at this goes 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.280
 very slow and this is going fast 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.950
 so this you did not have a monkey by accident 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.600
 it sometimes pulled very quickly but so 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.820
 must also okay just great 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.369
 just dig a hole in the ground 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.229
 distance down and could have had 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.030
 oh then it goes wrong and then as you see 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.320
 i just straight down and everything 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.600
 being minced under me I don't have to 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.040
 stand still and wait it's going to run 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.659
 Super fast 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.340
 imagine paper building is constructed need 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.140
 of course not live upstairs is also possible 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.670
 the side you will pier building and that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.049
 would you like to get away because it 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.259
 get in the way or you just want to get there 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.659
 no more and what you do then you go too 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.119
 are remote and you just use 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.310
 again the distance and then you see that 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.450
 just have to go very quickly if you 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.009
 a bit too far away then you just have to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.940
 a little more and especially your thumb or 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.610
 finger or whatever you use to 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.960
 just chop down and go mia then 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.280
 just a metaphor and then you can do the 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.290
 bottom piece also where you first chop 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.060
 not with just this is actually 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.940
 just a brief explanation of how to do this 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.500
 does it was really super fast done 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.330
 yes I thank you for watching 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.590
 actually meant more for people who 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.120
 didn't know 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.380
 probably not much alone 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.880
 many have had it once 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.130
 that she could make it very quickly but 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.660
 didn't know how that that is me too 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.070
 found out myself here I am real 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.810
 has been with a little for a long time 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.220
 how to do it 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.750
 and then I think I knew and I came 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.240
 behind it just had to have distance 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.640
 and yes now I am not that good and must 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.470
 hopefully you knew this here now 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.210
 I also thank you for looking 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.590
 I hope this will roll you up 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.850
 for example, a building that is gone 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.200
 can chop away very quickly 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.910
 is just a bit difficult because you up 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.920
 distance from certain blocks 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.060
 it only goes the net they computer 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.680
 just very happy look back a busy 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.210
 that just doesn't work is ours 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.950
 way things quickly forks away 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.230
 maybe not as simple as on the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.370
 computer but can I thank you 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.520
 hopefully i helped you again and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.860
