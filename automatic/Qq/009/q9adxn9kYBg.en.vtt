this<00:00:42.650> lake<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.129> as<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.449> became<00:00:45.229> more

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
this lake and as I became more

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.130 
this lake and as I became more
experienced<00:00:46.129> I<00:00:46.250> started<00:00:46.610> to<00:00:46.729> realize<00:00:47.089> that

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
experienced I started to realize that

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.630 
experienced I started to realize that
the<00:00:48.140> subject<00:00:48.559> matter<00:00:48.589> was<00:00:49.010> less<00:00:49.369> and<00:00:49.549> less

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
the subject matter was less and less

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.340 
the subject matter was less and less
important<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.269> me<00:00:50.390> what<00:00:50.600> was<00:00:50.720> more<00:00:50.869> important

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
important to me what was more important

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.850 
important to me what was more important
was<00:00:51.379> capturing<00:00:52.369> a<00:00:52.670> moment<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:54.229> meant

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
was capturing a moment that meant

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.829 
was capturing a moment that meant
something<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.250> me<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:55.760> think<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.360> that<00:00:56.570> is

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
something to me and I think that that is

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.149 
something to me and I think that that is
one<00:00:57.019> of<00:00:57.049> the<00:00:57.199> first<00:00:57.440> things<00:00:57.650> I<00:00:57.769> started<00:00:57.830> to

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
one of the first things I started to

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.460 
one of the first things I started to
really<00:00:58.339> define<00:00:58.850> my<00:00:59.570> work<00:00:59.839> as<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.049> landscape

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
really define my work as a landscape

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.170 
really define my work as a landscape
photographer<00:01:01.010> as<00:01:01.189> photographers<00:01:01.820> we<00:01:02.000> should

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
photographer as photographers we should

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.299 
photographer as photographers we should
all<00:01:02.269> try<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.839> be<00:01:02.989> artist<00:01:03.530> first<00:01:03.769> which<00:01:04.280> means

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
all try to be artist first which means

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.370 
all try to be artist first which means
that<00:01:04.790> whatever<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.080> you're<00:01:06.200> doing

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
that whatever it is that you're doing

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.450 
that whatever it is that you're doing
with<00:01:06.470> your<00:01:06.500> camera<00:01:06.950> should<00:01:07.130> be<00:01:07.220> something

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
with your camera should be something

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.490 
with your camera should be something
that<00:01:07.490> comes<00:01:07.700> from<00:01:07.850> inside<00:01:08.140> something<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:09.170> is

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
that comes from inside something that is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.230 
that comes from inside something that is
meaningful<00:01:10.250> because<00:01:10.670> that's<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.030> only<00:01:11.150> thing

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
meaningful because that's the only thing

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.120 
meaningful because that's the only thing
that<00:01:11.360> carries<00:01:11.659> you<00:01:11.780> through<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.679> times<00:01:12.920> when

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
that carries you through the times when

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.249 
that carries you through the times when
you're<00:01:13.250> not<00:01:13.340> inspired<00:01:13.759> or<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.689> times<00:01:14.960> where

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
you're not inspired or the times where

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.870 
you're not inspired or the times where
you're<00:01:15.409> not<00:01:15.469> really<00:01:15.530> feeling<00:01:15.950> motivated<00:01:16.250> to

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
you're not really feeling motivated to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.249 
you're not really feeling motivated to
get<00:01:17.030> out<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.329> shoot<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:17.719> think<00:01:18.020> one<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
get out and shoot I think one of the

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.410 
get out and shoot I think one of the
most<00:01:18.409> important<00:01:18.859> things<00:01:19.159> for<00:01:19.280> me<00:01:19.549> as<00:01:20.030> a

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
most important things for me as a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.260 
most important things for me as a
landscape<00:01:20.899> photographer<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.679> how<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.670> approach

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
landscape photographer is how I approach

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.289 
landscape photographer is how I approach
actually<00:01:23.689> taking<00:01:24.649> pictures<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:25.820> comes

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
actually taking pictures and that comes

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.060 
actually taking pictures and that comes
from<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.960> love<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.409> appreciation<00:01:27.469> of<00:01:28.009> nature

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
from a love and appreciation of nature

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.099 
from a love and appreciation of nature
why<00:01:28.549> is<00:01:28.609> it<00:01:28.909> that<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.299> gravitated<00:01:29.810> towards

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
why is it that I gravitated towards

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.389 
why is it that I gravitated towards
landscape<00:01:30.530> photography<00:01:31.039> I<00:01:31.070> think<00:01:31.280> it's

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
landscape photography I think it's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.219 
landscape photography I think it's
because<00:01:31.640> there's<00:01:31.850> something<00:01:31.909> about<00:01:32.630> being<00:01:32.689> in

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
because there's something about being in

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.380 
because there's something about being in
nature<00:01:33.619> that<00:01:33.770> inspires<00:01:34.189> me<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:35.030> makes<00:01:35.299> me

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
nature that inspires me that makes me

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.690 
nature that inspires me that makes me
want<00:01:35.509> to<00:01:35.990> spend<00:01:36.229> as<00:01:36.289> much<00:01:36.409> time<00:01:36.469> as<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.920> can<00:01:37.189> in

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
want to spend as much time as I can in

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.219 
want to spend as much time as I can in
nature<00:01:38.149> regardless<00:01:38.329> of<00:01:38.780> whether<00:01:38.929> I<00:01:38.990> have<00:01:39.200> a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
nature regardless of whether I have a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.410 
nature regardless of whether I have a
camera<00:01:39.679> or<00:01:39.799> not<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.579> camera<00:01:40.999> again<00:01:41.090> just

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
camera or not the camera again just

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.709 
camera or not the camera again just
happens<00:01:41.719> to<00:01:41.780> be<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.409> medium<00:01:42.799> but<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.969> idea<00:01:44.450> of

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
happens to be the medium but the idea of

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.289 
happens to be the medium but the idea of
capturing<00:01:45.079> emotion<00:01:45.950> in<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.700> picture<00:01:47.090> is

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
capturing emotion in a picture is

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.779 
capturing emotion in a picture is
something<00:01:47.689> that<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:48.079> very<00:01:48.829> complex<00:01:49.429> it's

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
something that is very complex it's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.099 
something that is very complex it's
still<00:01:49.969> something<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:50.450> struggling<00:01:50.929> with

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
still something that I'm struggling with

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:52.749 
still something that I'm struggling with
I'm<00:01:51.350> still<00:01:51.469> learning<00:01:51.770> how<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.069> do<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:52.549> when

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
I'm still learning how to do but when

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.669 
I'm still learning how to do but when
you<00:01:52.909> can<00:01:53.090> do<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.810> or<00:01:53.899> catch<00:01:54.079> a<00:01:54.170> glimpse<00:01:54.499> of

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
you can do it or catch a glimpse of

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.520 
you can do it or catch a glimpse of
doing<00:01:55.009> it<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:56.090> me<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.960> essence<00:01:57.319> of

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
doing it that to me is the essence of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.889 
doing it that to me is the essence of
being<00:01:57.590> creative<00:01:58.429> of<00:01:58.549> being<00:01:58.759> an<00:01:58.999> artist<00:01:59.329> so

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
being creative of being an artist so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:00.969 
being creative of being an artist so
what<00:02:00.020> I'm<00:02:00.109> working<00:02:00.350> on<00:02:00.409> here<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:00.799> a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
what I'm working on here is a

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.340 
what I'm working on here is a
composition<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.700> includes<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.450> mountains

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
composition that includes the mountains

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.469 
composition that includes the mountains
in<00:02:03.499> the<00:02:03.530> background<00:02:03.829> here<00:02:04.729> they've<00:02:05.119> got<00:02:05.149> some

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
in the background here they've got some

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.239 
in the background here they've got some
nice<00:02:05.630> curves<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.289> them<00:02:06.439> there's<00:02:06.740> also<00:02:06.889> some

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
nice curves to them there's also some

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.790 
nice curves to them there's also some
nice<00:02:07.369> curves<00:02:07.639> in<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.909> sky<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.539> there's<00:02:09.530> some

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
nice curves in the sky and there's some

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.550 
nice curves in the sky and there's some
beautiful<00:02:10.789> light<00:02:10.940> being<00:02:11.180> filtered<00:02:11.560> down

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
beautiful light being filtered down

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.300 
beautiful light being filtered down
through<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.920> clouds<00:02:13.190> and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
through the clouds and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.250 
through the clouds and
that's<00:02:14.610> creating<00:02:14.970> some<00:02:15.000> specular<00:02:15.930> highlights

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that's creating some specular highlights

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.540 
that's creating some specular highlights
on<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.440> water<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> waters<00:02:17.130> really<00:02:17.280> calm

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
on the water the waters really calm

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.670 
on the water the waters really calm
today<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.840> I'm<00:02:18.960> just<00:02:19.140> trying<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.380> make<00:02:19.530> an

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
today and so I'm just trying to make an

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.950 
today and so I'm just trying to make an
image<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.190> kind<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.910> captures<00:02:21.330> all<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.780> these

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
image that kind of captures all of these

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.320 
image that kind of captures all of these
elements<00:02:22.110> together<00:02:22.380> plus<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> little

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
elements together plus I have a little

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.420 
elements together plus I have a little
bit<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.510> shoreline<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.350> bottom<00:02:25.560> left

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
bit of shoreline here on the bottom left

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.580 
bit of shoreline here on the bottom left
and<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:27.810> time<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.140> right<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.320> get

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
and if I can just time it right and get

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.010 
and if I can just time it right and get
some<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.950> sand<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.520> gives<00:02:29.820> me

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
some of the sand and that gives me

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.170 
some of the sand and that gives me
several<00:02:31.020> elements<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> image<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:32.910> from

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
several elements in the image going from

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.510 
several elements in the image going from
sand<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.660> water<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.980> mountains<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.430> then

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
sand to water to the mountains and then

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.250 
sand to water to the mountains and then
the<00:02:35.610> sky<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.940> top<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.390> always<00:02:36.780> try<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.140> my

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
the sky on top I always try to make my

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.610 
the sky on top I always try to make my
images<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:37.830> multi-layered<00:02:38.610> as<00:02:39.209> possible<00:02:39.870> I'm

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
images as multi-layered as possible I'm

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.670 
images as multi-layered as possible I'm
going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.830> try<00:02:41.010> panoramas<00:02:41.550> here<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.680> just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
going to try panoramas here so just

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.870 
going to try panoramas here so just
going<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.860> make<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.100> couple<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.490> images<00:02:44.850> here

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
going to make a couple of images here

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.680 
going to make a couple of images here
panning<00:02:45.570> from<00:02:45.630> left<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.990> right<00:02:47.030> keeping<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
panning from left to right keeping the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.040 
panning from left to right keeping the
horizon<00:02:49.140> level<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.630> then<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.690> can<00:02:51.840> stitch

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
horizon level and then I can stitch

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.900 
horizon level and then I can stitch
those<00:02:52.230> together<00:02:52.380> afterwards<00:02:53.130> see<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.790> that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
those together afterwards see what that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.850 
those together afterwards see what that
looks<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.260> failure<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.739> those

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
looks like failure is one of those

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.080 
looks like failure is one of those
things<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.280> as<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.489> landscape<00:02:56.970> photographer

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
things that as a landscape photographer

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.650 
things that as a landscape photographer
we<00:02:57.690> become<00:02:58.050> very<00:02:58.770> very<00:02:59.280> familiar<00:02:59.760> with<00:02:59.940> when

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
we become very very familiar with when

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.510 
we become very very familiar with when
you're<00:03:00.780> working<00:03:01.020> with<00:03:01.140> Mother<00:03:01.320> Nature<00:03:01.520> you

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
you're working with Mother Nature you

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.830 
you're working with Mother Nature you
never<00:03:02.730> know<00:03:02.850> what's<00:03:03.000> what's<00:03:03.330> going<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.510> happen

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
never know what's what's going to happen

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.100 
never know what's what's going to happen
and<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.739> easy<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.550> get<00:03:05.730> frustrated<00:03:06.600> it's

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
and so it's easy to get frustrated it's

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.410 
and so it's easy to get frustrated it's
easy<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.739> kind<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.220> lose<00:03:08.489> faith<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.120> lose

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
easy to kind of lose faith and lose

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.330 
easy to kind of lose faith and lose
confidence<00:03:09.660> because<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.380> feel<00:03:10.620> as<00:03:10.830> though<00:03:11.070> no

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
confidence because you feel as though no

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.770 
confidence because you feel as though no
matter<00:03:11.489> how<00:03:11.640> much<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.940> try<00:03:12.120> you're<00:03:12.450> not<00:03:12.660> able

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
matter how much you try you're not able

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.210 
matter how much you try you're not able
to<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.200> capture<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.800> image<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.100> you

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
to really capture the image that you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.430 
to really capture the image that you
want<00:03:14.250> or<00:03:14.640> things<00:03:15.000> don't<00:03:15.090> quite<00:03:15.360> work<00:03:16.200> out<00:03:16.380> for

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
want or things don't quite work out for

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.030 
want or things don't quite work out for
you<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.970> actual<00:03:19.010> problem<00:03:20.010> that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
you and it was this actual problem that

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.440 
you and it was this actual problem that
I<00:03:20.160> was<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.489> through<00:03:20.640> where<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.030> discovered

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
I was going through where I discovered

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.360 
I was going through where I discovered
that<00:03:21.720> maybe<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.290> should<00:03:22.530> try<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.830> focus<00:03:23.070> on

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
that maybe I should try to focus on

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.100 
that maybe I should try to focus on
familiar<00:03:23.730> landscapes<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.360> then<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.720> can

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
familiar landscapes because then I can

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.039 
familiar landscapes because then I can
focus<00:03:25.709> less<00:03:25.980> on<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.730> subject<00:03:27.209> less<00:03:27.600> on<00:03:27.870> the

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
focus less on the subject less on the

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.170 
focus less on the subject less on the
actual<00:03:28.350> place<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> more<00:03:29.340> on<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.850> things<00:03:30.060> that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
actual place and more on the things that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.610 
actual place and more on the things that
inspired<00:03:30.660> me<00:03:30.870> about<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.350> particular

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
inspired me about that particular

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.039 
inspired me about that particular
location<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:32.970> going<00:03:33.360> back<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> same

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
location and so going back to the same

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.810 
location and so going back to the same
locations<00:03:34.530> means<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.040> become<00:03:35.400> familiar

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
locations means that I become familiar

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.310 
locations means that I become familiar
with<00:03:35.970> them<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.180> see<00:03:36.630> them<00:03:36.780> in<00:03:36.930> different

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
with them I see them in different

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.930 
with them I see them in different
weather<00:03:37.590> different<00:03:37.920> conditions<00:03:38.820> different

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
weather different conditions different

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.300 
weather different conditions different
time<00:03:39.360> of<00:03:39.390> day<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:40.049> allows<00:03:40.440> me<00:03:40.590> to<00:03:40.620> get<00:03:40.799> luckier

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
time of day it allows me to get luckier

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.370 
time of day it allows me to get luckier
and<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.700> lot<00:03:41.850> easier<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.269> mean<00:03:42.480> we<00:03:42.570> all<00:03:42.720> hear<00:03:43.200> oh

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
and a lot easier I mean we all hear oh

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.590 
and a lot easier I mean we all hear oh
he<00:03:44.100> got<00:03:44.220> lucky<00:03:44.430> with<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> shot<00:03:44.940> but<00:03:45.180> yeah<00:03:45.420> in

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
he got lucky with a shot but yeah in

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.150 
he got lucky with a shot but yeah in
fact<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.200> go<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.530> same<00:03:46.680> place<00:03:46.950> over

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
fact if you go to the same place over

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.340 
fact if you go to the same place over
and<00:03:47.459> over<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.700> over<00:03:47.790> again<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.930> learn

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
and over and over again and you learn

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.350 
and over and over again and you learn
where<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.250> light<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.549> at<00:03:50.700> different<00:03:50.970> times<00:03:51.180> of

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
where the light is at different times of

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.390 
where the light is at different times of
the<00:03:51.510> year<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.810> learn<00:03:52.320> how<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.890> weather

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
the year you learn how the weather

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.310 
the year you learn how the weather
changes<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.480> learn<00:03:54.630> how<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.930> looks<00:03:55.140> at

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
changes you learn how it looks at

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.140 
changes you learn how it looks at
different<00:03:55.590> times<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.920> day<00:03:55.980> then<00:03:56.850> it's<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.060> lot

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
different times of day then it's a lot

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.819 
different times of day then it's a lot
easier<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.390> get<00:03:57.510> lucky<00:03:57.750> because<00:03:58.049> when<00:03:58.590> you

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
easier to get lucky because when you

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.560 
easier to get lucky because when you
have<00:03:59.040> beautiful<00:03:59.670> conditions<00:04:00.120> then<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.450> know

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
have beautiful conditions then you know

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.780 
have beautiful conditions then you know
exactly<00:04:01.019> where<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.799> position<00:04:02.250> yourself<00:04:02.579> or

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
exactly where to position yourself or

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.789 
exactly where to position yourself or
where<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.030> go<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.900> get<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.230> picture<00:04:04.500> that

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
where to go to get that picture that

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.500 
where to go to get that picture that
allows<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.610> share<00:04:05.790> with<00:04:06.209> others<00:04:06.480> what

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
allows you to share with others what

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.390 
allows you to share with others what
inspired<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.380> as<00:04:07.500> an<00:04:07.709> example<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.340> this

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
inspired you as an example just this

inspired you as an example just this
morning<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.940> got<00:04:09.450> up<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.900> noticed<00:04:10.320> that

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
morning I got up and I noticed that

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.870 
morning I got up and I noticed that
there<00:04:10.590> was<00:04:10.799> some<00:04:11.340> interesting<00:04:11.549> weather

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
there was some interesting weather

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.069 
there was some interesting weather
happening<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.420> said<00:04:12.600> hey<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.720> want<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.019> go

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.600 
happening and I said hey I want to go
down<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.440> spot<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:13.920> know<00:04:14.010> up<00:04:14.370> a

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
down to the spot that I know up a

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.580 
down to the spot that I know up a
mountain<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.180> had<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.420> do<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> little<00:04:15.720> hiking<00:04:15.900> but

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
mountain I had to do a little hiking but

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.080 
mountain I had to do a little hiking but
once<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.859> got<00:04:17.010> there<00:04:17.220> while<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.459> got<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.910> top

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
once I got there while I got to the top

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.789 
once I got there while I got to the top
and<00:04:18.299> as<00:04:18.540> soon<00:04:18.690> as<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.900> got<00:04:19.079> there<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.320> knew<00:04:19.560> that

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
and as soon as I got there I knew that

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.469 
and as soon as I got there I knew that
this<00:04:19.919> was<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.100> kind<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.489> special<00:04:20.820> moment<00:04:20.910> I'd

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
this was a kind of a special moment I'd

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.089 
this was a kind of a special moment I'd
have<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.840> think<00:04:21.989> too<00:04:22.229> much<00:04:22.380> about<00:04:22.440> okay<00:04:22.890> where

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
have to think too much about okay where

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.160 
have to think too much about okay where
do<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.250> go<00:04:23.460> because<00:04:23.700> I

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
do I go because I

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.690 
do I go because I
you<00:04:24.260> kind<00:04:25.040> of<00:04:25.130> where<00:04:25.370> would<00:04:25.490> be<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.610> best

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
you kind of where would be the best

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.400 
you kind of where would be the best
angle<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:26.300> best<00:04:26.480> place<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.750> get<00:04:27.050> my<00:04:27.200> camera

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
angle the best place to get my camera

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.110 
angle the best place to get my camera
even<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.070> best<00:04:28.220> focal<00:04:28.580> length<00:04:28.760> those<00:04:28.970> are

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
even the best focal length those are

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.520 
even the best focal length those are
things<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.420> you<00:04:29.570> kind<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.870> learn<00:04:30.050> over<00:04:30.320> time

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
things that you kind of learn over time

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.860 
things that you kind of learn over time
why<00:04:31.250> because<00:04:31.700> I've<00:04:31.880> used<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.300> wrong<00:04:32.480> focal

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
why because I've used the wrong focal

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.570 
why because I've used the wrong focal
length<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:33.080> many<00:04:33.380> times<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.980> now<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.190> kind<00:04:34.520> of

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
length so many times that now I kind of

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.040 
length so many times that now I kind of
know<00:04:34.640> okay<00:04:34.940> here's<00:04:35.180> where<00:04:35.420> I<00:04:35.480> need<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.810> stay

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
know okay here's where I need to stay

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.800 
know okay here's where I need to stay
and<00:04:36.860> that's<00:04:37.070> just<00:04:37.340> as<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.520> principle<00:04:38.240> again<00:04:38.780> I

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
and that's just as a principle again I

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.770 
and that's just as a principle again I
think<00:04:39.050> being<00:04:39.410> open<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:40.310> exploration<00:04:40.730> is<00:04:41.270> the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
think being open to exploration is the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.690 
think being open to exploration is the
most<00:04:41.990> important<00:04:42.380> thing<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:42.890> there<00:04:43.670> are

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
most important thing and so there are

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.450 
most important thing and so there are
many<00:04:43.910> rules<00:04:44.270> but<00:04:44.630> as<00:04:44.810> they<00:04:45.590> say<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:45.890> have<00:04:46.250> to

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
many rules but as they say you have to

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.980 
many rules but as they say you have to
have<00:04:46.940> rules<00:04:47.210> in<00:04:47.420> order<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:47.630> break<00:04:47.810> them

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
have rules in order to break them

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.780 
have rules in order to break them
whereas<00:04:48.350> Twyla<00:04:48.890> Tharp's<00:04:49.250> says<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.520> have<00:04:49.640> to

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
whereas Twyla Tharp's says you have to

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.210 
whereas Twyla Tharp's says you have to
have<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:50.120> box<00:04:50.450> to<00:04:51.200> be<00:04:51.350> able<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.710> think<00:04:52.010> outside

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
have a box to be able to think outside

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.370 
have a box to be able to think outside
the<00:04:52.520> box<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:53.270> learning<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.840> rules<00:04:54.050> first

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
the box and so learning the rules first

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.680 
the box and so learning the rules first
then<00:04:55.370> being<00:04:55.730> able<00:04:55.850> to<00:04:55.970> go<00:04:56.150> outside<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.480> them

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
then being able to go outside of them

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.540 
then being able to go outside of them
gives<00:04:57.080> you<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.230> reason<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.650> do<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.800> one<00:04:58.400> of<00:04:58.490> the

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
gives you a reason to do that one of the

gives you a reason to do that one of the

what I call the 4 a.m. filter and that

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.290 
what I call the 4 a.m. filter and that

at the end of of the day everything in a
picture<00:05:25.070> is<00:05:25.130> important<00:05:25.550> everything<00:05:26.360> so<00:05:26.810> even

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
picture is important everything so even

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.450 
picture is important everything so even
if<00:05:27.140> you<00:05:27.200> have<00:05:27.320> this<00:05:27.410> beautiful<00:05:27.650> band<00:05:28.100> of<00:05:28.250> color

all<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.280> way<00:05:31.370> to<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.610> edges<00:05:31.760> so<00:05:32.420> you<00:05:32.480> just

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
all the way to the edges so you just

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.540 
all the way to the edges so you just
can't<00:05:32.930> say<00:05:33.110> well<00:05:33.290> no<00:05:34.100> one's<00:05:34.250> gonna<00:05:34.340> pay

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
can't say well no one's gonna pay

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.470 
can't say well no one's gonna pay
attention<00:05:34.580> this<00:05:34.940> up<00:05:35.030> here<00:05:35.150> because<00:05:35.390> the

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
attention this up here because the

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.510 
attention this up here because the
center<00:05:35.750> so<00:05:35.960> great<00:05:36.200> no<00:05:36.590> it<00:05:36.800> has<00:05:36.980> to<00:05:37.160> work<00:05:37.280> all

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
center so great no it has to work all

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.550 
center so great no it has to work all
together<00:05:37.670> the<00:05:38.480> dilemma<00:05:38.840> I<00:05:38.930> have<00:05:39.170> were<00:05:39.380> the

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
together the dilemma I have were the

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.990 
together the dilemma I have were the
what<00:05:39.800> I<00:05:39.830> would<00:05:40.040> do<00:05:40.130> is<00:05:40.190> I<00:05:40.250> would<00:05:40.280> wait<00:05:40.640> until<00:05:40.970> I

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
what I would do is I would wait until I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.840 
what I would do is I would wait until I
could<00:05:41.120> have<00:05:41.450> something<00:05:41.990> in<00:05:42.200> there<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:43.370> added

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
could have something in there that added

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.300 
could have something in there that added
to<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.000> picture<00:05:44.240> and<00:05:44.950> given<00:05:45.950> that<00:05:46.130> it's

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
to the picture and given that it's

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.720 
to the picture and given that it's
reflecting<00:05:47.180> off<00:05:47.750> of<00:05:48.230> the<00:05:48.620> water<00:05:48.890> now<00:05:49.400> you<00:05:49.460> have

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
reflecting off of the water now you have

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.460 
reflecting off of the water now you have
that<00:05:49.940> multiplied<00:05:50.690> by<00:05:50.870> two<00:05:50.930> like<00:05:51.260> you<00:05:51.350> have

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
that multiplied by two like you have

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.870 
that multiplied by two like you have
dead<00:05:51.740> space<00:05:51.980> on<00:05:52.130> top<00:05:52.280> and<00:05:52.460> bottom

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
dead space on top and bottom

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.630 
dead space on top and bottom
I<00:05:52.910> would<00:05:53.150> like<00:05:53.360> let's<00:05:54.230> say<00:05:54.470> a<00:05:54.740> little<00:05:55.430> more

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
I would like let's say a little more

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.580 
I would like let's say a little more
texture<00:05:56.060> in<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.300> clouds<00:05:56.510> up<00:05:56.750> there<00:05:56.780> some<00:05:57.440> more

than<00:06:10.680> his<00:06:10.800> actual<00:06:10.980> work<00:06:11.430> was<00:06:11.700> the<00:06:11.820> fact<00:06:12.000> that

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
than his actual work was the fact that

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.850 
than his actual work was the fact that
he<00:06:12.180> was<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.360> master<00:06:12.810> print<00:06:13.050> maker<00:06:13.260> and<00:06:13.560> the

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
he was a master print maker and the

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.760 
he was a master print maker and the
prints<00:06:14.190> were<00:06:14.790> what<00:06:15.120> he<00:06:15.540> was<00:06:15.720> after<00:06:16.200> that's

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
prints were what he was after that's

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.740 
prints were what he was after that's
kind<00:06:17.040> of<00:06:17.130> defined<00:06:17.490> him<00:06:17.760> as<00:06:17.970> an<00:06:18.180> artist<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.690> so

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
kind of defined him as an artist and so

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.270

something<00:06:55.680> that's<00:06:55.950> lacking<00:06:56.190> there<00:06:56.640> it's<00:06:56.850> it's

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
something that's lacking there it's it's

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.180 
something that's lacking there it's it's
a<00:06:57.420> little<00:06:57.630> bit<00:06:57.750> too<00:06:57.960> zeros<00:06:58.530> and<00:06:58.650> ones<00:06:58.800> and

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
a little bit too zeros and ones and

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.290 
a little bit too zeros and ones and
doesn't<00:06:59.460> have<00:06:59.550> actually<00:06:59.880> have<00:07:00.030> something
