 there is no machine light but the refrigerator 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:42.840
 still working so do not let 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.940
 the open refrigerator so that the

 external parts of the machine must be 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.770
 clean with fabric and water 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.710
 only very soft cleaning agents 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.690

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.990
 full semi milk 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.450
 pasteurized is an option but the quality 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.390
 the foam will be less stable 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.700

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.820
 been frozen 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.560

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.330
