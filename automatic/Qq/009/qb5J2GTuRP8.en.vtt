00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:12.520 
have bluing olive superfine dubbing but
I'm<00:03:04.500> going<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:07.099> spend<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.480> very<00:03:09.480> thin<00:03:09.989> noodle

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.899 

it's<00:03:13.530> pretty<00:03:13.799> easy<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.249> the<00:03:14.370> superfine

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
it's pretty easy with the superfine

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.589 
it's pretty easy with the superfine
because<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.419> stretches<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.180> stretch<00:03:18.569> it

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
because it stretches you can stretch it

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:25.280 
because it stretches you can stretch it
out<00:03:18.810> pretty<00:03:19.019> far<00:03:23.510> ok<00:03:24.510> now<00:03:24.629> I'm<00:03:24.780> going<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.169> go
