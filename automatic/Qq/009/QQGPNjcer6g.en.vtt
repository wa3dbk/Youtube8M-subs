do we assess popularity well basically
if<00:03:14.310> we're<00:03:14.940> comparing<00:03:15.330> two<00:03:15.660> web<00:03:15.900> pages<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
if we're comparing two web pages and the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.370 
if we're comparing two web pages and the
first<00:03:17.549> has<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> number<00:03:18.329> of<00:03:18.450> incoming<00:03:18.989> links<00:03:19.260> or

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.770 
backlinks and the second has none then
we'd<00:03:22.530> say<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.859> first<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.519> more<00:03:24.030> popular<00:03:24.600> or
