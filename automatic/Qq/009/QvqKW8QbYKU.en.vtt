it's<00:03:40.409> when<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.799> were<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.040> great<00:03:41.220> dark<00:03:41.519> spot

it's when you were the great dark spot

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.080 
it's when you were the great dark spot
it's<00:03:42.380> revolution<00:03:43.070> that's<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.400> longest<00:03:43.820> ear

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
it's revolution that's the longest ear

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.410 
it's revolution that's the longest ear
