because we've got cavity give the knife

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.930 
because we've got cavity give the knife
a<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.129> bit<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> clean<00:00:41.550> off

hair closes and session or have how deep
should<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> incision<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> get<00:00:52.860> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
should the incision be just to get it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619 
should the incision be just to get it
going<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.879> start<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> can

like to leave my fish in the fridge
overnight<00:01:09.299> before<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> did<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> sit

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
overnight before I did this just to sit

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.740 
overnight before I did this just to sit
the<00:01:10.830> flesh<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.540> want<00:01:12.689> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the flesh of it but because we want to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.950 
the flesh of it but because we want to

assuming that it's really not not going
to<00:01:20.400> happen<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.530> avoid<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.070> part

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to happen so then just avoid this part

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.210 
to happen so then just avoid this part
there<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.670> some<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:24.000> meat<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.210> here<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.650> it's

just a pain in the ass with the with the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.850 
just a pain in the ass with the with the
ribcage<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:30.030> cut<00:01:30.240> around<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.840> omits<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
ribcage so just cut around it omits the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.609 
ribcage so just cut around it omits the
rough<00:01:32.729> Phillip<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> scales<00:01:33.600> mean<00:01:33.930> so
