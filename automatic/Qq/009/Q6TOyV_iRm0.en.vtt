risotto perhaps or something like that
that<00:03:36.519> truffle<00:03:36.940> adds<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.079> much<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> it

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
that truffle adds so much to it

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.770 
that truffle adds so much to it
however<00:03:39.130> they<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.670> changed<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.420> recipe<00:03:40.750> a

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
however they have changed the recipe a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.390 
however they have changed the recipe a
bit<00:03:40.989> from<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.290> traditional<00:03:41.799> pecorino

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
bit from a traditional pecorino

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.060 
bit from a traditional pecorino
obviously<00:03:42.880> by<00:03:43.000> adding<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.959> truffles<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.560> yet

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
obviously by adding the truffles and yet

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.300 
obviously by adding the truffles and yet
it<00:03:45.280> has<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.760> wonderful<00:03:46.090> fragrance<00:03:46.540> and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
it has a wonderful fragrance and

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.770 
it has a wonderful fragrance and
distinctness<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:48.970> so<00:03:49.120> all<00:03:49.150> four<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.630> these

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
distinctness to it so all four of these

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.430 
distinctness to it so all four of these
