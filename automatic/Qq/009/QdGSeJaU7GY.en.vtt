00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.180

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.500
 new live complete here on my channel 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.150
 again if I go games like I said 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.730
 we nice blackops two games we go 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.220
 multi team pill conform play on muslims 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.080
 And that means we have almost no one 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.760
 I think I can pick up a doctor 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.100
 you play multi team 3 against 3 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.720
 3 9 men in total and I think if you 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.250
 a dock tap wants to go grab that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.590
 immediately in enemy after state or the nanny 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.390
 mina's building and so immediately kill you a 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.680
 steal in the gates with jesse and russians 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.970
 rest charpak pain 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.440
 I was not against fx and she recognized 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.059

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.530
 wife and I are basically suits right away 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.030
 the other team I park this right away 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.989
 team that on this side exciting you spawn 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.550
 namely here 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.870
 saw an already under house day let him that 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.850
 but I try this one nice 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.590
 I'll grab hold love which doc.txt yet 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.730
 pact only i will put that car in a flop 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.469
 so i lay my own the that i like 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.270
 to but not at his age on 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.190
 loft that is how we do it and it was still normal 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.450
 catch that kill but I actually had 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.890
 just have to wait a while in the back 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.850
 but you can never estimate it or quickly 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.530
 keep tensing 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.879
 that they are immediately in another place 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.080
 go tension video click on tackle that 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.800
 would return to be its a 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.229
 emmy 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.820
 use the msm cm at ciber camel and vest 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.259
 good on I have lightweight flack 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.580
 jacket sevender anyway so and 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.770
 dexterity of stench 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.940
 He stands behind Atalia Allah 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.229
 him too , they also came in again 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.179
 my back but I was standing too long 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.950
 now wait the 10 degree we are used to 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.119
 nice spans red arrow as would 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.890
 I think it can continue 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.319
 good because then it will all be fine 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.569
 only decamp there you just have to total 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.440
 we are normal fit again is not parents 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.229
 6 tiel 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.459
 then I say well that is not convenient 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.459
 say hello ok doctor 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:38.380
 wiltec and nme every heli just shoots too 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.759
 the book job resolution at reasonable 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.319
 two good enemies with a golden clan 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.090
 tag and so come just ship cloth 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.500
 and that other team pointed out my design 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.179
 ethan's house was in stalking again 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.440
 met orbital and stay as normal 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.670
 exciting black we then have to 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.899
 well then we can just release 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.729
 who also keep it in the air 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.200
 so go nice now I just play normally 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.580
 pay attention now that we are not out 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.380
 the dead grass again like me just twice 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.970
 Had 3 times 4 times because there are 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.649
 just dumb distill a dumbbell neck 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.270
 from share to bring our die and then 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.470
 are you still going to be able to die by being able to 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.970
 there dead and then you have to be there for a while 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.200
 new ones and a packet 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.610
 completely the other side of the folders 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.989
 then you no longer go to that place 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.190
 So now runs just stay in this side 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.050
 from the mat loop it drove back and forth 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.010
 back and forth the spawners of suffering tea 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.270
 for your point 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.530
 see for pill there and so it should 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.300
 just keep it that way all the time 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.950
 picking up passage of in-dock signs for 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.900
 the extra 100 points per child if 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.370
 we get 50 points doctor headland 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.750
 again at once and won 100 senior 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.430
 inside and that's how it should go 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.720
 as we are now from players and escort robin 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.280
 it can not stand still you pieterse 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.290
 I still do n't call in he is waiting for the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.880
 impey way is very pts quadroon 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.260
 is Jews roping ground down and then going 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.820
 we simply get angry about so must 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.960
 know it go now good i go 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.950
 no longer on the other side of that man 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.330
 flew because I just died 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.950
 and if I walk it again now 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.360
 I feel like I'm still dying there 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.860
 I stay nice on this side of the map 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.540
 walk think a good one 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.310
 decision is because if we go to one again 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.810
 thing ready to go and I'm going to be dead than 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.220
 I also forgive myself never more so 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.090
 how nice that side are this side 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.320
 I also like that 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.790
 does not really matter which side of the 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.620
 Mattie dominates if you just have one 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.239
 side of the map dominates or you come 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.830
 down this folder is dominated other 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.270
 side of the folder it is both precise 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.590
 the same and all plays precisely 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.880
 the same thing only you just walk one 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.200
 other routiq you 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.750
 and so it doesn't stop either 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.970
 where you should as long as you are just fine 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.470
 keep paying attention and pay attention when paying attention 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.730
 where the one to be span I play multi 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.560
 team and multi team is a whole 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.730
 easy games but again a whole 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.200
 difficult game fashion because they are literal 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.880
 can stretch anywhere they can 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.410
 spring fair behind you 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.120
 klasje exciting there exciting there 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.290
 voltage is now also on my mini-map 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.700
 trusses now just another one behind me 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.140
 so the customer will be one for it again immediately 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.980
 people are panning there again 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.840
 so you have to stay there very well 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.190
 watch out in multi but otherwise tel 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.269
 just really a super chille also emote 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.590
 to play in 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.299
 if the and who is also not race we put 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.010
 that's just the disadvantage of multi 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.330
 team if you are also a deaf it is in the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.070
 air in look that they immediately rose white 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.750
 have a new orbital in the air 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.489
 and this is how it should stay 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.950
 persevere and then we just grab them 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.959
 Hard here is grown film also makes 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.299
 well the doctor's suitcase the extra dots we 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.549
 now just have 38100 score men 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.140
 it's really beast and I see it me 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.549
 ben van has those spans check them 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.370
 span did it again in infamous planet 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.870
 again in exactly the same place and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.489
 so I actually wait for them 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.890
 just up until they tighten there again 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.880
 wouldn't really wait but of course 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.560
 I don't want that anymore but I want 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.329
 sadness in itself it is not really over 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.100
 wait because they can just 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.900
 easy popping just so simply 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.340
 just not because they don't expect that 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.110
 as a tension that will be there again immediately 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.850
 one of them is 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.959
 wait for this good again so edgy 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.329
 nice than I was waiting for that death 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.769
 went to meteor picks and so as beautiful 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.269
 I do not do it themselves all the 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.799
 doctor's grab a lot of extra 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.570
 Features that came with are free point 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.130
 actually just that toptex is picked up 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.810
 they always handy red lion 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.130
 yellow that can't you can the two joyce 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.780
 at the same time have a pretty not nice one 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.160
 boys come lord edgar's in him 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.630
 why can't you just have 20th joyce 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.460
 at the same time the nobody that it much 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.390
 easier than you can really go ps like 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.360
 i20 of those things in the air 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.460
 can at the same time 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.900
 man or 20 things on the floor at the same time 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.360
 because its no fly killstreak there 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.770
 his ground killstreaks 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.909
 you can do it again with new s cotone 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.930
 just in the air is your show 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.979
 hanging out there 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.270
 I think it's best if you have anything 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.229
 kills boy come on you can also do one 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.490
 chilly 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.099
 kelly basket with the double kill achieved 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.150
 come on buddy another kind you ever so 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.979
 just have to go i think it is real 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.479
 always nice pots because actually hoof 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.590
 another moment to pay attention to 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.150
 because of course you also or it is 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.710
 it caught in the air but you have to 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.090
 of course keep paying attention and there 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.919
 the jar is just back on 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.490
 you can't do much for a game that fast 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.569
 34 to 334 suitcases and 34 kills is each 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.639
 I also have the kill I made 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.050
 shortened immediately and it is that easy 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.240
 actually just go into multi team 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.680
 Unfortunately, you cannot reduce the film 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.150
 really easy we stretch the jar 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.469
 of course if you are allowed once again 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.330
 just not a not picking up on time 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:22.099
 because the sparkle thing is just like that 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.509
 it's really easy just to make it 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.340
 a multi 10 pots and just play 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.960
 is called the spice we keep checking 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.279
 pain that this is my one side of the folder me 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.810
 walked on that side of the folder 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.060
 and you know the other person again 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.110
 just look jesse lee deep into something 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.699
 the middle of the folder and we 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.889
 checked rinsing clean 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.750
