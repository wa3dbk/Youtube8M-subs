would probably be a Hornet queen and
some<00:01:05.189> type<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> weird<00:01:06.000> genki<00:01:06.570> deck<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.110> yes

as soon as turn for attacking and you

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010 
as soon as turn for attacking and you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
hard I like it a lot as a speculation I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.969 
hard I like it a lot as a speculation I
don't<00:02:00.689> feel<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:00.990> any<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> cartage<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
don't feel like any of the cartage of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.020 
don't feel like any of the cartage of
really<00:02:02.340> were<00:02:02.549> speculating<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:04.130> non<00:02:05.130> foils<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
really were speculating as non foils I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.949 
really were speculating as non foils I
feel<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.140> foil<00:02:07.560> yes<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.429> go

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
feel like as a foil yes I would go

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.050 
feel like as a foil yes I would go
probably<00:02:09.959> 10<00:02:10.379> 20<00:02:11.039> copies<00:02:11.280> at

I know I'm trying to figure out which of
the<00:02:15.360> Collins<00:02:16.140> &amp;<00:02:16.410> Dragons<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.040> want<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.340> go<00:02:17.459> deep

the Collins &amp; Dragons I want to go deep

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
the Collins &amp; Dragons I want to go deep
into<00:02:18.239> because<00:02:19.050> I'm<00:02:19.230> probably<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:19.890> going<00:02:20.099> to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
into because I'm probably not going to

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.280 
into because I'm probably not going to
spend<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.580> much<00:02:20.760> money<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.270> deep<00:02:22.110> into

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
spend that much money and go deep into

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.540 
spend that much money and go deep into
more<00:02:22.560> than<00:02:22.739> one<00:02:22.770> dragon<00:02:23.459> maybe<00:02:24.090> not<00:02:24.360> even<00:02:24.390> like

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
more than one dragon maybe not even like

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.370 
more than one dragon maybe not even like
one<00:02:26.550> dragon<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.209> con<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.930> would<00:02:28.080> much<00:02:28.319> rather

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
one dragon or con I would much rather

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.530 
one dragon or con I would much rather
prefer<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.220> go<00:02:29.310> deep<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.390> way<00:02:30.510> I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
prefer to go deep in one that way I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.420 
prefer to go deep in one that way I
don't<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.959> track<00:02:31.170> at<00:02:31.349> them<00:02:31.470> all<00:02:31.620> but

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430

don't have the track at them all but
Lisa<00:02:32.700> I'm<00:02:33.150> looking<00:02:33.569> at<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.099> she's<00:02:35.099> right

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
Lisa I'm looking at it and she's right

Lisa I'm looking at it and she's right
now<00:02:35.519> d<00:02:35.580> strong<00:02:35.970> favorite<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.690> feel<00:02:37.080> her<00:02:37.260> price

so<00:02:49.319> this<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.709> card<00:02:50.069> i<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.580> i<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> card

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
so this is a card i like i like the card

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.360 
so this is a card i like i like the card
a<00:02:51.420> lot<00:02:51.569> but<00:02:52.350> i<00:02:52.530> want<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:52.830> see<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.220> happens

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
a lot but i want to see what happens

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.330 
a lot but i want to see what happens
with<00:02:53.819> it<00:02:54.000> especially<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.900> foils<00:02:55.410> very<00:02:56.100> good

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
with it especially the foils very good

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.430 
with it especially the foils very good
in<00:02:56.489> tiny<00:02:56.760> leaders<00:02:57.209> should<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.170> next

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
in tiny leaders should that be the next

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.589 
in tiny leaders should that be the next
EDH<00:02:58.860> format<00:02:59.310> that's<00:02:59.549> what<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.910> gotta<00:03:00.120> look<00:03:00.390> at

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
EDH format that's what you gotta look at

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.380 
EDH format that's what you gotta look at
yeah<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.049> look<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.380> her<00:03:01.530> color<00:03:01.799> sees<00:03:02.099> mar<00:03:02.400> do<00:03:02.640> mar

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
yeah I look at her color sees mar do mar

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.089 
yeah I look at her color sees mar do mar
do<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> very<00:03:04.140> interesting<00:03:04.410> color<00:03:04.830> set

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
do is a very interesting color set

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.830 
do is a very interesting color set
because<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.060> doesn't<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.569> many

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
because it doesn't have that many

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.100 
because it doesn't have that many
legendary<00:03:07.380> creatures<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:09.750> doesn't<00:03:10.019> have

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
legendary creatures and it doesn't have

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.460 
legendary creatures and it doesn't have
that<00:03:10.200> many<00:03:10.349> legendary<00:03:11.030> tiny<00:03:12.030> leaders<00:03:12.540> so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
that many legendary tiny leaders so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
that many legendary tiny leaders so
that's<00:03:13.950> why<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.370> foil<00:03:14.910> version<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.630> is

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
that's why a foil version of this is

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.210 
that's why a foil version of this is
very<00:03:16.470> interesting

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.280 

I
