00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.700
 ah 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.880
 here 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.460
 now kids here freedom in all 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.350
 again again and in this little 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.200
 video I will show you how to 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.920
 select with photoshop by colors 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.810
 without killing us well but of a small 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.540
 image in photoshop is worth several 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.919
 colors as you can see and now what 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.899
 I would like to do is select by 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:36.350
 example the greens or the yellows or the 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:39.379
 blue but without using neither the wand nor 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.739
 nor the polygonal tie how it should be 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.960
 do this then we would go to selection 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.660
 to the range of colors 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 and here they fix select sampled 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.120
 OK 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.360
 select sampled and directly 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.670
 we go with him 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.200
 with the count drops towards the color that 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.580
 we want to select for example the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.290
 yellow 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.239
 boix here, the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.000
 yellows 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.470
 and we give him ok now as you see he has already 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.050
 selected what acted the yellows 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.310
 'skyline' the picture of agreement now 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.440
 when this selection then we can 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.200
 do what we want 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.300
 for example we could change it color 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.210
 with control 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.560
 which is the saturation tone we could 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.560
 give coloring for example 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.580
 putting the color that we want 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.620
 in agreement 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.620
 for example red 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.820
 for example let's make another change 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.780
 selection of colors and this time I'm going 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.220
 to change then 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:54.060
 the blue ones we select the blue one and 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.310
 mark here ok have been selected 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 control 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.380
 this is not saturation but without control 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.180
 you can also go to the picture settings 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.459
 Saturation tone is what you can change 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.630
 the color according to what you have 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.380
 selected as you see 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.130
 to 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.130
 change the tone 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.990
 for example I will let it be in 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.120
 orange 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.730
 with more than selected control 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.220
 you know nothing 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.930
 This is a 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.550
 There are other tools to do 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.990
 substitutions of colors also but 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.510
 more than anything is he wanted to teach how 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.340
 select by colors 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.380
 as you see it is quite simple 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.200
 remember to like him if he has 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.170
 liked if it has helped you and subscribe to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340

 to make more videos about how 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.340
 select with the pen and other 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.360
 according tactics as it may go well 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.360
