00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.869
 the art of cutting three components 1 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:37.110
 good knife second experience and third sharp 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:39.629
 our eye clipping consists of two 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.719
 parts here is the main part and this one 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.820
 head first thing we take off head with 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.059
 the main tenderloin knife for this i will take 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.760
 soft for phillip fiber separated 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.170
 on connection again here we have separated 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 I will clean up my head first 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.460
 You can remove this film and take it off 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.390
 veins 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.750
 such precise movements 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.049
 sharp also I clean the head we remove 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.200
 we ended up with a film 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.299
 I can split it in half so that later 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.540
 it was not easier to work with her I will do 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.540
 cut from steaks cut off unnecessary part 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.930
 Here I have a smooth piece turned out 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.229
 now a little trick 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.159
 so that we have steaks even I 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.369
 I'll wrap up 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.829
 cutting into the film's tight tight 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.579
 wrap up here I got this 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.770
 sausage 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.020
 I will cut this sausage into 4 steaks 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.700
 let's say 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.450
 here in half still in half and more about 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.579
 I have turned out so round 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.229
 beautiful steaks and fry them need on 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.060
 pan not like this but 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.579
 across the fibers I still have 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.149
 head from the head can do another 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.789
 steak here's another steak from our heads 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.170
 turned out to be tall we have difficult 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.969
 be 45 centimeters 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.789
 the rest of the pieces we can cut into 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.920
 beef stroganoff as I like it 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.910
 now show you with an example this is something 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.060
 type by. 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.970
 ready to beef stroganoff here I 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.720
 I cut it along the fibers of such thickness 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.260
 somewhere 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.370
 05 is a bit thicker which is important when we cut and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.640
 any meat 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.480
 the bars here it turned out we have a bar 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.209
 it needs to be cut across the fibers for 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.090
 to make money very well here 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.459
 the fibers diverge from the remaining meat 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.310
 you can make carpaccio put in the film 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.030
 tightly wrap cut off a little bit 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.850
 leave the film will explain what we are doing 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.720
 how candy wrap the edges turn down 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.299
 we put the edges on the film 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.450
 literally once cranking and 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.569
 fix then throw the freezer it 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.670
 we tuck out take out and 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.440
 cut into thin plates for carpaccio 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.200
 and so beef and today 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.519
 Got a bevy cut on beef stroganoff 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.519
 petals and carpaccio
