00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
new thread in the fly tying market and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.130 
new thread in the fly tying market and
it's<00:01:07.710> very<00:01:07.950> strong<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> very<00:01:08.549> small<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it's very strong and very small so the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's very strong and very small so the
first<00:01:10.350> step<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.920> fly<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.220> selecting<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
first step of this fly is selecting a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.319 
first step of this fly is selecting a
piece<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> marabou<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> case<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
piece of marabou in this case this is

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.990 
piece of marabou in this case this is
black<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.860> we're<00:01:16.979> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.729> use

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
black and what we're going to do is use

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
black and what we're going to do is use
the<00:01:18.180> entire<00:01:18.600> stem<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> we're<00:01:20.940> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> fold

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the entire stem so we're going to fold

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
the entire stem so we're going to fold
all<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.900> together<00:01:22.110> measure<00:01:22.860> about<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
all of that together measure about the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.430 
all of that together measure about the
length<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.840> hook<00:01:25.770> shank<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> fly<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
length of the hook shank of the fly and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.840 
length of the hook shank of the fly and
we're<00:01:28.440> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.590> transfer<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.460> my<00:01:29.580> left

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
we're going to transfer that to my left

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.390 
we're going to transfer that to my left
hand<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.510> we're<00:01:31.260> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.620> tie<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.159> in

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
hand and we're going to tie that in

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.450 
hand and we're going to tie that in
right<00:01:32.760> at<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> bend<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.990> hook<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.650> couple

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
right at the bend of the hook a couple

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.420 
right at the bend of the hook a couple
or<00:01:35.760> three<00:01:35.790> wraps<00:01:36.330> loosely<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.800> pull<00:01:38.159> tight

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
or three wraps loosely then pull tight

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.430 
or three wraps loosely then pull tight
on<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.760> thread<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.360> binds<00:01:39.690> it<00:01:39.930> down<00:01:40.140> in

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
on the thread and that binds it down in

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.370 
on the thread and that binds it down in
that<00:01:40.740> position<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> that's<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.930> looks

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
that position so that's what that looks

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.950 
that position so that's what that looks
like<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.010> how<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.310> applied

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
like and that's how it's applied

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.969 
like and that's how it's applied
secondly<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.140> we're<00:01:46.260> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.620> because

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
secondly what we're going to do because

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.219 
secondly what we're going to do because
this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.370> fat<00:01:47.880> bodied<00:01:48.360> fly<00:01:48.659> we're<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
this is a fat bodied fly we're going to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.280 
this is a fat bodied fly we're going to
use<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.770> stem<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.370> this<00:01:50.490> marabou<00:01:51.120> to<00:01:52.080> help

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
use the stem of this marabou to help

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.560 
use the stem of this marabou to help
build<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.890> underbody<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.580> this<00:01:53.760> fly<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.390> I'm

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
build the underbody of this fly so I'm

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.350 
build the underbody of this fly so I'm
just<00:01:54.810> simply<00:01:55.350> palmer<00:01:56.100> wrapping<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.330> thread

build a body on the fly so we're going

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.690 
build a body on the fly so we're going
to<00:02:09.209> take<00:02:09.390> our<00:02:09.569> thread<00:02:09.840> back<00:02:10.140> over<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.700> come

again we're going to sit that right on
top<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.099> hook

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
top of the hook

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.710 
top of the hook
same<00:02:30.030> length<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.930> tail<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.540> we're<00:02:33.540> just

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
same length as the tail and we're just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.720 
same length as the tail and we're just
going<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.900> go<00:02:34.080> over<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.680> material<00:02:34.920> bind<00:02:35.550> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
going to go over that material bind it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.370 
going to go over that material bind it
on<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.270> couple<00:02:37.200> wraps<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:39.600> hold<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.230> on

on a couple wraps just to hold it on

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.260 
on a couple wraps just to hold it on
them<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.980> hook<00:02:41.160> give<00:02:41.610> us<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.820> little<00:02:41.970> bit<00:02:42.120> of

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
them on the hook give us a little bit of

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
them on the hook give us a little bit of
flashback<00:02:42.900> there

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.970 

secure<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.820> next<00:02:48.090> step<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.740> applying<00:02:49.740> a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
secure it the next step is applying a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.850 
secure it the next step is applying a
saddle<00:02:50.370> hackle<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:52.530> saddle

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
saddle hackle this is a the saddle

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.660 
saddle hackle this is a the saddle
hackle<00:02:53.240> that<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.630> comes<00:02:54.870> off<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.080> rump<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.709> a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
hackle that that comes off the rump of a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.990 
hackle that that comes off the rump of a
of<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.330> rooster<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:58.130> this<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.280> what<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.580> use<00:02:59.790> for

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
of a rooster and this is what we use for

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.790 
of a rooster and this is what we use for
the<00:03:00.090> material<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.660> prepare<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.380> saddle

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
the material we prepare that saddle

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.890 
the material we prepare that saddle
hackle<00:03:02.010> we're<00:03:02.730> going<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.940> tie<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.240> in<00:03:03.570> by<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
hackle we're going to tie it in by the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.580 
hackle we're going to tie it in by the
tip<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.760> there's<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> reason<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.110> doing<00:03:07.260> that

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
tip and there's a reason for doing that

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.850 
tip and there's a reason for doing that
is<00:03:07.920> because<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.820> feather<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.390> tapered<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.320> we

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
is because the feather is tapered and we

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.250 
is because the feather is tapered and we
want<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.250> smallest<00:03:11.670> hackle<00:03:12.360> barbels<00:03:12.930> which

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
want the smallest hackle barbels which

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.430 
want the smallest hackle barbels which
are<00:03:13.470> these<00:03:14.270> things<00:03:15.270> coming<00:03:15.750> off<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.080> stem

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
are these things coming off the stem

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.699 
are these things coming off the stem
first<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:17.790> get<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> taper<00:03:18.330> on<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.080> fly<00:03:19.350> to

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
first so we get a taper on the fly to

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.850 
first so we get a taper on the fly to
give<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.100> look<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.270> we<00:03:21.420> want<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.680> we're

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
give it a look that we want so we're

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.090 
give it a look that we want so we're
going<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.040> separate<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.880> barbels<00:03:24.890> come<00:03:25.890> along

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
going to separate the barbels come along

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.500 
going to separate the barbels come along
the<00:03:26.280> side<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.730> hook<00:03:26.880> lash<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.390> down<00:03:28.050> and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
the side of the hook lash that down and

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.440 
the side of the hook lash that down and
tie<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:31.310> snip<00:03:32.310> off<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.700> excess<00:03:33.150> right

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
tie that in snip off the excess right

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.920 
tie that in snip off the excess right
there<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.709> next<00:03:34.920> step<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.670> applying<00:03:36.239> peacock

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
there the next step is applying peacock

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.590 
there the next step is applying peacock
herl<00:03:37.290> these<00:03:38.130> are<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.519> barbels<00:03:38.940> off<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.360> side

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
herl these are the barbels off the side

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.740 
herl these are the barbels off the side
of<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.989> big<00:03:40.200> peacock<00:03:40.799> feather<00:03:41.730> we're<00:03:42.540> going<00:03:42.660> to

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
it is also twisting around the thread

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.900 
it is also twisting around the thread
and<00:04:31.320> making<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:32.570> chenille<00:04:33.630> if<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.260> will<00:04:34.530> out<00:04:35.520> of

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
and making a chenille if you will out of

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.330 
and making a chenille if you will out of
the<00:04:36.120> peacock<00:04:36.540> herl<00:04:36.930> which<00:04:37.410> adds<00:04:37.710> strength

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the peacock herl which adds strength

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.250 
the peacock herl which adds strength
because<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:39.000> peacock<00:04:39.360> herl<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.900> very

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
because the peacock herl is a very

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.279 
because the peacock herl is a very
fragile<00:04:40.710> little

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
fragile little

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.519 
fragile little
fiber<00:04:43.219> and<00:04:43.610> what<00:04:44.539> we've<00:04:44.719> done<00:04:44.929> now<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.199> that's

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:45.529 
fiber and what we've done now is that's

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:48.489 
fiber and what we've done now is that's
twisted<00:04:45.919> around<00:04:46.399> the<00:04:46.580> thread<00:04:46.939> and<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:48.259> is

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:48.499 
twisted around the thread and so that is

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.219 
twisted around the thread and so that is
anchored<00:04:49.189> and<00:04:49.550> twisted<00:04:50.389> with<00:04:50.659> the<00:04:50.929> thread

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
anchored and twisted with the thread

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.790 
anchored and twisted with the thread
body<00:04:51.499> to<00:04:51.800> make<00:04:51.919> a<00:04:51.949> very<00:04:52.339> strong<00:04:53.529> peacock<00:04:54.529> herl

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
body to make a very strong peacock herl

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.540 
body to make a very strong peacock herl
body<00:04:55.809> now<00:04:56.809> this<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.169> about<00:04:57.409> two<00:04:58.339> or<00:04:58.520> three

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
body now this is about two or three

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.839 
body now this is about two or three
times<00:04:59.209> the<00:04:59.959> the<00:05:00.589> size<00:05:00.919> that<00:05:01.490> this<00:05:01.610> would

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
times the the size that this would

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.709 
times the the size that this would
normally<00:05:02.059> would<00:05:02.839> have<00:05:03.110> been<00:05:04.029> but<00:05:05.029> since<00:05:05.509> we've

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
normally would have been but since we've

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.589 
normally would have been but since we've
added<00:05:05.990> that<00:05:06.439> under<00:05:06.800> body<00:05:06.949> material<00:05:07.639> we<00:05:08.449> get<00:05:08.569> a

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
added that under body material we get a

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.119 
added that under body material we get a
nice<00:05:08.809> fat<00:05:09.080> body<00:05:09.349> now<00:05:09.589> we're<00:05:09.740> going<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:09.919> take<00:05:10.099> a

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
nice fat body now we're going to take a

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.269 
nice fat body now we're going to take a
saddle<00:05:10.729> hackle<00:05:10.969> and<00:05:11.709> the<00:05:12.709> technique<00:05:13.129> is

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:13.279 
saddle hackle and the technique is

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.850 
saddle hackle and the technique is
called<00:05:13.309> palmering<00:05:14.169> we're<00:05:15.169> gonna<00:05:15.259> wrap<00:05:15.589> that

concentric<00:05:20.659> wraps<00:05:20.959> towards<00:05:21.469> the<00:05:21.619> eye<00:05:21.729> and

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
concentric wraps towards the eye and

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.790 
concentric wraps towards the eye and
when<00:05:22.939> we<00:05:23.089> get<00:05:23.300> right<00:05:23.599> at<00:05:23.839> the<00:05:23.869> eye<00:05:24.020> on<00:05:24.559> this

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
when we get right at the eye on this

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.879 
when we get right at the eye on this
particular<00:05:25.159> pattern<00:05:25.639> we<00:05:26.599> do<00:05:26.809> several<00:05:27.289> wraps

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889
