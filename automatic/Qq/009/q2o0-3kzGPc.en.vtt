00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
stuff he's gotten a lot of chance to go

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.450 
stuff he's gotten a lot of chance to go
with<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> first<00:02:04.380> team<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.920> gotten<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
with the first team and gotten a lot of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.670 
with the first team and gotten a lot of
chance<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.990> speed<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.469> will<00:02:07.530> be

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
chance to to get up to speed it will be

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.369 
chance to to get up to speed it will be
his<00:02:07.829> first<00:02:08.069> start<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.690> their<00:02:09.869> label

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
his first start but I think their label

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.979 
his first start but I think their label
which<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:11.280> fairly<00:02:11.670> upbeat

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
which you can be you know fairly upbeat

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.350 
which you can be you know fairly upbeat
Notre<00:02:12.989> Dame

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
about Maxie 64 that's probably 242 or

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.240 
about Maxie 64 that's probably 242 or
243<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> last<00:02:22.690> time<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.020> told<00:02:23.200> us<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.590> he's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
243 the last time you told us and he's

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.700 
243 the last time you told us and he's
got<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.790> know<00:02:24.940> real<00:02:25.270> not<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:26.080> live<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.500> but

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
got you know real not just a live on but

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.830 
got you know real not just a live on but
live<00:02:26.920> legs<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.550> he<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.790> run<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.150> tackle<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:28.720> he

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
live legs and he can run to tackle so he

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.510 
live legs and he can run to tackle so he
can<00:02:28.990> throw<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.260> ball<00:02:29.350> he<00:02:29.710> likes<00:02:30.040> throwing<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
can throw the ball he likes throwing the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.930 
can throw the ball he likes throwing the
ball<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.910> run<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.800> think<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.820> know

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
ball on the run so I think you know

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.570 
ball on the run so I think you know
optimistically<00:02:34.840> they<00:02:35.470> will<00:02:35.800> let<00:02:35.980> him<00:02:36.220> throw

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
optimistically they will let him throw

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.280 
optimistically they will let him throw
the<00:02:36.730> ball<00:02:36.910> they'll<00:02:37.330> let<00:02:37.540> him<00:02:37.660> throw<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> gate

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the ball they'll let him throw a gate

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.110 
the ball they'll let him throw a gate
the<00:02:38.470> reason<00:02:38.800> he<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> backup<00:02:39.459> quarterback

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
the reason he is the backup quarterback

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.670 
the reason he is the backup quarterback
is<00:02:40.330> because<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.750> strong<00:02:41.140> lon<00:02:41.380> and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
is because of that strong lon and

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.460 
is because of that strong lon and
because<00:02:42.370> he<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.610> able<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.750> throw<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.050> deep<00:02:44.230> and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
because he is able to throw it deep and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.300 
because he is able to throw it deep and
I<00:02:45.190> think<00:02:45.430> his<00:02:45.730> abilities<00:02:46.660> more<00:02:46.990> reflect<00:02:47.920> max

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
I think his abilities more reflect max

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.110 
I think his abilities more reflect max
bark<00:02:48.640> Matt<00:02:49.290> Barkley's<00:02:50.400> ability<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.790> way<00:02:51.910> he

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
bark Matt Barkley's ability the way he

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.930 
bark Matt Barkley's ability the way he
throws<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.540> ball<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.590> think<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.430> don't<00:02:54.730> think

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
throws the ball so I think I don't think

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.330 
throws the ball so I think I don't think
a<00:02:55.030> lot<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.239> going<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.630> change<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.080> think<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:57.160> key

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
a lot is going to change I think the key

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.670 
a lot is going to change I think the key
with<00:02:57.520> matches<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.959> he's<00:02:59.260> going<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.620> a

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
with matches is he's going to have a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.410 
with matches is he's going to have a
whole<00:02:59.890> week<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.400> get<00:03:00.520> ready<00:03:00.580> won't<00:03:01.060> be<00:03:01.239> just

an<00:03:02.890> all<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.160> game<00:03:03.340> he's<00:03:04.209> also<00:03:04.450> i<00:03:04.930> think

and<00:03:44.290> things<00:03:44.410> like<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.650> will<00:03:44.920> get<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.220> him

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
and things like that will get to him

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.479 
and things like that will get to him
before<00:03:45.610> that<00:03:46.239> before<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.230> game<00:03:47.410> anyway<00:03:47.830> so

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
before that before the game anyway so

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.580 
before that before the game anyway so
he'll<00:03:49.030> know<00:03:49.209> that<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.540> circus<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:50.080> on<00:03:50.260> him<00:03:50.560> but

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
he'll know that the circus is on him but

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.509 
he'll know that the circus is on him but
I<00:03:51.580> don't<00:03:52.540> think<00:03:52.900> he's<00:03:53.530> declined<00:03:54.010> it<00:03:54.220> will<00:03:54.400> be

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
I don't think he's declined it will be

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.060 
I don't think he's declined it will be
totally<00:03:54.760> thrown<00:03:55.299> off<00:03:55.480> by<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.170> as<00:03:56.590> much<00:03:56.799> as<00:03:57.010> I

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
totally thrown off by that as much as I

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.620 
totally thrown off by that as much as I
don't<00:03:57.280> think<00:03:57.430> Cody<00:03:57.610> Kessler<00:03:57.850> will<00:03:58.209> be<00:03:58.390> either

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
don't think Cody Kessler will be either

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.600
