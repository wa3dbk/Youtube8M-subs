00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.740 
that I have a bachelor's in biochemistry
I'm<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.550> excited<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.360> cuz<00:00:24.720> I

I'm so excited to have you here cuz I
have<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.440> many<00:00:25.560> questions<00:00:26.040> about<00:00:26.220> hemp<00:00:26.610> so

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
have so many questions about hemp so

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.210 
have so many questions about hemp so
let's<00:00:27.300> start<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.470> happening<00:00:28.920> what

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
let's start with what is happening what

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.190 
let's start with what is happening what
is<00:00:29.250> hemp<00:00:29.730> hemp<00:00:30.030> is<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.270> plant<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.870> its<00:00:31.020> most

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
is hemp hemp is a plant in its most

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.979 
is hemp hemp is a plant in its most
simple<00:00:31.650> form<00:00:31.730> it<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.879> technically<00:00:33.329> cannabis

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
simple form it is technically cannabis

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.490 
simple form it is technically cannabis
sativa<00:00:34.170> L<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.129> it<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.550> legally<00:00:36.030> defined

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
sativa L and it is legally defined

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
sativa L and it is legally defined
differently<00:00:37.500> than<00:00:37.770> marijuana

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
differently than marijuana

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.000 
differently than marijuana
so<00:00:38.850> both<00:00:39.239> hemp<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.810> marijuana<00:00:39.989> come<00:00:40.680> from

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so both hemp and marijuana come from

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850 
so both hemp and marijuana come from
cannabis<00:00:41.579> sativa<00:00:41.730> L<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.840> hemp<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
cannabis sativa L but hemp is the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.660 
cannabis sativa L but hemp is the
specific<00:00:44.610> plant<00:00:44.910> parts<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.540> stalk<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> stems

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
specific plant parts the stalk the stems

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.040 
specific plant parts the stalk the stems
oils<00:00:47.670> pressed<00:00:48.000> from<00:00:48.149> seeds<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> seeds

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
oils pressed from seeds and the seeds

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680 
oils pressed from seeds and the seeds
derived<00:00:49.500> therefrom<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:51.239> flowers

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
derived therefrom but not the flowers

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.650 
derived therefrom but not the flowers
and<00:00:51.930> basically<00:00:52.590> marijuana<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.520> flowers<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
and basically marijuana is flowers that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.750 
and basically marijuana is flowers that
is<00:00:54.809> cultivated<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.680> those<00:00:55.920> purposes<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
is cultivated for those purposes and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
is cultivated for those purposes and
hemp<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> very<00:00:57.899> different<00:00:58.380> forms<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
hemp is very different forms of the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.660 
hemp is very different forms of the
plant<00:00:59.730> for<00:01:00.000> fiber<00:01:00.530> protein<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.070> different

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
plant for fiber protein and different

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.639 
plant for fiber protein and different
types<00:01:02.880> of<00:01:03.090> products<00:01:03.570> derived<00:01:04.079> from<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.409> seeds

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
types of products derived from the seeds

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.340 
types of products derived from the seeds
so<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.820> official<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.930> marijuana

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
so it's official this is not marijuana

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.149 
so it's official this is not marijuana
correct<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.399> is<00:01:08.810> they<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:10.020> similar<00:01:10.409> cousins

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
correct this is they are similar cousins

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.249 
correct this is they are similar cousins
same<00:01:11.520> plant<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.539> different<00:01:12.899> varieties<00:01:13.229> like

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
same plant but different varieties like

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.739 
same plant but different varieties like
a<00:01:13.439> red<00:01:13.920> rose<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.579> yellow<00:01:14.789> rose<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.359> both<00:01:15.569> a

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:15.749 
a red rose and a yellow rose are both a

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:17.449 
a red rose and a yellow rose are both a
rose<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.350> they're<00:01:16.530> not<00:01:16.679> the<00:01:16.920> same<00:01:17.130> type<00:01:17.429> of

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
rose but they're not the same type of

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:19.340 
rose but they're not the same type of
rose<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.479> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:18.899> we're<00:01:19.020> looking<00:01:19.259> at

rose it's kind of what we're looking at

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.080 
rose it's kind of what we're looking at

those are the building blocks for our

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.380 
those are the building blocks for our
body<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.830> make<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.250> machinery<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.150> little

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.540 
body to make the machinery the little
machinery<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:39.260> call<00:02:39.440> enzymes<00:02:39.920> that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
machinery we call enzymes that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.190 
machinery we call enzymes that
manipulate<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.209> other<00:02:41.360> molecules<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:41.989> keep

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
manipulate the other molecules and keep

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.830 
manipulate the other molecules and keep
us<00:02:42.349> going<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.519> gives<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.060> whole<00:02:44.330> host<00:02:44.630> of

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
us going so it gives you a whole host of

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.990 
us going so it gives you a whole host of
things<00:02:45.349> that<00:02:45.650> your<00:02:45.830> body<00:02:46.099> needs<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.790> can

things that your body needs and can

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.400 
things that your body needs and can
benefit<00:02:47.390> from<00:02:47.450> all<00:02:47.870> at<00:02:48.140> once

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
benefit from all at once

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.380 
benefit from all at once
I<00:02:48.530> think<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> nutritional<00:02:49.730> benefits<00:02:50.180> are

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
I think the nutritional benefits are

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.090 
I think the nutritional benefits are
almost<00:02:50.810> next<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.170> no<00:02:51.290> other<00:02:51.410> plant<00:02:51.769> that<00:02:51.980> we

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
almost next to no other plant that we

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.850 
almost next to no other plant that we
know<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.580> thinking<00:02:53.299> evolutionary<00:02:54.260> biology

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
know and thinking evolutionary biology

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.190 
know and thinking evolutionary biology
many<00:02:55.700> many<00:02:55.910> years<00:02:56.150> ago<00:02:56.299> we<00:02:56.600> grazed<00:02:56.870> on<00:02:57.080> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
many many years ago we grazed on the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.229 
many many years ago we grazed on the
lands<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.680> ate<00:02:57.950> mostly<00:02:58.370> plants<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.090> was

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
lands and ate mostly plants and this was

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.550 
lands and ate mostly plants and this was
probably<00:02:59.450> one<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.959> plants<00:03:00.319> that<00:03:00.380> we

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
probably one of the plants that we

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.860 
probably one of the plants that we
enjoyed<00:03:00.890> eating<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.489> we<00:03:01.670> are<00:03:01.819> tuned<00:03:02.209> for<00:03:02.630> this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
enjoyed eating and we are tuned for this

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.259 
enjoyed eating and we are tuned for this
one<00:03:03.140> with<00:03:03.739> our<00:03:03.920> own<00:03:04.069> natural<00:03:04.459> systems<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.209> would

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
one with our own natural systems I would

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.570 
one with our own natural systems I would
say<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:06.019> we<00:03:06.200> talked<00:03:06.470> about<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.860> legal<00:03:07.130> aspects

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
say so we talked about the legal aspects

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.330 
say so we talked about the legal aspects
of<00:03:07.790> hemp<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.780> how<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.410> totally<00:03:10.130> not

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
of hemp and how it is totally not

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
marijuana and then and all the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.880 
marijuana and then and all the
