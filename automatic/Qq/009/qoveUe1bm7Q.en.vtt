00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
to do this it's not hair hair has shadow

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.929 
to do this it's not hair hair has shadow
and<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:19.080> highlights<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.550> find

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and it has highlights in it so find

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.700 
and it has highlights in it so find
where<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> highlights<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.260> your<00:00:22.470> hair

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
this is where it is a curves and up here

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.070 
this is where it is a curves and up here

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
so that would mean I wouldn't have so

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.410 
so that would mean I wouldn't have so
many<00:00:28.230> lines<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.859> through<00:00:29.160> there<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.609> do

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

that<00:00:43.969> it's<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> tooth<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.739> where

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that it's just the tooth this is where

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.580

its<00:00:47.129> light<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.579> those<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.969> higher

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.610 

I<00:00:52.650> don't<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.690> one<00:00:54.690> way<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.200> would<00:00:55.470> be

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
I don't know one way to do it would be

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.200 
I don't know one way to do it would be
just<00:00:55.770> go<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.400> your<00:00:56.580> blending<00:00:57.000> tool

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
just go back in with your blending tool

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.210 
just go back in with your blending tool
and<00:00:57.420> make<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.200> softer<00:01:00.739> have<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> feel

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
and make it a little softer have a feel

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.939 
and make it a little softer have a feel
of<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.550> come<00:01:02.850> through<00:01:03.150> here<00:01:03.559> it's<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> little

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of it come through here it's a little

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.850 
of it come through here it's a little
bit<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.660> really<00:01:10.260> simple<00:01:10.680> way

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
bit that would be one really simple way

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.370 
bit that would be one really simple way
to<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.130> hair

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380

okay<00:01:18.189> we<00:01:18.340> can't<00:01:19.030> predict<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.539> ears<00:01:19.810> ears<00:01:20.200> for

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
okay we can't predict the ears ears for

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.249 
okay we can't predict the ears ears for
our<00:01:20.619> things<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.610> lot<00:01:21.789> of<00:01:21.880> people<00:01:22.210> struggle<00:01:23.049> with

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
that's that's the beginning that's the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
that's that's the beginning that's the
start<00:03:31.730> it's<00:03:32.000> nowhere<00:03:32.599> near<00:03:32.630> done<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:34.390> it's

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
start it's nowhere near done so it's

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.320 
start it's nowhere near done so it's
going<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.930> evolve<00:03:36.050> as<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:37.250> keep<00:03:37.610> working<00:03:37.790> on<00:03:38.120> it

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
going to evolve as I keep working on it

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.330 
going to evolve as I keep working on it
it's<00:03:38.510> not<00:03:38.750> going<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.620> look<00:03:39.739> like<00:03:39.799> this<00:03:40.099> when<00:03:40.280> I

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
it's not going to look like this when I

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.449 
it's not going to look like this when I
turn<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:40.910> this<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.500> rough<00:03:42.739> set<00:03:43.099> out<00:03:43.280> now

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
turn it in this is the rough set out now

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.360 
turn it in this is the rough set out now
I<00:03:43.489> can<00:03:43.760> go<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.209> can<00:03:44.319> move<00:03:45.319> stuff<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:45.980> nose

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
I can go and I can move stuff this nose

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.250 
I can go and I can move stuff this nose
is<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.819> right<00:03:47.030> i<00:03:47.060> would<00:03:47.390> go<00:03:47.569> in<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.900> i<00:03:47.989> change

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
is that right i would go in and i change

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.500 
is that right i would go in and i change
that<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.739> make<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:48.920> have<00:03:49.910> more<00:03:50.269> of<00:03:50.420> the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that and make it have more of the

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.850 
that and make it have more of the
correct<00:03:50.810> shape<00:03:51.370> then<00:03:52.370> with<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.610> lips<00:03:52.849> just

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
correct shape then with the lips just

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.380 
correct shape then with the lips just
slightly<00:03:54.860> tweak<00:03:55.280> things<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.849> make<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.209> look

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
slightly tweak things to make it look

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.970 
slightly tweak things to make it look
more<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:57.890> other<00:03:58.190> side<00:03:58.549> cuts
