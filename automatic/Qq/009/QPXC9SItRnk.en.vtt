 Hi, I'm Luisa Gas from the team 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.460
 makeup jorge de la herza or makeup 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.960
 let's see the basic corrections with 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.809
 our products in our line 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.870
 we have different powder correctors 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.650
 in pencil and brush in this video 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.039
 used the pencil and the brush 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.039
 lets go see it 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.369
 we begin by applying our flash hydro 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.340
 make - up base with tensor effect that 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.240
 hydrata protects and prepares the skin before 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 of the makeup application 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.160
 now we will apply the liquid power 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.260
 our fluid foundation with a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.520
 powder finish that serves to unify 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.340
 the tone of the skin as you see I am 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.620
 applying with a damp sponge and giving 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.200
 a few soft taps to distribute 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.140
 ok the makeup without dragging it 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.990
 we continue with the consell erpen waterproof 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.360
 that has an applicator with a brush that 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.290
 helps us to correct in a very 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.000
 easy everything we need 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.150
 we start by applying the lighter color 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.400
 to illuminate the dark areas or to 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.390
 give more importance to the areas that 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.390
 we want to highlight 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.040
 now with the correction pen 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.340
 green imperfections let's correct 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.650
 all redness and granite what 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.450
 We put directly with the pencil and 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.690
 then with your fingers we work it well 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.690
 until you see that the redness is disguised 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 we continue correcting now with the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.430
 darker tone of the erpen consell 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.440
 waterproof to work the volume of the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.170
 face 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.180
 we begin by applying it on the cheekbone to 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.370
 give it more depth 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.520
 and in this case we will apply it in the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.890
 lower part of the lip to correct it 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.829
 As you can also see, you can work with 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.619
 the fingers and we finish the makeup with 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.660
 loose powders to eliminate shine and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.190
 get the makeup fixed and 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.190
 last us much more 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.670
 and here we have the final result a 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.110
 face with well-defined volumes 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.110
 and very natural looking
