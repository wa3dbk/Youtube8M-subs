00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.960 
start from the beginning on each new
surface<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.729> reward<00:04:51.150> only<00:04:51.509> nose<00:04:51.720> pushes

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.270 

Jessie<00:04:56.970> tries<00:04:57.120> pine<00:04:57.599> that's<00:04:58.410> not<00:04:58.740> rewarded<00:04:59.250> so

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
Jessie tries pine that's not rewarded so

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.529 
Jessie tries pine that's not rewarded so
she<00:04:59.490> goes<00:04:59.669> back<00:04:59.880> to<00:05:00.090> what<00:05:00.270> works

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.029 

her<00:05:03.539> nose<00:05:03.780> pushes<00:05:04.229> are<00:05:04.349> hard<00:05:04.620> that's<00:05:05.220> great<00:05:07.039> at

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
her nose pushes are hard that's great at

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.490 
her nose pushes are hard that's great at
this<00:05:08.639> point<00:05:08.970> I'll<00:05:09.180> click<00:05:09.479> for<00:05:09.690> either<00:05:09.840> hard<00:05:10.260> or

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
this point I'll click for either hard or

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.740 
this point I'll click for either hard or
low<00:05:10.740> pushes<00:05:11.220> or<00:05:11.400> both<00:05:11.729> if<00:05:12.030> she<00:05:12.240> offers<00:05:12.570> them

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
low pushes or both if she offers them

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.839 
low pushes or both if she offers them
but<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.199> need<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.560> keep<00:05:13.710> my<00:05:13.860> criteria<00:05:14.099> low<00:05:14.639> on

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
but I need to keep my criteria low on

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:21.159 
but I need to keep my criteria low on
the<00:05:14.970> new<00:05:15.150> surface<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:15.930> she<00:05:15.990> can<00:05:16.229> be<00:05:16.349> successful

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.100 

ad<00:05:22.169> pushing<00:05:22.740> distance<00:05:23.099> as<00:05:23.220> before<00:05:23.760> and<00:05:24.570> she

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
ad pushing distance as before and she

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.839 
ad pushing distance as before and she
starts<00:05:25.409> lowering<00:05:25.860> her<00:05:26.009> push<00:05:26.250> point<00:05:26.580> while

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
starts lowering her push point while

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.520 
starts lowering her push point while
keeping<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.389> hard<00:05:27.599> push<00:05:30.229> increase<00:05:31.229> your

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
keeping the hard push increase your

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.749 
keeping the hard push increase your
distance<00:05:31.740> from<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:32.220> ball

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
distance from the ball

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.810 
distance from the ball
I<00:05:33.289> send<00:05:34.289> Lucy<00:05:34.650> around<00:05:34.949> the<00:05:35.099> ball<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:35.610> back

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
I send Lucy around the ball and back

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.469 
I send Lucy around the ball and back
away<00:05:36.000> as<00:05:36.389> she<00:05:36.570> pushes<00:05:36.810> it<00:05:37.050> towards<00:05:37.199> me<00:05:38.479> each

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
away as she pushes it towards me each

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.490 
away as she pushes it towards me each
session<00:05:39.870> start<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.470> little<00:05:40.590> further<00:05:40.830> back<00:05:41.130> I

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
session start a little further back I

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.820 
session start a little further back I
use<00:05:43.500> arm<00:05:43.800> signals<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.400> direct<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:44.820> ball

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.380 

eventually<00:05:50.830> you<00:05:51.340> want<00:05:51.460> to<00:05:51.580> be<00:05:51.670> stationary<00:05:52.240> and

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
eventually you want to be stationary and

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.030 
eventually you want to be stationary and
to<00:05:52.600> send<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.960> dog<00:05:53.140> to<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.560> ball<00:05:53.710> from<00:05:53.950> a

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
to send the dog to the ball from a

to send the dog to the ball from a
distance<00:06:07.230> add<00:06:08.230> goalposts<00:06:09.870> because<00:06:10.870> we<00:06:11.020> are

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
distance add goalposts because we are

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:20.400 
distance add goalposts because we are
adding<00:06:11.440> a<00:06:11.530> new<00:06:11.560> criteria<00:06:12.340> we<00:06:12.610> start<00:06:12.850> close<00:06:19.410> add

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
adding a new criteria we start close add

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:31.960 
adding a new criteria we start close add
distance<00:06:21.070> by<00:06:21.310> backing<00:06:21.550> away

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.430 

here<00:06:32.970> I<00:06:33.000> asked<00:06:33.449> for<00:06:33.600> more<00:06:33.750> distance<00:06:34.199> in<00:06:34.320> the

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
here I asked for more distance in the

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.640 
here I asked for more distance in the
send<00:06:34.710> out<00:06:34.889> than<00:06:35.160> we<00:06:35.310> have<00:06:35.430> trained<00:06:35.699> so<00:06:35.940> far

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
send out than we have trained so far

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.020 
send out than we have trained so far
with<00:06:37.650> some<00:06:37.860> help<00:06:38.070> from<00:06:38.130> armed<00:06:38.520> and<00:06:38.699> verbal

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
with some help from armed and verbal

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.700 
with some help from armed and verbal
cues<00:06:39.240> she<00:06:39.630> eventually<00:06:39.810> targets<00:06:40.410> the<00:06:40.560> ball<00:06:42.710> her

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
cues she eventually targets the ball her

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.650 
cues she eventually targets the ball her
return<00:06:44.040> is<00:06:44.220> very<00:06:44.250> confident<00:06:44.940> as<00:06:45.120> she<00:06:45.330> has<00:06:45.419> more

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
return is very confident as she has more

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.400 
return is very confident as she has more
experience<00:06:45.780> with<00:06:46.350> this<00:06:46.530> part<00:06:46.830> of<00:06:46.889> the<00:06:46.979> game

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.680 

add<00:06:52.490> more<00:06:53.490> balls<00:06:53.729> and<00:06:54.060> you're<00:06:54.240> on<00:06:54.360> your<00:06:54.389> way<00:06:54.570> to

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
add more balls and you're on your way to
