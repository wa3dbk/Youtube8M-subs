00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:16.139
 review just talk in video still 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.200
 the pure avanti flow is a dab + radio 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.080
 but which can also stream over wifi 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.800
 and yes, you want to be quick 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 look at 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 on the one hand, you can see her upper part 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.050
 has it for the iphone one 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.350
 docking station does not just speak that 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.330

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.110
 every different generation of 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.790
 iphone 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.970
 There is a shell in here in the one 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.820
 can exchange say the luggage in it 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.920
 are synonymous for the distant final game ipod the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.460
 fifth generation second and so on 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 third ipod touch as well as the ipod nano 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.470
 have been stinging it was the whole 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.379
 could incorporate and thus the after 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.610
 have space 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.640
 by default this is for the iphone 4s 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.229
 her directly afterwards docking stations 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.119
 the whole as an alarm clock use of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.810
 I believe I bet 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.979
 not so good 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.070
