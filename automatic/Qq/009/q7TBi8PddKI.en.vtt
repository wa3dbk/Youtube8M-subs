00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
then like it kind of goes 7 years

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.440 
then like it kind of goes 7 years
forward<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.460> these<00:01:59.610> psychologists<00:02:00.329> are

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
forward and all these psychologists are

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.940 
forward and all these psychologists are
saying<00:02:00.689> no<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.110> trees<00:02:01.350> didn't<00:02:01.619> grab<00:02:01.770> your

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.069 
saying no the trees didn't grab your
brother<00:02:02.219> like<00:02:02.520> she's<00:02:03.060> been<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.390> treatment<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.520 
I guess she went home and told everyone
the<00:02:07.729> trees<00:02:08.060> stole<00:02:08.630> my<00:02:08.899> brother<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.440> they

what really happened

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.620 
what really happened
and<00:02:12.860> then<00:02:13.010> seven<00:02:13.430> years<00:02:13.459> later<00:02:13.670> she's<00:02:14.180> walking

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
regret it I love this story so much I

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.590 
regret it I love this story so much I
wish<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:40.370> was<00:03:40.579> more<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:41.030> like<00:03:41.209> an<00:03:41.390> ongoing

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
wish that it was more of like an ongoing

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.750 
wish that it was more of like an ongoing
series<00:03:42.170> but<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.860> didn't<00:03:43.100> really<00:03:43.280> end<00:03:43.400> with<00:03:43.700> a

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
series but it didn't really end with a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.370 
series but it didn't really end with a
cliffhanger<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:44.570> think<00:03:44.750> it's<00:03:45.049> just<00:03:45.200> a

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
cliffhanger so I think it's just a

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.979 
cliffhanger so I think it's just a
one-off<00:03:45.650> book<00:03:46.160> but<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.790> really<00:03:47.390> enjoyed<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.870> so

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
one-off book but I really enjoyed it so

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.229 
one-off book but I really enjoyed it so
