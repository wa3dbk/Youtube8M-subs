00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
expensive so they just took to a new

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.160 
expensive so they just took to a new
medium<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.460> they<00:01:09.670> took<00:01:09.880> their<00:01:10.180> their<00:01:10.750> art<00:01:10.960> and

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.609 
medium and they took their their art and
they<00:01:11.320> were<00:01:11.380> they<00:01:12.220> pretty<00:01:12.550> much<00:01:13.110> created<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.320> new

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
they were they pretty much created a new

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.070 
they were they pretty much created a new
medium<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.430> okay<00:01:16.390> well<00:01:16.570> how<00:01:16.660> am<00:01:16.720> I<00:01:16.840> gonna<00:01:16.930> get

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
medium and okay well how am I gonna get

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.810 
medium and okay well how am I gonna get
my<00:01:17.229> art<00:01:17.380> scene<00:01:17.560> so<00:01:17.860> they<00:01:18.430> would<00:01:18.550> paint<00:01:18.729> on

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
my art scene so they would paint on

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.670 
my art scene so they would paint on
trains<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.210> train<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.750> travel<00:01:20.259> through<00:01:20.560> the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
trains and train to travel through the

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.100 
trains and train to travel through the
city<00:01:20.890> and<00:01:21.040> everyone<00:01:21.520> would<00:01:21.670> see<00:01:21.880> them<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
city and everyone would see them and

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.060 
city and everyone would see them and
then<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.530> became<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:25.600> how<00:01:25.869> big<00:01:26.170> can<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.680> get

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
then it became like how big can you get

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.330 
then it became like how big can you get
and<00:01:27.369> if<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.300> had<00:01:28.539> a<00:01:28.570> tag<00:01:29.110> at<00:01:29.470> every<00:01:29.979> subway

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
and if you had a tag at every subway

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.570 
and if you had a tag at every subway
station<00:01:31.000> when<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.899> were<00:01:32.080> pretty<00:01:32.920> much<00:01:33.039> like<00:01:33.100> a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
station when you were pretty much like a

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.310 
station when you were pretty much like a
king<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.960> if<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.170> had<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> crown<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:36.160> your<00:01:36.310> tag

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
king so if you had a crown to your tag

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.230 
king so if you had a crown to your tag
but<00:01:38.320> those<00:01:38.500> rules<00:01:38.770> within<00:01:39.160> your<00:01:39.430> beedi<00:01:39.670> that's

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
but those rules within your beedi that's

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.150 
but those rules within your beedi that's
still<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.899> stage<00:01:41.140> haven't<00:01:41.979> really

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
still to the stage haven't really

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.639 
still to the stage haven't really
changed<00:01:42.399> your<00:01:43.390> basis<00:01:43.810> is<00:01:43.899> a<00:01:43.960> tag<00:01:44.289> which<00:01:44.530> is

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
changed your basis is a tag which is

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.310 
changed your basis is a tag which is
like<00:01:44.800> your<00:01:44.920> signature<00:01:45.720> then<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.810> have<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> bomb

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
like your signature then you have a bomb

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.630 
like your signature then you have a bomb
which<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.310> like<00:01:48.610> very<00:01:49.210> simple<00:01:49.750> bubble<00:01:50.049> letters

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
which is like very simple bubble letters

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.190 
which is like very simple bubble letters
it's<00:01:51.640> usually<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:52.060> white<00:01:52.420> fill<00:01:52.689> with<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:52.930> black

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
it's usually a white fill with a black

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.609 
it's usually a white fill with a black
outline

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
outline

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.850 
outline
so<00:01:54.490> if<00:01:54.580> bomb<00:01:54.760> can<00:01:55.030> go<00:01:55.150> over<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.510> tag<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.260> then

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
so if bomb can go over a tag and then

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.800 
so if bomb can go over a tag and then
you<00:01:56.890> have<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.460> burner<00:01:57.790> which<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.240> little<00:01:58.630> bit

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
you have a burner which is a little bit

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.570 
you have a burner which is a little bit
more<00:01:59.049> complicated<00:01:59.439> which<00:02:00.040> can<00:02:00.220> go<00:02:00.310> over<00:02:00.549> a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
more complicated which can go over a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.550 
more complicated which can go over a
blob<00:02:00.880> burner<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.540> go<00:02:01.689> over<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.869> piece<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.409> piece

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
blob burner to go over a piece a piece

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.830 
blob burner to go over a piece a piece
can<00:02:02.770> go<00:02:02.830> over<00:02:03.009> hand<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:03.640> if<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.450> looks<00:02:04.720> good

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
can go over hand so if it looks good

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.780 
can go over hand so if it looks good
don't<00:02:05.470> go<00:02:05.650> over<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:05.979> table<00:02:08.220> most<00:02:09.220> importantly<00:02:09.700> I

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
don't go over a table most importantly I

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.640 
don't go over a table most importantly I
think<00:02:09.940> yep<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.330> first<00:02:11.019> learn<00:02:11.320> how<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.470> do

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
think yep this first learn how to do

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.710 
think yep this first learn how to do
