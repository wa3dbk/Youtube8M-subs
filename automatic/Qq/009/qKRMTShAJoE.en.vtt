 born to win in the comments 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.560
 The main players passed the phrase that 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.210
 similar decision from the organization 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.860
 show that to any young player 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.610
 under the force to get into one of the leading 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.860
 teams 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.140
 a planet to one of the leading organizations 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.759
 of the world however even this statement dad deeds 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.740
 some fans or simple 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.170
 viewers give a negative opinion about 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.850
 new players and teams in general their words 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.039
 approximately sounded as follows 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 hang your mouse on a nail and forget about 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.200
 victories 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.690
 however, the situation is as follows 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.580
 way if you expect instant victories 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.799
 from navi and not going to wait uncheck 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.179
 fan shirt and forget about everything 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.009
 if you think that this composition 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.600
 deserves the right to exist 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.340
 you will have to suffer as this 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.110
 the team has repeatedly shown that she 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.299
 need a little time to reach 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.159
 desired result or just 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.140
 as close as possible to him 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.569
 Well , young players themselves are like a sip 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.399
 fresh air for old man autumn zeus 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.739
 this is the motivation for the next victories 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.360
 so we are waiting for the first games and of course 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.360
 first positive results 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.950
 June 29 the first matches on the Internet 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.840
 as part of matt cuts on counter-strike 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.490
 global offencive to LAN final 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.290
 was destined to get only two 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.090
 the strongest online selection team 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.650
 these teams became the French from 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.690
 the world of games and the Swedish composition of fnatic 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.490
 Sorry whether Ukrainian or 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.470
 Khazar team Astana dragon with her 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.180
 could oppose anything to the future 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.430
 finalist events and fizzled out 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.020
 very early final big match 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.970
 unfortunately not brought delight and 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.410
 any emotion since the french are in 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.870
 once again demonstrated 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.730
 total domination over rival forever 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.350
 turn got a hard fight back and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.670
 a lot of mistakes you need 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.320
 correct to achieve 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.060
 positive results will be 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.160
 hope that the Swedes will find the right 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.800
 style of play we will get very combat-ready 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.360
 a team which can give the word 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.810
 resistance to the team is not in the future 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.810
 events 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.939
 we previously reported massive closings 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.950
 discipline starcraft 2 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.450
 known organization dissolves the composition 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.519
 then leading players began to give away 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.799
 preference study and began to leave so 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.690
 say from big sports but so 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.489
 large 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.319
 organizations we burned gaming 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.170
 professional gaming league based in 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.420
 2002 in 2011 they spend 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.700
 major starcraft 2 tournaments almost 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.709
 not every month they have already collected the best 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.420
 players from around the world in the us where 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.340
 played out a prize fund of seventy 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.930
 five thousand dollars were also popular 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.730
 and league championships of league but 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.099
 a few weeks ago appeared very 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.849
 the sad news of maji abandon 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.159
 starcraft 2 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.750
 getting rid of the popular strategy one 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.879
 of the biggest eSports faces 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.409
 turned to dota 2 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.590
 first tournament in the new discipline 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.180

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.470
 for international which was held in 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.269
 Seattle showed a massive 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.460
 interest second dota and and we 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.460
 already decided to be seduced by this idea 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.919
 after reading this news after 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.599
 Seen with my own eyes you can safely 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.729
 say incredible but fact 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.110
 most popular from maker modernity 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.789

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.219

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.289
 game incentive to say honestly after 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.120
 how I played on this map I asked 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.219
 only one question why so late 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.289
 come out so bright and promising 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.969
 ideas from people that can affect 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.949
 game development why are they all the time 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.810
 delayed with similar updates 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.909

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.009
 cool and dynamic what if u turn on 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.139

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.360
 on this map will be very interesting and 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.460
 with protection there is a clear grant that us 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.199
 defend well, and attacks as usual will 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.710
 It is very difficult to pass to deliver 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.690
 the bomb 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.000
 Now players can prolazit under 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.949

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.020
 the popularity of the shooter which by the way was 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.150
 slightly lost closed captivity now 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.610
 also became very similar to version 16 in 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.259
