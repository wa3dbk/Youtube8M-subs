the<00:00:10.290> details<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:10.800> like<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.130> say<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.580> created

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the details I just like to say I created

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.310 
the details I just like to say I created

you can find links to both of those in
the<00:00:30.269> description<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.779> usual<00:00:31.669> okay<00:00:32.669> let's<00:00:33.000> take

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the description as usual okay let's take

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
the description as usual okay let's take
a<00:00:33.239> closer<00:00:33.480> look<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:34.739> right

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a closer look so as you can see right

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.360 
a closer look so as you can see right
now<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.670> being<00:00:35.940> operated<00:00:36.149> by<00:00:36.570> motor<00:00:37.160> in<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
now it is being operated by motor in the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.920 
now it is being operated by motor in the
back<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:40.940> right<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.149> using<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.540> old<00:00:42.690> 9

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
back here right now I'm using this old 9

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.119 
back here right now I'm using this old 9
volt<00:00:43.170> motor<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:43.980> easily

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
volt motor but you can just as easily

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.560 
volt motor but you can just as easily
use<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.520> power<00:00:45.210> functions<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:46.050> motor<00:00:47.329> but<00:00:48.329> we'll

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
use a power functions a motor but we'll

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.610 
use a power functions a motor but we'll
stop<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.239> take<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.539> off<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.440> if

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
stop it for now and take it off and if

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.220 
stop it for now and take it off and if
you<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:52.890> off<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.100> motor

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
you take off the motor

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.010 
you take off the motor
you<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.410> also<00:00:55.559> power<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.039> manually<00:00:57.020> using

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
you can also power it manually using

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.060 
you can also power it manually using
this<00:00:58.590> crank<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> side<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
this crank on the side and it is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.050 
this crank on the side and it is
operated<00:01:02.760> quite<00:01:02.940> easily<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:04.880> flapping<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
operated quite easily the flapping of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240 
operated quite easily the flapping of
the<00:01:06.119> wings<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.479> achieved<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.250> pretty

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the wings is achieved through a pretty

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.050 
the wings is achieved through a pretty
simple<00:01:08.700> set<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.390> technical<00:01:10.200> IFFT<00:01:10.409> arms<00:01:11.060> which

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
simple set of technical IFFT arms which

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.920 
simple set of technical IFFT arms which
you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:13.880> attached<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.330> these

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you can see here attached to these

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.240 
you can see here attached to these
cranks<00:01:17.180> which<00:01:18.180> achieve<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.250> somewhat

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
cranks which achieve a somewhat

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
cranks which achieve a somewhat
realistic<00:01:20.549> flapping<00:01:21.210> motion<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.900> remove

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
realistic flapping motion you can remove

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
realistic flapping motion you can remove
the<00:01:25.170> flying<00:01:25.380> machine<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.369> pilot<00:01:26.640> from

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the flying machine and the pilot from

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.240 
the flying machine and the pilot from
the<00:01:26.880> stand<00:01:27.119> quite<00:01:27.360> easily<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.979> pop<00:01:29.189> them

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the stand quite easily you just pop them

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.780 
the stand quite easily you just pop them
off<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.829> fly<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.520> around

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
off and that way you can fly them around

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.350 
off and that way you can fly them around
through<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.790> while<00:01:35.939> he's<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
through there and while he's not a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.109 
through there and while he's not a
passion<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> stand<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.320> operate<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
passion to stand you can operate the

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.399 
passion to stand you can operate the
wings<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> pilot<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.650> by<00:01:41.280> using

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
wings just as the pilot would by using

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.370 
wings just as the pilot would by using
one<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> these<00:01:43.710> links<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:45.049> if<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.200> take<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
one of these links here if we take a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.679 
one of these links here if we take a
closer<00:01:46.619> look<00:01:46.829> at<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.040> stand<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
closer look at the stand you can see I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.899 
closer look at the stand you can see I
have<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> simple<00:01:49.890> piston<00:01:50.399> built<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:52.909> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
have a simple piston built into it and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.139 
have a simple piston built into it and
that<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> wings<00:01:54.750> flap<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.159> machine

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that way as the wings flap the machine

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.030 
that way as the wings flap the machine
will<00:01:57.390> move<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.840> down<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.469> time<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
will move up and down in time with the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.100 
will move up and down in time with the
flapping<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.520> wings<00:01:59.579> to<00:02:00.540> give<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> little

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
flapping of the wings to give a little

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.700 
flapping of the wings to give a little
bit<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.500> realism<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.380> about<00:02:04.530> all

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
bit more realism so that's about all

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.170 
bit more realism so that's about all
there<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.250> put<00:02:05.969> them

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
there is to it put them

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.960 
there is to it put them
now<00:02:06.980> as<00:02:07.980> I<00:02:08.160> said<00:02:08.369> at<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.520> beginning<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
