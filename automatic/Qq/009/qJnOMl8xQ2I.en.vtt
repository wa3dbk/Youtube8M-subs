00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.779
 avoid the pokemon invasion at the 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.970
 house for cause my son did his 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.680
 back in the century too I can not 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.740
 resist the temptation to show you 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.630
 this pikachu trail attack to play tommy 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:33.160
 which is for the 80 plus but all of 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:34.660
 next let's find out together this player in 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.940
 the box that what we find there is there 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.670
 find a record but you will not have 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.000
 need if you look good this demo 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.829
 we find the pikachu the pikachu and delivered 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.840
 with 3 batteries and art 3 what you 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.579
 so lets test it directly 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.579
 in the box before you even buy it 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.480
 here he has he is doing this sentence 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.399
 different in their style their at 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.600
 start-up 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.320
 you put there he was on the position 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.560
 try me you'll put it on the position 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.670
 from the rightmost position also has 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.580
 there is the strap that will 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.770
 put the money is hot on the shoulder and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.770
 a dozen records 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.500
 know of course that one can find 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.090
 disk refills in 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.010
 commerce and a lawyer or if you lose 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.120
 your records it's easy to find 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.240
 so we will immediately do a test 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.740
 but on the first position 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.050
 of use of this pikachu trail 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.550
 attack table a rising position on 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.790
 will see the story of the fair seems 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.790
 after 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.210
 the first thing to do aces and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.310
 to insert discs inside 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.770
 our pikachu for that there is a hatch 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.180
 just open the hatch and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.160
 slide the stack of disks inside 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:58.790
 like that it's simple we try to 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:01.920
 put or right fallen to galicia and 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.870
 Well, he's aligned right up 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.770
 because otherwise it might get stuck 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.800
 I lost 1.5 I have my stack of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.440
 disks inside so I close and 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.070
 there is the little button 1 that goes 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.110
 allow to trigger the pikachu for 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.220
 throw the discs so I took with 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.140
 me some figurines 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.020
 to show you what it can 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.240
 give so I let guess her 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.540
 figurines with my pikachu launcher 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.200
 trail drive then attacks so for 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.300
 start I press this button 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.520
 she looks for risks and after I have 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.470
 done on the rail here I aim for the podium 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.080
 here I have not managed to make them 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.080
 to fall but I start again I say no yes 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.220
 that's good then I suddenly kills me 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.670
 say but you see it works very 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.230
 very well 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.940
 finally it's quite funny 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.820
 discs are very light so we do not 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.230
 risk not the accident 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.600
 it will not hurt anyone 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.950
 it's good to know when you're still 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.530
 I do not have them all expensive but 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.120
 good it's not for now I'm going 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.150
 show you how to place the strap 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.190
 on the back and as we place so 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.459
 the other pikachu ready to tax on 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.530
 the shoulder then to install it on a 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.500
 other spades at all on the chickens so 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.630
 I'm going to take my look there in passing 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.340
 I want to clarify that there is a small 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.700
 tank that will allow you to put 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.470
 other disks in addition because 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.390
 it goes very quickly with the twelve 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.640
 records so for my son is enough 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.270
 simple in August but offers a bowl in 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.930
 a 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.880
 in one seems the other low in the other 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.570
 kids are doing it very 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.580
 easily 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.280
 I have a small size so I arrive 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.590
 to get in but anyway 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.590
 it's reasonable and you even see a 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.480
 adult can have a pikachu on 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.430
 the shoulder there is a case of problem for 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.040
 that's it I think I'm fine is 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.350
 this not alas so to place it my 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.850
 pikachu down it's very simple see it 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.860
 there is a little hole there it is too much 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:14.000
 landmarks and here there a little picot that 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.520
 spring just place the pikachu 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.670
 shoes on his lair clip c 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.010
 here I make sure he's on the 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:28.310
 position hawn and sees the savate equal 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.200
 well head and there you go we will 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.970
 aim for the camera to do that I 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.860
 pressed the button and then to 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.180
 trigger the shot I was leaning on his back 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.330
 rally it's because he had specified 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:48.540
 just now okay you're ready 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:49.740
 watch out for you I think I have 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.890
 succeeded anyway when I read you when 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.890
 even 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.970
 that's still pretty good 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.780
 I 'm standing here I'm crying 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:03.060
 move but finally it's great I 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.560
 think if I had excuses in five years 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.880
 I would put even though it takes 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.400
 I am father that of the benefits the 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.140
 have fun here's well listen I think 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.120
 we went around this ready pikachu 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.240
 at the attack of tommy and if you want 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.380
 see two demos of other toys always 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.380
 good reflex was joined as 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.269
