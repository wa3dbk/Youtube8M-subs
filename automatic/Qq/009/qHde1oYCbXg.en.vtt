with<00:00:00.210> the<00:00:00.299> n97<00:00:00.630> still<00:00:01.170> fully<00:00:01.740> functioning

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:02.629 
with the n97 still fully functioning

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.700 
with the n97 still fully functioning
after<00:00:03.629> dropping<00:00:03.870> it<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.170> bowl<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.380> cereal

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
after dropping it in the bowl of cereal

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.330 
after dropping it in the bowl of cereal
but<00:00:05.700> I'll<00:00:05.850> bet<00:00:05.970> sticky<00:00:06.420> so<00:00:06.600> we'll<00:00:06.779> just

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
but I'll bet sticky so we'll just

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.640 
but I'll bet sticky so we'll just
quickly<00:00:08.340> wash<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.760> off<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.090> their<00:00:09.500> sample<00:00:10.500> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
quickly wash that off in their sample a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:32.840 
quickly wash that off in their sample a
bit<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.889> water<00:00:28.160> dry<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.220> off<00:00:31.610> should<00:00:32.610> get<00:00:32.759> rid

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
bit of water dry it off should get rid

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.010 
bit of water dry it off should get rid
of<00:00:32.910> any<00:00:33.290> existing<00:00:34.290> milk

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.510 

but<00:00:41.560> the<00:00:41.650> question<00:00:42.070> is<00:00:43.530> will<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.650> n97<00:00:45.040> still

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
but the question is will the n97 still

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:55.250 
but the question is will the n97 still
works<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:50.200> 97<00:00:51.070> appear<00:00:51.310> to<00:00:51.430> still<00:00:51.610> be<00:00:51.730> working
