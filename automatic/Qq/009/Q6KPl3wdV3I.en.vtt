00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.000
 hello girls welcome to miami tournament 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.980
 again from my house 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.500
 Today I wanted to tell you, I walk a little 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.470
 recently stressed that I'm programming 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.810
 my fashion videos to go out if it's not 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.550
 this month as for the other and I have some 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.550
 very very good ideas 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.399
 well the plan what I want to do that already 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.989
 they know that for me all teaching is 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.090
 one thing is like you signal my fashion and 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.640
 is that most do not like it but 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.650
 me yes to this but another thing is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 teach you to find your 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.240
 own fashion and they find that they 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.740
 define and find their colors and 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.080
 since I found their colors that 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.280
 like those that you feel comfortable 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.200
 how to also combine that with your 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.990
 Makeup does not use the thing since 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.630
 you when they go out and go well but 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.670
 if they look good prose every magazine of 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.150
 blogs already know that right now the wave of 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.150
 Fashion blogs is at its most 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.710
 high then I want to transmit them 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.700
 that too 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.229
 in an easy way you already know that 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.420
 you can understand that you 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.220
 say, I understand, you are all mine and I can 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.570
 combine me this I can combine the other 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.820
 and that they can go to stores and that 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.220
 they can also choose very easy is not 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.460
 my wave I want to lighten them to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.810
 you work and well as you 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.840
 I want to lighten you right now 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.110
 I'm working and I've been two hours without 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.540
 to be able to decide that I already have the colors 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.220
 He said that a tuto of intense colors does not 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.679
 there's how to combine them because sometimes 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.179
 you bring like three magenta oranges and 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.670
 very strong in your clothes that you're going to 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.140
 put on web makeup or teach what 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.490
 if you bring an orange maybe you can 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.170
 put the magenta on your lips 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.090
 things and that's what I want 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.030
 teach you but here 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.050
 I have look at all the tabs that are 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.090
 there in a thousand the milan that I have several 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.280
 options and things so I'm putting together 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 but I was thinking good instead of 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.850
 I'm breaking my head, I'm going to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.810
 ask you what it is that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.770
 you want to see in the area 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.229
 fashion talk or if you like my idea 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.140
 tell me and if you continue with that because also 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.360
 I want to teach them how to combine patterns 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.239
 the gardens I think if it is I do not know if it is 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.830
 a pochado that with this 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.510
 cheese is also very very fashionable 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.920
 then it is something that is going to stay 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.900
 still a while then I want 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.720
 teach them to you also tell me 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.690
 what do you think of my ideas and wait for the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.849
 today's video in a little while all these 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.590
 rendering I recorded it there since yesterday 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.450
 but it has still taken a little 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.850
 but I wait in a while 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.030
 aside that billy coach also comes 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.690
