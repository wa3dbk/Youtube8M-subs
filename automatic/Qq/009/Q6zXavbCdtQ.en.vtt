00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
theme was chocolate so this was

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.000 
theme was chocolate so this was
obviously<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.829> bounty<00:03:26.220> wrapper<00:03:26.640> done<00:03:27.600> with

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
obviously a bounty wrapper done with

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.000 
obviously a bounty wrapper done with
faber<00:03:29.010> castell<00:03:29.640> polychromos<00:03:30.799> pencils<00:03:31.799> and

faber castell polychromos pencils and

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.380 
faber castell polychromos pencils and
then<00:03:32.160> there's<00:03:32.370> another<00:03:32.459> one<00:03:32.760> there<00:03:33.000> you

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
then there's another one there you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.970 
then there's another one there you
probably<00:03:33.660> can't<00:03:33.870> make<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.140> out<00:03:34.290> but<00:03:34.799> there's

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
probably can't make that out but there's

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.190 
probably can't make that out but there's
no<00:03:35.100> color<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.549> one<00:03:35.790> yet<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:37.019> I'm<00:03:37.109> probably

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
no color on that one yet so I'm probably

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.099

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
front cover of it doesn't need finishing

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.699 
front cover of it doesn't need finishing
and<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.390> uses<00:03:54.660> one<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.930> Sizzix<00:03:55.290> dye<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:55.680> I
