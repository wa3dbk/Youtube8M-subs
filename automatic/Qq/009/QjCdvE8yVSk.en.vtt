00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
pin you right back with you when the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.020 
pin you right back with you when the

steam is pouring up high as you can see

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.609 
steam is pouring up high as you can see
the<00:01:48.240> steam<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:49.100> blowing<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.360> violently<00:01:51.590> now<00:01:52.590> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the steam is blowing out violently now I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
the steam is blowing out violently now I
should<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.890> told<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.430> before<00:01:53.990> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
should have told you this before you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.540 
should have told you this before you
don't<00:01:55.229> want<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.560> put<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.009> high<00:01:56.250> flame

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
don't want to put it on high flame

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.350 
don't want to put it on high flame
because<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.659> handle<00:01:58.110> could<00:01:58.440> melt<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.789> put

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
because the handle could melt so you put

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.630 
because the handle could melt so you put
it<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.570> medium<00:02:00.899> flame<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.860> heat<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.369> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
it on medium flame and heat it up that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.490 
it on medium flame and heat it up that
way<00:02:04.280> anyhow<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> steam<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.880> flowing<00:02:06.500> so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
way anyhow if the steam is flowing so

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.840 
way anyhow if the steam is flowing so
I'm<00:02:07.590> turning<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.070> down

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:19.190

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.409 

right<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.020> keep<00:04:35.469> it<00:04:35.680> on<00:04:35.860> low<00:04:35.949> flame<00:04:36.789> this

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
right and you keep it on low flame this

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.260 
right and you keep it on low flame this
time<00:04:37.749> you're<00:04:38.559> gonna<00:04:38.680> wait<00:04:39.009> for<00:04:39.279> the<00:04:39.369> steam<00:04:39.879> to

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
time you're gonna wait for the steam to

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.159 
time you're gonna wait for the steam to
come<00:04:40.479> out<00:04:40.749> again<00:04:41.999> this<00:04:42.999> time<00:04:43.080> you're<00:04:44.080> gonna

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
come out again this time you're gonna

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.749 
come out again this time you're gonna
have<00:04:44.319> it<00:04:44.619> on<00:04:44.710> low<00:04:45.039> flame<00:04:46.619> and<00:04:47.619> the<00:04:48.159> reason<00:04:48.580> why

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
have it on low flame and the reason why

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.999 
have it on low flame and the reason why
I<00:04:48.789> like<00:04:49.059> flame<00:04:49.449> is<00:04:49.719> because<00:04:50.080> it<00:04:50.229> brews<00:04:50.529> better

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.510 

so<00:04:54.029> we'll<00:04:55.029> wait<00:04:55.240> for<00:04:55.629> that<00:04:56.110> seem<00:04:57.099> to<00:04:57.249> come<00:04:57.399> out

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
so we'll wait for that seem to come out

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.820 
so we'll wait for that seem to come out
