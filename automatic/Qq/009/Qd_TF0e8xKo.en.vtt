00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 clean to normal straight line to your liking 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.360
 This stitch length of three millimeters 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.200
 exactly level with the warehouse and mine here 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.219
 rib damaged place neatly 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.139
 on not ascend 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.000
 that's just a straight line because 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.570
 let's start it here 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.570
 semicircle 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.740
 before the damaged place 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:46.980
 Now we put the order and let it go 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.160
 we zigzag it with a zigzag 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.390
 wrap here is not suitable because 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.570
 there will be a strong thickening 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 width and 2 maxim address where there are two 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.180
 half three millimeter stitch length 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.080
 Now we will see how much she is she 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.979
 broadly wide and rubisko I'm happy he 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.979
 already built 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.010
 and 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:23.650
 2 2 bread should just kill our 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.650
 which line is older 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.770
 due completely what damage zone 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.770
 slippers 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.479
 look wear we talked about nothing with 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.930
 disney carving in no cut what 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.479
 strings 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.880
 they open seam this for that went off and 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.130
 check how out we all about 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.580
 scribbled like this right stretching 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:59.110
 we consider packs today we just 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.079
 studied or taken away moments yes that's evans 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.700
 poser little plain view cart 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:09.000
 who just got to the point with us 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.530
 appeared only in one place he is here 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.530
 close start this moment close 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.620
 already down there itâ€™s clear at once that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.660
 Usually zigzag did not suit us 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.890
 warrior usually 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:28.270
 have started to grab 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:32.709
 and check everything is already farther it is all 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:37.140
 close close ordinary bezam so we 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.300
 here here comes the stitching we see further 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.610
 what we do for this here for us 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.790
 scuff back and stitch and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.550
 sustain this your allowance for this 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.350
 we will need to lay like this 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.380
 a little more allowance here leave and 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.450
 lay so here already and now 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.760
 scribbling then it's all used how much 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.130
 so here we will have for this us 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.160
 you need to maximize this allowance 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.920
 we have it just so here you are 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.650
 let the country a large straight line 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.910
 as much as we can 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.910
 how much can brackets release 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:34.170
 on the most there now we are leaving as she and 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.170
 was either 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:52.020
 Now the task is to iron everything 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.020
 correctly and with a beautiful thread
