00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.230
 tie ties no easy 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.970
 I'll try it here 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.910
 to teach today 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.059
 starting with the double windsor the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.099
 Double windsor should be right-handed 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.420
 actually the long end on the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.369
 I have it on the right side 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.390
 However, we started to get used to it differently 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.189
 not surprised 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.680
 who so far with tie knots yet 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.449
 There's nothing wrong with it 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.619
 like me all others have to stop 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.119
 rethink a bit 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.920
 but that's it for the times 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.880
 no thought yet ties 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.199
 could bind 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.180
 the double windsor is one 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.130
 symmetrical knot which was why 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.879
 pretty good to very reputable occasions 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.460
 fits and he is to tie like this 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.100
 The long end will be over the short 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.670
 put one on that one 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.940
 part here is relatively short as 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.430
 orientation 15 centimeters approximately one 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.469
 further orientation is a near future 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.609
 the tie that can be fulfilled 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.270
 about half the length has 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.270
 this is approaching 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.130
 This position is laid over the short one 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.649
 end about here is the seam 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.560
 one holds with the left hand this 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.570
 point the loop here continue 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.729
 persists 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.979
 Now you have the tie on principle 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.530
 his right thigh and takes 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:31.819
 So it ends the long and leads it from 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.860
 down through the bend and it works out 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:40.490
 above it you wrap so in principle 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.649
 one time the tie around this 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.899
 partly once around 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.970
 Now the tie is on the right 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.750
 side one continues to keep the knot with 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.599
 the left 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.799
 Now you take the tie again and 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:57.640
 lead them through and here between 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.479
 chest and at his wrist 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.289
 Here we have the back 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:07.009
 tie the back of the tie 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:09.079
 Pointing to the neck points to the tie and 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.489
 is once again laid around here 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.489
 and pulled through 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.670
 now it should be like this 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.230
 It does not look like it does 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.370
 very clean but it is also 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.120
 that I just can not do it 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.640
 mirror she now has the tie 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.440
 here the outside the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.120
 inside of tie shows handy 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.739
 to the outside and that's not the case 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.430
 is and that you can not do that 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.860
 able to see 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.209
 you put the tie around this knot 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.549
 just over it 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.220
 So it's not a knot but a 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.489
 expectant knot now lies the tie 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.190
 on the left arm and we join in 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.900
 the right hand right again 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.849
 through the cavity between the chest and 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.319
 Wrist and get us the tie 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:03.079
 from here and lead them with the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:09.290
 inside of the tie off the body 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:12.920
 show through the bend on the neck of the 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.750
 It's all about it now 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.129
 the knot is completely taken 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.629
 tie yourself and do it 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.629
 the bend created here 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.300
 holds around the knot to get ready 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.020
 one with the left hand the short end 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:36.620
 and pull the one with the right hand 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:40.290
 Knot this is the double windsor 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.690
 Now you can still push me up 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.150
 I did not wear a shirt anymore 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.470
 You can see the knot here, too 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.180
 then about the shirt be then say 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.260
 The tie knot is from the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.150
 shirt collar covered gives a very nice 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.190
 picture behind also had enough space 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.040
 the short end in the intended 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.650
 loop 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.190
 that would be the double windsor you are allowed 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.670
 like to watch my folk videos 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.160
 Here we would have the half winery and 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.020
 here again the halm windsor with one 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.209
 thick tie the ties are 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.370
 harder to find 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.510
 I will be glad if you like the video 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.970
 a thumbs up if you are 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.460
 and if you like mine too 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.930
 would watch follow-up videos until then 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.980
 I wish you all the best and much success 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.980
 Tie the tie
