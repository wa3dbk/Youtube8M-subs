00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
advantage of such machines is that they

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.660 
advantage of such machines is that they
offer<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.280> big<00:01:56.729> saving<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.420> space<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.140> desk

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
offer a big saving on space on your desk

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.100 
offer a big saving on space on your desk
moreover<00:01:59.670> they're<00:02:00.060> easier<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> move<00:02:00.960> around

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
moreover they're easier to move around

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.499 
moreover they're easier to move around
and<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:02.100> usually<00:02:02.310> look<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:03.000> good<00:02:03.210> too

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and they usually look pretty good too

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.020 
and they usually look pretty good too
however<00:02:04.229> they<00:02:04.680> offer<00:02:04.890> much<00:02:05.219> less<00:02:05.460> upgrade

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
however they offer much less upgrade

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.150 
however they offer much less upgrade
options<00:02:06.509> than<00:02:06.869> conventional<00:02:07.380> desktop<00:02:07.530> towers

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
options than conventional desktop towers

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.070 
options than conventional desktop towers
so<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.700> probably<00:02:09.060> won't<00:02:09.300> matter<00:02:09.660> too<00:02:10.050> much

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
so this probably won't matter too much

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.010 
so this probably won't matter too much
