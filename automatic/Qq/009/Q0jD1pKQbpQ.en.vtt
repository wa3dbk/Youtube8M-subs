00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
torque and only 33 thousand RPM so what

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.270 
torque and only 33 thousand RPM so what
that<00:02:45.769> means<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.080> it's<00:02:48.440> zero<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.830> 60<00:02:49.220> in

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
that means is that it's zero to 60 in

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.870 
that means is that it's zero to 60 in
under<00:02:49.989> four<00:02:50.989> seconds<00:02:51.530> about<00:02:51.739> 3.8<00:02:52.430> seconds

under four seconds about 3.8 seconds

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.070 
under four seconds about 3.8 seconds
