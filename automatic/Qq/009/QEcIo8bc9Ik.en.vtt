00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 welcome everyone is dark on the canal 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.389
 radiators and I'm here with 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.309
 a world premiere world because 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.220
 truly world-wide you are not joking 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.800
 Here in this game is called or boe 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.010
 a game entirely conceived 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.260
 programmed drawn animated played e 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.660
 so that you have more 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.609
 from notri always radiators that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.440
 even a channel of his moves I leave it 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.380
 in the video descriptions and nothing 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.500
 this is a beautiful game here 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.300
 let's see in the meantime we immediately notice one 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.090
 graphic this celephais ding a lot 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.070
 I particularly like keeping up with 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.719
 times 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.440
 we immediately see a first quotation here 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.719
 so we can call it this 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.270
 little house that I don't know if anyone says 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.059
 something is known practically took 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.489
 cue from the crash house to crash 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.280
 bandicoot singing I also know that you can 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.600
 we immediately hear the sounds of this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.570
 very background music 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.680
 relaxing the waterfall down there with those 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.610
 very stylish water splashes 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.790
 Japanese I dare say I remember a lot 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:26.450
 okami here if we go down the sounds too 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.450
 of the jump that bends the no he says 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.140
 I can do too 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.960
 it's like they sodomized him here 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:41.869
 we hear instead of the attack is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.170
 clearly his dog he says no but it is 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.100
 one who did was instead is just one who 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.579
 does 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.340
 bao but let's go to the fence because 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.229
 I know it gets dirty I fell I am 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.240
 fell only dead flickers all yes 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.840
 return to the beginning here we see 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.239
 the respawn system and I want to go 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.869
 over the house I went to and to 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:08.030
 note and I'm flying 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.420
 but now I jump down 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.940
 and let's start playing right away, I would say 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:19.370
 Let's go to these bridges immediately 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.780
 very bastard I dare say unsafe 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.709
 when we are here immediately the first mob that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.030
 you bastard I killed him 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.980
 so much I know that life is not there but I know that 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.230
 so three strokes are life after three 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.470
 bodies will die and be restored as 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.510
 we have already seen before we see these 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.870
 molecules here that should be lives 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.859
 but I go down but we are stupid 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:56.049
 I said it big bastards anyway 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.049
 we continue to follow the hi both talk 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:04.120
 with this bastard here one shot 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.610
 because surely I did to him and shot 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.960
 shiny because they are very strong in the meantime 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.650
 we see here we can enter the waterfall 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.830
 and we find the second easter egg but the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.280
 real streng its more than anything else and 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.590
 we immediately see the sun's altar from the dark 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.850
 souls is a radiator because we are 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.890
 the radiators in megabits and you can 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.520
 cross it like a thing 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:39.290
 intangible an abstract thing almost not 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.870
 I know good traps I don't know there would be from 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.300
 speculate here but I don't feel like it then 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.400
 the fuck 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.820
 instead we see here for those who don't 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.950
 was aware of what it is practically of 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.160
 final fantasy that everyone will know already 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.490
 this is a great cactus here 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.270
 very well what happened to me 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.950
 wedged the camera into the textures 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.560
 but let's not get lost in it since 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.870
 this game as I said before is done 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.680
 completely from a person who still 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.500
 he didn't even finish college because 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.900
 that I do n't know that or maybe because day 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.310
 because I don't know a cad to fans ass in ot 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.959
 that card 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.750
 we ask for the bridge that there is a hole in the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.870
 half so I would not have to jump 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.610
 made me not fucked again 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.060
 I like to hear your voice when 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:38.699
 it was fun 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:42.360
 I was so impressed by this boss 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.840
 bossi reminds me a lot of doctor trophy e 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:52.590

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:55.830

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.580
 I'm so strong we see it here in the 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.039
