00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.690
 or the people 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.269
 how are you 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.049
 and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.759
 I'm a little nervous fearful this is not 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.599
 is a video like the one you are 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.599
 used to seeing 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.679
 you will already know work in the writing 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.779
 of a news channel and well the 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.320
 information and greatly influences 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.900
 corridors you find out about things 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.070
 sometimes not so important sometimes 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.070
 not so relevant 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.120
 Well, the information that came to my 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.120
 hands this time if you have me 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.920
 I do not know how to describe it is something that 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.570
 I needed to express is something that 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.650
 I needed to get out of me 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.650
 I am very afraid 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.730
 right now 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.430
 see my hands even 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.990
 when wanting to record this video 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.250
 I have words just 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.250
 I'm very afraid 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.840
 it's also like that I actually prefer 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.840
 protect my identity 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.930
 as you know this country 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:36.790
 good the country I believe that the whole world 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:39.350
 is controlled by a group of people 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.390
 it's not 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.840
 very broad is a group of people 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.470
 reduced powerful influencers 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.420
 impressively 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.150
 and good this world this country is 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.460
 controlled by these people who 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:00.980
 implant fashions implant trends and 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.860
 that basically tell us what it is that 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.820
 we should like it and what is it that we do not 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.380
 should like to tell us what to think 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.910
 we do not realize that because 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.670
 what 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.060
 we are stupid maybe we are 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.020
 some little machines that we get up and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.930
 we do what society dictates 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.239
 but there is a massive indoctrination 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.930
 of which we are victims and which is 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:36.329
 produced by these people at 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.329
 which I will call the nameless 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.010
 there is a theory 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.010
 around these subjects 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.440
 the reptilians I do not know if they have heard 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.770
 talk about them maybe many have 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.550
 delved into the deep internet in the 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.819
 deep web and they know a little about the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.890
 reptilians 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.239
 I also suppose you have heard 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.239
 of the Illuminati 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:17.780
 to say a fact the founders of usa 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.020
 George Washington his first president 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.610
 He was a renowned Illuminati 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.820
 in fact the dollar 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.750
 has the triangle that is the symbol of 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.819
 the Illuminati 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.680
 there are also the freemasons 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:42.389
 that control all digital commerce to 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.389
 through your site 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.800
 amazon 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.350
 forgiveness is difficult is difficult when you 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.350
 you start talking about things
