00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
right back so I've got a ance of fuel in
each<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.640> these<00:01:26.750> will<00:01:27.750> fire<00:01:28.080> them<00:01:28.290> off<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
each one of these will fire them off and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
each one of these will fire them off and
the<00:01:29.640> issue<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.000> I've<00:01:30.240> been<00:01:30.390> running<00:01:30.689> into<00:01:30.869> on

these completely rolled aluminum bottle

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.760 
these completely rolled aluminum bottle
stoves<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.869> put<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> cold<00:01:37.560> pot

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
stoves is that when you put the cold pot

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.190 
stoves is that when you put the cold pot
of<00:01:37.890> water<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:39.000> flame<00:01:39.329> dies<00:01:39.570> down<00:01:39.869> quite

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of water on it the flame dies down quite

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
of water on it the flame dies down quite
a<00:01:40.229> bit<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> tried<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.430> combat<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.090> by

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
a bit so I tried to combat that by

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.800 
a bit so I tried to combat that by
putting<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:43.220> pot<00:01:44.220> stand<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.820> top<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
putting a pot stand on top of this but I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.530 
putting a pot stand on top of this but I
lose<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> lot<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:46.649> flame<00:01:47.149> through<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> top

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
lose a lot of my flame through the top

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.840 
lose a lot of my flame through the top
because<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.110> putt<00:01:49.530> stained<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.340> pot<00:01:50.640> stain

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
because that putt stained the pot stain

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.770 
because that putt stained the pot stain
that<00:01:50.909> I've<00:01:51.060> been<00:01:51.149> using<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.659> relatively<00:01:52.409> thick

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
that I've been using is relatively thick

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.359 
that I've been using is relatively thick
so<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> had<00:01:54.990> flame<00:01:55.380> coming<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> side

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
so I had flame coming up out of the side

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.700 
so I had flame coming up out of the side
and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.119> seemed<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.689> cutting<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.590> my

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and it seemed to be cutting down on my

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.020 
and it seemed to be cutting down on my
burn<00:01:58.950> time<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> we'll<00:02:02.310> give<00:02:02.460> these<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> minute

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
burn time so we'll give these a minute

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.569 
burn time so we'll give these a minute
to<00:02:03.149> blossom<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.829> will<00:02:05.219> put<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
to blossom and then I will put the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.229 
to blossom and then I will put the
stoves<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.060> there<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:08.910> them<00:02:09.030> both

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
stoves on there so I have them both

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.440 
stoves on there so I have them both
blossomed<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.050> now<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.619> we'll<00:02:11.220> put<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
blossomed up now and we'll put the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.040 
blossomed up now and we'll put the
he<00:02:13.540> put<00:02:13.750> on<00:02:13.930> first<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.620> find<00:02:15.099> out<00:02:15.310> if<00:02:15.550> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
he put on first and find out if the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.600 
he put on first and find out if the
little<00:02:17.050> indentions<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.950> top<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.370> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.339 
little indentions on the top of the
stove<00:02:19.239> will<00:02:20.050> keep<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.530> from<00:02:20.940> dying<00:02:21.940> down<00:02:22.349> which

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
stove will keep it from dying down which

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.100 
stove will keep it from dying down which
that<00:02:23.590> looks<00:02:23.769> awesome<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.670> then<00:02:25.480> try<00:02:26.080> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
that looks awesome and then try the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.520 
that looks awesome and then try the
fosters<00:02:26.739> pot<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.519> that<00:02:31.530> buster

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
fosters pot and you can see that buster

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.620 
fosters pot and you can see that buster
spud<00:02:32.769> did<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> little<00:02:33.190> bit<00:02:33.340> better<00:02:33.489> this<00:02:33.760> time

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
spud did a little bit better this time

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.250 
spud did a little bit better this time
I<00:02:35.370> believe<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:38.310> flames<00:02:39.310> are<00:02:39.840> going<00:02:40.840> down<00:02:41.230> a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
I believe the flames are going down a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.470 
I believe the flames are going down a
little<00:02:41.560> bit<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.160> Foster's<00:02:42.700> pot<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.330> we'll

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
little bit on the Foster's pot so we'll

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.470 
little bit on the Foster's pot so we'll
have<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.720> pull<00:02:44.379> that<00:02:44.410> one<00:02:44.590> off<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.299> give<00:02:46.299> that

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
have to pull that one off and give that

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.300 
have to pull that one off and give that
a<00:02:46.510> second<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.080> heat<00:02:47.290> up<00:02:49.799> honey<00:02:50.799> pots<00:02:51.069> still

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
a second to heat up honey pots still

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.509 
a second to heat up honey pots still
going<00:02:51.670> strong<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.829> we'll<00:02:53.829> try<00:02:54.040> putting<00:02:54.370> this

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
going strong and we'll try putting this

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.420 
going strong and we'll try putting this
down<00:02:54.730> maybe<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:56.010> got<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.069> little<00:02:59.400> warmer<00:03:00.400> a

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
down maybe it got a little warmer a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.380 
down maybe it got a little warmer a
little<00:03:00.489> stronger<00:03:01.030> flame<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.880> still<00:03:04.209> looks

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
little stronger flame and it still looks

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.190 
little stronger flame and it still looks
like<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:04.750> dwindling<00:03:05.349> a<00:03:05.500> bit<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:10.810> looks<00:03:10.840> like

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
like it's dwindling a bit it looks like

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.600 
like it's dwindling a bit it looks like
it'll<00:03:11.349> hang<00:03:11.620> in<00:03:11.829> there

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
it'll hang in there

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:22.570 
it'll hang in there
will<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.540> Oh

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.680 

it<00:03:23.300> looks<00:03:23.480> like<00:03:23.600> it's<00:03:23.780> gonna<00:03:23.900> hang<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.290> there

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
it looks like it's gonna hang in there

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.710 
it looks like it's gonna hang in there
so<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:27.470> think<00:03:28.460> we've<00:03:28.670> proven<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.150> definitely

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
so I think we've proven that definitely

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.510 
so I think we've proven that definitely
having<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.110> indentions<00:03:30.800> in<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.040> top<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.430> the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
having the indentions in the top of the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.540 
having the indentions in the top of the
can<00:03:31.820> of<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.960> alcohol<00:03:33.380> stove<00:03:35.260> definitely<00:03:36.550> give

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
can of the alcohol stove definitely give

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.420 
can of the alcohol stove definitely give
it<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.730> smaller<00:03:38.060> space<00:03:38.570> for<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.710> cold<00:03:40.010> pot<00:03:40.250> to

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
it a smaller space for the cold pot to

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.990 
it a smaller space for the cold pot to
sit<00:03:40.670> on<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:42.140> not<00:03:42.380> cooling<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.610> entire

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
sit on so it's not cooling the entire

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.810 
sit on so it's not cooling the entire
alcohol<00:03:44.510> stove<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.340> putting<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.430> flame<00:03:46.670> out

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
alcohol stove and putting the flame out

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.130 
alcohol stove and putting the flame out
so<00:03:47.290> let's<00:03:48.290> just<00:03:48.560> see<00:03:49.240> see<00:03:50.240> if<00:03:50.330> that<00:03:50.600> hurts<00:03:50.840> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
so let's just see see if that hurts the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.670 
so let's just see see if that hurts the
boil<00:03:52.130> times<00:03:52.430> at<00:03:52.640> all<00:03:53.080> be<00:03:54.080> right<00:03:54.260> back<00:03:54.470> as<00:03:54.650> soon

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
boil times at all be right back as soon

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.900 
boil times at all be right back as soon
as<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.040> start<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.460> blow<00:03:56.740> so<00:03:57.740> I<00:03:57.770> want<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.130> catch

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
as you start to blow so I want to catch

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.170 
as you start to blow so I want to catch
this<00:03:59.240> as<00:03:59.540> best<00:04:00.020> I<00:04:00.200> can<00:04:00.260> when<00:04:00.740> it<00:04:00.860> happens<00:04:01.310> but

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
this as best I can when it happens but

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.370 
this as best I can when it happens but
it<00:04:03.140> looks<00:04:03.380> like<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.740> Heineken<00:04:04.160> pot<00:04:04.580> is

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
it looks like the Heineken pot is

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.740 
it looks like the Heineken pot is
already<00:04:06.380> coming<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:06.980> boil<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.750> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
already coming to a boil and the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.690 
already coming to a boil and the
Foster's<00:04:09.200> pot<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:09.560> way<00:04:09.709> behind<00:04:09.890> we<00:04:10.370> did<00:04:10.520> have

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
Foster's pot is way behind we did have

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.910 
Foster's pot is way behind we did have
to<00:04:10.820> juggle<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.270> foster<00:04:11.660> spot<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.260> little<00:04:12.740> bit

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
to juggle the foster spot a little bit

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.140 
to juggle the foster spot a little bit
to<00:04:13.600> get<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.959> sit<00:04:15.380> down<00:04:15.620> on<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.250> stove

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
to get it to sit down on the stove

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.110 
to get it to sit down on the stove
without<00:04:17.660> putting<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.230> flame<00:04:18.470> out<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.120> it

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
without putting the flame out and it

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.210 
without putting the flame out and it
looks<00:04:20.540> like<00:04:20.780> we're<00:04:20.989> starting<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.680> get<00:04:21.830> a<00:04:21.890> boil

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
looks like we're starting to get a boil

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.010 
looks like we're starting to get a boil
just<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.640> couple<00:04:22.820> seconds<00:04:23.240> away<00:04:23.360> from<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.810> roll

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
just a couple seconds away from the roll

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.580 
just a couple seconds away from the roll
there<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.850> foster<00:04:26.750> spots<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.200> little

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
there and the foster spots a little

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.520 
there and the foster spots a little
behind<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:30.640> think<00:04:31.640> it's<00:04:31.790> worth<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:33.380> go

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
behind it so I think it's worth it to go

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.820 
behind it so I think it's worth it to go
ahead<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:33.860> crimp<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.250> top<00:04:34.460> of<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.669> stove

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
ahead and crimp the top of the stove

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.020 
ahead and crimp the top of the stove
seems<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:37.010> make<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.160> lot<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.430> difference<00:04:37.850> there

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
seems to make a lot of difference there

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.850 
seems to make a lot of difference there
we<00:04:38.150> go<00:04:38.300> we<00:04:38.480> already<00:04:38.570> got<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.810> full<00:04:39.560> rolling

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
we go we already got the full rolling

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.850 
we go we already got the full rolling
boil<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:41.050> foster<00:04:42.050> spots<00:04:42.380> way<00:04:42.620> behind<00:04:43.010> it's

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
boil and foster spots way behind it's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.960 
boil and foster spots way behind it's
actually<00:04:45.860> no<00:04:46.010> it's<00:04:46.220> starting<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.669> get<00:04:46.760> there

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
actually no it's starting to get there

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.260 
actually no it's starting to get there
now<00:04:47.150> but<00:04:47.950> still<00:04:48.950> that<00:04:49.160> was<00:04:49.250> probably<00:04:49.520> 30

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
now but still that was probably 30

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.360 
now but still that was probably 30
seconds<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:52.870> so<00:04:53.870> getting<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.110> lot<00:04:54.320> of<00:04:54.370> pulsing

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
seconds and so getting a lot of pulsing

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.030 
seconds and so getting a lot of pulsing
and<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.850> flames<00:04:56.120> on<00:04:56.360> these<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.500> next<00:04:57.740> test

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
and the flames on these so the next test

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.060 
and the flames on these so the next test
will<00:04:58.280> be<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.850> add<00:04:59.600> a<00:04:59.630> couple<00:05:00.230> of<00:05:00.410> small<00:05:00.740> holes

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
will be to add a couple of small holes

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.030 
will be to add a couple of small holes
to<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.550> inside<00:05:02.240> of<00:05:02.540> the<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:03.470> inner<00:05:03.680> wall<00:05:04.010> of

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
to the inside of the the inner wall of

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.360 
to the inside of the the inner wall of
the<00:05:04.280> stove<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.390> see<00:05:05.600> if<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.870> can<00:05:06.110> alleviate<00:05:06.979> the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
the stove to see if I can alleviate the

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.530 
the stove to see if I can alleviate the
pressure<00:05:07.610> that's<00:05:07.970> building<00:05:08.270> up<00:05:08.540> in<00:05:08.720> there<00:05:08.930> and

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
pressure that's building up in there and

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.890 
pressure that's building up in there and
keep<00:05:11.540> that<00:05:11.720> pulsing<00:05:12.669> down<00:05:13.669> to<00:05:13.910> a<00:05:13.940> minimum<00:05:14.360> but

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
keep that pulsing down to a minimum but

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.159 
keep that pulsing down to a minimum but
I<00:05:15.970> think<00:05:16.970> we've<00:05:17.150> proven<00:05:17.419> what<00:05:17.750> we<00:05:17.870> wanted<00:05:18.110> to

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
I think we've proven what we wanted to

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.230 
I think we've proven what we wanted to
prove<00:05:18.229> here<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.450> thanks<00:05:20.450> for<00:05:20.570> watching

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
prove here and thanks for watching

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.330 
prove here and thanks for watching

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
so just for a little clarification as to

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:32.290 
so just for a little clarification as to
what<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:25.640> did<00:05:28.030> on<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:30.820> stove<00:05:31.820> that<00:05:31.850> had<00:05:32.210> the

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
Heineken pot on it I crimped that the

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.070 
Heineken pot on it I crimped that the
edge<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.390> it

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
edge of it

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.439

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.200 
is that that needlenose pliers that I
used<00:05:41.150> had<00:05:41.389> a<00:05:41.419> very<00:05:41.780> blunt<00:05:42.110> tip<00:05:42.500> on<00:05:42.710> them<00:05:43.000> if<00:05:44.000> you

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
used had a very blunt tip on them if you

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.629 
used had a very blunt tip on them if you
use<00:05:44.509> a<00:05:44.870> needlenose<00:05:45.620> plier<00:05:46.129> that<00:05:46.400> has<00:05:46.610> a

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
the actual crimping of the can but

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.409 
the actual crimping of the can but
definitely<00:06:10.220> proved<00:06:10.580> what<00:06:10.789> I<00:06:10.819> wanted<00:06:11.090> -<00:06:11.270> it

want to use it without a pot stand you

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.920 
want to use it without a pot stand you
definitely<00:06:25.729> need<00:06:25.880> to<00:06:25.909> crimp<00:06:26.270> this<00:06:26.479> and<00:06:26.810> it

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
definitely need to crimp this and it

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.129 
definitely need to crimp this and it
helps<00:06:27.440> your<00:06:27.560> boil<00:06:27.889> times<00:06:28.190> and<00:06:29.139> definitely

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
helps your boil times and definitely

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.980 
helps your boil times and definitely
improves<00:06:30.860> the<00:06:31.039> performance<00:06:31.190> of<00:06:31.789> the<00:06:32.030> alcohol

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
improves the performance of the alcohol

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.080 
improves the performance of the alcohol
stove<00:06:33.289> with<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.620> hiney<00:06:34.069> pot<00:06:34.370> or<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.639> fosters

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
stove with the hiney pot or the fosters

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.670 
stove with the hiney pot or the fosters
pot<00:06:35.330> I'm<00:06:35.479> sure<00:06:35.690> the<00:06:35.840> Fosters<00:06:36.199> pot<00:06:36.440> would<00:06:36.560> be

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
pot I'm sure the Fosters pot would be

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.100 
pot I'm sure the Fosters pot would be
the<00:06:36.800> same<00:06:37.039> but<00:06:37.610> it<00:06:38.150> definitely<00:06:38.330> will<00:06:38.840> be<00:06:38.900> an

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
the same but it definitely will be an

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.850 
the same but it definitely will be an
addition<00:06:40.900> additional<00:06:41.900> step<00:06:42.199> that<00:06:42.229> I<00:06:42.409> add<00:06:42.590> to

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
addition additional step that I add to
