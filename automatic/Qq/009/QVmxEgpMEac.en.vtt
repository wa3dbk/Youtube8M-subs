fitness so let's talk about lying tricep
extensions<00:01:03.329> before<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:04.019> into<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
extensions before I get into how I

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.320 
extensions before I get into how I
reduce<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.049> likelihood<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:08.159> I'm<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
reduce the likelihood that I'm going to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330 
reduce the likelihood that I'm going to
pick<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.540> elbow<00:01:10.049> issues<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.650> lying<00:01:10.860> tricep

extensions I want to explain something

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
extensions I want to explain something
most<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> guys<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> lying<00:01:14.970> tricep

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
most of you guys do the lying tricep

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
most of you guys do the lying tricep
extensions<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.530> skull<00:01:16.860> crushers

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
extensions like this skull crushers

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
extensions like this skull crushers
right<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> your<00:01:17.880> face<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> functions

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
right to your face one of the functions

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.969 
right to your face one of the functions
of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> long<00:01:20.189> head<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.850> tricep<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.979> not

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of the long head of the tricep is not

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.890 
of the long head of the tricep is not
just<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.610> extend<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.530> rotate<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
just to extend but it is to rotate the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.740 
just to extend but it is to rotate the
arm<00:01:27.900> down<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.240> skull

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
arm down like this so I do skull

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
arm down like this so I do skull
crushers<00:01:31.229> back<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.700> top<00:01:32.939> of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
crushers back here to about the top of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.749 
crushers back here to about the top of
the<00:01:33.240> head<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:34.340> incorporates<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.579> two

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the head that incorporates the two

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.670 
the head that incorporates the two
functions<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> long<00:01:36.659> head<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> tricep

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
functions of the long head of the tricep

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.630 
functions of the long head of the tricep
rotation<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.850> extension<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.400> if<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.549> ever

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
rotation and extension so if you ever

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 
rotation and extension so if you ever
see<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> video<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.420> me<00:01:42.720> doing<00:01:42.899> lying<00:01:43.530> tricep

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
see a video of me doing lying tricep

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.370 
see a video of me doing lying tricep
extensions<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:45.000> why<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.720> actually

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
extensions that's why I actually

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
extensions that's why I actually
recommend<00:01:46.829> doing<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:48.240> like

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
recommend doing them like that not like

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.990 
recommend doing them like that not like
skull<00:01:48.810> crushers<00:01:49.350> okay<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> back<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
skull crushers okay but to the back of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.520 
skull crushers okay but to the back of
the<00:01:51.060> head<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.540> about<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:51.990> top<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the head just about to the top of the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.120 
the head just about to the top of the
head<00:01:52.680> rotate<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.759> extend<00:01:54.320> rotate<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.619> extend

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
head rotate and extend rotate and extend

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.230 
head rotate and extend rotate and extend
so<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.180> said<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:58.100> I<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.280> too<00:01:59.340> heavy<00:01:59.939> too

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
so with that said if I go too heavy too

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.319 
so with that said if I go too heavy too
often<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:00.960> lying<00:02:01.710> tricep<00:02:02.369> extensions<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.090> tend

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
often on lying tricep extensions I tend

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.660 
often on lying tricep extensions I tend
to<00:02:03.420> pick<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.810> elbow<00:02:04.439> tenderness<00:02:05.009> elbow

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to pick up elbow tenderness elbow
