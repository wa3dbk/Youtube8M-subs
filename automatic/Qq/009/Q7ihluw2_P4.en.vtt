upcoming<00:00:40.800> weeks<00:00:40.949> but<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:42.059> think<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.019> he<00:00:43.109> had

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:43.319 
upcoming weeks but I think what he had

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.979 
upcoming weeks but I think what he had
to<00:00:43.440> say<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.829> true<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.760> honestly<00:00:45.600> dancing

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
to say was true but honestly dancing

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.389 
to say was true but honestly dancing
that<00:00:46.109> dance<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.679> of<00:00:46.769> my<00:00:46.829> favorite<00:00:47.069> dances

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that dance was one of my favorite dances

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:50.959
