I<00:02:05.750> used<00:02:06.409> it<00:02:06.619> as<00:02:06.740> breadcrumbs<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.579> outside

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
I used it as breadcrumbs on the outside

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.280 
I used it as breadcrumbs on the outside
well<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.259> time<00:02:09.530> I'm<00:02:09.769> putting<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.220> in<00:02:11.049> so<00:02:12.049> I'm

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
well this time I'm putting it in so I'm

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.680 
well this time I'm putting it in so I'm
probably<00:02:12.319> going<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.400> put<00:02:13.700> see<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.510> never

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
probably going to put see I never

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.600 
probably going to put see I never
measure<00:02:15.080> that's<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:15.560> problem<00:02:15.769> with<00:02:16.099> recipe

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
measure that's the problem with recipe

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.309 
measure that's the problem with recipe
intuition<00:02:17.269> I'm<00:02:17.480> probably<00:02:17.750> going<00:02:18.019> to<00:02:18.110> put

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
intuition I'm probably going to put

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.600 
intuition I'm probably going to put
maybe<00:02:20.319> yeah<00:02:21.319> probably

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
maybe yeah probably

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.990 
maybe yeah probably
two<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.750> half<00:02:23.989> heaping<00:02:24.830> tablespoons<00:02:25.730> of

that<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.420> there<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:29.720> we're<00:02:29.870> going

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
that in there and then what we're going

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.270 
that in there and then what we're going
to<00:02:30.170> do<00:02:30.549> is<00:02:31.549> add<00:02:32.000> enough<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.079> garbanzo<00:02:34.069> bean

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
to do is add enough of the garbanzo bean

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.360 
to do is add enough of the garbanzo bean
flour<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:35.209> chickpea<00:02:35.630> flour<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.560> make<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:36.950> into

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
flour the chickpea flour to make it into

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.150 
flour the chickpea flour to make it into
a<00:02:37.400> thick<00:02:38.000> paste<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.900> then<00:02:39.440> we'll<00:02:39.680> check<00:02:39.920> back

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
a thick paste and then we'll check back

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.720 
a thick paste and then we'll check back
and<00:02:40.370> I'll<00:02:40.489> show<00:02:40.519> you<00:02:40.670> what<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:40.970> do<00:02:41.060> from<00:02:41.360> there

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and I'll show you what I do from there

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.280 
and I'll show you what I do from there
all<00:02:43.730> right<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.180> got<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.629> to<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> nice<00:02:44.959> thick

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
all right so I got it to a nice thick

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.920 
all right so I got it to a nice thick
consistency<00:02:45.470> now<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.640> what<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.790> do<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.510> take

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
consistency now and what I do is I take

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.460 
consistency now and what I do is I take
my<00:02:48.280> ice<00:02:49.280> cream<00:02:49.670> size<00:02:49.940> scoop<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:51.019> hard<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.349> do

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
my ice cream size scoop it's hard to do

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.680

you want to do is you just want to form

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.830 
you want to do is you just want to form
it<00:03:07.609> into<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.930> crab<00:03:09.319> cake<00:03:09.620> sighs<00:03:10.100> patty<00:03:10.840> and

it into like a crab cake sighs patty and
you<00:03:11.959> don't<00:03:12.109> need<00:03:12.260> any<00:03:12.500> egg<00:03:13.280> or<00:03:13.700> any<00:03:13.880> milk<00:03:14.150> or

anything to put the bread crumbs on
because<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.489> mixture<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:17.000> like<00:03:17.150> really

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
because the mixture is like really

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.879 
because the mixture is like really
sticky<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:20.139> it's<00:03:21.139> basically<00:03:21.500> like<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.769> little

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
hockey puck so I've got my pan over here

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.309

whole<00:03:27.590> plate<00:03:27.919> of<00:03:28.190> ones<00:03:28.700> that<00:03:28.910> I've<00:03:29.000> already

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
whole plate of ones that I've already

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.940 
whole plate of ones that I've already
prepared<00:03:29.780> over<00:03:30.079> here<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.440> goes<00:03:30.709> really

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
prepared over here this goes really

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.170 
prepared over here this goes really
quickly<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:33.709> takes<00:03:33.950> like<00:03:34.220> no<00:03:34.430> time<00:03:34.790> at<00:03:35.030> all

had<00:04:05.470> this<00:04:05.620> one<00:04:05.830> before<00:04:06.010> already<00:04:06.550> I<00:04:06.930> really

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
had this one before already I really

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.340 
had this one before already I really
wish<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.560> could<00:04:09.780> figure<00:04:10.780> out<00:04:10.960> a<00:04:11.110> way<00:04:11.320> to

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
wish that I could figure out a way to

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.990 
wish that I could figure out a way to
make<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:11.800> on<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.010> Forman<00:04:12.490> grill<00:04:12.520> because

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
make this on the Forman grill because

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.330 
make this on the Forman grill because
then<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:13.780> probably<00:04:14.230> wouldn't<00:04:14.830> use<00:04:15.010> as<00:04:15.160> much

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
then it probably wouldn't use as much

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.970 
then it probably wouldn't use as much
oil<00:04:15.580> and<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.900> still<00:04:17.230> want<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.470> have<00:04:17.650> like<00:04:17.830> that

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
oil and I still want to have like that

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.890 
oil and I still want to have like that
crispy<00:04:18.370> texture<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.209> what'd<00:04:19.600> you<00:04:19.690> think<00:04:19.810> about
