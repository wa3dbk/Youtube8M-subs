00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.589
 welcome to him and gomez in this that are 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.699
 we will make a comparison between the bi 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:26.320
 mobile x 512 and samsung galaxy 6 the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.849
 which we hope you can know what 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.849
 best of each of both devices 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 in that it has 112 points four thousand 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 meters high and eleven points 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.180
 3.5 inch with resolution 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.010
 500 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.729
 the screen is 3.5 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.630
 with resolution hd mahéas I did not put the 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.729
 panic pressure 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.619
 as for the design of both are models 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.659
 pretty similar phones that 'do not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.789
 same with touch screen being in my 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.479
 mobile a little thicker than the samsung 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.479
 happy galaxy 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.530
 the camera is 5 megapixels with flash 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.530
 led does not have field 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.640
 in the section of each chamber 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.630
 has his thing samsung galaxy is like 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.610
 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.619
 an autofocus while the gib 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.630
 mobile with 3 megapixel camera and 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.729
 improve automatic both with led flash 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.710
 being in better condition obviously 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.810
 the one of samsung galaxy days for its best 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.140
 resolution although the camera is forgotten 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.610
 frontal what the mobile ax 512 has 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.040
 which encourages us to shape 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.830
 Selfish plus they are extra thanking 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.319
 above all a very comfortable prisoner of 55 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.730
 dollars compared to 150 and it cost 6 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.730
 Three years ago 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.209
 Y 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.270
 how 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.270
 how 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.790
 227 from others 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.430
 in terms of memory 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.930
 memory is a very important issue the 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.349
 samsung galaxy days with just 158 ​​megs 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.430
 of free memory and the mobile bi with 1.8 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.430
 gigabyte of the user 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:37.100
 the 1150 milliamp battery 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.100
 supported by the battery 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.800
 as for the battery they are quite 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.900
 similar the leis were thousand 350 thousand 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.240
 empires the mobile with thousand 900 thousand 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.940
 pretty similar empires in this 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.520
 about that comparison 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.050
 the way how it has evolved 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.160
 phones 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.160
 what happened in the old 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.160
 do not
