00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 remember the vinyl records that 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.490
 fell into disuse with the arrival of CB 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.370
 because it is after an out of fashion time 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.679
 they are back a record company 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
 replaced the format on the market with a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.699
 national pop rock collection 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.039
 good news for those who do not know 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.039
 accustomed to the sound of digital media 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.880
 the record players are prominent in the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.789
 home of the journalist bento araújo he is 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.140

 Vinyl's Discs 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.309
 the first lp was acquired in 1984 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.660
 album is from the band scorpions inside had 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.489
 seven years 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.470
 some international bands came from 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.440
 brazil beginning of years 80 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.839
 the first contact was with that in 81 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.120
 soon I'll scratch and quiz you later 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.150
 had the tire first edition in January 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.580
 85 then this caused a huge furor 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.589
 between the kids there at the time and 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.290
 a lot of people started listening to rock and enjoy 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.810
 collects discs and that's when I started 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.869
 today the collection has approximately 3 thousand 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.689
 titles and many rarities like this 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.490
 Tones Original flights 1967 with cover 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.960
 holographic inside is not averse to new 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.780
 technologies 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.770
 but for him the sound of vinyl does not have 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.310
 equal to that serious dramatic sound is another 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.310
 thing like that 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.530
 the sound packed the dance floors in the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.300
 the 70s and 80s but the LP came 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.730
 in the 50's 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.190
 the disc is made of plastic vinyl and 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.040
 has grooves that guide the needle 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.370
 turntable vibration is transformed into 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.130
 electrical signal and then sound at the end 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.220
 80's invention of the disco complex 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.350
 cd promised greater capacity 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.830
 durability and sound clarity and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.620
 called wafers have just been replaced 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.950
 today in the technology era the media 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.270
 have invaded the market and 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.420
 further distanced the new 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.670
 generations of the old analogue 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.670
 low of the internet was a device he 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.240
 cell return plans 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.390
 the red hot villain the court has presence of the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.520
 he has said that the dollar in Brazil 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.820
 last recorder closed the production of 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.709
 vinyl in 1998 but contrary to what 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.020
 a lot of people imagined they would not 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.880
 disappeared from the market produced in 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.430
 smallest scale in the world the video 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.410
 became a rarity and object of worship 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.430
 among those who never stopped 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.830
 enjoy it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.260
 The businessman Luiz leverages a fierce 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.230
 vinyl defender he owns a store 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.690
 in São Paulo with more than 90 thousand titles 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.239
 part was acquired just when the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.130
 lp production went into crisis 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.630
 I made a great economic turn of the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.700
 my life what do you want to say? 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.860
 even cd so i started investing in ccb 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.750
 and bid in return for vinyl 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.670
 hence I was the best deal of my life is 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.920
 My subject doubled it. 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.140
 according to Luísa, he looks for weight. 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.269
 big but that's because his store is 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.180
 specialized and has a very 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.519
 specific squad still buy the disc 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.620
 39 exchange but I think it cool to have the idol 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.019
 with drugs in the room in Colombia in the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.750
 I do not know how to listen to a lot of 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.280
 pretty cover because of this but have the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.980
 people who appreciate have a lot of 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.730
 genetics that likes to listen with vinyl 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.840
 that I am really is much more vibrant 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.960
 It's even for bingo, so it's e. 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.350
 collectors researchers 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.580
 Boy, how come it's one thing? 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.400
 equable right 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.320
 is much better worked booklet 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.620
 That thing then for who really 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.590
 like in the non-abandonment of the market 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.440
 a national record label reopened 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.050
 the doors and now launches the four 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.950
 the first discs of the new 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.610
 all of the nation 's pop rock national zombie 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.400
 big dog 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.680
 pitty and fernanda takai the re-releases 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.650
 already successful 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.170
 I find a trace of nostalgia that is 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.260
 interesting is almost a romanticism of and 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.300
 the very short for the sonority by 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.360
 quality and maintain that tradition of 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:27.400
 vinyl that big disco of you see 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.400
 so to attachments all together
