you<00:04:09.629> want<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.870> ramp<00:04:10.049> up<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:11.189> rejuvenation<00:04:11.909> and

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
you want to ramp up to rejuvenation and

then Swift men the reason for this is

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.709 
then Swift men the reason for this is
