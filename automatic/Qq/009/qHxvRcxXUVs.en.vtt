as you can see Rosco uses reflective

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.479 
as you can see Rosco uses reflective
tape<00:02:59.720> on<00:02:59.930> his<00:03:00.080> floats<00:03:00.470> which<00:03:00.950> makes<00:03:01.220> them<00:03:01.400> a

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
tape on his floats which makes them a

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.339 
tape on his floats which makes them a
lot<00:03:01.849> easier<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:02.390> pick<00:03:02.540> out<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:02.930> amongst<00:03:03.260> all

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
lot easier to pick out in amongst all

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.800 
lot easier to pick out in amongst all
the<00:03:03.500> other<00:03:03.650> floats<00:03:03.980> out<00:03:04.159> there<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.540> they<00:03:05.659> were

the other floats out there and they were

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:16.699 
the other floats out there and they were
quite<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> lot<00:03:06.349> of<00:03:06.470> other<00:03:06.590> pops<00:03:07.159> out<00:03:07.400> there

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.740 

we'll<00:03:17.280> use<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.459> few<00:03:17.760> different<00:03:18.030> styles<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.480> pots

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
we'll use a few different styles of pots
