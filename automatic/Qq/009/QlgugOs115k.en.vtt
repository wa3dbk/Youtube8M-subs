repair with me for the spacer to be a
horizontal<00:01:44.770> piece<00:01:45.219> of<00:01:45.399> wood<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:47.409> easy

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
horizontal piece of wood that it's easy

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.800 
horizontal piece of wood that it's easy
to<00:01:47.950> install<00:01:48.219> if<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:49.030> just<00:01:49.210> put<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.570> piece<00:01:49.780> of

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
to install if you just put the piece of

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.980 
to install if you just put the piece of
wood<00:01:50.109> on<00:01:50.350> top<00:01:50.409> of<00:01:51.009> these<00:01:51.219> and<00:01:51.750> find<00:01:52.750> us<00:01:52.960> a

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
wood on top of these and find us a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.740 
wood on top of these and find us a
common<00:01:53.649> stud<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.759> can<00:01:54.939> screw<00:01:55.299> into<00:01:55.539> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
common stud that you can screw into the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.620 
common stud that you can screw into the
spacer<00:01:56.350> so<00:01:57.070> that<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.369> never<00:01:57.640> comes<00:01:57.789> dislodged

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
spacer so that it never comes dislodged

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.840 
spacer so that it never comes dislodged
in<00:01:58.929> the<00:01:59.020> middle<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.710> shaker<00:02:00.009> an<00:02:00.340> earthquake

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
in the middle of a shaker an earthquake

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.620 
in the middle of a shaker an earthquake
so<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.719> should<00:02:01.960> put<00:02:02.109> a<00:02:02.170> spacer<00:02:02.770> at<00:02:03.759> about<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
so you should put a spacer at about the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.660 
so you should put a spacer at about the
same<00:02:04.840> places<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.710> water<00:02:05.920> heater<00:02:06.159> is<00:02:06.310> strapped

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
same places the water heater is strapped

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.450 
same places the water heater is strapped
it's<00:02:06.969> very<00:02:07.210> easy<00:02:07.450> if<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:07.810> say

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
it's very easy if you just say

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.100 
it's very easy if you just say
spacer<00:02:08.940> Ottomans<00:02:09.450> screw<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:12.540> important

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
spacer Ottomans screw in it's important

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.740 
spacer Ottomans screw in it's important
that<00:02:13.350> we<00:02:13.980> take<00:02:14.190> every<00:02:14.520> precaution<00:02:14.690> not<00:02:15.690> to

that we take every precaution not to
have<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> water<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.740> gas<00:02:16.920> disconnected

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
have the water of the gas disconnected

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
with a positive connection so we would

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.900 
with a positive connection so we would
put<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> piece<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.840> wood<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.380> here<00:03:31.910> nailed
