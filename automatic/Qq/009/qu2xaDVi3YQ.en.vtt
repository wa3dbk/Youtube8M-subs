00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:27.420
 product of powers of equal bases 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:33.420
 to the m by a n is the same 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.760
 and has raised to the exponent m more n is 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.260
 to say the exponents add 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.430
 examples 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:50.710
 2 squared by 2 to the cube is equal 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.900
 a 2 raised to the exponent 23 adding 23 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.500
 we obtain 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.590
 2 to exponent 5 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.320
 exponent 5 tells us that base 2 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:09.860
 must multiply 5 times 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:12.280
 operating the result is 32 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.000
 another example 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.840
 - 3 to exponent 1 for minus 3 to 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.560
 square 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:27.740
 the exponents minus 3 are added to the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:31.210
 exponent 12 operand 123 we would have 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.010
 minus 3 cubed 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.800
 developing less 3 to the cube you get 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.800
 as a result minus 27 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.120
 Equal base power ratio 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.920
 to the m / a to the n is equal 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.720
 raised to the exponent m - n 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.740
 ej 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.390
 - 5 to the fourth between minus 5 to 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.170
 square 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.700
 subtract the exponents we would have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.700
 minus 5 to exponent 4 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.450
 two 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.879
 operating four minus two gives us two 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.879
 then you have minus 5 squared 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:37.120
 operating minus 5 squared minus 5 x 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.120
 minus 5 we get as a result 25 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.190
 power of power 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.560
 to the exponent m all raised to the exponent 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.040
 n 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.200
 will be equal to a multiply the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:01.660
 exponents m by n 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.120
 example minus 4 cubed all elevated to 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.690
 square 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:12.560
 multiply 3 by 2 minus 4 at 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.730
 exponent 3 for 2 operand 3 for 2 us 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.730
 gives 6 you have minus 4 to the sixth the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.860
 number 6 tells us that the base minus 4 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.710
 multiply 6 times 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:31.010
 operating is obtained at the end as 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.010
 result plus 4,000 96
