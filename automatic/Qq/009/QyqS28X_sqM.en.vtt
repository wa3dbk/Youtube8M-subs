00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.780 

there<00:00:08.410> was<00:00:08.650> a<00:00:08.680> time<00:00:09.070> when<00:00:09.340> we<00:00:09.490> couldn't

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
there was a time when we couldn't

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.609 
there was a time when we couldn't
imagine<00:00:10.180> anything<00:00:11.080> ever<00:00:11.320> changing

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:31.630 

even<00:00:18.619> that<00:00:18.800> we<00:00:19.100> would<00:00:19.490> change

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.060 

and<00:00:32.640> then<00:00:33.740> it<00:00:34.740> happened<00:00:35.250> after<00:00:35.700> all

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
and then it happened after all

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.900 
and then it happened after all
inevitably

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.460 

we've<00:00:45.540> gained<00:00:46.020> weight<00:00:47.360> intellectually<00:00:48.470> and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
we've gained weight intellectually and

00:00:49.470 --> 00:01:22.200 
we've gained weight intellectually and
in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.070> places<00:00:51.230> hopefully

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:37.030 

yes<00:01:23.210> we're<00:01:24.080> grown-ups<00:01:24.560> now<00:01:25.120> mature<00:01:26.860> sensible

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.910 

but<00:01:38.040> could<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:38.550> be<00:01:38.580> something<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.630> us<00:01:39.920> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
but could there be something in us that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:57.250 
but could there be something in us that
has<00:01:41.100> stayed<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:41.580> same

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:08.990 

something<00:01:58.260> that<00:01:58.440> drives<00:01:58.860> us<00:01:59.280> deep<00:01:59.820> down

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.600 

something<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.210> keeps<00:02:10.450> us<00:02:10.780> young<00:02:11.230> and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
something that keeps us young and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.450 
something that keeps us young and
revitalizes<00:02:12.610> us<00:02:16.710> something<00:02:17.710> that<00:02:17.860> Spurs<00:02:18.190> us

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
revitalizes us something that Spurs us

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
revitalizes us something that Spurs us
on<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.210> our<00:02:19.510> best<00:02:28.410> time<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.830> again

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:03:08.690 

no<00:02:35.019> matter<00:02:35.230> how<00:02:35.560> old<00:02:35.590> we<00:02:36.040> are

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.199 

it<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:10.120> our<00:03:10.480> core<00:03:10.959> values<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.860> define<00:03:12.640> our

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
it is our core values that define our

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.500 
it is our core values that define our
character<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.580> inner<00:03:15.849> strength<00:03:16.390> that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
character it is this inner strength that

00:03:16.510 --> 00:04:31.750 
character it is this inner strength that
makes<00:03:16.870> us<00:03:17.230> who<00:03:17.650> we<00:03:17.680> are

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.120 

this<00:04:32.360> is<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.810> only<00:04:32.960> way<00:04:33.290> we<00:04:33.590> can<00:04:33.800> keep

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
this is the only way we can keep

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.320 
this is the only way we can keep
developing<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:35.060> yet<00:04:35.920> remain<00:04:36.920> true<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
developing and yet remain true to

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:50.800 
developing and yet remain true to
ourselves<00:04:40.360> like<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.570> new<00:04:41.810> 911

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810
