leave this a little incline right here
the<00:01:23.730> only<00:01:23.940> way<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.120> get<00:01:24.300> this<00:01:24.390> incline<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:25.080> like

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
the only way to get this incline up like

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.550 
the only way to get this incline up like
this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.330> lay<00:01:27.330> around<00:01:27.480> here<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> lay<00:01:28.410> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
this is to lay around here and lay it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.460 
this is to lay around here and lay it
out<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.190> erases<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.910> up<00:01:30.470> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
out here and that erases that up so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.220 
out here and that erases that up so
you've<00:01:32.100> got<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.520> lay<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> two<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.690> then<00:01:33.810> take

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
you've got to lay the two and then take

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.800 
you've got to lay the two and then take
back<00:01:34.410> one<00:01:36.200> I'm<00:01:37.200> also<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.010> put<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.120> a

block and two blocks there and I'm going
to<00:01:44.760> put<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:44.970> switch<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:48.050> that

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
to put a switch right here and that

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.700 
to put a switch right here and that
momentarily<00:01:49.710> activates<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.410> powered<00:01:52.410> rail

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
momentarily activates that powered rail

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.000 
momentarily activates that powered rail
and<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:54.320> important<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.440> we'll<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:55.860> a

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.700 
and I'm gonna put a butt in there all
right<00:03:14.240> now<00:03:17.480> these<00:03:18.480> power<00:03:18.840> rails<00:03:19.340> will<00:03:20.340> move<00:03:20.670> I

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
right now these power rails will move I

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:30.470 
right now these power rails will move I
need<00:03:22.710> to<00:03:22.830> put<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:28.490> need<00:03:29.490> to<00:03:29.610> put<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> powered<00:03:30.210> rail

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
need to put I need to put a powered rail

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.650 
need to put I need to put a powered rail
right<00:03:30.840> there<00:03:34.820> these<00:03:35.820> power<00:03:36.150> rails<00:03:36.450> will

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
right there these power rails will

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.160 
right there these power rails will
actually<00:03:37.110> push<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:38.360> minecart<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:39.660> you've<00:03:39.810> got

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
actually push a minecart but you've got

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.110 
actually push a minecart but you've got
to<00:03:40.380> have<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:43.680> start<00:03:44.130> off<00:03:44.310> somehow<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.060> you

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
to have it start off somehow and you

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.880 
to have it start off somehow and you
need<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> slope<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.840> start<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.350> off<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.710> that's

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
need a slope to start it off and that's

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.380 
need a slope to start it off and that's
that's<00:03:47.220> why<00:03:47.340> we<00:03:47.490> put<00:03:47.670> these<00:03:47.790> things<00:03:48.060> here<00:03:48.270> on

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
that's why we put these things here on

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.840 
that's why we put these things here on
the<00:03:48.570> end<00:03:48.720> as<00:03:48.990> they<00:03:49.800> are<00:03:49.980> these<00:03:50.160> are<00:03:50.310> powered

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
the end as they are these are powered

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.780 
the end as they are these are powered
rails<00:03:51.090> right<00:03:51.390> here<00:03:51.680> so<00:03:52.680> if<00:03:53.460> I<00:03:54.000> hit<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.840> switch

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.670 

it<00:03:59.790> will<00:03:59.940> power<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.600> there<00:04:00.780> now<00:04:01.110> let's<00:04:01.530> get

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
it will power it to there now let's get

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.610 
it will power it to there now let's get
rid<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.920> this<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:03.660> one<00:04:03.810> thing<00:04:03.960> I<00:04:04.050> forgot<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.590> I

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
rid of this the one thing I forgot is I

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.710 
rid of this the one thing I forgot is I
need<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.040> put<00:04:06.440> some<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> these<00:04:07.620> torches<00:04:08.040> next

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
need to put some of these torches next

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.810 
need to put some of these torches next
to<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.840> powered<00:04:10.200> rails<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:11.220> power<00:04:11.400> up<00:04:11.640> these

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
to the powered rails to power up these

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.030 
to the powered rails to power up these
sections<00:04:12.300> of<00:04:12.480> track<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:16.350> these<00:04:16.500> sections<00:04:16.920> of

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
sections of track so these sections of

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.400 
sections of track so these sections of
track<00:04:17.280> are<00:04:17.460> powered<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.480> ones<00:04:18.690> on<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.960> ends

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
track are powered the ones on the ends

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.289 
track are powered the ones on the ends
are<00:04:19.620> only<00:04:19.890> powered<00:04:20.310> when<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.700> switch<00:04:21.000> goes

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
are only powered when that switch goes

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.840 
are only powered when that switch goes
in<00:04:21.510> momentarily<00:04:24.920> so<00:04:25.920> this<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.220> what<00:04:26.400> happens

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
in momentarily so this is what happens

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.070 
in momentarily so this is what happens
we<00:04:27.000> press<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.510> switch

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.430 

and<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.560> clerk<00:04:35.800> goes<00:04:36.009> all<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.280> way<00:04:36.430> down<00:04:36.759> here

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
and the clerk goes all the way down here

and the clerk goes all the way down here
to<00:04:38.440> this<00:04:38.590> rail<00:04:39.539> and<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:40.660> stops<00:04:40.990> here<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.530> if<00:04:41.590> we

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
to this rail and it stops here and if we

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:51.090 
to this rail and it stops here and if we
push<00:04:41.919> this<00:04:42.130> switch<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:45.280> will<00:04:45.460> go<00:04:45.580> back<00:04:49.169> now<00:04:50.169> by

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
push this switch it will go back now by

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.590 
push this switch it will go back now by
right-clicking<00:04:51.639> on<00:04:51.820> this<00:04:52.000> we<00:04:52.150> can<00:04:52.300> hop<00:04:52.479> in<00:04:52.810> and

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
right-clicking on this we can hop in and

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.529 
right-clicking on this we can hop in and
we<00:04:55.600> can<00:04:55.780> press<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.050> switch<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.910> go<00:04:58.300> for<00:04:58.509> a

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
we can press the switch and go for a

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.020 
we can press the switch and go for a
little<00:04:58.750> ride<00:04:59.460> when<00:05:00.460> we<00:05:00.520> get<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.759> the<00:05:00.850> other<00:05:00.940> end

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
little ride when we get to the other end

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:15.629 
little ride when we get to the other end
it<00:05:01.270> stops<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:03.610> we<00:05:03.699> can<00:05:03.850> go<00:05:03.970> back

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.730 

and<00:05:16.300> if<00:05:16.449> we<00:05:16.569> right-click<00:05:16.810> on<00:05:17.169> this<00:05:17.289> again<00:05:17.560> we

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
and if we right-click on this again we

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.290 
and if we right-click on this again we
hop<00:05:17.949> out<00:05:18.240> alright<00:05:19.240> so<00:05:19.300> that's<00:05:19.689> a<00:05:19.900> basic<00:05:20.139> track

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
hop out alright so that's a basic track

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.600 
hop out alright so that's a basic track
with<00:05:22.300> like<00:05:22.539> two<00:05:23.319> little<00:05:23.620> end<00:05:23.800> stations<00:05:24.370> where

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
with like two little end stations where

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.860 
with like two little end stations where
you<00:05:24.639> can<00:05:24.849> move<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.120> cart<00:05:25.389> back<00:05:25.689> and<00:05:25.960> forth<00:05:27.870> the

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
you can move a cart back and forth the

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.659 
you can move a cart back and forth the
thing<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.199> remember<00:05:29.319> is<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:30.069> need<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:30.310> put

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
thing to remember is you need to put

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.589 
thing to remember is you need to put
powered<00:05:31.150> tracks<00:05:31.539> every<00:05:32.439> so<00:05:32.620> often<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:34.419> can

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
powered tracks every so often you can

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:35.999 
powered tracks every so often you can
kind<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.840> experiment<00:05:35.289> with<00:05:35.680> that<00:05:35.830> you're

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
kind of experiment with that you're

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.499 
kind of experiment with that you're
supposed<00:05:36.250> to<00:05:36.280> be<00:05:36.430> able<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.669> put<00:05:36.789> three<00:05:37.150> power

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
supposed to be able to put three power

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.809 
supposed to be able to put three power
tracks<00:05:38.020> every<00:05:39.840> 19<00:05:40.840> or<00:05:41.050> 20<00:05:41.409> regular<00:05:42.069> tracks<00:05:42.610> or

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
tracks every 19 or 20 regular tracks or

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.300 
tracks every 19 or 20 regular tracks or
so<00:05:43.030> but<00:05:43.990> sometimes<00:05:44.439> it's<00:05:44.680> a<00:05:44.770> little<00:05:44.889> more<00:05:45.039> or

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
so but sometimes it's a little more or

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.059 
so but sometimes it's a little more or
less<00:05:45.490> depending<00:05:46.030> on<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.210> terrain<00:05:46.590> and<00:05:47.590> you

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
less depending on the terrain and you

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.279 
less depending on the terrain and you
can<00:05:48.219> actually<00:05:48.400> test<00:05:48.819> it<00:05:48.969> if<00:05:49.120> you're<00:05:50.110> not

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
can actually test it if you're not

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.830 
can actually test it if you're not
building<00:05:50.469> it<00:05:50.680> in<00:05:50.830> creative<00:05:51.099> world<00:05:51.610> and<00:05:52.150> you're

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
building it in creative world and you're

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.019 
building it in creative world and you're
trying<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.139> save<00:05:54.129> tracks<00:05:54.520> you<00:05:54.729> can<00:05:54.879> actually

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
trying to save tracks you can actually

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:59.159 
trying to save tracks you can actually
kind<00:05:55.300> of<00:05:55.449> test<00:05:55.870> it<00:05:56.680> by<00:05:56.949> running<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:58.169> minecart

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
kind of test it by running the minecart

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.809 
kind of test it by running the minecart
and<00:05:59.229> seeing<00:05:59.560> if<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.770> slows<00:06:00.069> down<00:06:00.400> too<00:06:00.639> much

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
and seeing if it slows down too much

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.999 
and seeing if it slows down too much
before<00:06:01.090> it<00:06:01.389> reaches<00:06:01.960> the<00:06:01.990> powered<00:06:02.439> rail<00:06:02.740> so

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
before it reaches the powered rail so

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.219 
before it reaches the powered rail so
you<00:06:03.039> can<00:06:03.129> kind<00:06:03.939> of<00:06:04.029> place<00:06:04.360> them<00:06:04.569> optimally

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
you can kind of place them optimally

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.140 
you can kind of place them optimally
you're<00:06:05.889> working<00:06:06.129> in<00:06:06.250> a<00:06:06.310> creative<00:06:06.610> world<00:06:06.969> it

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
you're working in a creative world it

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.459 
you're working in a creative world it
doesn't<00:06:07.389> hurt<00:06:07.479> to<00:06:07.629> put<00:06:07.719> a<00:06:07.779> few<00:06:07.990> more<00:06:08.050> power

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:08.469 
doesn't hurt to put a few more power

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.260 
doesn't hurt to put a few more power
tracks<00:06:08.919> because<00:06:09.279> it<00:06:09.400> does<00:06:09.789> it<00:06:09.879> really<00:06:09.969> cost

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
tracks because it does it really cost

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.600 
tracks because it does it really cost
anything<00:06:10.719> you<00:06:10.990> know<00:06:11.110> and<00:06:11.349> the<00:06:12.039> rail<00:06:12.250> will<00:06:12.460> work

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
anything you know and the rail will work

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.149 
anything you know and the rail will work
a<00:06:12.729> little<00:06:12.849> better<00:06:13.029> if<00:06:13.210> you<00:06:13.300> have<00:06:13.419> a<00:06:13.449> few<00:06:13.659> more

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
a little better if you have a few more

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.740 
a little better if you have a few more
remember<00:06:15.159> to<00:06:15.310> put<00:06:15.520> more<00:06:15.819> power<00:06:16.090> tracks<00:06:16.569> in

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
remember to put more power tracks in

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.390 
remember to put more power tracks in
like<00:06:16.900> three<00:06:17.229> if<00:06:17.349> you're<00:06:17.469> going<00:06:17.740> up<00:06:17.860> an<00:06:17.949> incline

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
like three if you're going up an incline

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.600 
like three if you're going up an incline
you<00:06:18.639> should<00:06:18.849> have<00:06:19.919> if<00:06:20.919> you're<00:06:21.159> going<00:06:21.339> up<00:06:21.490> a

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
you should have if you're going up a

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.129 
you should have if you're going up a
very<00:06:21.819> steep<00:06:22.120> incline<00:06:22.509> you<00:06:22.659> should<00:06:22.839> have<00:06:22.990> them

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
very steep incline you should have them

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.129 
very steep incline you should have them
the<00:06:24.099> entire<00:06:24.460> incline<00:06:24.879> really<00:06:25.240> powered<00:06:25.629> tracks

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
the entire incline really powered tracks

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.879 
the entire incline really powered tracks
to<00:06:26.560> take<00:06:26.889> it<00:06:27.009> up<00:06:27.129> to<00:06:27.159> the<00:06:27.279> top<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:27.849> over<00:06:28.889> all

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
to take it up to the top and over all

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.290 
to take it up to the top and over all
right<00:06:30.099> so<00:06:30.159> this<00:06:30.430> is<00:06:30.490> a<00:06:30.610> basic<00:06:30.960> track<00:06:31.960> setup

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
right so this is a basic track setup

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.079 
right so this is a basic track setup
we'll<00:06:34.300> go<00:06:34.479> more<00:06:35.409> over<00:06:35.740> some<00:06:36.250> of<00:06:36.400> the<00:06:36.879> things

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:37.089 
we'll go more over some of the things

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:38.999 
we'll go more over some of the things
you<00:06:37.180> can<00:06:37.270> do<00:06:37.389> with<00:06:37.539> tracks<00:06:37.870> in<00:06:38.199> future<00:06:38.560> videos

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
you can do with tracks in future videos

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.439 
you can do with tracks in future videos
