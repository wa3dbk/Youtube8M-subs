like<00:00:44.160> us<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.520> gonna<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> year<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> West

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
like us is gonna be the year of the West

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.229 
like us is gonna be the year of the West
how<00:00:46.530> come<00:00:46.800> some<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> those<00:00:47.820> teams<00:00:48.030> have

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
how come some of those teams have

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.779 
how come some of those teams have
underperformed<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.200> think<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.460> man<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
underperformed I think in this man I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.100 
underperformed I think in this man I
think<00:00:51.120> all<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> teams<00:00:51.480> coming<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.899> we're

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
think all the teams coming in we're

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.650 
think all the teams coming in we're
already<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.100> even<00:00:53.520> we've<00:00:54.270> seen<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> lot<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
already so so even we've seen a lot of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
already so so even we've seen a lot of
upsets<00:00:55.170> even<00:00:55.530> though<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.920> hindsight<00:00:56.160> they

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
upsets even though on hindsight they

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.709 
upsets even though on hindsight they
might<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.910> been<00:00:56.940> upset<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
might not have been upset because the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.150 
might not have been upset because the
teams<00:00:57.930> are<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.440> good<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.859> every

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
teams are just really good and every

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
teams are just really good and every
team<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.760> close<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.149> level<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> each<00:01:00.809> other

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
team is so close to level to each other

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.619 
team is so close to level to each other
I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> Chinese<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:03.030> perform<00:01:03.420> at<00:01:03.510> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
I think the Chinese just perform at this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.820 
I think the Chinese just perform at this
point<00:01:03.840> better<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> distress<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
point better on the distress that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.429 
point better on the distress that
they're<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> better

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
they're on and just to have the better

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
they're on and just to have the better
capability<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.970> improve<00:01:08.970> per<00:01:09.600> game<00:01:09.869> rather

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
capability to improve per game rather

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.399 
capability to improve per game rather
than<00:01:10.290> /<00:01:10.740> series<00:01:11.189> or<00:01:11.340> per<00:01:11.520> day<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.659> it's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
than / series or per day so it's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.560 
than / series or per day so it's
adaptability<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.640> think<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.060> ability<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
adaptability you think an ability to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.730 
adaptability you think an ability to
perform<00:01:15.840> under<00:01:16.080> pressure<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.500> most

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
perform under pressure the most

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.370 
perform under pressure the most
important<00:01:17.189> thing<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.549> pro<00:01:17.759> team<00:01:17.970> uh<00:01:18.380> na

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
important thing for a pro team uh na

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.670 
important thing for a pro team uh na
well<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:20.189> very<00:01:20.310> important<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.090> think

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
well it's very important I think

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.020 
well it's very important I think
individual<00:01:22.680> play<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.220> very<00:01:23.580> important<00:01:23.939> as

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
individual play is very important as

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
individual play is very important as
well<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.170> tournament<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.740> far<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
well but in this tournament so far the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.920 
well but in this tournament so far the
synergy<00:01:26.580> between<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.180> team<00:01:27.390> between<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
synergy between the team between the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.249 
synergy between the team between the
players<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.770> most<00:01:28.950> important<00:01:29.460> thing<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
players is the most important thing and

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.289 
players is the most important thing and
are<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.590> any<00:01:31.619> teams<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.670> flat-out

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
are there any teams that just flat-out

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.880 
are there any teams that just flat-out
surprised<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.409> said<00:01:34.590> oh<00:01:34.619> these

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
surprised you like you said oh these

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.710 
surprised you like you said oh these
teams<00:01:35.220> maybe<00:01:35.549> they<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> good<00:01:36.479> shot

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
teams maybe they don't have a good shot

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.480 
teams maybe they don't have a good shot
but<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.110> they<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.409> jumped<00:01:37.860> forward<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
but then they just jumped forward and it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
but then they just jumped forward and it
was<00:01:38.610> surprising<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.659> there's<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> few

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
was surprising to you there's a few

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
was surprising to you there's a few
obvious<00:01:40.920> ones<00:01:41.280> obviously<00:01:41.430> there's<00:01:42.030> there's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
obvious ones obviously there's there's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
obvious ones obviously there's there's
complexity<00:01:43.170> who<00:01:43.409> did<00:01:43.590> very<00:01:43.619> well<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.159> lot

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
complexity who did very well a lot

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.770 
complexity who did very well a lot
better<00:01:44.430> than<00:01:44.670> i<00:01:44.729> was<00:01:44.880> expecting<00:01:44.970> them<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
better than i was expecting them to and
