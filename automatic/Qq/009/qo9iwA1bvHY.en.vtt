edition the first thing that you'll
notice<00:00:22.390> is<00:00:22.869> that<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.199> cooling<00:00:23.529> system<00:00:23.560> is

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
notice is that the cooling system is

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.740 
notice is that the cooling system is
like<00:00:24.250> nothing<00:00:24.519> you've<00:00:24.730> ever<00:00:24.820> seen<00:00:25.000> our<00:00:25.330> lineup

like nothing you've ever seen our lineup

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.509 
like nothing you've ever seen our lineup
and<00:00:25.929> that's<00:00:26.560> because<00:00:26.800> it<00:00:26.919> has<00:00:27.039> some<00:00:27.279> very

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
and that's because it has some very

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.390 
and that's because it has some very
unique<00:00:27.730> properties<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.560> most<00:00:29.769> obvious<00:00:29.980> is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
unique properties the most obvious is

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.360 
unique properties the most obvious is
the<00:00:30.460> fan<00:00:30.730> we<00:00:31.599> call<00:00:31.779> it<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.929> vortex<00:00:32.410> and<00:00:32.649> it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
the fan we call it the vortex and it

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.920 
the fan we call it the vortex and it
features<00:00:33.700> our<00:00:33.850> world<00:00:34.149> wind<00:00:34.360> technology

something<00:00:35.860> I'll<00:00:35.950> get<00:00:36.129> into<00:00:36.219> a<00:00:36.309> little<00:00:36.340> bit

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
something I'll get into a little bit

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.240 
something I'll get into a little bit
later<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:38.050> makes<00:00:38.230> this<00:00:38.350> fan<00:00:38.530> truly<00:00:38.980> unique

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
later what makes this fan truly unique

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.450 
later what makes this fan truly unique
is<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.640> ability<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:40.329> manually<00:00:41.020> adjust

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is the ability to manually adjust

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.160 
is the ability to manually adjust

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
physical attributes of the card to make

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.260 
physical attributes of the card to make
it<00:00:44.320> perform<00:00:44.590> differently<00:00:45.090> something<00:00:46.090> no

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
it perform differently something no

other video card has ever done before

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.910 
other video card has ever done before
we'll<00:00:49.660> take<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.809> closer<00:00:50.050> look<00:00:50.230> so<00:00:50.559> I<00:00:50.590> can<00:00:50.770> show

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
we'll take a closer look so I can show

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.700 
we'll take a closer look so I can show
you<00:00:50.980> how<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.160> use<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:51.640> vortex<00:00:52.320> by<00:00:53.320> pulling<00:00:53.590> the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
you how to use the vortex by pulling the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.160 
you how to use the vortex by pulling the
red<00:00:53.890> tabs<00:00:54.160> gently<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.050> twisting<00:00:56.050> it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
red tabs gently and twisting it

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.919 
red tabs gently and twisting it
counterclockwise<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:58.329> can<00:00:58.449> see<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.690> fan

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
counterclockwise you can see the fan

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.279 
counterclockwise you can see the fan
physically<00:00:59.559> rise<00:01:00.750> twist<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.809> fan<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.140> other
