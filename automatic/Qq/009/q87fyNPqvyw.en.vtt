00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.790
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.280
 Unfortunately there is a lot of noise in the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.040
 in namisa where I usually do the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.580
 videos and my daughter crying my 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.609
 Wife is cleaning the house then 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.820
 I locked myself in the bedroom the bed 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.840
 is here and I'm doing a video for 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 here today 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.269
 It's okay, I ate a little well. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.230
 quick on death syndrome 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.660
 suddenly on galaxy 3 that actually does not 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.290
 only touches galaxy 3 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.430
 the galaxy note 2 it can also be 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.140
 affected because of the following 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.309
 I'm here with the omega 6 36 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:58.079
 it is based on the ram and then the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.770
 last round with 4.11 point 2 thrown 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.260
 for england and the problem is 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:11.250
 related to devices with this chip 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:19.820
 the chip has this feature that the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.820
 which has a chip type vt 100 m né 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:31.890
 the revision version 10 x f1 despite 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:40.829
 he has this chip and should and should be 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:42.899
 marking here yes né chip with risk of 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.570
 bug or anything of this type and here 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.299
 I did not mark because in fact this 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.119
 application it identifies the type of 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.570
 chip but it was made for the s2 galaxy 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.149
 and not for galaxy 3 nor for north 2 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.799
 So what does this care for us? 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.590
 identification here 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.310
 if you have this characteristic here type 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.429
 vt 100 m 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.429
 and in this focus 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:18.750
 and movie call review 10 x f 1 you 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.000
 has a chip with potential problems 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.900
 to have the syndrome of death 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.819
 sudden right 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.459
 apparently this is not official, it was not 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.030
 has not been officially released 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.250
 samsung seems to have implemented the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.190
 correction in the eni but we do not 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.819
 Are you sure, yes or no? 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.950
 but one thing is certain is not to trend it 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:49.650
 had one in the update notices of the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:03:00.739
 channel perseus is what I'm using 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:03:05.100
 perseus if I am not mistaken 31.2 in the service and 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.890
 won 3 1 to denmark 3 1 million 31.2 is 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.140
 the latest version released for both 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.720
 galaxy 3 how much paulo note me 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.890
 I'm using it also the galaxy number 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.750
 note of 2 is he owns he owns 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.670
 disable the routine that works as 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.340
 a trigger for activation of the death of 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.620
 sudden pain syndrome of the galaxy s 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.250
 13 Also in the galaxy note of 2 a thing 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.230
 interesting is that the developers 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.390
 verifying the source codes than in the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.530
 galaxy note of 2 in the version now me 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.730
 ran away name 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.430
 the build version but the last 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.110
 version released for france 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.940
 at least they include disabling 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.530
 also of this function 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.959
 so even though they have started 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.320
 now the reports on the syndrome of 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.230
 sudden death on samsung galaxy note 2 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.470
 even if it is is samsung has not 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.859
 reported that she was sneakily there 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.380
 and disabled those functions, right? 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.750
 the same functions disabled on the channel 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:20.630
 Perseus including both partners have 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.770
 other mmc functions disabled 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.710
 optimized or made more 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.069
 urias, that 's why he is editor in the pipes 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.800
 currently the safest in the galaxy s 13 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:34.169
 in another feature are not 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.449
 all resorting not all bodies 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.979
 why cast what should they be 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.740
 considered safe, it is necessary to have a 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.780
 pet for the correction of the 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.940
 problem 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:51.000
 one of 14 safe molds is the wired wire 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.090
 todi based on cut mall of 6.0 point 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.530
 2.7 which is what I put here too 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.930
 no galaxy s 3 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.849
 as he is not mine then taking all 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.380
 possible care so that you do not have 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.909
 sudden death syndrome 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.000
 I'm using that still I'm safe. 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.130
 using the indicated mold package and the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.419
 I am not charging 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.669
 making in the outlet 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.550
 I'm doing it for the computer because 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.810
 works with smaller voltages takes longer 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.810
 To charge, but not like the reports. 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.580
 almost all involve the device that was 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.379
 connected to the power outlet all night then 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.840
 better not risk it 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.639
 I'm looking forward to keeping him longer. 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.750
 but is loaded more 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.250
 gradual 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.639
 even he heats less that way 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.279
 right 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:43.529
 is the warning substitutes that years of 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:46.349
 you by perseus though some say 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:50.880
 that what samsung is is with 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:54.870
 correction, it is better not to risk who 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.300
 You know it takes time to release the 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.699
 Fixed to release the fixes I do not think 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.639
 You released it so fast. 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.810
 so there is the hint of doing the exchange 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.210
 two pipes 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.479
 this is so true for samsung galaxy s 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.909
 3 as for samsung galaxy note 2 by 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.250
 yes no I replace my body the 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:16.620
 who says the Malaga box or 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:20.940
 any such thing by yarn 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:25.159
 is also also is based on 6,216 40 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:28.080
 points two points 7 and will work 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:29.550
 I hope as a preventive for the 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.659
 sudden death syndrome 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.870
 even because my device drives that 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:42.930
 application here 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:45.870
 this mc check and in my the galaxy note of 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:50.870
 2 gave same chip involved with the 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.870
 problem is not better not to risk it right
