that's<00:01:17.530> how<00:01:17.649> it<00:01:17.920> is<00:01:18.040> originally<00:01:18.579> but<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.060> is

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
that's how it is originally but this is

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.980 
that's how it is originally but this is
a<00:01:19.509> little<00:01:20.320> bit<00:01:20.439> much<00:01:20.619> so<00:01:20.950> I'll<00:01:21.070> need<00:01:21.219> to<00:01:21.990> like

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
a little bit much so I'll need to like

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.899 
a little bit much so I'll need to like
spray<00:01:23.710> it<00:01:23.770> down<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.040> little<00:01:24.280> bit<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.640> water

spray it down a little bit of water

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.459 
spray it down a little bit of water
because<00:01:25.210> they<00:01:25.329> can't<00:01:25.540> really<00:01:25.719> boil<00:01:26.020> wash<00:01:26.200> it

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
because they can't really boil wash it

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.289 
because they can't really boil wash it
otherwise<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:27.189> curls<00:01:27.549> will<00:01:27.729> be<00:01:27.880> destroyed

she was an 80s Barbie but guess not and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.000 
she was an 80s Barbie but guess not and
this<00:02:50.420> one<00:02:50.690> has<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.020> totally<00:02:51.530> different<00:02:51.560> face

from<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.700> other<00:02:52.940> Barbie<00:02:53.300> so<00:02:53.960> that's<00:02:54.170> why<00:02:54.320> I

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
from the other Barbie so that's why I

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.080 
from the other Barbie so that's why I
knew<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.830> one<00:02:55.010> was<00:02:55.040> from<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.340> 90s<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.000> I

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
knew this one was from the 90s and I

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.490 
knew this one was from the 90s and I
thought<00:02:56.240> this<00:02:56.360> one<00:02:56.540> from<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.900> 80s<00:02:56.930> but

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
thought this one from the 80s but

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.320 
thought this one from the 80s but
they're<00:02:58.010> from<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.280> same<00:02:58.430> time<00:02:58.730> period<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.300> I

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
they're from the same time period so I

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.540 
they're from the same time period so I
guess<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.690> one<00:02:59.870> came<00:03:00.050> out<00:03:00.170> later<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:01.250> one
