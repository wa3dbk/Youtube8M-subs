I'm<00:02:35.860> gonna<00:02:36.010> turn<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.489> on<00:02:36.640> I'm<00:02:36.970> gonna<00:02:37.120> lift<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
I'm gonna turn it on I'm gonna lift it

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.240 
I'm gonna turn it on I'm gonna lift it
up<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.900> little<00:02:38.080> bit<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.290> just<00:02:41.500> briefly

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
up a little bit and time to just briefly

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.180 
up a little bit and time to just briefly
test<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.879> motors<00:02:43.269> slightly<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.590> again<00:02:45.069> if

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
test the motors slightly and again if

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.360 
test the motors slightly and again if
you<00:02:45.340> don't<00:02:45.459> have<00:02:45.580> experience<00:02:45.849> in<00:02:46.420> manual<00:02:46.989> mode

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
you don't have experience in manual mode

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.960 
you don't have experience in manual mode
don't<00:02:48.370> do<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.209> house<00:02:49.599> or<00:02:50.140> if<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.530> do

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
don't do it in the house or if you do

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.080 
don't do it in the house or if you do
get<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> prop<00:02:52.239> guards<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:54.730> gonna<00:02:54.849> get<00:02:55.030> a

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
get a prop guards it's gonna get a

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:34.220 
get a prop guards it's gonna get a
little<00:02:55.390> loud<00:02:55.599> out<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.110> sleep

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.350 

all<00:03:35.040> right<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.580> seems<00:03:35.819> to<00:03:35.970> be<00:03:36.090> functioning

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
all right so it seems to be functioning

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.190 
all right so it seems to be functioning
fine<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.849> tested<00:03:38.849> my<00:03:38.879> left<00:03:39.269> my<00:03:39.480> right<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.959> motor

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
fine I tested my left my right the motor

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.990 
fine I tested my left my right the motor
sounds<00:03:40.560> fine<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.550> didn't<00:03:42.450> hear<00:03:42.629> anything<00:03:42.870> funny

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
sounds fine I didn't hear anything funny

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.309 
sounds fine I didn't hear anything funny
but<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.510> regardless<00:03:46.200> going<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.069> replace

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
but I and regardless going to replace

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.150 
but I and regardless going to replace
the<00:03:49.319> motors<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.730> because<00:03:51.709> when<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.890> when

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
the motors on this because when it when

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.479 
the motors on this because when it when
it<00:03:53.190> crash<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.090> crushed<00:03:54.420> on<00:03:54.690> concrete<00:03:55.459> like<00:03:56.459> I

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
it crash the crushed on concrete like I

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.210 
it crash the crushed on concrete like I
said<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:56.880> about<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> bunch<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.480> feet<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.900> air

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
said it about a bunch of feet in the air

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.860 
said it about a bunch of feet in the air
again<00:03:59.220> these<00:03:59.580> prop<00:03:59.880> guards<00:04:00.239> are<00:04:00.360> beautiful

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
again these prop guards are beautiful

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.690 
again these prop guards are beautiful
because<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.769> kind<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.040> lift<00:04:02.250> up<00:04:02.459> and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
because you just kind of lift up and

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.420 
because you just kind of lift up and
pull<00:04:02.880> out<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.900> they're<00:04:04.440> very<00:04:04.560> easy<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.040> get<00:04:05.250> on

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
pull out and they're very easy to get on

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.960 
pull out and they're very easy to get on
and<00:04:05.670> off<00:04:06.530> again<00:04:07.530> I'll<00:04:07.680> put<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.980> link<00:04:08.160> on<00:04:08.370> so

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
and off again I'll put the link on so

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.030 
and off again I'll put the link on so
now<00:04:09.239> as<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:09.690> was<00:04:09.780> saying<00:04:10.049> when<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.260> crashed<00:04:10.709> that

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
now as I was saying when I crashed that

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.500 
now as I was saying when I crashed that
was<00:04:11.160> about<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.370> hundred<00:04:11.730> feet<00:04:11.880> here<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.150> hit<00:04:12.480> a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
was about a hundred feet here I hit a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.259 
was about a hundred feet here I hit a
birth<00:04:12.750> birth<00:04:13.290> building<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.849> then<00:04:15.030> she

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
birth birth building and then she

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.569 
birth birth building and then she
tumbled<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.870> floor<00:04:16.139> she<00:04:17.040> was<00:04:17.190> out<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.459> my

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
tumbled to the floor she was out of my

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.490 
tumbled to the floor she was out of my
sight<00:04:17.940> which<00:04:18.209> you're<00:04:18.630> not<00:04:18.750> supposed<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.260> do

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
sight which you're not supposed to do

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.099 
sight which you're not supposed to do
but<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:20.100> did<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.030> she<00:04:21.060> was<00:04:21.479> out<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.720> my<00:04:21.840> sight<00:04:22.079> so

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
but I did it she was out of my sight so

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.780 
but I did it she was out of my sight so
I<00:04:22.260> didn't<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:23.330> her<00:04:24.330> crash<00:04:25.400> until<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.610> too

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
I didn't see her crash until it was too

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.420 
I didn't see her crash until it was too
late<00:04:26.820> if<00:04:27.270> she<00:04:27.450> was<00:04:27.600> sitting<00:04:28.080> on<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:29.400> ground

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
late if she was sitting on the ground

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.909 
late if she was sitting on the ground
and<00:04:30.270> as<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.540> could<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:30.750> if<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.200> look<00:04:31.440> here

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
and as you could see if you look here

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.370 
and as you could see if you look here
you'll<00:04:32.760> see<00:04:32.970> where<00:04:33.180> there's<00:04:33.389> damage<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:34.020> the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
you'll see where there's damage to the

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.960 
you'll see where there's damage to the
body<00:04:34.979> of<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:37.770> Phantom<00:04:38.310> which<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.729> right

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
body of the the Phantom which is right

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.760 
body of the the Phantom which is right
here<00:04:39.389> you<00:04:39.590> can<00:04:40.590> see<00:04:40.620> some<00:04:41.010> damage<00:04:41.310> here<00:04:42.380> on<00:04:43.380> the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
here you can see some damage here on the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.260 
here you can see some damage here on the
motors<00:04:44.250> you'll<00:04:44.940> see<00:04:45.210> here<00:04:45.660> let<00:04:46.050> me<00:04:46.080> get<00:04:46.320> it

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
motors you'll see here let me get it

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.129 
motors you'll see here let me get it
some<00:04:48.270> damage<00:04:48.690> there<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.350> damage<00:04:50.360> here<00:04:51.360> then

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
some damage there and damage here then

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.029 
some damage there and damage here then
you<00:04:52.289> can<00:04:52.470> see<00:04:52.650> this<00:04:52.830> lip<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.370> little<00:04:53.789> bent<00:04:54.300> in

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
you can see this lip is a little bent in

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.640 
you can see this lip is a little bent in
so<00:04:56.039> that<00:04:56.580> tells<00:04:56.880> me<00:04:57.180> that<00:04:57.210> when<00:04:57.660> she<00:04:57.900> crashed

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
so that tells me that when she crashed

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.590 
so that tells me that when she crashed
she<00:04:59.340> must<00:04:59.580> have<00:04:59.669> Christ<00:05:00.030> like<00:05:00.360> that<00:05:00.630> and

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
she must have Christ like that and

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.180 
she must have Christ like that and
because<00:05:03.600> she<00:05:03.780> crashed<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.380> props<00:05:04.680> were<00:05:05.010> on

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
because she crashed the props were on

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.610 
because she crashed the props were on
that<00:05:05.400> broke<00:05:05.700> but<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.660> props<00:05:06.930> were<00:05:07.139> still<00:05:07.440> on

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
that broke but the props were still on

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.100 
that broke but the props were still on
preventing<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.460> motor<00:05:08.700> from<00:05:09.419> allowing<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:10.080> to

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
preventing the motor from allowing it to

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.420 
preventing the motor from allowing it to
spin<00:05:10.560> was<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.250> crash<00:05:11.520> mode<00:05:12.289> which<00:05:13.430> again

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
spin was in the crash mode which again

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.129 
spin was in the crash mode which again
it<00:05:14.760> could<00:05:15.330> have<00:05:15.450> been<00:05:15.539> doing<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.900> for<00:05:15.960> a

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
it could have been doing that for a

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.770 
it could have been doing that for a
couple<00:05:16.320> minutes<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:17.910> feel<00:05:18.150> like<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.570> this

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
couple minutes and I feel like that this

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.710 
couple minutes and I feel like that this
these<00:05:19.169> two<00:05:19.440> motors<00:05:19.950> might<00:05:20.940> possibly<00:05:21.180> have

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
these two motors might possibly have

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.870 
these two motors might possibly have
suffered<00:05:22.139> some<00:05:22.410> you<00:05:22.710> know<00:05:22.830> damage<00:05:23.400> because

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
suffered some you know damage because
