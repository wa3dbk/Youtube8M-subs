00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:10.110
 This system was developed by the Institute of Advanced Life Science at Tokyo Women's Medical University. 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:15.590
 Here is a system called opec 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:20.330
 Directly in their own teacher of the surgeon when viewing the image in the operating room 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:24.619
 It has been developed thinking to be able to operate the interface 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.400
 It's a coin It's a hand to the camera I'm teaching that I'm going to operate 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.260
 I will 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:35.510
 Well there is a white ball in the place right now 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:40.010
 It acts like a mouse icon Hand this hand on the arrow and next Tweet 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.920
 When I turn on the page, it is a pathological diagnostic picture of that patient 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.449
 Where to concentrate 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.440
 It's very important information when you ask the key or the source but I also see it 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.090
 can do 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.640
 You can also enlarge the screen by sticking out your hand 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.330
 If you want to read mr so that if you push up your hand once the image will change 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.550
 It has become 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:08.170
 You can scroll the screen continuously by overlaying the arrows 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:12.080
 It is is when you want to see the image of it is the traditional shame one in ct and mri 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.550
 Well on their own because the teacher of the surgeon has gloves were sterilized in hand 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:21.020
 I was not able to operate the vinegar and the keyboard, so to the nurses around 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:25.730
 I want you to flip through the pages following one after another Ya back without'm the page door, such as the following: 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:30.110
 An environment in which stressful for the very surgeon teacher because he instructed verbally that 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.100
 Although it was, by using this , the doctor's teacher himself chooses the favorite image 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.780
 So you can present 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:41.280
 It became possible to proceed smoothly with the operation without stress . 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.190
 At first I used a camera that was conscious of hand movement 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.740
 And it came out kinect from more of Microsoft at just the right time 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.930
 It was decided to do the application 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.030
 With the full support from microsoft, you can get it to market early 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.330
 I think if you bring in 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.590
 It has been used in some hospitals in Japan 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.590
 It is generally well received
