the<00:00:43.770> way<00:00:43.890> they<00:00:44.010> want<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.489> then<00:00:44.780> I'm

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the way they want to do it then I'm

in<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> moment<00:02:03.360> ones<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.659> nine<00:02:03.869> years<00:02:04.079> old

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
in the moment ones like nine years old

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.920 
in the moment ones like nine years old
and<00:02:04.409> one's<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.829> kitten<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.219> moment

and one's just a kitten in the moment

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.819 
and one's just a kitten in the moment
and<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.079> kind<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.290> thought<00:02:07.409> I'd<00:02:07.530> love<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.740> get

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and I kind of thought I'd love to get

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.460 
and I kind of thought I'd love to get
cat<00:02:08.009> when<00:02:08.129> I'm<00:02:08.220> older<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.580> well<00:02:09.319> but<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> always

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
cat when I'm older as well but I always

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.930 
cat when I'm older as well but I always
considered<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.009> idea<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.370> actually<00:02:11.489> breeding

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
considered the idea of actually breeding

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.740 
considered the idea of actually breeding
animals

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
animals

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.210 
animals
whether<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.260> be<00:02:13.410> cats<00:02:13.680> or<00:02:13.830> something<00:02:14.070> else

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
whether that be cats or something else

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.470 
whether that be cats or something else
but<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.730> think<00:02:15.720> either<00:02:15.960> cats<00:02:16.470> or<00:02:17.000> maybe<00:02:18.000> ferrets

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
but I think either cats or maybe ferrets

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.810 
but I think either cats or maybe ferrets
are<00:02:18.780> considered<00:02:19.200> as<00:02:19.290> well<00:02:19.550> always<00:02:20.550> wanted<00:02:20.760> a

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
are considered as well always wanted a

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.730 
are considered as well always wanted a

if we get the timing right you can kill

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.850 
if we get the timing right you can kill
them<00:04:09.269> in<00:04:09.390> one<00:04:09.570> but<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.049> can<00:04:10.170> flame<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.620> twice

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
them in one but you can flame it twice

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.830 
them in one but you can flame it twice
before<00:04:11.070> there<00:04:11.310> she<00:04:11.459> hit<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:14.690> don't<00:04:15.690> really
