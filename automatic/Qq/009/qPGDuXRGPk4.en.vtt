00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
check out my other tutorials sorry I had

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
check out my other tutorials sorry I had
to<00:00:34.649> put<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> watermark<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.000> paid

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
to put a watermark over this that paid

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.979 
to put a watermark over this that paid
for<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> seamless<00:00:36.989> fur<00:00:37.380> texture<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.989> that's

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
for the seamless fur texture so that's

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.410 
for the seamless fur texture so that's
why<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.440> huge<00:00:40.620> watermark<00:00:41.180> okay<00:00:42.180> once

Photoshop or GIMP as shown here we're

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.479 
Photoshop or GIMP as shown here we're
going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> use<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.379> new<00:00:52.590> layer<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.309> our

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
going to use this new layer for our

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.660 
going to use this new layer for our
glowing<00:00:53.699> markings<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.219> emulator

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
glowing markings if you can emulator

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.520 
glowing markings if you can emulator
something<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.300> glow<00:00:57.570> marking<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> want

glowing more things to really stand out

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.469 
glowing more things to really stand out
so<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> suggest<00:01:05.070> picking<00:01:05.250> out<00:01:05.580> bright<00:01:06.090> neon

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
so I suggest picking out bright neon

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.660 
so I suggest picking out bright neon
colors<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.350> something<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> would<00:01:08.460> see

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
colors for this something you would see

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
colors for this something you would see
on<00:01:08.970> glow<00:01:09.210> sticks<00:01:09.570> or<00:01:09.810> other<00:01:09.960> glowing<00:01:10.170> objects

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
on glow sticks or other glowing objects

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.539 
on glow sticks or other glowing objects
is<00:01:11.010> best<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.040> our<00:01:17.189> color

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
is best so now that we have our color

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
is best so now that we have our color
we're<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> draw<00:01:18.299> our<00:01:18.420> markings<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.049> with

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
we're going to draw our markings on with

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.109 
we're going to draw our markings on with
this<00:01:19.560> color<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:20.430> our<00:01:20.490> glow<00:01:21.000> marking<00:01:21.509> layer

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
this color on our glow marking layer

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.820 
this color on our glow marking layer
once<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.479> done<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.140> want<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> make<00:01:25.619> it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
once that is done we want to make it

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.789 
once that is done we want to make it
look<00:01:25.979> more<00:01:26.250> glowy<00:01:26.520> than<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.380> we're

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
look more glowy than just that so we're

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.230 
look more glowy than just that so we're
going<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.009> duplicate<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> glow<00:01:29.850> marking

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
