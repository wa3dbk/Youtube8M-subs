what makes gardens and graveyards really
work<00:01:28.000> though<00:01:28.240> is<00:01:28.270> how<00:01:28.540> all<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.840> classes<00:01:29.590> play

work though is how all the classes play

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.430 
work though is how all the classes play
off<00:01:29.979> each<00:01:30.010> other<00:01:30.430> there<00:01:31.240> are<00:01:31.270> four<00:01:31.810> classes

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
off each other there are four classes

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.680 
off each other there are four classes

unique<00:01:35.170> abilities<00:01:35.860> for<00:01:36.700> example<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.240> foot

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
unique abilities for example the foot

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.050 
unique abilities for example the foot
soldiers<00:01:37.930> zpg<00:01:38.619> might<00:01:38.890> take<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> while<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.850> fire

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
soldiers zpg might take a while to fire

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.990 
soldiers zpg might take a while to fire
but<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.900> does<00:01:41.110> massive<00:01:41.530> damage

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.660

likewise the scientists of warp ability
can<00:01:47.820> rapidly<00:01:48.270> close<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> gap<00:01:48.990> between<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
can rapidly close the gap between you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
can rapidly close the gap between you
and<00:01:49.830> an<00:01:49.950> enemy<00:01:50.100> getting<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.360> range<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.810> the
