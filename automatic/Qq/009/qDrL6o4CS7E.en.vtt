00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
calm I don't usually revisit games just

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.850 
calm I don't usually revisit games just
because<00:00:14.309> they<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:15.360> updates<00:00:16.230> added<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.680> them

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
because they have updates added to them

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.659 
because they have updates added to them
but<00:00:17.150> this<00:00:18.590> weirdly<00:00:19.590> enough<00:00:19.980> has<00:00:20.189> become<00:00:20.460> my

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:20.669 
but this weirdly enough has become my

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:22.909 
but this weirdly enough has become my
favorite<00:00:21.300> game<00:00:21.509> on<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> iphone<00:00:22.079> I<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:22.650> no

favorite game on the iphone I have no
idea<00:00:22.949> why<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.669> addictive<00:00:24.410> but<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.559> is<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
idea why it's addictive but it is and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.999 
idea why it's addictive but it is and
they<00:00:26.579> just<00:00:26.610> did<00:00:26.969> a<00:00:27.000> huge<00:00:27.329> update<00:00:27.809> and<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.829> took

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
they just did a huge update and it took

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.069 
they just did a huge update and it took
into<00:00:29.250> account<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.759> lot<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.149> the<00:00:30.270> problems<00:00:30.540> I<00:00:30.869> had

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
into account a lot of the problems I had

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.940 
into account a lot of the problems I had
without<00:00:31.820> really<00:00:32.820> changing<00:00:33.620> their<00:00:34.620> first

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
without really changing their first

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130 
without really changing their first
versions<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> game<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.780> showed

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
versions of the game so what I showed

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
versions of the game so what I showed
you<00:00:37.170> guys<00:00:37.530> last<00:00:37.920> time<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.210> Halloween

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you guys last time was the Halloween

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
you guys last time was the Halloween
mode<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.710> classic<00:00:41.190> mode<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.550> very

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
mode and the classic mode is very

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
mode and the classic mode is very
similar<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.179> that<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.989> they've<00:00:43.199> added<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.769> mode

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
similar to that but they've added a mode

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
similar to that but they've added a mode
called<00:00:44.510> farm<00:00:45.510> mode<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.739> i<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.429> is<00:00:48.350> really

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
called farm mode which i think is really

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.000 
called farm mode which i think is really
a<00:00:49.710> lot<00:00:50.339> of<00:00:50.519> fun<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.269> can<00:00:51.300> see<00:00:51.719> now<00:00:52.319> you<00:00:52.379> can

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
a lot of fun as you can see now you can

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.630 
a lot of fun as you can see now you can
move<00:00:53.309> back<00:00:53.729> and<00:00:53.789> forth<00:00:54.329> through<00:00:54.859> a<00:00:55.859> bunch<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
move back and forth through a bunch of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.270 
move back and forth through a bunch of
different<00:00:56.819> areas<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:58.649> background<00:00:58.890> has

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
different areas and the background has

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.829 
different areas and the background has
changed<00:00:59.699> its<00:00:59.850> brighter<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.659> little

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
changed its brighter so your little

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.500 
changed its brighter so your little
skeleton<00:01:01.710> guy<00:01:01.859> looks<00:01:02.129> wildly<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.089> of<00:01:03.120> place

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
skeleton guy looks wildly out of place

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.289 
skeleton guy looks wildly out of place
but<00:01:04.220> it's<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.400> fun<00:01:05.670> they've<00:01:05.850> still<00:01:06.090> got

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
but it's really fun they've still got

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.039 
but it's really fun they've still got
the<00:01:06.710> amount<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.890> jump<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.880> moving<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> little

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the amount to jump but moving a little

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.690 
the amount to jump but moving a little
more<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.740> something<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> thought<00:01:11.640> could

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
more with something that I thought could

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.190 
more with something that I thought could
add<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.600> lot<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.110> also<00:01:13.740> changing<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
add to it a lot and also changing up the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.650 
add to it a lot and also changing up the
type<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.230> animals<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.800> that<00:01:17.250> came<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.700> also

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
type of animals that that came in also

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.170 
type of animals that that came in also
there's<00:01:18.900> no<00:01:19.080> level<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.620> on<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.880> mode<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
there's no level up on this this mode of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.780 
there's no level up on this this mode of
gameplay<00:01:21.660> instead<00:01:22.260> you<00:01:22.980> just<00:01:23.010> continue<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
gameplay instead you just continue to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.110 
gameplay instead you just continue to
get<00:01:24.150> time<00:01:24.890> time<00:01:25.890> buttons<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:26.940> we<00:01:27.000> have

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
get time time buttons and now we have

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.270 
get time time buttons and now we have
flying<00:01:27.540> pigs<00:01:27.870> which<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.230> awesome<00:01:28.410> another

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
flying pigs which is awesome another

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.850 
flying pigs which is awesome another
cool<00:01:29.580> thing<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> love<00:01:30.480> is<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.260> now<00:01:31.500> as

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
cool thing that I love is you can now as

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
cool thing that I love is you can now as
you<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.340> saw<00:01:32.550> if<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.480> get<00:01:33.540> under<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.020> pig

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you just saw if I get under this pig

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.900 
you just saw if I get under this pig
eventually<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:36.530> can<00:01:37.530> bump<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.160> pig<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
eventually I can bump that pig up so I

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.080 
eventually I can bump that pig up so I
can<00:01:39.210> use<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:39.900> big<00:01:40.170> easier<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:41.550> jump<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
can use the big easier to jump out of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
can use the big easier to jump out of
the<00:01:42.300> frame<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.870> when<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.530> jump<00:01:43.740> out<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the frame and when you jump out of the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
the frame and when you jump out of the
frame<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.370> automatically<00:01:44.970> get<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.480> drill

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
frame you automatically get the drill

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
frame you automatically get the drill
down<00:01:46.620> instead<00:01:47.160> of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.430> explosion<00:01:47.910> though<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
down instead of the explosion though I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.720 
down instead of the explosion though I
really<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.200> explosion<00:01:49.680> mode<00:01:49.830> but<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
really like the explosion mode but it

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.150 
really like the explosion mode but it
still<00:01:51.360> exists<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:51.960> other<00:01:52.110> versions<00:01:52.800> which

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
still exists on the other versions which

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.670 
still exists on the other versions which
i<00:01:53.310> still<00:01:53.370> play<00:01:53.760> quite<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.650> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
i still play quite a bit but this is a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.110 
i still play quite a bit but this is a
nice<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.310> change<00:01:57.300> up<00:01:57.660> to<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.410> version

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
nice little change up to that version

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.370 
nice little change up to that version
and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.960 
and
yeah<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.860> other<00:02:03.010> cool<00:02:03.220> thing<00:02:03.280> they<00:02:03.580> added<00:02:03.850> is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
yeah the other cool thing they added is

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
yeah the other cool thing they added is
this<00:02:04.270> which<00:02:04.720> gives<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.860> well<00:02:06.750> screwed<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.870> up

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
this which gives you well screwed it up

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.560 
this which gives you well screwed it up
but<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.070> gives<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.399> little<00:02:09.970> lists<00:02:10.450> of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
but it gives you little lists of

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.720 
but it gives you little lists of
combinations<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.950> pull<00:02:12.190> off<00:02:12.220> you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
combinations that if you pull off you

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.020 
combinations that if you pull off you
