 that we have animal pills 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.599
 view of the mascot in the afternoon of this Monday 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.059
 well we started to work 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.689
 if we are going to need 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.100
 ubm onyx 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.000
 of military in this case in a measure will reduce so that you can 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.099
 appreciate better they will find in the wicker days 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.330
 by the way for this oval reason some bring 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.039
 a small boat of this slope on one side 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:35.660
 so they can climb 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.660
 the ong the animals we are going to take the measurements 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.850
 for 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.190
 get to 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.610
 make 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.130
 inside 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.040
 and to line this corn is 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.480
 the base measures 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.060
 the long 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.290
 The width 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.890
 and we are going to make a mold of this oval 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.720
 let's keep in mind 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.170
 the internal height 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.610
 all 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 the outline of it 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 we choose a fabric 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.920
 of cotton 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.979
 something very cute much more timid in this case has drawings of animals 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.040
 from rice 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.310
 this 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.439
 let's cut 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.930
 that mold we made that oval 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.700
 three times 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.780
 one is going to be for lara do to line the inside 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.890
 of the internal reading we are going to cut 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310
 a ribbon 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.070
 can choose if nothing 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.640
 she has saved 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.560
 reserve the quarters for the final fly 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.040
 in this way it has been done 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.660
 in this case I'm still cutting a piece of cloth that comes out with a pose 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.600
 this entity is going to have 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.310
 of the interior of walnuts 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.329
 i once immediately the driver novel manises 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.310
 let's face the rights 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.180
 let's start to be a seam 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.300
 subtraction 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.070
 with family machine 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.860
 the rate when he is blind 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.739
 years 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.929
 extremes 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.509
 I have those 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.309
 maybe this the copper peace 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:18.519
 what am I going to have to respect as small tweezers 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.359
 and just 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.379
 these little clamps 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.569
 they are going to make the wake 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.039
 but intense 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.219
 and have many more centimeters 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.299
 to cover the height of the mobile 6 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.500
 because if you are not so much going to compare that very sexy they are going to give 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:37.699
 account 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.009
 that the walls of it 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.090
 always open out 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.530
 and have more hours 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.860
 centimeters the the actress with lathe that the losses 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.239
 once they put all this 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.629
 all the ribbons in its outline 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.739
 we will be this way 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.299
 Of course 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.810
 They are going to spend a six year machine 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.419
 because it's a web that you visit 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.289
 we already have the interior 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.059
 from elmo and saez 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.489
 A) Yes 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.169
 It is the measure 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.319
 let's do now 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.899
 tape 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.039
 the main town 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.689
 that adorns all this work 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.439
 the main bollard 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.089
 Miguel Kiguel The Musac Stack 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.109

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.519
 dedicate yourself to finding a fight that you had 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.599

 on the side this i that you want 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.429
 the higher the more striking is that the 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:41.380
 and here yes 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.509

 ap two and a half months the outline of all sex 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.449
 let's pass a seam 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.819
 in its base 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.389
 with a topless 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.469
 because let's say it distills 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.540
 then a straight seam 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.769
 catching the top 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.549
 and the bottom part 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.619
 after 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:11.639
 of having made those seams so that it does not follow, we will pass other 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.349
 pieces 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.159
 on top 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.359

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.289
 let's go back to the piece that we had before 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.960
 we are going to face like this 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.999
 this piece about 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.210
 the right of the previous 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.090
 and there 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.439
 we will perform 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.849
 a straight seam catching 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.740

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.309
 of this activity 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:56.960

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.180
 from the same fabric 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.629
 two circles 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.050
