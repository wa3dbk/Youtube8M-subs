00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.149 
me closer to these people who who are
the<00:01:42.390> most<00:01:42.509> important<00:01:42.990> people<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:43.350> life<00:01:43.439> by

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the most important people in my life by

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.700 
the most important people in my life by
letting<00:01:44.399> them<00:01:44.729> through<00:01:45.380> another<00:01:46.380> thing<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
letting them through another thing that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.410 
letting them through another thing that
Cortana<00:01:47.009> keeps<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.670> her<00:01:47.729> notebook<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:48.270> my

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
Cortana keeps in her notebook are my

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.160 
Cortana keeps in her notebook are my
favorite<00:01:48.720> places

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
favorite places

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.130 
favorite places
so<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:50.759> says<00:01:50.939> Paris<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.570> could<00:01:51.720> say<00:01:51.899> home

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
so this says Paris but it could say home

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
so this says Paris but it could say home
or<00:01:52.439> work<00:01:52.680> or<00:01:52.979> my<00:01:53.130> gym<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> then<00:01:54.149> these

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
or work or my gym and then these

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.420 
or work or my gym and then these
nicknames<00:01:54.750> would<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.409> understood<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:56.009> Cortana

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
nicknames would be understood by Cortana

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
nicknames would be understood by Cortana
when<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> say<00:01:57.030> homework<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.659> Jim<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.680> places

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
when I say homework or Jim as the places

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.270 
when I say homework or Jim as the places
that<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.820> own

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
that are that are my own

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.280 
that are that are my own
and<00:02:00.550> Cortana<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.300> really<00:02:01.720> good<00:02:01.870> at<00:02:01.990> setting

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
and Cortana is really good at setting

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.200 
and Cortana is really good at setting
reminders<00:02:02.470> as<00:02:03.040> well<00:02:03.250> she<00:02:03.790> can<00:02:03.910> set<00:02:04.090> reminders

I'll give you an example now I'll

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.870 
I'll give you an example now I'll
actually<00:02:11.380> interact<00:02:11.740> with<00:02:11.860> my<00:02:12.070> voice<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.580> do

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
something that's completely unique with

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.880 
something that's completely unique with
Cortana<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.220> I'll<00:02:18.310> say<00:02:18.490> for<00:02:18.670> example<00:02:19.890> next

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
Cortana so I'll say for example next

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.130 
Cortana so I'll say for example next
time<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.070> talk<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.430> my<00:02:21.700> sister<00:02:21.840> remind<00:02:22.840> me<00:02:23.020> to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
time I talk to my sister remind me to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.200

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.910 

so<00:02:28.210> for<00:02:28.420> example<00:02:28.810> my<00:02:28.960> sister<00:02:29.020> perhaps<00:02:29.620> just

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
so for example my sister perhaps just

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.430 
so for example my sister perhaps just
got<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.070> new<00:02:30.250> cat<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:31.360> say<00:02:31.540> yes<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:32.020> want<00:02:32.350> this

got a new cat I can say yes I want this
reminder<00:02:33.390> Cortana<00:02:34.390> stores<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:34.960> her

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
reminder Cortana stores it in her

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.080

better<00:02:42.130> brother<00:02:42.430> these<00:02:42.910> people<00:02:43.270> based

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
better brother these people based

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.910 
better brother these people based
reminders<00:02:43.930> are<00:02:44.050> really<00:02:44.260> important<00:02:44.680> for<00:02:44.710> us

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
reminders are really important for us

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.200 
reminders are really important for us
and<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.340> think<00:02:45.550> it's<00:02:45.670> something<00:02:45.820> that's<00:02:46.150> really

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
and I think it's something that's really

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.120 
and I think it's something that's really
cool<00:02:46.570> about<00:02:46.750> Cortana<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.470> it's<00:02:47.770> completely

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
cool about Cortana and it's completely

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.580 
cool about Cortana and it's completely
differentiated<00:02:48.970> from<00:02:49.390> other<00:02:49.510> assistants<00:02:50.050> now

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
differentiated from other assistants now

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.200 
differentiated from other assistants now
you<00:02:51.040> might<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.310> noticed<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.820> can<00:02:51.880> speak

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
you might have noticed I can speak

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.000 
you might have noticed I can speak
really<00:02:52.480> naturally<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.290> Cortana<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:53.950> she

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
really naturally to Cortana so she

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.370 
really naturally to Cortana so she
supports<00:02:54.430> natural<00:02:54.700> voice<00:02:55.240> I<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:55.930> say<00:02:56.110> things

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.730 
supports natural voice I can say things
like

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
like

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.100 
like
