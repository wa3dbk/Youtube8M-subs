 we toss 8 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.059
 to heat in a paella pan can be a 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.350
 pot also if they do not have soil to 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.880
 right up in a wok 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.320
 2 cloves of garlic we are going to put to fry 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.020
 for a few seconds for the oil 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.750
 start to touch the flavor below and 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.750
 then add a chopped onion 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.260
 when the onion starts to be leg 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.750
 add red and green pepper or 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.440

 a cup of broccoli 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.060

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.289

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.400
 now let's take a liter of the broth 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.400
 Made of veggies 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.710
 we let the vegetables cook for about 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.869
 5 or 10 minutes 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.479
 a few minutes later when the vegetable 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.479
 is boiling everything like that with the caldito 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.930
 let's take a sprig of laurel 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.390
 I have three here 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.370
 and we have an envelope of seasoning for 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.990
 paella but good if you do not have 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.970
 seasoning for paella I 'm going to put 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.300
 what are the condiments that have 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300
 what to throw 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.550
 we also take a spoonful of 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.550
 paprika 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.500
 let's take 3 grams of seaweed and citi 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.880
 that have been hydrated 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.150
 for 20 minutes 3 dry grams do not 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.450
 hydrata will start much more 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.400
 we can also throw wakame seaweed 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.860
 we mix well the physics and so that everything 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.459
 the caldito taste algae has a 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.640
 very strong flavor to sea handful of that 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.640
 gross 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.390
 finally we are going to throw 600 grams of 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.390
 rice 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.050
 we make a cross 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.670
 we mix the rice evenly 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.670
 with the vegetables 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.560
 and add the other liter of broth 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.370
 but little by little as I go 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.330
 needing first we add a little 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.330
 that covers all the rice 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.140
 and we cover 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.860
 at 67 minutes we will see that rice has 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.910
 started to absorb all the caldito well 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.030
 let's take a little more 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.710
 you do not have to stir the rice only 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.050
 at the beginning it is stirred to mix 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.100
 with the vegetables but then I do not know 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.640
 stir nothing 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.640
 ah 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.550
 true I remembered that in the freezer 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.590
 I had these vegetarian shrimp 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.230
 vegan shrimp 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.640
 made with soy I do not know with what but good 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.819
 they are fun so I am going to throw them 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.180
 now total need to be thawed 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.180
 nothing else 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.760
 I'll put it there where I buy them 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.970
 but good 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.970
 and fun to use it 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.200
 I just approved the rice is almost 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.000
 ready but he's going to ask us a little bit more 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.450
 of broth so I'm going to take a 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.450
 a little more 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.479
 the last thing we have left almost will not be 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.479
 half cup more 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.180
 we cover for the last time and we leave 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.150
 cook for 5 more minutes 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.780
 well, the 5 minutes went by 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.930
 put a few slices of lemon to decorate 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.670
 that also gives flavor to the 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.980
 paella we put out the fire 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.300
 and let stand for 20 minutes 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.300
 before eating
