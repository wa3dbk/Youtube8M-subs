00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.070
 [Music] 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.179
 [Music] 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 at the end of the 1990s the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.029
 toys presented the frames to the world 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.529
 At that time these nice little pets 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.199
 captivate children by repeating words 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.119
 and speak your own language 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.859
 the success was so much that he won 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.590
 several versions over the years. 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.780
 including a more current one that arrives at 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.840
 Brazil with news and today I go 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.090
 to introduce these pests means 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.489
 nice to meet you 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.230
 the projects are small robots with colors 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.059
 and striking textures 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 they look more like the intersection of a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.800
 hamster an owl 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.750
 your eyes are numerous lcd screens 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.510
 that help you understand what the pet 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 is feeling and talking in the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.930
 bottom 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.079
 they bring two plastic parts that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.120
 help in their movement 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.909
 movement is very good samba and move on 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.040
 ears 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.600
 interaction is the most fun and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.030
 boring movies 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.390
 they are able to listen to music and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.220
 react to users' speech 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.920
 sensors on the head and belly detect 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.799
 when you cuddle or tickle what 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.540
 almost always generate an answer 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.180
 over time it develops a 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.549
 personality, this ensures that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.500
 one firm is not equal to the other 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.290
 they start by speaking only their language 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.560
 native forbach but soon learns the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.299
 speak portuguese 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 The point is that they are repetitive and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.960
 they talk a lot of nonsense 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.340
 even so it takes a point for the fun 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.979
 for being a toy with a high level 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.020
 technological I miss of some kind 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.880
 Internet connection it does not 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.369
 integrates with Facebook and not with the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.590
 twitter only with apple devices 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.630
 like ipad and iphone 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.399
 if you have one of these devices you can 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.869
 food was good with varied menu 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.149
 of sweets 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.500
 there is also a dictionary of fame xvii 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:16.360
 and a few more surprises 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:18.490
 a mini disco goes to interactivity 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.860
 happens even when you have two 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.360
 strong but here comes the question 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.790
 would you buy another half point furb 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.370
 the lack of control options 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.209
 configuration are sorely lacking to 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.550
 forbes 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.860
 they sing dance they talk to each other 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.140
 others in a single volume and does not exist 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.870
 how to change it, it does not have any 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.730
 button if they get that annoying 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.700
 there are also no means to disconnect 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.400
 unscrew a cap and remove 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.650
 the cells eventually your turn 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.420
 sleep but it is good not to reveal in it because 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.840
 this will be your only time to 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.709
 quiet without button to switch off does not 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.900
 points 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.020
 robots have their educational value 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.760
 although it does not seem very explicit the fans 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.709
 can help children to have more 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.850
 responsibility and even a little bit of 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.550
 patience 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.250
 however they do not bring games or 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.970
 activities that stimulate the rationale 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.530
 which is a flawless point here in with 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.360
 two and a half points was a 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.530
 fun but a little toy 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.680
 irritant 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.000
 here it costs 400 reais which is almost 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.000
 the price of a bicycle
