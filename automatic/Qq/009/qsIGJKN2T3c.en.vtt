copy it and then you're going to want to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.469 
copy it and then you're going to want to
put<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:32.040> after<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> equal<00:01:32.790> sign<00:01:32.880> and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
put it in right after the equal sign and

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
put it in right after the equal sign and
right<00:01:34.049> before<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.439> little<00:01:34.650> ampersand<00:01:35.130> and

right before that little ampersand and
paste<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.530> application

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
paste it so now you have the application

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.090 
paste it so now you have the application
ID<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.299> lost<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.899> canvas<00:01:43.439> URL<00:01:43.890> so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
ID and then just lost that canvas URL so

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.530 
ID and then just lost that canvas URL so
let<00:01:44.220> me<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.430> grab<00:01:44.640> that

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.280 

so<00:01:51.230> my<00:01:51.520> actual<00:01:52.520> browser<00:01:52.760> is<00:01:52.970> making<00:01:53.330> me<00:01:53.510> click

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
so my actual browser is making me click

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.900 
so my actual browser is making me click
enter<00:01:54.530> each<00:01:54.680> time<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:54.980> add<00:01:55.220> something<00:01:55.490> new<00:01:55.670> on

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
enter each time I add something new on
