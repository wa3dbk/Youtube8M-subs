me<00:05:24.840> thinking<00:05:25.320> for<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.980> little<00:05:26.280> bit<00:05:26.430> but<00:05:26.640> once<00:05:27.120> I

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
me thinking for a little bit but once I

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.030 
me thinking for a little bit but once I
figured<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.690> out<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.930> know<00:05:28.230> I<00:05:28.260> felt<00:05:28.560> kind<00:05:28.950> of

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
figured it out you know I felt kind of

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.530 
figured it out you know I felt kind of
speaking<00:05:29.460> because<00:05:29.610> he's<00:05:29.820> pretty<00:05:30.000> obvious

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
speaking because he's pretty obvious

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.180 
speaking because he's pretty obvious
that<00:05:31.290> happens<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.770> all<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:32.040> us<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.860> yeah<00:05:35.010> it's

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
that happens to all of us so yeah it's

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.070 
that happens to all of us so yeah it's
fairly<00:05:35.430> simple<00:05:35.730> game<00:05:36.000> play<00:05:36.210> pick<00:05:36.540> up<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:36.870> play

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
fairly simple game play pick up and play

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.740 
fairly simple game play pick up and play
and<00:05:37.380> just<00:05:38.100> have<00:05:38.580> fun<00:05:38.910> with<00:05:38.970> it<00:05:39.210> I<00:05:39.390> mean<00:05:39.480> that's

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
and just have fun with it I mean that's

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.400 
and just have fun with it I mean that's
that's<00:05:40.230> the<00:05:40.350> point<00:05:40.530> of<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.770> game<00:05:42.350> now<00:05:43.350> the

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
that's the point of the game now the

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.800 
that's the point of the game now the
sound<00:05:43.830> it's<00:05:44.400> pretty<00:05:44.700> addicting<00:05:45.240> I<00:05:45.450> don't<00:05:45.690> know

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
sound it's pretty addicting I don't know

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.660 
sound it's pretty addicting I don't know
if<00:05:45.900> this<00:05:46.110> is<00:05:46.320> the<00:05:46.350> same<00:05:46.800> type<00:05:47.040> of<00:05:47.190> meat<00:05:47.340> what

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
if this is the same type of meat what

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.570 
if this is the same type of meat what
probably<00:05:48.150> is<00:05:48.270> but<00:05:48.660> this<00:05:49.410> music<00:05:49.620> from<00:05:50.340> the

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
probably is but this music from the

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.990 
probably is but this music from the
Dragon<00:05:50.940> Ball<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:52.680> Dragon<00:05:53.100> Ball<00:05:53.220> on<00:05:53.460> cartoon

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
or whatever but I really like the music

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.920 
or whatever but I really like the music
