00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.010
 speak personal beauty guilherme and in the area 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.080
 bringing the first gene here 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.090
 this new season for you that does not 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
 already responds to a video in which I 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.750
 answer the questions of this group 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.000
 can be sent via 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.880
 video on youtube or via facebook 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.830
 and twitter using the hashtag always gg 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.930
 beauty responds as then the first 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.240
 question that is in video do you think 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.380
 it was a good move nintendo to have postponed 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.870
 the new zelda of the river or if it thinks 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.850
 Damn these things and what you think 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.980
 that they did not show a zelda on e3 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 I was particularly sad about 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.899
 postponement 0 and why because I was 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 keeping enough for the game and certainty 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.250
 that a lot of people also wanted to play 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.260
 this year but how the producer needed to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.570
 This extra time is meant to bring a game. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.180
 really good game finalized a game 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 no problems without fail without bugs then 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 Okay, we wait, not only would it be 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 Nice if it brought some content 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.789
 at least at e3 to calm down a bit 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 the mood of the crowd as you can not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.450
 bring not even a trailer shows it all 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.409
 well, we wait until the year we 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:21.930
 come on 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:23.759
 next question currently the consoles 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.799
 still very expensive yes here at 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.900
 you find some discounts 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.060
 some deals can buy times without 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.189
 interest but they are still priced well 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.140
 tall games are also quite expensive still 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.450
 so relationship to it is not worth it 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.119
 buy still not worth to buy 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.400
 for the games the library of 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.710
 games of the new generation consoles comes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.689
 increasing recently and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 promise is several good games will be 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.670
 released in the near future on Batman the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.979
 witch 3 various multiplatform games without 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.259
 you hear around then in 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.360
 relation to the game library this yes 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.060
 it 's worth already buying a console from 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.299
 new generation here in Brazil the beauty 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.979
 next question also video and beauty 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.879
 I wanted to know your opinion and stay 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.879
 metal gear solid series 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.700
 konami today is one thing 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.500
 disastrous for the metal franchise day 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.390
 because because the games are going to lose a lot 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.670
 quality that will happen is as follows 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.799
 konami now wants to transform and will 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.019
 transforming the metal gear franchise into a 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.819
 annual franchise if it will quit a game 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.099
 per year then you already imagine that the 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.810
 quality will drop quite a bit too 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.760
 will happen the same with a new website 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.620
 River because he was being well 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.750
 expected because the ideal kojima and 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.879
 transform the franchise and give a face 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.900
 new franchise as well as gender 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.639
 of survival horror 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.590
 we saw this with a recent one from the 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.150
 Website saw no appetite. 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.519
 So now we have a website and a 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.409
 only goes for sure the quality 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.370
 should also be somewhat lower than 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.049
 Anyway we are hoping 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.000
 to make the game good because I'm 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.040
 remembering that I really like the franchise 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.060
 silent hill the next question in text 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.159
 Let's check 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.930
 she 's from the official blog he asks which 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.489
 were the difficulties of the beginning of the channel 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.480
 Cody and I would give to those who are 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.040
 starting 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.049
 Look when I started I found 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.299
 So much trouble, because because 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.040
 beginning had few related channels 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.840
 of the video game had an imbued channel 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.669
 channel of the angry the console galley 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.440
 brazil games but it was not so much the channel 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.760
 just as it is today who is 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.500
 beginning today you find a difficulty 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.959
 much greater by the gigantic amount 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.389
 of channels related to the video game 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.579
 these many channels with content 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.919
 good how cool, so the tip I 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.199
 I suggest you try to bring content 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.269
 related to its truth to the type of 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.129
 game that you really like and not only 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.900
 because that game is fashionable to the type of 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.699
 content you like to watch 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.949
 because this will generate a 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.840
 much greater identification by the 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.879
 audience is watching the crowd goes 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.919
 I liked and true what you're talking about. 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.689
 so it will be easier the guys wanted 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.669
 sharing your video wanted to give 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.590
 force at the beginning of the channel including 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.810
 constructive tips then the tip I 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.129
 This dredge is content related to 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.500
 your truth and beauty 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.840
 one more question is the text is from 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.430
 jean seco castro which was the first 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.620
 game that you exaggerated 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.419
 I remember until today was the face pitbull 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.519
 that I used my first game was this 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.859
 I remember being little, passing by 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.290
 shopping and passing by in the 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.030
 pitbull on a television and asked my mother 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.099
 me down game at the time did not even know 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.630
 the video game I took home and the 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.550
 game I'll be first went 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.740
 just the picchu then came others 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.910
 most critical was the first and marked 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.020
 I like him a lot 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.270
 Until today you have a special affection. 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.320

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.850
 I will be beautiful 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.160
 these were the questions then 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.320

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.800
