in<00:00:16.650> South<00:00:16.830> Texas<00:00:19.160> so<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.189> brought<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.670> out

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
in South Texas so I brought this out

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.179 
in South Texas so I brought this out
full<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.359> ice<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.990> also<00:00:22.289> have<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> drink<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.010> there

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.910 
full of ice I also have a drink in there
and<00:00:23.400> I'm<00:00:24.180> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.750> if<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.260> cool<00:00:25.650> off<00:00:25.710> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and I'm going to see if I can cool off a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.160 
and I'm going to see if I can cool off a
little<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.340> then<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.390> fan<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> little

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
little bit then the fan is a little

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.599 
little bit then the fan is a little
louder<00:00:28.410> than<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.769> would<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.400> definitely

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
louder than I would like I definitely

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.999 
louder than I would like I definitely
could<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.150> hunt<00:00:30.510> deer<00:00:30.779> or<00:00:31.109> hogs<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
could not hunt deer or hogs out of this

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.250 
could not hunt deer or hogs out of this
with<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.480> use<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.899> came<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> with

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
with it you in use I came in with

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.799 
with it you in use I came in with
turkeys<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.700> what<00:00:35.940> I'll<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.450> turn

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
turkeys so I think what I'll do is turn

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.170 
turkeys so I think what I'll do is turn
it<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.129> cool<00:00:38.129> off<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.579> little<00:00:38.670> bit<00:00:38.790> turn<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
it on cool off for a little bit turn it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.549 
it on cool off for a little bit turn it
back<00:00:39.270> off<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.020> hot<00:00:40.260> just

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
back off and then when I get hot just

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.560 
back off and then when I get hot just
kind<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.280> alternate<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.969> way<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.390> cool

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
kind of alternate that way I can cool

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.590 
kind of alternate that way I can cool
down<00:00:42.629> still<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.969> still<00:00:45.180> hear

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
down still but I'm not I can still hear

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.340 
down still but I'm not I can still hear
the<00:00:45.930> gobbles<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.950> birds<00:00:47.390> um<00:00:48.390> another

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the gobbles in the birds um another

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
the gobbles in the birds um another
thing<00:00:49.559> I'd<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> change<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.399> when<00:00:51.120> that's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
thing I'd like to change is when that's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.529 
thing I'd like to change is when that's
in<00:00:51.649> it<00:00:52.649> blows<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.190> low<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.180> I've<00:00:54.300> pulled

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
in it blows kind of low so I've pulled

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.470 
in it blows kind of low so I've pulled
it<00:00:54.719> out<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.199> tilted<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.480> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it out and just tilted it up and it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.709 
it out and just tilted it up and it
actually<00:00:57.690> blows<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> me<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> fan

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
actually blows right up on me like a fan

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.319 
actually blows right up on me like a fan
the<00:01:00.719> air<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.079> considerably<00:01:01.739> cooler<00:01:02.210> in<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the air is considerably cooler in the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.060 
the air is considerably cooler in the
air<00:01:03.449> outside<00:01:03.600> when<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.140> turn<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.739> cool

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
air outside when I turn it on I do cool

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.570 
air outside when I turn it on I do cool
off<00:01:05.540> quite<00:01:06.540> quickly<00:01:06.860> but<00:01:08.270> again<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.280> sound<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
off quite quickly but again the sound is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.310 
off quite quickly but again the sound is
a<00:01:11.610> little<00:01:11.670> too<00:01:12.030> much<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> can't<00:01:13.049> hear<00:01:13.200> my

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
a little too much or I can't hear my

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.190 
a little too much or I can't hear my
surroundings<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.010> well<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.049> have

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
surroundings as well as I like so I have

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.050 
surroundings as well as I like so I have
another<00:01:17.420> two<00:01:18.420> two<00:01:18.600> fans<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
another two two fans that are from a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
another two two fans that are from a
computer<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.930> I'm<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> put<00:01:22.530> those<00:01:22.680> in

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
computer and I'm going to put those in

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
computer and I'm going to put those in
another<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.400> I'm<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> make<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> second

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
another one I'm going to make a second

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.230 
another one I'm going to make a second
one<00:01:24.299> eventually<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.890> I'll<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> fan<00:01:26.970> here

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
one eventually and I'll put a fan here

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.600 
one eventually and I'll put a fan here
and<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> fan<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:27.960> they're<00:01:28.140> large<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:29.520> if

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and a fan here they're large and see if

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.270 
and a fan here they're large and see if
they<00:01:29.759> push<00:01:30.000> enough<00:01:30.270> air<00:01:30.420> having<00:01:30.659> two<00:01:30.900> fans<00:01:31.280> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
they push enough air having two fans to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
they push enough air having two fans to
cool<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> off<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.229> be

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
cool it off if they do that it will be

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.280 
cool it off if they do that it will be
perfect<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.829> hunting<00:01:35.009> deer<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.259> right

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
now it's a little loud but I can use it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.649 
now it's a little loud but I can use it
for<00:01:39.299> turkeys<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.890> see<00:01:41.009> how's<00:01:41.159> having<00:01:41.490> a
