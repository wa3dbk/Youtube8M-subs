helicopter basically means go up down

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.550 
helicopter basically means go up down
left<00:00:19.230> right<00:00:19.410> forward<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.310> backward<00:00:21.260> it<00:00:22.260> is

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
left right forward and backward it is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.220 
left right forward and backward it is
infrared<00:00:24.380> use<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.680> radio<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.019> thirty

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
infrared use the radio and for thirty

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.220 
infrared use the radio and for thirty
bucks<00:00:31.820> I'm<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.000> gonna<00:00:33.120> complain<00:00:33.450> about<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
bucks I'm not gonna complain about the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.479 
bucks I'm not gonna complain about the
quality<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> radio<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.390> as<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.630> see

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
quality of the radio but as you can see

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.889 
quality of the radio but as you can see
it<00:00:38.489> does<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.850> spring<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> throttle

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
it does have a spring in the throttle

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.369 
it does have a spring in the throttle
which<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:41.040> too<00:00:41.370> thrilled<00:00:41.399> about<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:42.780> I

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
which I'm not too thrilled about but I

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.880 
which I'm not too thrilled about but I
will<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.129> remove<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.579> later<00:00:45.890> as

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
will see if I can remove that later as

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340 
will see if I can remove that later as
you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.489> infrared<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> it's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you can see it is infrared so it's

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.029 
you can see it is infrared so it's
indoor<00:00:49.710> only<00:00:50.750> if<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.870> fly<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> outside<00:00:52.530> one

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
indoor only if you fly it outside one

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.290 
indoor only if you fly it outside one
little<00:00:53.280> breeze<00:00:53.660> will<00:00:54.660> catch<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:56.300> of

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
little breeze will catch it and of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
little breeze will catch it and of
course<00:00:57.390> you'll<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.809> interference<00:00:58.559> from

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
course you'll get interference from

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.799 
course you'll get interference from
sunlight<00:01:00.379> because<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> infrared<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
sunlight because of the infrared in the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.450 
sunlight because of the infrared in the
box<00:01:04.019> comes<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.519> helicopter<00:01:06.090> itself<00:01:07.460> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
box comes with the helicopter itself the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.109 
box comes with the helicopter itself the
radio<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.890> USB<00:01:10.890> cable<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.970> actually

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
radio a USB cable so you can actually

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.870 
radio a USB cable so you can actually
charge<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.780> from<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.200> computer<00:01:13.729> instead<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
charge it from your computer instead of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.030 
charge it from your computer instead of
the<00:01:15.320> built-in<00:01:16.820> charger<00:01:17.820> cord<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.950> which<00:01:19.950> i

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the built-in charger cord here which i

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.179 
the built-in charger cord here which i
think<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.340> pretty<00:01:20.549> cool<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:22.530> also<00:01:22.650> comes<00:01:22.979> with

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
think is pretty cool it also comes with

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.999 
think is pretty cool it also comes with
a<00:01:23.520> spare<00:01:24.270> tail<00:01:25.110> rotor<00:01:27.020> let's<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.680> doesn't

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
a spare tail rotor let's see it doesn't

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.880 
a spare tail rotor let's see it doesn't
include<00:01:29.189> main<00:01:29.640> rotors<00:01:29.970> though<00:01:30.860> those<00:01:31.860> are

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
include main rotors though those are

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.710 
include main rotors though those are
separate<00:01:33.110> but<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.619> was<00:01:35.220> surprised<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:36.119> how<00:01:36.689> well

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
separate but I was surprised at how well

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.490 
separate but I was surprised at how well
built<00:01:38.210> this<00:01:39.210> thing<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.119> very<00:01:42.450> well<00:01:43.229> put

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
built this thing is it is very well put

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.460 
built this thing is it is very well put
together<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.960> all-metal

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
together and you can see the all-metal

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.550 
together and you can see the all-metal
body<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:49.549> that's<00:01:50.549> got<00:01:51.079> nice<00:01:52.079> even<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
body there that's got nice even get a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.639 
body there that's got nice even get a
shot<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.549> got<00:01:53.700> two<00:01:53.909> motors<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> one

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
shot it's got two motors you see the one

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.730 
shot it's got two motors you see the one
on<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> front<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.479> on<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.630> back<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.469> got

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
on the front there on the back it's got

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.240 
on the front there on the back it's got
plenty<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.729> power<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.119> get<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> job<00:02:00.689> done<00:02:04.250> for

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
plenty of power to get the job done for

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.600 
plenty of power to get the job done for
my<00:02:05.399> first<00:02:05.820> flight<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.799> was<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.129> surprised

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
my first flight I was kind of surprised

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.760 
my first flight I was kind of surprised
at<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.119> how<00:02:09.239> stable<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.379> does<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
at just how stable it is it does have a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.119 
at just how stable it is it does have a
built<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.280> gyro

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
built in gyro

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.069 
built in gyro
which<00:02:12.760> helps<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.180> lot<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:16.079> big

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
which helps a lot and it's a big

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.280 
which helps a lot and it's a big
advantage<00:02:17.530> over<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:18.310> older<00:02:18.999> s<00:02:19.180> 105<00:02:19.810> which

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
advantage over the older s 105 which

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.259 
advantage over the older s 105 which
doesn't<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> gyro<00:02:22.030> in<00:02:22.299> it<00:02:23.579> but<00:02:24.579> let's<00:02:25.150> go

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
doesn't have a gyro in it but let's go

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.149 
doesn't have a gyro in it but let's go
ahead<00:02:25.389> and<00:02:25.629> give<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.409> quick<00:02:26.650> little<00:02:26.799> test

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
ahead and give you a quick little test

00:02:27.159 --> 00:03:27.050 
ahead and give you a quick little test
flight

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.369 

so<00:03:28.060> as<00:03:28.180> he<00:03:28.329> saw<00:03:28.510> from<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.930> little<00:03:29.079> test

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
so as he saw from that little test

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.709 
so as he saw from that little test
flight<00:03:29.650> there<00:03:29.980> this<00:03:30.549> thing<00:03:30.909> is<00:03:31.150> extremely

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:31.719 
flight there this thing is extremely

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.739 
flight there this thing is extremely
stable<00:03:32.439> in<00:03:32.769> flight<00:03:32.799> it<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.150> blast<00:03:34.480> to

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:34.749 
stable in flight it is just a blast to

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.879 
stable in flight it is just a blast to
fly<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.760> think<00:03:36.760> almost<00:03:37.599> anybody<00:03:37.959> can<00:03:38.170> just<00:03:38.499> can

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
fly I think almost anybody can just can

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.459 
fly I think almost anybody can just can
fly<00:03:39.069> this<00:03:39.129> thing<00:03:39.579> right<00:03:39.879> out<00:03:39.909> of<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> box<00:03:43.469> I'm

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:44.469 
fly this thing right out of the box I'm

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.110 
fly this thing right out of the box I'm
just<00:03:44.889> I'm<00:03:45.639> still<00:03:46.000> kind<00:03:46.719> of<00:03:46.780> shocked<00:03:47.079> it<00:03:47.290> just

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
just I'm still kind of shocked it just

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.199
