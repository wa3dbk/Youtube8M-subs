00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the lid down you know in order to create

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.740 
the lid down you know in order to create
such<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.580> good<00:01:41.820> seal<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:42.480> almost

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
such a good seal because it's almost

full but you know you just put the lid
down<00:01:45.380> push<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.410> over<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.650> that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
down push it over and just like that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
down push it over and just like that
you're<00:01:50.610> sealed<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.720> strong<00:01:52.080> enough<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you're sealed up it's strong enough that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.860 
you're sealed up it's strong enough that
it<00:01:52.560> holds<00:01:53.010> it<00:01:53.160> just<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.300> don't<00:01:54.690> have

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
it holds it just like that I don't have

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.050 
it holds it just like that I don't have
to<00:01:54.990> actually<00:01:55.230> hold<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.440> container<00:01:55.800> and<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to actually hold the container and the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.200 
to actually hold the container and the
seal<00:01:57.300> is<00:01:57.420> good<00:01:57.570> enough<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> when<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.110> do<00:01:58.230> that

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
seal is good enough that when I do that

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.700 
seal is good enough that when I do that
you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.300> none<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.900> salt<00:02:01.140> leaks<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.500> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
just like that again still strong enough

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.560 
just like that again still strong enough
to<00:03:08.700> hold<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.970> obviously<00:03:12.300> not

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
to hold it and it's obviously not

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.780 
to hold it and it's obviously not
tripping<00:03:13.290> nothing<00:03:13.980> going<00:03:14.130> on<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.250> table<00:03:14.640> I

tripping nothing going on the table I

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.050 
tripping nothing going on the table I
would<00:03:15.480> say<00:03:15.690> it's<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.930> leak-proof<00:03:16.140> seal<00:03:16.790> now<00:03:17.790> for
