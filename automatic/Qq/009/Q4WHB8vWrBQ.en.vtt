the bipod for some odd reason I do

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.729 
the bipod for some odd reason I do
understand<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:21.090> me<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.690> feels<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.440> it

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
understand to me it just feels like it

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.979 
understand to me it just feels like it
is<00:02:22.830> better<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.489> looks<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.420> gives<00:02:24.750> me

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
is better and looks like it gives me

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.720 
is better and looks like it gives me
some<00:02:25.170> kind<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.440> advantage<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.280> some<00:02:26.430> reason

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
some kind of advantage with some reason

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.420 
some kind of advantage with some reason
now<00:02:27.300> if<00:02:27.569> we<00:02:27.630> go<00:02:27.840> according<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> stat<00:02:29.190> it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
now if we go according to the stat it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.910 
now if we go according to the stat it
isn't<00:02:29.970> better<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.390> any<00:02:30.569> way<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.020> also<00:02:31.440> feel<00:02:31.890> like

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
isn't better in any way I also feel like

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.110 
isn't better in any way I also feel like
it<00:02:32.520> somehow<00:02:33.260> lowers<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:35.400> effect<00:02:36.000> of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
it somehow lowers the effect of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.330 
it somehow lowers the effect of
suppression<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.930> don't<00:02:37.590> know<00:02:37.709> why<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> heard

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
suppression I don't know why I heard

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.370 
suppression I don't know why I heard
that<00:02:38.489> somewhere<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.970> believe<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.780> think

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
that somewhere I believe and I think

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.040 
that somewhere I believe and I think
it's<00:02:40.620> true<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.790> I'm<00:02:41.970> not<00:02:42.510> entirely<00:02:42.840> sure

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it's true but I'm not entirely sure

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.839 
it's true but I'm not entirely sure
because<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.620> stats<00:02:43.890> absolutely<00:02:44.400> don't<00:02:44.580> say

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
because the stats absolutely don't say

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.080 
because the stats absolutely don't say
that<00:02:45.060> anyway<00:02:46.019> really<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.680> rather<00:02:47.099> not<00:02:47.610> go<00:02:47.849> with

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
that anyway really I rather not go with

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.470 
that anyway really I rather not go with
the<00:02:48.390> any<00:02:48.870> high<00:02:49.590> magnified<00:02:50.430> scopes<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.239> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the any high magnified scopes as the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.750 
the any high magnified scopes as the
m416<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.260> more<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.980> medium<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.549> long<00:02:53.730> range

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
m416 is more of a medium to long range

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.780 
m416 is more of a medium to long range
weapon<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:55.049> second<00:02:55.590> attachment<00:02:55.890> choice

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
weapon as the second attachment choice

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.940 
weapon as the second attachment choice
although<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.420> usually<00:02:57.989> go<00:02:58.200> with<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.530> foregrip

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
although I usually go with the foregrip

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.699 
although I usually go with the foregrip
but<00:02:59.220> i<00:02:59.250> think<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.150> bipod<00:03:00.600> has<00:03:00.900> great<00:03:01.170> benefits

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
but i think the bipod has great benefits

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.820 
but i think the bipod has great benefits
and<00:03:02.280> has<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.760> great<00:03:03.120> reason<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.200> used<00:03:04.470> for

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
and has a great reason to be used for

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.970 
and has a great reason to be used for
the<00:03:05.640> third<00:03:05.880> choice<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:07.019> either<00:03:07.200> go<00:03:07.620> with

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the third choice you can either go with

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.820 
the third choice you can either go with
the<00:03:08.250> left<00:03:08.549> side<00:03:08.819> for<00:03:09.090> increased<00:03:09.450> hipfire<00:03:10.080> or<00:03:10.410> a

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
the left side for increased hipfire or a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.460 
the left side for increased hipfire or a
heavy<00:03:11.310> barrel<00:03:11.730> if<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:12.569> want<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.870> be<00:03:13.019> better<00:03:13.260> at

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
heavy barrel if you want to be better at

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.460 
heavy barrel if you want to be better at
longer<00:03:13.950> ranges<00:03:14.370> some<00:03:15.239> use<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.930> suppressor

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
longer ranges some use the suppressor

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.620 
longer ranges some use the suppressor
and<00:03:16.739> but<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.700> pretty<00:03:18.209> much<00:03:18.390> only

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
and but that is pretty much only
