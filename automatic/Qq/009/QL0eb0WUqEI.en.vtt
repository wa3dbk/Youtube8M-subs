lot of people that want to win and you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.310 
lot of people that want to win and you
can't<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.710> by<00:00:58.829> yourself<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
can't just do it all by yourself so I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650 
can't just do it all by yourself so I
highly<00:01:02.219> suggest<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> either<00:01:03.239> play<00:01:03.480> with

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
highly suggest that you either play with

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.420 
highly suggest that you either play with
a<00:01:03.690> team<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.290> you're<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.589> play<00:01:04.979> those<00:01:05.220> game

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
a team or if you're not play those game

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.149 
a team or if you're not play those game
modes<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.140> don't<00:01:07.380> play<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
modes because if you don't play with the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.149 
modes because if you don't play with the
team<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.670> you're<00:01:09.420> playing<00:01:09.799> games<00:01:10.799> where

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
people like to win it will affect your

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.249 
people like to win it will affect your
win-loss<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.280> kill<00:01:14.490> death<00:01:14.610> ratio

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
win-loss and your kill death ratio

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.810 
win-loss and your kill death ratio
negatively<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:17.040> almost<00:01:17.159> guarantee<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820

the<00:01:54.930> challenges<00:01:55.290> gradually<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:55.770> time<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.369> if

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the challenges gradually over time so if

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
the challenges gradually over time so if
you<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.329> them<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.530> get

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
you actually go for them you will get

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.020 
you actually go for them you will get
them<00:01:58.770> very<00:01:58.979> quickly<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.850> notice

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
them very quickly and you will notice

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
them very quickly and you will notice
that<00:02:00.509> your<00:02:00.719> rank<00:02:01.020> will<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> lot<00:02:01.649> faster

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that your rank will go a lot faster

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
that your rank will go a lot faster
because<00:02:02.250> you're<00:02:02.490> doing<00:02:02.729> those<00:02:02.880> challenges

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
because you're doing those challenges

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.289 
because you're doing those challenges
and<00:02:03.659> you're<00:02:04.619> doing<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.159> lot<00:02:05.549> better<00:02:05.610> as<00:02:06.030> you're

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and you're doing a lot better as you're

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.589 
and you're doing a lot better as you're
doing<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:08.060> could<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> difference<00:02:09.360> between

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
doing it could be the difference between

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.809 
doing it could be the difference between
ranking<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.560> ranking<00:02:10.920> up<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.280> most

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
ranking up and not ranking up in most

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.760 
ranking up and not ranking up in most
cases

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
cases

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.460 
cases
and<00:02:14.350> third<00:02:15.350> thing<00:02:15.820> killstreaks<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:18.080> have<00:02:18.290> to

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
and third thing killstreaks you have to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.450 
and third thing killstreaks you have to
be<00:02:19.330> aware<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.660> situation<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
be aware of the situation that the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.340 
be aware of the situation that the
strike<00:02:22.730> packages<00:02:23.150> would<00:02:23.330> come<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
strike packages would come in in the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.620 
strike packages would come in in the
game<00:02:24.530> for<00:02:25.400> instance<00:02:25.730> let's<00:02:26.330> say<00:02:26.420> you're

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
game for instance let's say you're

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.570 
game for instance let's say you're

the<00:02:29.090> assault<00:02:29.930> strike<00:02:30.200> package<00:02:30.530> because<00:02:30.710> it

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
the assault strike package because it

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.490 
the assault strike package because it
can<00:02:31.370> get<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.330> most<00:02:32.540> cable<00:02:32.750> as<00:02:32.990> possible

out of all three of the strike packages
you<00:02:35.660> can<00:02:35.720> use<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:37.850> would<00:02:38.000> benefit<00:02:38.330> you<00:02:38.480> and

thing<00:02:57.940> don't<00:02:58.940> ignore<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.690> fact<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.490> you

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
thing don't ignore the fact that you

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.340 
thing don't ignore the fact that you
can't<00:03:02.060> get<00:03:02.330> very<00:03:02.480> high<00:03:02.690> killstreaks<00:03:02.930> very

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
can't get very high killstreaks very

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.950 
can't get very high killstreaks very
often<00:03:03.770> let's<00:03:04.490> say<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.930> get<00:03:06.310> UAVs<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.610> ton<00:03:08.000> but

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
often let's say you get UAVs a ton but

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.510 
often let's say you get UAVs a ton but
you<00:03:09.080> like<00:03:09.260> getting<00:03:09.700> 5<00:03:10.700> killstreaks<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.630> ton<00:03:12.520> but

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
you like getting 5 killstreaks a ton but

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.340 
you like getting 5 killstreaks a ton but
you're<00:03:13.700> not<00:03:13.880> capable<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.690> doing<00:03:14.990> it<00:03:15.080> very<00:03:15.170> much

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
you're not capable of doing it very much

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.320 
you're not capable of doing it very much
you<00:03:15.680> are<00:03:15.710> inconsistent<00:03:16.580> when<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.030> comes<00:03:17.209> to

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
you are inconsistent when it comes to

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.390 
you are inconsistent when it comes to
getting<00:03:17.480> those<00:03:17.660> killstreaks<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:19.010> would<00:03:19.190> want

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
getting those killstreaks you would want

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.040 
getting those killstreaks you would want
to<00:03:21.550> make<00:03:22.550> your<00:03:22.670> killstreaks<00:03:23.090> lower<00:03:23.300> realize

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
to make your killstreaks lower realize

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.660 
to make your killstreaks lower realize
that<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.890> can't<00:03:25.100> get<00:03:25.220> them<00:03:25.340> at<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.490> point

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
that you can't get them at this point

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.120 
that you can't get them at this point
and<00:03:25.910> just<00:03:26.030> get<00:03:26.270> better<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.740> work<00:03:27.740> up<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:27.920> those

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
and just get better and work up to those

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.560 
and just get better and work up to those
killstreaks<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:28.790> mean<00:03:28.940> that's<00:03:29.030> all<00:03:29.240> you<00:03:29.330> got<00:03:29.480> to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
killstreaks I mean that's all you got to

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.290 
killstreaks I mean that's all you got to
do<00:03:29.920> but<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.100> will<00:03:31.310> give<00:03:31.490> you<00:03:31.610> marks<00:03:31.790> beef<00:03:32.060> and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
do but it will give you marks beef and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.930 
do but it will give you marks beef and
calling<00:03:32.570> those<00:03:32.750> little<00:03:33.110> or<00:03:33.200> kill<00:03:33.380> streaks

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
calling those little or kill streaks

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.910 
calling those little or kill streaks
time<00:03:34.940> by<00:03:35.120> time<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:35.630> it<00:03:35.990> will<00:03:36.140> pile<00:03:36.440> up<00:03:36.470> and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
time by time and it will pile up and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.980 
time by time and it will pile up and
stack<00:03:37.130> up<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.670> you'll<00:03:38.630> notice<00:03:38.840> the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
stack up and you'll notice the

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.260 
stack up and you'll notice the
difference<00:03:39.290> like<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.530> say<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.730> lower

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
difference like I say and the lower

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.780 
difference like I say and the lower
killstreaks<00:03:44.780> benefit<00:03:45.680> your<00:03:45.800> team<00:03:45.980> like<00:03:46.310> UAVs

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
killstreaks benefit your team like UAVs

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.020 
killstreaks benefit your team like UAVs
will<00:03:47.090> help<00:03:47.270> everybody<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.900> mean<00:03:48.230> don't<00:03:49.190> don't

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
will help everybody I mean don't don't

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.400 
will help everybody I mean don't don't
count<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.450> lower<00:03:50.630> kill<00:03:50.840> streaks<00:03:51.050> out<00:03:51.200> just

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
count the lower kill streaks out just

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.320 
count the lower kill streaks out just
because<00:03:51.500> they're<00:03:51.830> normally<00:03:52.760> less<00:03:53.000> rewarding

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
because they're normally less rewarding

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.190 
because they're normally less rewarding
because<00:03:54.370> they're<00:03:55.370> easier<00:03:55.940> to<00:03:55.970> get<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.720> they

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
because they're easier to get so they
