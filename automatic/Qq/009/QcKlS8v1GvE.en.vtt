very proud of our laser counters and
this<00:03:45.110> it's<00:03:45.500> words<00:03:45.769> done<00:03:45.980> right<00:03:46.130> over<00:03:46.340> here<00:03:46.580> ran

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
this it's words done right over here ran

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:55.570 
this it's words done right over here ran
by<00:03:47.750> Tim<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.690> once<00:03:54.080> this<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.440> cut<00:03:54.680> was<00:03:55.280> what<00:03:55.489> it

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
by Tim and once this is cut was what it

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.220 
by Tim and once this is cut was what it
looks<00:03:55.730> like<00:03:55.850> once<00:03:56.060> it's<00:03:56.209> done<00:03:56.360> we're<00:03:57.019> bringing

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
looks like once it's done we're bringing
