00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
on right here but I think you can even

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.490 
on right here but I think you can even
see<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.850> paint<00:00:40.120> but<00:00:40.930> like<00:00:41.080> we<00:00:41.199> used<00:00:41.379> to

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
see the paint but like we used to

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.220

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
we scrape probably not allowed this is

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.049 
we scrape probably not allowed this is
ancient<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:49.600> used<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:50.080> uh<00:00:50.110> yeah<00:00:50.800> we<00:00:51.010> I'm<00:00:51.879> not

to spray-paint the net with yellow and

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.240 
to spray-paint the net with yellow and
we<00:00:58.570> we<00:00:58.989> didn't<00:00:59.170> have<00:00:59.290> goalies<00:00:59.739> all<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.040> time

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
we we didn't have goalies all the time

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.299 
we we didn't have goalies all the time
but<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:00.670> was<00:01:00.820> it<00:01:01.000> it<00:01:01.120> was<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:03.129> where

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
but that was it it was a this is where

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.250 
but that was it it was a this is where
it<00:01:03.400> was<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.640> most<00:01:03.850> fun<00:01:04.150> I<00:01:04.180> think<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.690> had<00:01:05.080> as<00:01:05.229> a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
it was the most fun I think I had as a

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.920 
it was the most fun I think I had as a
kid<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.710> was<00:01:05.740> playing<00:01:06.190> outdoor<00:01:06.580> hockey<00:01:06.930> who

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
kid it was playing outdoor hockey who

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.450 
kid it was playing outdoor hockey who
would<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.200> pretend<00:01:08.620> to<00:01:08.710> be<00:01:08.830> because<00:01:09.130> every

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
would you pretend to be because every

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.000 
would you pretend to be because every
kid<00:01:09.990> he's<00:01:10.990> somebody<00:01:11.440> when<00:01:11.650> they're<00:01:11.799> younger

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
kid he's somebody when they're younger

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.070 
kid he's somebody when they're younger
yeah<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:13.119> think<00:01:13.360> there's<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.630> lot<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.810> guys<00:01:14.020> like

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
yeah I think there's a lot of guys like

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.750 
yeah I think there's a lot of guys like
I<00:01:14.320> think<00:01:14.409> obviously<00:01:14.830> everyone<00:01:15.040> knows<00:01:15.070> when<00:01:15.729> to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
I think obviously everyone knows when to

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
I think obviously everyone knows when to
Clark<00:01:16.060> fan<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.479> that's<00:01:16.600> somebody<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:16.990> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
Clark fan and that's somebody that I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.800 
Clark fan and that's somebody that I
idolized<00:01:18.220> but<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.549> mean<00:01:18.909> those<00:01:19.270> guys<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.690> way

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
idolized but I mean those guys the way

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.840 
idolized but I mean those guys the way
they<00:01:19.960> played<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.350> game<00:01:20.380> that's<00:01:20.710> what<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:20.890> like

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
they played the game that's what I like

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.609 
they played the game that's what I like
to<00:01:22.000> be<00:01:22.119> Dougie<00:01:22.360> Gilmore<00:01:22.900> I<00:01:22.930> think<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.500> would

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
to be Dougie Gilmore I think it would

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.530 
to be Dougie Gilmore I think it would
depend<00:01:24.460> on<00:01:24.610> who<00:01:24.790> scored<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.210> night<00:01:25.360> before

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
depend on who scored the night before

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.270 
depend on who scored the night before
would<00:01:25.899> depend<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.560> it's<00:01:26.680> like<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.950> kid<00:01:27.159> in

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
would depend on it it's like the kid in

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.800 
would depend on it it's like the kid in
that<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.609> would<00:01:27.759> you<00:01:27.909> would<00:01:28.030> try<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.329> be<00:01:28.450> but

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
that you would you would try and be but

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.649 
that you would you would try and be but
I<00:01:29.259> think<00:01:29.859> a<00:01:29.950> lot<00:01:30.100> of<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:31.030> unfortunate<00:01:31.329> have<00:01:31.539> to

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
I think a lot of the unfortunate have to

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:32.969 
I think a lot of the unfortunate have to
play<00:01:31.840> for<00:01:31.990> at<00:01:32.079> least<00:01:32.140> who<00:01:32.289> all<00:01:32.409> them<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.619> pretend

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
play for at least who all them I pretend

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.760 
play for at least who all them I pretend
