that<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.760> saw<00:00:51.030> from<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.359> last<00:00:51.510> year<00:00:51.690> was

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that I saw from them last year was

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
that I saw from them last year was
definitely<00:00:52.289> Aaron<00:00:52.500> Rodgers<00:00:52.829> number<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.309> he

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
definitely Aaron Rodgers number one he

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
definitely Aaron Rodgers number one he
tours<00:00:54.239> pretty<00:00:54.600> much<00:00:54.780> every<00:00:55.050> defense<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.739> he

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
tours pretty much every defense that he

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
tours pretty much every defense that he
came<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.309> against<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.850> he<00:00:56.910> put<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> green<00:00:57.390> bay

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
came up against and he put the green bay

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.970 
came up against and he put the green bay
in<00:00:58.370> route<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.640> win<00:00:59.879> every<00:01:00.149> game<00:01:00.890> except<00:01:01.890> for

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
in route to win every game except for

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.509 
in route to win every game except for
maybe<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.850> game<00:01:03.149> against<00:01:03.449> Minnesota<00:01:04.519> Oh

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
maybe a game against Minnesota Oh

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.669 
maybe a game against Minnesota Oh
besides<00:01:06.149> that<00:01:06.360> game<00:01:06.660> they<00:01:06.929> pretty<00:01:07.229> much<00:01:07.320> more

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
besides that game they pretty much more

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.190 
besides that game they pretty much more
in<00:01:07.770> contention<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.310> win<00:01:08.460> most<00:01:09.300> of<00:01:09.600> those<00:01:09.840> games

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
in contention to win most of those games

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.040 
in contention to win most of those games
because<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.800> Aaron<00:01:11.190> Rodgers<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.600> second

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
because of Aaron Rodgers the second

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.109 
because of Aaron Rodgers the second
strength<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.710> last<00:01:14.039> year<00:01:14.280> would<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.910> be

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
strength from last year would have to be

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.040 
strength from last year would have to be
that<00:01:16.009> defense<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.610> run<00:01:17.819> defense<00:01:18.000> shut<00:01:18.840> down

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
that defense the run defense shut down

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.169 
that defense the run defense shut down
everyone<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.340> number<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:20.910> run

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
everyone there are number one in run

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:23.660 
everyone there are number one in run
defense<00:01:21.209> last<00:01:21.750> year<00:01:22.050> only<00:01:22.530> had<00:01:22.860> five<00:01:23.190> rushing

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
defense last year only had five rushing

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
defense last year only had five rushing
touchdowns<00:01:24.119> against<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.599> all<00:01:24.810> season<00:01:25.349> long

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
touchdowns against them all season long

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.529 
touchdowns against them all season long
which<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.920> huge<00:01:26.670> achievement<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
which is a huge achievement for that

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.900 
which is a huge achievement for that
defense<00:01:27.950> considering<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.039> Year<00:01:29.250> previous<00:01:29.550> to

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
defense considering the Year previous to

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.550 
defense considering the Year previous to
that<00:01:29.940> they<00:01:30.209> were<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.360> horrible<00:01:30.780> stop<00:01:31.289> in<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that they were a horrible stop in the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.589 
that they were a horrible stop in the
run<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.700> third<00:01:32.970> strength<00:01:33.450> would

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
run and I think the third strength would

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.719 
run and I think the third strength would
have<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.989> be<00:01:34.140> their<00:01:34.380> ability<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.459> get

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
have to be their ability to get

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.330 
have to be their ability to get
turnovers<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.569> defense<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.920> ball

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
turnovers that defense was just ball

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.339 
turnovers that defense was just ball
hawkers<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.179> they<00:01:39.239> even<00:01:39.569> got<00:01:39.780> some<00:01:39.959> fumble

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:40.349 
hawkers and they even got some fumble

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:43.130 
hawkers and they even got some fumble
recoveries<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:42.479> offense<00:01:42.929> doesn't

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
recoveries and that offense doesn't

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.570 
recoveries and that offense doesn't
really<00:01:43.349> turn<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> ball<00:01:43.800> over<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.190> much<00:01:44.369> so

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
really turn the ball over that much so

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.089 
really turn the ball over that much so
that<00:01:44.610> definitely<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:46.080> always<00:01:46.410> will<00:01:46.770> help<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:47.099 
that definitely that always will help a

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:48.859 
that definitely that always will help a
football<00:01:47.520> team<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:48.000> they<00:01:48.300> can<00:01:48.479> get<00:01:48.630> turnovers

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
football team if they can get turnovers

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.050 
football team if they can get turnovers
and<00:01:49.410> if<00:01:49.739> they<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> prevent<00:01:50.399> turning<00:01:50.849> the<00:01:50.940> ball

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and if they can prevent turning the ball

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 
and if they can prevent turning the ball
over<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.899> puts<00:01:52.140> most<00:01:52.470> teams<00:01:52.800> in<00:01:53.009> contention

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
over that puts most teams in contention

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.880 
over that puts most teams in contention
to<00:01:53.550> be<00:01:53.819> a<00:01:53.849> very<00:01:54.360> very<00:01:54.750> good<00:01:55.080> team<00:01:55.349> and<00:01:55.379> green

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
to move to left guard or right guard and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.229 
to move to left guard or right guard and
if<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.799> happened<00:02:26.280> i<00:02:26.400> think<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.879> offensive

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
if that happened i think that offensive

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.630 
if that happened i think that offensive
line<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.959> not<00:02:28.170> going<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.590> be<00:02:28.739> great<00:02:29.159> but<00:02:29.459> it's

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
line it's not going to be great but it's

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.369 
line it's not going to be great but it's
going<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:29.939> be<00:02:30.090> better<00:02:30.540> than<00:02:30.840> last<00:02:31.049> year

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
going to be better than last year

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.229 
going to be better than last year
obviously<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.730> second<00:02:33.349> big<00:02:34.349> glaring<00:02:35.239> spot

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
obviously the second big glaring spot

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.500 
obviously the second big glaring spot
would<00:02:36.599> have<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.049> be<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:38.040> pass<00:02:38.519> defense<00:02:39.090> even

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:50.219 
to see either Brandon chiller or a

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:54.530 
to see either Brandon chiller or a
Jayhawk<00:03:50.790> move<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.670> linebacking<00:03:53.670> for<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
Jayhawk move to the linebacking for the

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.660 
Jayhawk move to the linebacking for the
right<00:03:54.689> side<00:03:54.900> linebacker<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.620> be<00:03:55.829> a<00:03:55.859> pass

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
right side linebacker to be a pass

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.339 
right side linebacker to be a pass
rusher<00:03:56.969> or<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.239> left<00:03:57.420> side<00:03:57.599> linebacker<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:58.230> be

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
rusher or the left side linebacker to be

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.500 
rusher or the left side linebacker to be
a<00:03:58.379> pass<00:03:58.590> rusher<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.189> know<00:03:59.849> they<00:04:00.090> say<00:04:00.269> hawk

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
a pass rusher I know they say hawk

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.869 
a pass rusher I know they say hawk
doesn't<00:04:00.870> have<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.109> framework<00:04:01.799> but<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:02.609> think

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
doesn't have the framework but I think

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.059 
doesn't have the framework but I think
keep<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.480> he<00:04:03.900> has<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.200> coverage<00:04:04.560> abilities<00:04:04.950> is

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
keep and he has in coverage abilities is

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.470 
keep and he has in coverage abilities is
why<00:04:05.189> they<00:04:05.340> put<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.700> middle<00:04:05.969> but<00:04:06.090> Brandon

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
why they put in the middle but Brandon

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.239 
why they put in the middle but Brandon
chiller<00:04:06.719> I<00:04:06.749> think<00:04:07.049> can<00:04:07.290> be<00:04:07.469> a<00:04:07.499> pass<00:04:07.739> rusher<00:04:08.069> and

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:08.249 
chiller I think can be a pass rusher and

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.739 
chiller I think can be a pass rusher and
I<00:04:08.310> think<00:04:08.519> he<00:04:08.639> can't<00:04:08.879> also<00:04:09.120> cover<00:04:09.359> so<00:04:09.569> I<00:04:09.629> think

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:09.749 
I think he can't also cover so I think

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.750 
I think he can't also cover so I think
Brendan<00:04:10.139> chiller<00:04:10.319> should<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:10.739> put<00:04:10.980> as<00:04:11.159> the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
Brendan chiller should be put as the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.149 
Brendan chiller should be put as the
other<00:04:11.879> side<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.209> foreplay<00:04:13.019> Matthews<00:04:13.499> doesn't

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
other side of foreplay Matthews doesn't

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.170 
other side of foreplay Matthews doesn't
work<00:04:14.279> out<00:04:14.459> they're<00:04:14.669> going<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.849> have<00:04:15.029> to

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
work out they're going to have to

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.960 
work out they're going to have to
address<00:04:15.419> it<00:04:15.689> either<00:04:15.840> free<00:04:16.200> agency

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
address it either free agency

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.960 
address it either free agency
or<00:04:17.090> through<00:04:17.360> the<00:04:17.420> draft<00:04:17.630> of<00:04:17.870> next<00:04:18.230> year<00:04:18.440> so

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
or through the draft of next year so

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.580 
or through the draft of next year so
that<00:04:19.970> is<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.299> weaknesses<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.049> strengths

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
that is the weaknesses and the strengths

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.440 
that is the weaknesses and the strengths
now<00:04:21.769> they<00:04:22.310> do<00:04:22.430> have<00:04:22.580> some<00:04:22.760> tough<00:04:22.910> games<00:04:23.150> on<00:04:23.360> the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
now they do have some tough games on the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.480 
now they do have some tough games on the
road<00:04:23.600> they<00:04:23.960> have<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.410> go<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.560> New<00:04:25.010> York<00:04:25.220> Jets

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
road they have to go to New York Jets

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.190 
road they have to go to New York Jets
which<00:04:25.700> i<00:04:25.790> think<00:04:25.850> is<00:04:26.060> going<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.360> be<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.600> game<00:04:26.900> one

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
which i think is going to be a game one

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.050 
which i think is going to be a game one
of<00:04:27.230> the<00:04:27.350> games<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.830> I'm<00:04:28.700> going<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.000> be

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
of the games that I'm going to be

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.670 
of the games that I'm going to be
keeping<00:04:29.360> an<00:04:29.450> eye<00:04:29.570> on<00:04:29.600> its<00:04:30.020> on<00:04:30.170> Halloween

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
keeping an eye on its on Halloween

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.190 
keeping an eye on its on Halloween
twelve<00:04:31.490> o'clock<00:04:31.790> eastern<00:04:32.540> time<00:04:32.570> on<00:04:32.750> Halloween

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
twelve o'clock eastern time on Halloween

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.750 
twelve o'clock eastern time on Halloween
I<00:04:33.530> think<00:04:33.860> it's<00:04:33.980> going<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.160> win<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.400> games<00:04:34.610> of

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
I think it's going to win the games of

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.220 
I think it's going to win the games of
the<00:04:34.850> year<00:04:34.880> because<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.390> have<00:04:35.570> a<00:04:35.600> high

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
the year because you have a high

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.580 
the year because you have a high
explosive<00:04:36.560> offense<00:04:37.460> versus<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.480> shutdown<00:04:38.870> in

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
explosive offense versus a shutdown in

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.430 
explosive offense versus a shutdown in
your<00:04:40.100> face<00:04:40.370> defense<00:04:40.970> for<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.180> Jets<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:41.840> that's

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
your face defense for the Jets so that's

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.930 
your face defense for the Jets so that's
going<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.710> be<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.860> very<00:04:43.190> fun<00:04:43.460> game<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.700> watch

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
going to be a very fun game to watch

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.420 
going to be a very fun game to watch
another<00:04:44.300> tough<00:04:44.630> one<00:04:44.660> at<00:04:45.200> Minnesota<00:04:45.800> obviously

legacy that they have the dynasty in the
early<00:05:09.230> years<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:09.950> there's<00:05:10.460> still<00:05:10.669> a<00:05:10.700> very

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
early years so and there's still a very

Minnesota<00:05:14.419> is<00:05:14.510> going<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.720> be<00:05:14.840> one<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.140> them<00:05:15.230> and

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
Minnesota is going to be one of them and

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.960 
Minnesota is going to be one of them and
I<00:05:15.410> think<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.710> other<00:05:15.830> one<00:05:16.010> will<00:05:16.220> be<00:05:16.250> dallas<00:05:16.760> now

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
I think the other one will be dallas now

Dallas has never beaten green bay what i
did<00:05:20.540> once<00:05:20.810> it<00:05:20.960> is<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.110> two<00:05:21.260> years<00:05:21.470> ago<00:05:21.530> they've

only<00:05:21.890> been<00:05:22.040> green<00:05:22.280> bay<00:05:22.400> in<00:05:22.610> Green<00:05:22.910> Bay<00:05:22.940> once<00:05:23.419> so

that's going to be a very good game to
watch<00:05:26.810> overall<00:05:27.410> I<00:05:27.620> think<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.550> Packers<00:05:29.030> are

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150

going<00:05:29.300> to<00:05:29.360> finish<00:05:29.570> probably<00:05:30.050> 12<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.530> four

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
going to finish probably 12 and four

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.950 
going to finish probably 12 and four
number<00:05:31.160> one<00:05:31.340> in<00:05:31.460> that<00:05:31.550> division<00:05:31.880> so<00:05:32.300> that

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
number one in that division so that

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.290
