00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.750
Now we're going to get some warm water and
we're going to cleanse the skin. And we are

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:14.940
going to start into our massage. So at this
point I pull out the eye pads. As those are

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:23.901
not necessary as long as the steam is not
on. I'm going to go ahead and rinse up the

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:28.970
product. And since this person does not need
any cleaning, we are going to move right into

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.969
the massage. Also, don't forget the neck area.
You've put product down on the neck area.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:41.519
The brows concentrants pick that up too. You
want to make sure that you're very clean.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.600
Now we're going to move into doing the massage.
We're going to use two different oils here.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.769
One oil is for little more slip. So we're
going to start down on the declate. I put

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:03.339
a little bit all around. And then I start
my massage. So I start on the declate. Move

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:12.369
down to the shoulders. Up to the neck, chin,
above the lip, cheek area. Around the eyes

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:20.350
and nose. And the forehead. So declate, shoulders,
neck. Chin, above the lip. Forehead, around

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:29.920
the eyes and the nose. This also helps to
plump the collagen up a little bit. It also

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:59.720
makes the skin a little bit more flexible.
It's also the most relaxing part of the facial

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:19.989
along with the steam. And usually our massage
lasts about ten minutes within this service.

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:32.690
Once we are finished, we go ahead. Grab our
hot water. Rinse out towel out. On the face

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.220
it goes. Go ahead and rinse out excess product.
