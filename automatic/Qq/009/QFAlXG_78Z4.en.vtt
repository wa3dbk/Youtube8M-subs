00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
the bead I know it seems like a lot of

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.910 
the bead I know it seems like a lot of
wrapping<00:01:41.330> but<00:01:41.600> using<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.110> procedure<00:01:42.380> really

wrapping but using this procedure really

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.200 
wrapping but using this procedure really
helps<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.400> produce<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.940> nicely<00:01:44.330> tapered<00:01:44.750> body

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
helps to produce a nicely tapered body

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.609 
helps to produce a nicely tapered body

once there spin your bobbin

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.320 
once there spin your bobbin
counterclockwise<00:01:59.340> what<00:02:00.340> this<00:02:00.520> does<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:00.970> relax

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
counterclockwise what this does is relax

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.180 
counterclockwise what this does is relax
the<00:02:01.570> twist<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> thread<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.619> flatten<00:02:03.070> it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
the twist and the thread and flatten it

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.640 
the twist and the thread and flatten it
out<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.610> think<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.960> actually<00:02:05.170> see<00:02:05.560> it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
out I think you can actually see it

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.590 
out I think you can actually see it
getting<00:02:05.950> wider<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.369> flatter<00:02:06.580> in<00:02:07.150> this<00:02:07.330> shot

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
getting wider and flatter in this shot

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.410 
getting wider and flatter in this shot
now<00:02:08.429> again<00:02:09.429> begin<00:02:09.850> wrapping<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.390> thread

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
now again begin wrapping the thread

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.930 
now again begin wrapping the thread
rearward<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.890> can<00:02:15.069> see<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.550> flattened

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940
