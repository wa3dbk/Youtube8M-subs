00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.589
 1 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.579
 ouattara the food-wine pairings pushed to the far south camatte was 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.969
 precursor that was one of the big revolutions is important 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.490
 how are you doing today to work 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.230
 at this level it is hardly you go from the dish you leave the party var 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.419
 local associations I prefer from August 20 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.039
 so now I ask you the band to philippe mousset des 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.089
 presets 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.129
 and that's what I like because it's the method 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.910
 I will see the most effective 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.030
 short 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 because we can necessarily still build 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.810
 the glass by hand 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.220
 after 20 years of experience there really is not a wine that stands out on a 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.390
 year to year 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.960
 no no there is no 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.160
 there is not because yes it is necessary to know more that the agreements are limited in 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.180
 the weather 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.350
 for different reasons first the products the products and the cooking the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.590
 products that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.610
 asparagus does not last all year long 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.090
 other space-time devices 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.960
 yes it can be said of an agreement an agreement is true 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.910
 place of the madeleine over a given period of time 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.190
 school agents sprinkled it is more like this scenario but in Paris we have 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.850
 the chance of 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.890
 I do not know so sure 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.600
 because of the obelisk but we are two 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.840
 the universal meridian the agreements its long-term unity 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.170
 because of the products 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.250
 and also because of the evolution of the dollar before the glass where I 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.910
 maybe more there 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.360
 they did not change furniture after six or eight months its acidity 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.820
 is not quite the same which dish we will evolve so if we 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.060
 can be very accurate 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.860
 as we see the holding with my tie super good mood silva with 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.730
 who I'm going to go the next the term sports press 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.670
 she's leaving by the scientists 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.110
 so we noticed at the goal is to bring down that equinoxes she's 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.790
 important also for concerts a year to talk 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.040
 go for the agreement before the equivocal and after the equinox close 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.600
 the same thing in the 20's working more than others and tomorrow 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 who moves more than other students but it happened to us 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.420
 slightly modified but the outdoor stone seasoning because 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.489
 that because the wind in the sails before the summer break had to move 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:24.849
 a few hours later 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.629
 I started to work less 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.629
 for jacques dupuis zinnemann insiders 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.679
 for example who come 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.899
 in summer he capsized 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:36.769
 guys that I felt 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.749
 these great taster of the great beginnings on earth 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.269
 so indeed a small team 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.070
 Thursday 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.379
 research scientist 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.119
 an employee ole 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.799
 in this subject area 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.629
 sorry why on November 22 we all wanted to watch you 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.969
 very specific subject 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.329
 I phone the afp 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.629
 I asked them why 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.609
 e the barrel on which side they oxidize east and north south all 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.689
 the color of the sky the last ten last 15 years if the sky is gray 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.319
 so if the sky is blue 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.149
 I do not quite the same thing if the weather is rainy jace zone not 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:21.069
 my father, moreover, we know 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.009
 the amount of salt per day 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:24.969
 and bullshit like that 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.930
 and in fact really important shit we settle down we pushed the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.879
 very very long things 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:31.620
 we are having fun
