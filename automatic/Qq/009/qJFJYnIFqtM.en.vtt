layer because you know they cut you know
in<00:02:52.950> layers<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.610> that's<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.000> top<00:02:54.180> right

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
in layers because that's the top right

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.770 
in layers because that's the top right
there

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
there

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.380 
there
but<00:02:55.380> anyway<00:02:55.770> I'm<00:02:56.040> fascinated<00:02:56.489> by<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.120> fact

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
but anyway I'm fascinated by the fact

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.210 
but anyway I'm fascinated by the fact
that<00:02:57.510> my<00:02:57.840> shortest<00:02:58.350> layer<00:02:58.650> which<00:02:58.890> was<00:02:59.010> so

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
that my shortest layer which was so

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.800 
that my shortest layer which was so
short<00:02:59.550> when<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.760> try<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> put<00:03:00.270> my<00:03:00.390> hair<00:03:00.540> back<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
short when I try to put my hair back the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.290 
short when I try to put my hair back the
ponytail<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.709> would<00:03:01.920> stick<00:03:02.400> straight<00:03:03.150> up

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
ponytail it would stick straight up

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.660 
ponytail it would stick straight up
because<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.600> was<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.750> short<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.670> wouldn't

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
because it was just short I wouldn't

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.580 
because it was just short I wouldn't
wear<00:03:05.730> my<00:03:05.880> hair<00:03:06.060> come<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.660> hell<00:03:06.840> out<00:03:07.020> of<00:03:07.290> wore

wear my hair come to hell out of wore

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.039 
wear my hair come to hell out of wore
wigs<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.520> they<00:03:08.580> look<00:03:08.730> horrible<00:03:09.150> but<00:03:09.330> anyway

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
wigs and they look horrible but anyway

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.890 
wigs and they look horrible but anyway
it's<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.530> oh<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.820> here's<00:03:12.120> my<00:03:12.180> armpit<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
it's like oh like here's my armpit and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.130 
it's like oh like here's my armpit and
here's<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.049> hair<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.930> obviously<00:03:18.930> my

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
here's the hair like so obviously my

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.360 
here's the hair like so obviously my
hair<00:03:19.290> left<00:03:19.560> there<00:03:19.739> only

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
hair left there only

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.860 
hair left there only
something<00:03:20.820> must've<00:03:21.090> happened<00:03:21.150> but<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.660> think

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
something must've happened but I think

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.220 
something must've happened but I think
because<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.470> my<00:03:22.680> head<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:24.930> feels

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
because it's on my head it just feels

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.750 
because it's on my head it just feels
weird

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
weird

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.009 
weird
so<00:03:26.760> anyway<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.030> wanted<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.450> share<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.750> with

journey and back on their a-game I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.280 
journey and back on their a-game I
thought<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.910> wanted<00:03:36.329> my<00:03:36.480> hair<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.959> waist

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
thought I wanted my hair to be waist

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.539 
thought I wanted my hair to be waist
length<00:03:37.530> but<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.769> just<00:03:37.920> wanted<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.250> be<00:03:38.370> like

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
length but I just wanted to be like

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.390 
length but I just wanted to be like
right<00:03:39.290> above<00:03:40.290> waist<00:03:40.530> length<00:03:40.799> because<00:03:41.130> this

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
right above waist length because this

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.729 
right above waist length because this
this<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.540> how<00:03:42.690> my<00:03:42.870> hair<00:03:43.049> gets<00:03:43.230> caught<00:03:43.470> under<00:03:43.709> my
