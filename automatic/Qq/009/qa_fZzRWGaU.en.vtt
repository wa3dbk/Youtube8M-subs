director and we're gonna go through kind
of<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.760> differences<00:00:41.239> between<00:00:41.449> the<00:00:42.050> two<00:00:42.199> 22

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
of the differences between the two 22

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.290 
of the differences between the two 22
modes<00:00:42.859> and<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:43.250> 333<00:00:43.940> modes

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300

modes and the 333 modes
I've<00:00:45.199> gotta<00:00:45.469> wear<00:00:45.620> Chains<00:00:45.859> of<00:00:45.949> Olympus<00:00:46.809> so

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
I've gotta wear Chains of Olympus so

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.419 
I've gotta wear Chains of Olympus so
this<00:00:48.050> is<00:00:48.140> an<00:00:48.260> older<00:00:48.469> building<00:00:48.620> Attica<00:00:49.159> and<00:00:49.339> you

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
this is an older building Attica and you

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.029 
this is an older building Attica and you
can<00:00:49.579> see<00:00:49.729> that<00:00:49.989> aside<00:00:50.989> from<00:00:51.140> there's<00:00:51.769> there's

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
can see that aside from there's there's

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.439 
can see that aside from there's there's
obvious<00:00:52.369> polish<00:00:52.729> that's<00:00:52.909> gone<00:00:53.089> into<00:00:53.269> this

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
obvious polish that's gone into this

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.450 
obvious polish that's gone into this
level<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:54.109> just<00:00:54.170> comes<00:00:54.559> with<00:00:54.619> time<00:00:55.219> and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
level that just comes with time and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.920 
level that just comes with time and
development<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.180> kind<00:00:56.479> of<00:00:56.510> attention<00:00:56.780> to

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
development and kind of attention to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.859 
development and kind of attention to
detail<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.640> but<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.909> lot<00:00:59.269> of<00:00:59.299> the<00:00:59.449> other<00:00:59.570> things

00:00:59.859 --> 00:00:59.869 
detail of but a lot of the other things

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.049 
detail of but a lot of the other things
like<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.350> blood<00:01:00.619> and<00:01:00.649> there's<00:01:01.309> no<00:01:01.489> shadows<00:01:01.909> in

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
like the blood and there's no shadows in

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.029 
like the blood and there's no shadows in
the<00:01:02.149> scene<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.750> we<00:01:03.320> don't<00:01:03.530> we<00:01:03.680> aren't<00:01:03.799> pulling

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
the scene and we don't we aren't pulling

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.219 
the scene and we don't we aren't pulling
enough<00:01:04.850> full<00:01:05.000> turn<00:01:05.239> effects<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.780> get<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.049> same

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
enough full turn effects to get the same

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.830 
enough full turn effects to get the same
feel<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:06.800> get<00:01:06.890> today<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:08.390> blood<00:01:08.630> system

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
feel that you get today the blood system

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.130 
feel that you get today the blood system
is<00:01:09.110> actually<00:01:09.229> something<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.649> was<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.920> really

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
is actually something that was a really

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.120 
is actually something that was a really
contested<00:01:12.140> thing<00:01:12.289> because<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.710> actually<00:01:13.009> is<00:01:13.069> a

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
contested thing because it actually is a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.050 
contested thing because it actually is a
very<00:01:13.159> difficult<00:01:13.670> thing<00:01:13.789> to<00:01:13.819> pull<00:01:14.000> off

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
very difficult thing to pull off

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.029 
very difficult thing to pull off
correctly<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.840> in<00:01:15.289> this<00:01:15.560> version<00:01:15.740> here

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
correctly and in this version here

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.550 
correctly and in this version here
you're<00:01:16.190> seeing<00:01:16.810> little<00:01:17.810> blood<00:01:18.049> splash<00:01:18.409> that

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
you're seeing little blood splash that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.960 
you're seeing little blood splash that
are<00:01:18.649> coming<00:01:18.860> out<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:19.009> are<00:01:19.250> canned<00:01:19.490> particle

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
are coming out that are canned particle

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.219 
are coming out that are canned particle
systems<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.600> they<00:01:20.690> don't<00:01:20.869> land<00:01:21.020> on<00:01:21.110> the

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
systems and they don't land on the

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.449 
systems and they don't land on the
ground<00:01:21.470> when<00:01:21.860> you're<00:01:21.950> when<00:01:22.190> you're<00:01:22.310> fighting

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
ground when you're when you're fighting

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.550 
ground when you're when you're fighting
the<00:01:22.610> guys<00:01:22.759> we<00:01:23.390> didn't<00:01:24.020> have<00:01:24.140> any<00:01:24.289> lights

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
the guys we didn't have any lights

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.169 
the guys we didn't have any lights
affecting<00:01:25.039> the<00:01:25.130> characters<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:25.729> chrysalis

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
affecting the characters so chrysalis

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:27.550 
affecting the characters so chrysalis
blades<00:01:26.479> while<00:01:26.630> they're<00:01:26.750> on<00:01:26.840> fire<00:01:27.049> aren't

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
blades while they're on fire aren't

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.469 
blades while they're on fire aren't
actually<00:01:27.860> illuminating<00:01:28.340> anything<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.390> we

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
actually illuminating anything so we

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:30.580 
actually illuminating anything so we
actually<00:01:29.600> were<00:01:29.780> able<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.020> flip<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.409> switch

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
actually were able to flip the switch

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.010 
actually were able to flip the switch
and<00:01:30.740> turn<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.009> on<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:32.240> animation<00:01:32.569> blending

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
and turn that on the animation blending

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.620 
and turn that on the animation blending
is<00:01:33.110> not<00:01:33.310> not<00:01:34.310> what<00:01:34.520> what<00:01:34.819> it<00:01:34.909> is<00:01:35.030> today<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.600> a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
is not not what what it is today and a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.969 
is not not what what it is today and a
lot<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:35.990> just<00:01:36.080> has<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.380> do<00:01:36.500> with<00:01:36.679> we<00:01:36.830> have<00:01:36.950> a

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
lot of it just has to do with we have a

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.010 
lot of it just has to do with we have a
lot<00:01:37.190> more<00:01:37.220> room<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.729> work<00:01:37.880> with<00:01:38.209> and<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.479> lot<00:01:38.509> we

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
lot more room to work with and a lot we

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.170 
lot more room to work with and a lot we
can<00:01:39.109> put<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.289> lot<00:01:39.409> more<00:01:39.469> processing<00:01:40.399> power<00:01:40.700> into

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
can put a lot more processing power into

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.539 
can put a lot more processing power into
the<00:01:41.270> padding<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.130> decisions<00:01:43.130> on<00:01:43.340> what

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
the padding and the decisions on what

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.789 
the padding and the decisions on what
their<00:01:43.759> graphs<00:01:44.000> are<00:01:44.210> doing<00:01:44.500> you<00:01:45.500> can<00:01:45.560> see<00:01:45.740> in

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
their graphs are doing you can see in

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:46.870 
their graphs are doing you can see in
this<00:01:45.920> scene<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.159> there's<00:01:46.490> actually

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
this scene that there's actually

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.580 
this scene that there's actually
significantly<00:01:47.630> less<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:48.049> people<00:01:48.380> in<00:01:48.469> this

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
significantly less of people in this

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.469 
significantly less of people in this
scene<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:48.859> that's<00:01:48.950> because<00:01:49.369> really<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:50.270> all

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
scene and that's because really it's all

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.109 
scene and that's because really it's all
we<00:01:50.570> can<00:01:50.689> push<00:01:50.810> at<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:50.990> time<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.789> now<00:01:52.789> we<00:01:52.850> have

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
we can push at the time and now we have

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.669 
we can push at the time and now we have
a<00:01:53.149> lot<00:01:53.329> more<00:01:53.359> secondary<00:01:54.079> characters<00:01:54.469> that<00:01:54.619> we

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
a lot more secondary characters that we

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.889 
a lot more secondary characters that we
can<00:01:54.799> push<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.250> early<00:01:56.119> on<00:01:56.149> we<00:01:56.450> didn't<00:01:56.719> have

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
can push so early on we didn't have

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.870 
can push so early on we didn't have
maybe<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.500> know<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.979> performance<00:01:58.310> left<00:01:58.729> to

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
maybe you know the performance left to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.569 
maybe you know the performance left to
put<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.329> friendly<00:02:00.109> ai's<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:01.070> waste<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.549> know

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
put in friendly ai's and waste you know

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.880 
put in friendly ai's and waste you know
valuable<00:02:02.329> resources<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:03.049> guys<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.590> really

you're<00:02:04.009> not<00:02:04.130> supposed<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.460> be<00:02:04.579> killing<00:02:04.880> but

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
you're not supposed to be killing but

obviously lighting and shadows here but
there's<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.810> lot<00:02:18.049> of<00:02:18.170> fullscreen<00:02:18.350> effects

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
there's a lot of fullscreen effects

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.530 
there's a lot of fullscreen effects
every<00:02:19.310> explosion<00:02:19.609> here<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.209> see<00:02:20.390> that

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
every explosion here you can see that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.090 
every explosion here you can see that
they're<00:02:20.690> there<00:02:21.019> they're<00:02:21.440> triggering<00:02:21.739> effects

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
they're there they're triggering effects

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.140 
they're there they're triggering effects
here<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:22.430> we're<00:02:22.549> not<00:02:22.579> throwing<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:23.000> lot<00:02:23.120> of

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
here but we're not throwing a lot of

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.330 
here but we're not throwing a lot of
particles<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.049> all<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.590> particles<00:02:24.859> are<00:02:25.130> lit

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
particles and all the particles are lit

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.640 
particles and all the particles are lit
by<00:02:25.519> flashes<00:02:26.060> as<00:02:26.209> well<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.810> you're<00:02:27.230> gonna<00:02:27.350> see<00:02:27.620> a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
by flashes as well so you're gonna see a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.740 
by flashes as well so you're gonna see a
lot<00:02:27.859> of<00:02:28.010> differences<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.609> only<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.600> things

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
lot of differences and only the things

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.120 
lot of differences and only the things
this<00:02:29.959> area<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.500> actually<00:02:30.620> supposed<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.069> be

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
this area is actually supposed to be

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.590 
this area is actually supposed to be
like<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.489> little<00:02:31.700> gauntlet<00:02:32.150> for<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.420> play<00:02:32.540> and

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
like a little gauntlet for the play and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.819 
like a little gauntlet for the play and
run<00:02:32.750> through<00:02:32.870> nothing<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.260> challenging

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
run through nothing really challenging

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.530 
run through nothing really challenging
but<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.250> mean<00:02:34.639> we<00:02:34.819> wanted<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.120> set<00:02:35.239> up<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.389> lot<00:02:35.510> of

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
but I mean we wanted to set up a lot of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.300 
but I mean we wanted to set up a lot of
explosions<00:02:35.930> he<00:02:36.170> felt<00:02:36.500> kind<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:36.799> pressure<00:02:37.069> as

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
explosions he felt kind of pressure as

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.740 
explosions he felt kind of pressure as
you're<00:02:37.430> running<00:02:37.549> through<00:02:37.850> here<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.630> can

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
you're running through here and you can

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.879 
you're running through here and you can
see<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.019> version<00:02:39.200> well<00:02:39.380> what<00:02:39.560> we<00:02:39.650> have

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:39.889 
see in this version well what we have

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.440 
see in this version well what we have
some<00:02:40.160> explosions<00:02:40.670> going<00:02:40.850> off<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.299> doesn't

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
some explosions going off it doesn't

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.149 
some explosions going off it doesn't
really<00:02:41.720> feel<00:02:41.959> overwhelming<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.739> player<00:02:42.920> I

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
really feel overwhelming to the player I

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.649 
really feel overwhelming to the player I
mean<00:02:43.489> there's<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.700> lot<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:44.000> noise<00:02:44.180> going<00:02:44.540> on

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
mean there's a lot of noise going on

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:45.360 
mean there's a lot of noise going on
like

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
like

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.080 
like
and<00:02:46.410> large<00:02:47.410> cannon-shot<00:02:48.310> type<00:02:48.640> things<00:02:48.849> going

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
and large cannon-shot type things going

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.280 
and large cannon-shot type things going
through<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.300> air<00:02:49.510> but<00:02:49.720> when<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.019> see<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
through the air but when you see the

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.259 
through the air but when you see the
final<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.950> final<00:02:51.220> product<00:02:51.610> it's<00:02:51.790> got<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.030> lot

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
final the final product it's got a lot

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.089 
final the final product it's got a lot
more<00:02:52.420> going<00:02:52.599> on<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.470> those<00:02:53.590> are<00:02:53.739> just<00:02:53.830> some<00:02:53.980> of

more going on so those are just some of

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.119 
more going on so those are just some of
the<00:02:54.250> details<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.970> differences<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:56.129> 333

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
the details and the differences that 333

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.559 
the details and the differences that 333
megahertz<00:02:57.580> actually<00:02:57.879> affords<00:02:58.239> us<00:02:58.300> all<00:02:58.480> you

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
megahertz actually affords us all you

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.690 
megahertz actually affords us all you
gotta<00:02:58.690> four<00:02:58.840> chains<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.140> olympus<00:02:59.250> I<00:03:00.250> mean<00:03:00.610> the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
gotta four chains of olympus I mean the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.309 
gotta four chains of olympus I mean the
PSP<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.180> really<00:03:01.480> really<00:03:01.629> powerful<00:03:01.840> system

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
PSP is a really really powerful system

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.750 
PSP is a really really powerful system
with<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.440> lot<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.620> potential<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.099> I<00:03:03.160> think<00:03:03.190> from

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
with a lot of potential and I think from

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.520 
with a lot of potential and I think from
the<00:03:03.910> outside<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.420> know<00:03:04.510> as<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> PSP<00:03:04.959> developer

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the outside you know as a PSP developer

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.830 
the outside you know as a PSP developer
we<00:03:06.129> really<00:03:06.730> knew<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:06.940> we<00:03:07.209> wanted<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.510> push<00:03:07.690> it

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
we really knew that we wanted to push it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.880 
we really knew that we wanted to push it
and<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.080> is<00:03:08.230> just<00:03:08.410> one<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.560> those<00:03:08.709> things

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
and this is just one of those things

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.410 
and this is just one of those things
that<00:03:09.069> allows<00:03:09.280> us<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.760> know<00:03:09.790> make<00:03:10.299> an

that allows us to you know make an
already<00:03:10.690> great<00:03:10.870> game<00:03:11.140> even<00:03:11.410> better<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:11.980> I'm
