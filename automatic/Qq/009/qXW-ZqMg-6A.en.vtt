on the back so let's open them up and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.959 
on the back so let's open them up and
take<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.510> closer<00:00:54.870> look<00:00:55.520> okay<00:00:56.520> I'm<00:00:56.579> gonna<00:00:56.699> start

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
take a closer look okay I'm gonna start

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
take a closer look okay I'm gonna start
with<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> elephant<00:00:58.079> set<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.590> want<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> point

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
with the elephant set I do want to point

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.069 
with the elephant set I do want to point
out<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.760> corner<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> says<00:01:00.600> bobble

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
out in the corner here it says bobble

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.880 
out in the corner here it says bobble
with<00:01:01.230> style

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
with style

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.490 
with style
so<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.670> guessing<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.539> both<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:04.080> them<00:01:04.229> are

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
so I'm guessing one or both of them are

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.350 
so I'm guessing one or both of them are
bobble<00:01:04.949> heads<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.369> can<00:01:05.519> tell<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> baby<00:01:06.060> looks

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
bobble heads I can tell the baby looks

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240 
bobble heads I can tell the baby looks
like<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> bobble<00:01:06.900> head<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.260> mom<00:01:07.470> doesn't<00:01:08.040> look

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
like a bobble head the mom doesn't look

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
like a bobble head the mom doesn't look
like<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.600> guess<00:01:09.750> we'll<00:01:09.930> find

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
like one so much but I guess we'll find

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.060 
like one so much but I guess we'll find
out<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.439> know<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> comes

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
out when we know put it up so this comes

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:27.100

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
little bit it would probably start to
