I've got a game of the midst might ap

Ezreal<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> course<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.410> flavor<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
Ezreal which is of course the flavor of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220 
Ezreal which is of course the flavor of
the<00:00:44.040> month<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.700> guess<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.180> think<00:00:45.660> already<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the month I guess I think already on the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.529 
the month I guess I think already on the
PBE<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.829> jungling<00:00:47.190> item<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.940> been<00:00:47.969> changed

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
PBE the jungling item has been changed

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.970 
PBE the jungling item has been changed
so<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.840> probably<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> bill<00:00:49.829> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so this probably is not a bill that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.040 
so this probably is not a bill that
you're<00:00:50.129> gonna<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> near<00:00:50.789> future

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
you're gonna see in the near future

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.420 
you're gonna see in the near future
basically<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> whole<00:00:52.230> concept<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
basically the whole concept of it if you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.560 
basically the whole concept of it if you
for<00:00:53.610> some<00:00:53.640> reason<00:00:53.760> haven't<00:00:54.239> heard<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> that
