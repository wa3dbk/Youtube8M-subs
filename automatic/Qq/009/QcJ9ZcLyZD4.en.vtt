00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:09.580
 Yeah, what a beautiful day! 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.700
 Much better than the night 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.360
 Why are we still dancing? 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.360
 I do not know 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 This morning 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.400
 Zombies do that! 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.980
 We will take revenge on them! 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.980
 We need to make sure we change roles 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.660
 We will not be the victims anymore 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.300
 It will be epic! 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.920
 I know 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.900
 Some time later... 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.500
 I'm totally bored 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.540
 Just walk around 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.140
 I do not know how to code 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:56.880
 If the villagers and zombies changed places by orepros Do not forget to leave a 'blue thumb': D 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.180
 What a beautiful day 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.460
 Let's go grow! 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.860
 Okay! 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.480
 I see someone coming! 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.840
 Cool, a village! 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.720
 It's time to haggle with a villager! 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.420
 I have so much land! 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.520
 Hey, you want to haggle? 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.000
 We can give you a block of land for 10 diamonds 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.280
 Take all my blocks of land and leave me alone! 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.460
 HELP! 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.140
 Please do not hurt me 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.580
 I'm so scared 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.320
 I hope no zombie will attack me 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.440
 It's so scary 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.560
 &gt;: D 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.680
 Notch, why did you do that ?! 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.440
 Do everything as before! 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.580
 This update is so unfair! :( 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.620
 Only the villagers would be happy if that would have happened, but it will never happen :) 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.940
