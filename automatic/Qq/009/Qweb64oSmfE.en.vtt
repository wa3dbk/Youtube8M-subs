00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.740
 Internet connection the only requirement 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.830
 to be able to have this application is 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.290

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.310
 good to criterion you will already be 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.950
 choose one of them 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.650
 the own recommendation of used and 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.040
 two work perfectly and are very 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.750
 practical and good in describing the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.610

 just download it and copy it to memory 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.200
 cellular and from your cell phone run them 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.410
 they are with point extension jar I 'm not going to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.800
 make the mistake of extracting them because 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:18.160
 Sometimes it sometimes comes out with those of the win 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.700
 do not bring them in the first application 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.830
 weighs 403 head and the other weighs something of 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.810

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.030
 more execute it from there 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.970
 good let's start I have an emulator here 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.800

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.750
 producer the mobile behind the editor a 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.910

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.720
 from your cell phone this will open 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.270
