00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.570
 not so long ago, we came to our hands 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.580
 such a funny thing looks like 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.929
 ordinary lens for systemic 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.850
 cameras next from sony but in fact it 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:21.900
 full camera or as it was called in 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.119
 sony smart o count qx 100 is positioned 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.250
 this device on the market as an external camera 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.980
 even universal for a smartphone 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.929
 mount provided set on 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.360
 the phone and he starts to fulfill the role 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.000
 screen on a smartphone is necessary in advance 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.370
 knows the software that is available for ios and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.879
 for android the program is called artplay 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.860
 memory 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.450
 communication between camera and phone 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.239
 produced via Wi-Fi 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.059
 delays are minimal so use 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.010
 convenient but when testing one disappeared 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.930
 unpleasant feature when available 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.719
 Wi fi networks a lot of this whole structure 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.510
 terribly slows down and control the picture 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.100
 in real time, well, just impossible 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.170
 when the picture is taken to copy 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.350
 It takes about 5 seconds and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.479
 the picture gets smartphone however 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250
 You can take pictures without a smartphone 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.340
 at all 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 dates connecting this clothespin but so 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.439
 the cameras become somewhat 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.490
 less so the shooting will turn blind 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.250
 You can see the pictures only 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.100
 getting to the computer anyway 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.830
 pictures are saved on a micro sd card 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.409
 which is inside the inside of the camera 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 but back to the camera in the case hiding 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.610
 variable stabilization lens 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.680
 focal length from 28 to 100 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.590
 millimeters and inch based 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.990
 matrix essentially this sony rx100 camera 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 somewhat different 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.619
 appropriate picture quality 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.659
 the maximum size of which reaches 20 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.979
 megapixels but all these details are unlikely 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.840
 would interest me like 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.610
 potential buyer much 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.049
 more interesting than the decision itself 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.060
 use this camera you can 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.610
 for hidden shooting shoot a girl there 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.979
 completely forbidden and all this with great 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.170
 superior quality especially since 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.790
 You can not only take pictures but also 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.909
 shoot a video now you see 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.619
 image taken on camera qx that sound 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.440
 written to the same device 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.680
 in my opinion both the image and the sound are very 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.110
 she is worth this device a little less than 20 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.790
 thousand rubles a lot for a toy but 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.150
 normal for solving specific 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.150
 tasks
