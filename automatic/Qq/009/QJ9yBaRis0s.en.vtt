00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
center for the Leafs and what are your

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.780 
center for the Leafs and what are your
expectations<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:35.040> him<00:00:35.160> well<00:00:35.309> first<00:00:35.550> things

the<00:00:37.350> guy<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.590> he<00:00:37.829> hasn't<00:00:37.950> played<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.250> game

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the guy because he hasn't played a game

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.830 
the guy because he hasn't played a game
with<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> Leafs<00:00:38.820> yet<00:00:39.000> let's<00:00:39.270> pretend<00:00:39.600> he<00:00:39.809> was

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
with the Leafs yet let's pretend he was

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.569 
with the Leafs yet let's pretend he was
never<00:00:40.200> signed<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:40.950> were<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.100> having<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
never signed and we were just having a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.819 
never signed and we were just having a
conversation<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:42.420> hey<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.410> wanted<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
conversation of hey if you wanted to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.440 
conversation of hey if you wanted to
build<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.129> contending<00:00:44.640> team<00:00:44.670> who<00:00:45.210> would<00:00:45.329> be

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
build a contending team who would be

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
build a contending team who would be
your<00:00:45.480> number<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.840> center<00:00:46.260> you'd<00:00:46.440> probably<00:00:46.710> go

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
your number one center you'd probably go

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
your number one center you'd probably go
through<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> lot<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.700> names<00:00:47.940> before<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.390> said

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
through a lot of names before you said

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.330 
through a lot of names before you said
Tim<00:00:48.870> Connelly<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> being<00:00:49.680> said<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.039> he

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
Tim Connelly that being said I think he

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.369 
Tim Connelly that being said I think he
can<00:00:50.640> play<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> role<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:51.539> his<00:00:51.960> style<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
can play that role because his style of

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.840 
can play that role because his style of
play<00:00:52.440> provides<00:00:53.129> something<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
play provides something that is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
play provides something that is
seriously<00:00:54.149> lacked<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> leaf<00:00:55.289> system<00:00:55.680> for

a while now and that's scoring he's a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
a while now and that's scoring he's a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
bit more of a playmaker type and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.439 
bit more of a playmaker type and
everyone's<00:00:59.430> saying<00:00:59.640> well<00:00:59.820> he<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.090> set<00:01:00.329> up

everyone's saying well he can set up
Phil<00:01:00.629> Kessel<00:01:01.050> that's<00:01:01.199> great<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> know

offensive juggernaut in his short time
with<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.640> Leafs<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.150> he<00:01:06.240> showed<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.479> he<00:01:06.630> has

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
with the Leafs but he showed that he has

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
with the Leafs but he showed that he has
a<00:01:06.780> pretty<00:01:06.990> accurate<00:01:07.200> shot<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.040> Connelly

number one center but he'll be one at
very<00:01:43.560> least<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.220> something<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
very least and that's something that the

argue<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.439> Grabovski<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.280> guy<00:01:47.460> last

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
argue that Grabovski was that guy last

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.520 
argue that Grabovski was that guy last
year<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.240> ideally<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> don't<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.380> have

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
year but ideally I don't think you have

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.499 
year but ideally I don't think you have
him<00:01:49.710> doing<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.100> Josh<00:01:50.399> Cain<00:01:50.700> asks<00:01:51.240> will

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
him doing that Josh Cain asks will

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.450 
him doing that Josh Cain asks will

Detroit be a cup contender remember when

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that wasn't even a question actually let

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
question is what should they do with

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.170 
question is what should they do with
Nabokov<00:03:00.859> and<00:03:01.069> while<00:03:01.220> Nabokov<00:03:01.760> splay<00:03:02.060> his

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
Nabokov and while Nabokov splay his

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.879 
Nabokov and while Nabokov splay his
trail<00:03:02.450> off<00:03:02.629> so<00:03:02.870> much<00:03:03.019> he<00:03:03.260> should<00:03:03.440> probably<00:03:03.590> be

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
trail off so much he should probably be

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.789 
trail off so much he should probably be
thankful<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.670> any<00:03:04.909> NHL<00:03:05.420> team<00:03:05.840> wants<00:03:06.230> him<00:03:06.349> but

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
thankful that any NHL team wants him but

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.410 
thankful that any NHL team wants him but
after<00:03:06.950> what<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> Islanders<00:03:07.790> did<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.090> him<00:03:08.239> I

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
after what the Islanders did to him I

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.330 
after what the Islanders did to him I
think<00:03:08.870> they<00:03:09.170> should<00:03:09.409> be<00:03:09.530> happy<00:03:09.859> that<00:03:09.889> Nabokov

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
think they should be happy that Nabokov

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.220 
think they should be happy that Nabokov
is<00:03:10.760> willing<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.120> play<00:03:11.269> Islanders<00:03:11.900> use<00:03:12.079> like

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
what twenty five goalies last year might

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.580 
what twenty five goalies last year might
be<00:03:14.239> nice<00:03:14.389> to<00:03:14.450> get<00:03:14.720> some<00:03:14.930> stability<00:03:15.139> for<00:03:15.530> a

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
be nice to get some stability for a
