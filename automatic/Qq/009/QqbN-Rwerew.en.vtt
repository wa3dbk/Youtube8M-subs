in the queue 23rd November 1639 and 14
seconds<00:03:30.580> just<00:03:31.580> remember<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.060> minutes<00:03:32.360> and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
seconds just remember the minutes and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.480 
seconds just remember the minutes and
seconds<00:03:33.230> they<00:03:33.410> really<00:03:33.770> just<00:03:33.800> remember<00:03:34.370> the

seconds they really just remember the
seconds<00:03:34.940> these<00:03:35.240> guys<00:03:35.480> are<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:35.840> close<00:03:35.990> together

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
seconds these guys are so close together

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.130 
seconds these guys are so close together
but<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:37.160> 39<00:03:37.640> minutes<00:03:37.910> and<00:03:38.240> 14<00:03:38.690> seconds<00:03:39.140> 4e

let's<00:03:42.140> check<00:03:42.410> d<00:03:42.680> next<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.520> dash<00:03:44.110> 1d<00:03:45.280> we're

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
let's check d next to dash 1d we're

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.790 
let's check d next to dash 1d we're
remembering<00:03:46.700> 39<00:03:47.420> minutes<00:03:47.660> 14<00:03:48.500> seconds<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.900> d

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
remembering 39 minutes 14 seconds so d

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.180 
it's arriving only two seconds after E
and<00:04:02.440> then<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.650> leaves<00:04:03.890> us<00:04:04.130> with<00:04:04.510> two<00:04:05.510> dash<00:04:05.780> 1

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
and then that leaves us with two dash 1

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.480 
and then that leaves us with two dash 1
c<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:08.150> complete<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.780> triad<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:12.560> dash<00:04:12.770> 1<00:04:13.070> see

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
c to complete the triad to dash 1 see

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.690 
c to complete the triad to dash 1 see
visible<00:04:14.060> passes<00:04:16.150> 39<00:04:17.150> minutes<00:04:17.330> 23<00:04:17.900> seconds<00:04:18.700> so

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
visible passes 39 minutes 23 seconds so

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.310 
visible passes 39 minutes 23 seconds so
from<00:04:20.000> 14<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:21.160> 16<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.460> 23<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.270> all<00:04:23.660> three<00:04:23.990> of<00:04:24.020> them

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
from 14 to 16 to 23 so all three of them

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.270 
from 14 to 16 to 23 so all three of them
in<00:04:24.440> 9<00:04:25.070> seconds<00:04:26.020> will<00:04:27.020> appear<00:04:27.440> from<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.890> West

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.010 

39<00:04:31.280> degrees<00:04:31.460> isn't<00:04:32.000> too<00:04:32.120> bad<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.630> actually<00:04:32.990> a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
39 degrees isn't too bad and actually a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.780 
39 degrees isn't too bad and actually a
5.2<00:04:33.830> magnitude<00:04:34.430> is<00:04:35.800> pretty<00:04:36.800> good<00:04:37.010> too<00:04:37.070> so

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
5.2 magnitude is pretty good too so

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.830 
5.2 magnitude is pretty good too so
actually<00:04:39.490> it's<00:04:40.490> short<00:04:40.880> notice<00:04:41.030> but<00:04:41.300> if<00:04:41.570> you

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
actually it's short notice but if you

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.810 
actually it's short notice but if you
got<00:04:42.020> clear<00:04:42.290> skies<00:04:42.500> over<00:04:43.040> London<00:04:43.400> tonight<00:04:43.520> and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
got clear skies over London tonight and

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.050 
got clear skies over London tonight and
you<00:04:43.880> have<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.090> night<00:04:44.360> vision<00:04:44.690> camera<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:46.760> could

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
you have a night vision camera you could

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.770 
you have a night vision camera you could
capture<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:48.010> triangle<00:04:49.420> UFO<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:53.150> here<00:04:53.510> are<00:04:53.720> all

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
capture a triangle UFO so here are all

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.920 
capture a triangle UFO so here are all
the<00:04:54.170> passes<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.180> once<00:04:56.180> again<00:04:56.450> this<00:04:56.600> is<00:04:56.660> to

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
the passes and once again this is to

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.170 
the passes and once again this is to
dash<00:04:57.140> one<00:04:57.410> seat<00:04:57.740> let's<00:04:58.490> just<00:04:58.670> go<00:04:58.790> back<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:58.970> the

for London now look at all the
magnitudes<00:05:14.880> on<00:05:15.060> these<00:05:15.210> are<00:05:15.360> really<00:05:15.600> high<00:05:15.810> a

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
magnitudes on these are really high a

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.900 
magnitudes on these are really high a
lot<00:05:17.580> of<00:05:17.610> these<00:05:17.790> you<00:05:18.060> know<00:05:19.580> you<00:05:20.580> need<00:05:20.760> some

pretty good binoculars to see them

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.260 
pretty good binoculars to see them
that's<00:05:23.940> for<00:05:24.120> sure<00:05:24.620> or<00:05:25.620> night<00:05:26.460> vision<00:05:26.820> camera

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
that's for sure or night vision camera

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.020 
that's for sure or night vision camera
of<00:05:27.420> course<00:05:27.800> anyway<00:05:28.800> that's<00:05:29.460> your<00:05:29.730> best<00:05:29.910> bet

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
of course anyway that's your best bet

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:38.780 
of course anyway that's your best bet
for<00:05:32.780> filming<00:05:33.780> a<00:05:33.870> triangle<00:05:34.880> UFO<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:37.610> it'd<00:05:38.610> be

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
for filming a triangle UFO and it'd be

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.780 
for filming a triangle UFO and it'd be
the<00:05:38.910> NAS<00:05:39.090> triplets<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:40.310> they're<00:05:41.310> still<00:05:41.610> out

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
the NAS triplets and they're still out

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.130 
the NAS triplets and they're still out
there<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.950> maybe<00:05:43.950> now<00:05:44.190> we<00:05:44.250> can<00:05:44.430> get<00:05:45.140> some

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
there and maybe now we can get some

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.480 
there and maybe now we can get some
better<00:05:46.320> footage<00:05:46.740> of<00:05:46.920> them<00:05:47.010> that'd<00:05:47.190> be<00:05:47.220> pretty

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
better footage of them that'd be pretty

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.220 
better footage of them that'd be pretty
cool<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.790> see<00:05:47.940> actually<00:05:48.450> I've<00:05:48.570> got<00:05:48.810> really

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
cool to see actually I've got really

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.180 
cool to see actually I've got really
enjoy<00:05:49.440> to<00:05:49.590> see<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:50.180> okay
