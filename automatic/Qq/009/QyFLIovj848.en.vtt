back up to the B now this will be a
stretch<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.840> not<00:00:42.840> middle<00:00:43.140> C<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.710> is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
stretch here see not middle C this is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.709 
stretch here see not middle C this is
Millicent<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.579> see<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.590> e

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
Millicent this see up here and then e

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.959 
Millicent this see up here and then e
the<00:00:48.719> mill<00:00:48.960> seen<00:00:49.260> back<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.489> high<00:00:50.640> seat
