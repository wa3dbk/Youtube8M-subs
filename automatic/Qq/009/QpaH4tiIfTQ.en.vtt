00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.630 
there you know it you that's as soon as
it<00:02:14.780> goes<00:02:14.870> green<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.800> drivers<00:02:16.250> will<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.520> go

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
it goes green the drivers will just go

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.240 
it goes green the drivers will just go
straight<00:02:17.000> through<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:17.330> without<00:02:17.780> looking<00:02:18.250> if

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
straight through it without looking if

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.580 
straight through it without looking if
the<00:02:19.430> drivers<00:02:19.790> approached<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.330> thinking<00:02:20.660> there

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the drivers approached it thinking there

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.110 
the drivers approached it thinking there
might<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:21.860> something<00:02:22.250> coming<00:02:22.400> here<00:02:22.730> even<00:02:22.940> if

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
might be something coming here even if

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.730 
might be something coming here even if
it's<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> green<00:02:23.480> light<00:02:23.510> which<00:02:24.050> incidentally

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
it's a green light which incidentally

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.070 
it's a green light which incidentally
there<00:02:24.920> isn't<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:26.270> pedestrian<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.930> on

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
there isn't and that pedestrian is on

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.080 
there isn't and that pedestrian is on
red<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.680> absolutely<00:02:28.250> fine<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.970> just

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
red so it's absolutely fine to just

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.760 
red so it's absolutely fine to just
drive<00:02:29.450> through<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:30.020> absolutely<00:02:30.650> fine

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
drive through here absolutely fine

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.900 
drive through here absolutely fine

yep
with<00:02:35.690> Sattar<00:02:35.930> because<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> light<00:02:37.040> is

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
with Sattar because as a light is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.650 
with Sattar because as a light is
telling<00:02:37.610> us<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> do<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:38.480> the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
telling us to do that and that the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.510 
telling us to do that and that the
decision-making<00:02:39.140> process<00:02:39.890> has<00:02:40.400> been

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
decision-making process has been

to drive correctly that power has been
devolved<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.540> fucking<00:02:51.140> light<00:02:51.380> bulb<00:02:52.660> let

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
devolved to a fucking light bulb let

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.040 
devolved to a fucking light bulb let
people<00:02:54.020> learn<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.890> do<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.160> themselves<00:02:56.050> I'm

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
people learn to do it themselves I'm

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.960 
people learn to do it themselves I'm
sure<00:02:57.590> every<00:02:57.830> will<00:02:57.980> become<00:02:58.220> much<00:02:58.459> nicer

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
sure every will become much nicer

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.670 
sure every will become much nicer
drivers<00:02:59.420> as<00:02:59.540> well<00:02:59.570> cuz<00:03:00.140> then<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.380> don't<00:03:00.560> get

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
drivers as well cuz then you don't get

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
you dropped a red light it wouldn't be

you dropped a red light it wouldn't be
red<00:03:05.390> light<00:03:05.570> every<00:03:05.959> light<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.320> effectively<00:03:06.770> a

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
red light it's just you've got to govern

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.160 
red light it's just you've got to govern
whether<00:03:09.890> it's<00:03:10.100> safe<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.550> drive<00:03:10.730> three<00:03:11.090> or<00:03:11.239> not

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
things you know world poverty we could

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.290 
things you know world poverty we could
do<00:04:26.010> something<00:04:26.220> about<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.490> instead<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:30.210> of

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
do something about that instead so of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.640 
do something about that instead so of
course<00:04:30.450> no<00:04:30.690> one's<00:04:30.840> going<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.080> challenge<00:04:31.290> the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
course no one's going to challenge the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.740 
course no one's going to challenge the
traffic<00:04:31.980> light<00:04:32.130> but<00:04:32.700> if<00:04:32.970> everyone<00:04:33.330> did<00:04:33.630> their

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
traffic light but if everyone did their

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.780 
traffic light but if everyone did their
own<00:04:33.870> little<00:04:34.110> bit<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.950> we<00:04:35.100> solved<00:04:35.550> all<00:04:35.670> these

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
own little bit and we solved all these

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.060 
own little bit and we solved all these
problems<00:04:35.960> maybe<00:04:36.960> we've<00:04:37.170> have<00:04:37.350> more<00:04:37.530> time<00:04:37.800> to

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
problems maybe we've have more time to

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.029 
problems maybe we've have more time to
concentrate<00:04:38.460> on<00:04:39.090> world<00:04:39.390> poverty

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.799 

even<00:04:43.699> just<00:04:43.819> saying<00:04:44.089> that<00:04:44.240> as<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.360> sense<00:04:44.629> that

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:44.809 
even just saying that as a sense that

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:47.049 
even just saying that as a sense that
sounds<00:04:45.169> ridiculous<00:04:45.529> because<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:46.099> the<00:04:46.219> scale

00:04:47.049 --> 00:04:47.059 
sounds ridiculous because of the scale

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:49.980 
sounds ridiculous because of the scale
differences<00:04:47.779> of<00:04:48.229> magnitude<00:04:49.039> of<00:04:49.219> what<00:04:49.369> what<00:04:49.580> is

what is a bad problem what is a what is

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:54.909 
what is a bad problem what is a what is
an<00:04:53.749> everyday<00:04:53.960> annoyance<00:04:54.499> and<00:04:54.680> what<00:04:54.800> is<00:04:54.889> a
