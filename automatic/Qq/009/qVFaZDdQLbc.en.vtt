00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.880 
can't remember feels heavy but it could
just<00:01:37.820> be<00:01:37.940> me<00:01:38.210> in<00:01:38.360> my<00:01:38.480> brain<00:01:38.750> but<00:01:39.440> it's

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
just be me in my brain but it's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.800 
just be me in my brain but it's
definitely<00:01:40.100> but<00:01:40.850> even<00:01:41.120> looking<00:01:41.360> up<00:01:41.480> the<00:01:41.570> box

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
definitely but even looking up the box

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.310

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
don't think much has changed in the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.979 
don't think much has changed in the
models<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.400> mean<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.730> isn't<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.239> first<00:02:20.540> gin

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
models I mean this isn't the first gin

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.050 
models I mean this isn't the first gin
of<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:22.040> there's<00:02:22.400> really<00:02:22.640> nothing

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
of this so that there's really nothing

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.110 
of this so that there's really nothing
too<00:02:23.420> exciting<00:02:23.750> about<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.970> we've<00:02:25.970> already

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
too exciting about that we've already

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.979 
too exciting about that we've already
had<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.420> few<00:02:26.660> revs<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.170> unibody<00:02:27.440> design<00:02:27.670> so

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
had a few revs of the unibody design so

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.020 
had a few revs of the unibody design so
let's<00:02:29.989> get<00:02:30.260> rid<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.890> stuff<00:02:33.790> this<00:02:34.790> out
