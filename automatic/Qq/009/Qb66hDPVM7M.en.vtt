when<00:00:00.299> I<00:00:00.329> push<00:00:00.599> any<00:00:00.930> hand<00:00:01.260> at<00:00:01.380> all<00:00:01.530> what<00:00:02.159> I'm

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
when I push any hand at all what I'm

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.579 
when I push any hand at all what I'm
looking<00:00:02.580> for<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.270> overall<00:00:03.540> gesture<00:00:04.110> what

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
looking for is the overall gesture what

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.840 
looking for is the overall gesture what
I'm<00:00:04.680> looking<00:00:04.980> for<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.430> overall<00:00:05.790> impact

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
I'm looking for is the overall impact

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.610 
I'm looking for is the overall impact
and<00:00:06.390> then<00:00:06.480> I'm<00:00:06.569> trying<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.960> build<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.319> people

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
and then I'm trying to build it people

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.770 
and then I'm trying to build it people
like<00:00:07.770> blocks<00:00:08.250> as<00:00:08.790> quickly<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.420> easily<00:00:09.540> as

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
like blocks as quickly and easily as

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.950 
like blocks as quickly and easily as
possible<00:00:13.400> like<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.639> you're<00:00:15.269> very<00:00:15.509> often

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
possible like that you're very often

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.290 
possible like that you're very often
going<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:17.279> essence<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> gesture

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
going to have the essence of the gesture

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.220 
going to have the essence of the gesture
of<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.480> hand<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.810> you're<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> build

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
of a hand and you're going to build

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.410 
of a hand and you're going to build
something<00:00:19.529> comes<00:00:19.859> off<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> side<00:00:20.340> but<00:00:20.820> just

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
something comes off the side but just

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.790 
something comes off the side but just
with<00:00:21.630> those<00:00:21.779> two<00:00:22.699> large<00:00:23.699> shapes<00:00:24.300> you're<00:00:25.260> going

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
with those two large shapes you're going

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.820 
with those two large shapes you're going
to<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.640> thrust<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.510> hand<00:00:27.779> okay<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.590> may

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
to have the thrust of a hand okay it may

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070 
to have the thrust of a hand okay it may
look<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.160> like<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> flipper<00:00:29.880> initially<00:00:30.480> but

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
look more like a flipper initially but

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
look more like a flipper initially but
then<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:31.949> through<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.730> break<00:00:33.120> out<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
then you go through and break out the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.010 
then you go through and break out the
elements<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.649> pull<00:00:34.980> away<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
elements that pull away from that and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.799 
elements that pull away from that and
find<00:00:37.040> your<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.399> hand<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> whole<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
find your your hand as a whole and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.560 
find your your hand as a whole and
strengthen<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.559> build<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.070> into<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:42.420> you're

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
strengthen it build it into what you're

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
strengthen it build it into what you're
actually<00:00:42.719> seeing<00:00:43.200> if<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> had<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> hand

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
actually seeing if you had a hand

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.150 
actually seeing if you had a hand
straight<00:00:45.180> off<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.539> side<00:00:45.750> same<00:00:46.140> idea<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.770> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
straight off the side same idea can I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
straight off the side same idea can I
reduce<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.739> couple<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:50.239> cubes<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
reduce it to a couple of cubes like this

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.029 
reduce it to a couple of cubes like this
that<00:00:52.760> will<00:00:53.760> show<00:00:54.360> me<00:00:54.390> where<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.469> bulk<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that will show me where the bulk of the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.900 
that will show me where the bulk of the
hands<00:00:56.280> gesture<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:58.289> from<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.460> can

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
hands gesture is and then from that can

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
hands gesture is and then from that can
I<00:01:00.059> add<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:01.260> additional<00:01:01.590> elements<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.670> are

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I add on my additional elements that are

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.800 
I add on my additional elements that are
going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.210> break<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.930> into<00:01:04.080> some<00:01:04.470> more<00:01:04.799> complex

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
going to break it into some more complex

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.929 
going to break it into some more complex
we<00:01:06.810> will<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.229> ultimately<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.189> many<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
we will get ultimately to many of the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.109 
we will get ultimately to many of the
complexities<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.830> how<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.850> every

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
complexities but this is how so every

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.700 
complexities but this is how so every
when<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:12.390> started<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.990> I've<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:13.439> his<00:01:13.560> wrist

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
when I'm started so I've got his wrist

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.050 
when I'm started so I've got his wrist
coming<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.369> I've<00:01:14.490> got<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.760> outside

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
coming in here I've got the outside

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
coming in here I've got the outside
contour<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.630> his<00:01:15.720> hand<00:01:15.960> coming<00:01:16.590> down<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:16.950> an

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
contour of his hand coming down at an

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
contour of his hand coming down at an
angle<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.720> dropping<00:01:18.990> into

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
angle about like that it's dropping into

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.080 
angle about like that it's dropping into
his<00:01:19.439> knuckles<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.009> falling<00:01:20.430> through<00:01:20.700> here

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
his knuckles and falling through here

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.969 
his knuckles and falling through here
I've<00:01:21.420> got<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.720> main<00:01:21.990> finger<00:01:22.409> running<00:01:22.770> along

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I've got that main finger running along

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.859 
I've got that main finger running along
which<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> occur

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
which is going to occur

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.450 
which is going to occur
get<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.079> hand<00:01:25.289> too<00:01:25.409> big<00:01:25.679> let's<00:01:26.009> shrink<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
get my hand too big let's shrink the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.230 
get my hand too big let's shrink the
staff

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.590 

like<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:34.310> then<00:01:34.520> I've<00:01:34.970> got<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.360> thumb

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
like that and then I've got the thumb

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.140 
like that and then I've got the thumb
gesture<00:01:36.020> coming<00:01:36.320> off<00:01:36.470> which<00:01:36.680> is<00:01:36.799> lovely

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
gesture coming off which is lovely

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.120 
gesture coming off which is lovely
graceful<00:01:38.150> motion<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.170> triangle<00:01:39.680> coming<00:01:39.979> down

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
graceful motion the triangle coming down

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.070 
graceful motion the triangle coming down
from<00:01:40.369> fingers<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:40.940> tip<00:01:41.150> drop<00:01:41.690> something<00:01:41.960> about

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
from fingers to tip drop something about

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.620 
from fingers to tip drop something about
that<00:01:42.260> far<00:01:42.619> then<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.850> comes<00:01:44.119> up<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.479> could<00:01:44.600> have

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
that far then this comes up I could have

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.749 
that far then this comes up I could have
narrowed<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.170> whole<00:01:45.409> thing<00:01:45.619> down<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.700> I've

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
narrowed this whole thing down so I've

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.840 
narrowed this whole thing down so I've
got<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.030> too<00:01:47.150> broad<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.229> what<00:01:48.350> am<00:01:48.470> i<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:49.670> is

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
got it too broad but what am i this is

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.999 
got it too broad but what am i this is
sort<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.119> my<00:01:50.240> outlining<00:01:50.750> finding<00:01:51.470> blocking

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
sort of my outlining finding blocking

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.160 
sort of my outlining finding blocking
stage<00:01:52.369> what<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.119> care<00:01:53.479> more<00:01:53.840> about<00:01:53.899> is<00:01:56.140> can<00:01:57.140> I

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
stage what I care more about is can I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.540 
stage what I care more about is can I
turn<00:01:57.320> this<00:01:57.860> into<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:59.149> constant<00:02:00.020> construct<00:02:00.979> that

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
turn this into a constant construct that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.029 
turn this into a constant construct that
is<00:02:02.180> like<00:02:03.110> my<00:02:03.470> set<00:02:03.800> of<00:02:04.570> blocks<00:02:05.570> initially<00:02:06.200> can<00:02:06.710> I

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
is like my set of blocks initially can I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.070 
is like my set of blocks initially can I
in<00:02:07.700> my<00:02:08.119> mind's<00:02:08.690> eye<00:02:08.869> break<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:09.950> down<00:02:10.280> into

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
in my mind's eye break this down into

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:20.070 
in my mind's eye break this down into
something<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:15.280> more<00:02:16.280> like<00:02:16.970> my<00:02:17.300> set<00:02:18.230> of

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
something that is is more like my set of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.630 
something that is is more like my set of
two

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.990 

card<00:02:24.450> decks<00:02:24.990> stacked<00:02:25.770> together<00:02:26.040> or<00:02:26.520> cigarette

card decks stacked together or cigarette

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.850 
card decks stacked together or cigarette
boxes<00:02:27.480> stack<00:02:28.230> together

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
boxes stack together

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.570 
boxes stack together
can<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:30.260> resolve<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.920> such<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> fashion

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
can I I resolve this in such a fashion

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.449 
can I I resolve this in such a fashion
quickly<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.650> me<00:02:34.920> what<00:02:35.520> I'm<00:02:35.670> seeing<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.390> a

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.420 

box<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.230> another<00:02:43.230> box<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.950> front<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.340> it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
box like this another box in front of it

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.150 
box like this another box in front of it
coming<00:02:44.640> down<00:02:44.880> about<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.360> far<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.930> then<00:02:46.500> one

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
coming down about this far and then one

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.510 
coming down about this far and then one
that<00:02:47.340> drapes<00:02:47.610> out<00:02:47.850> into<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> fingers<00:02:49.080> and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
that drapes out into the fingers and

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.510 
that drapes out into the fingers and
that<00:02:50.520> is<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.630> many<00:02:52.170> ways<00:02:54.380> all<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.400> this

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
that is in many ways all I have to this

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.490 
that is in many ways all I have to this
and<00:02:56.790> I've<00:02:56.970> got<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.360> thumb<00:02:57.570> coming<00:02:57.900> off<00:02:58.020> on<00:02:58.230> top

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
and I've got the thumb coming off on top

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.460 
and I've got the thumb coming off on top
of<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.770> box<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.760> it<00:03:00.420> actually<00:03:00.690> drops<00:03:01.200> out

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
of this box so it actually drops out

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.830 
of this box so it actually drops out
here<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.370> then<00:03:02.519> creates<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.090> substructure

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
here and then creates a substructure

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.810 
here and then creates a substructure
that<00:03:03.870> goes<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.040> still<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.700> my

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
that goes like that but I'm still in my

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.390 
that goes like that but I'm still in my
mind's<00:03:06.060> eye<00:03:06.380> wrapping<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.500> all<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.250> that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
mind's eye wrapping this all in so that

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.509 
mind's eye wrapping this all in so that
it<00:03:08.550> feels<00:03:08.910> like<00:03:09.660> solid<00:03:10.620> chunks<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.340> can

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
it feels like solid chunks that I can

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.479 
it feels like solid chunks that I can
pick<00:03:11.700> up<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:12.180> am<00:03:12.570> looking<00:03:13.380> for<00:03:13.650> planes<00:03:14.010> by

about that range this turns here comes

a little pallet within my pallet down
here<00:03:56.730> an<00:03:57.150> area<00:03:57.450> where<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.230> blue<00:03:58.920> turns

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
here an area where the blue turns

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.300 
here an area where the blue turns
purpley<00:04:00.300> over<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.630> red<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.320> red<00:04:01.350> orange<00:04:01.980> is

over to the yellow and then the yellow

over to the yellow and then the yellow
greens<00:04:06.210> up<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:07.230> plays<00:04:07.470> into<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.890> blue<00:04:08.070> I

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
greens up as it plays into the blue I

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.170 
greens up as it plays into the blue I
often<00:04:09.030> do<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.209> when<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.600> start<00:04:09.990> out<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:11.130> am<00:04:11.850> NOT

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
often do that when I start out I am NOT

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.870 
often do that when I start out I am NOT
a<00:04:12.480> big<00:04:12.900> fan<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:13.530> working<00:04:13.920> out<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.340> puddles<00:04:14.670> I

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
a big fan of working out of puddles I

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.320 
a big fan of working out of puddles I
don't<00:04:15.360> think<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.320> it's<00:04:16.470> grand<00:04:16.799> idea<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.970> get

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
don't think that it's grand idea to get

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.240 
don't think that it's grand idea to get
it<00:04:18.570> color<00:04:18.810> going<00:04:19.109> really<00:04:19.410> well<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.950> use<00:04:20.100> it

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
it color going really well and use it

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.610 
it color going really well and use it
everywhere<00:04:20.519> so<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.209> will<00:04:21.540> be<00:04:21.720> scraping<00:04:22.080> up<00:04:22.380> and

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
everywhere so I will be scraping up and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.290 
everywhere so I will be scraping up and
cleaning<00:04:22.890> off<00:04:23.070> my<00:04:23.100> pallet<00:04:23.430> cos<00:04:23.760> we've<00:04:24.180> been

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
cleaning off my pallet cos we've been

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.480 
cleaning off my pallet cos we've been
off<00:04:24.480> at<00:04:24.660> my<00:04:24.810> first<00:04:25.020> step<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.620> something<00:04:26.250> like

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
off at my first step is something like

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.040 
off at my first step is something like
this<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.270> get<00:04:27.390> something<00:04:27.720> up<00:04:27.810> there<00:04:27.930> and

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
this and it's get something up there and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.730 
this and it's get something up there and
get<00:04:28.140> started<00:04:29.630> that's<00:04:30.630> not<00:04:31.080> that<00:04:31.350> it's<00:04:31.650> a

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
get started that's not that it's a

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.610 
get started that's not that it's a
little<00:04:31.919> purpley<00:04:32.550> I'm<00:04:32.790> seeing<00:04:33.240> more<00:04:34.020> yellow<00:04:34.590> in

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
little purpley I'm seeing more yellow in

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.940 
little purpley I'm seeing more yellow in
there<00:04:35.040> than<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:36.090> initial<00:04:37.020> color<00:04:37.230> suggests

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
there than that initial color suggests

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.110 
there than that initial color suggests
it<00:04:38.730> also<00:04:39.180> feels<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.870> little<00:04:39.960> bit<00:04:40.169> light<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.770> me

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
it also feels a little bit light to me

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.950 
it also feels a little bit light to me
so<00:04:42.120> I'm<00:04:42.270> going<00:04:42.480> to<00:04:42.540> grab<00:04:43.169> some<00:04:43.200> yellow<00:04:44.960> jump

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
so I'm going to grab some yellow jump

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.020 
so I'm going to grab some yellow jump
into<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.530> mix<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.340> up<00:04:47.490> with<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:47.669> little<00:04:47.910> more

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
into it and mix it up with a little more

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.220 
into it and mix it up with a little more
red<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.240> blue<00:04:48.540> it's<00:04:48.780> still<00:04:48.990> more

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
red and blue it's still more

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.750 
red and blue it's still more
predominantly<00:04:49.800> yellow<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.280> play<00:04:50.550> that

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
predominantly yellow and play that

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.219 
predominantly yellow and play that
through<00:04:51.060> that's<00:04:51.570> better

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
through that's better

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.159 
through that's better
notice<00:04:52.919> that<00:04:53.280> even<00:04:54.150> in<00:04:54.450> my<00:04:54.570> initial<00:04:54.780> stage

notice that even in my initial stage

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:55.730 
notice that even in my initial stage

small<00:05:11.550> I'm<00:05:11.940> actually<00:05:12.180> picking<00:05:12.630> up<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.050> paint

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
and laying it on that went darker than I

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.500 
and laying it on that went darker than I
