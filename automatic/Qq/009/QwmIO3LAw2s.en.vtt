this<00:01:19.469> is<00:01:19.590> obviously<00:01:19.829> talking<00:01:19.979> about<00:01:20.159> radar

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
this is obviously talking about radar

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.929 
this is obviously talking about radar
here<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:22.249> it's<00:01:23.249> always<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.490> very<00:01:23.549> interesting

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
here and it's always a very interesting

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.899 
here and it's always a very interesting
question<00:01:24.740> people<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> UFO<00:01:26.429> that's<00:01:26.639> one

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
thing but if something is then tracked

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.419 
thing but if something is then tracked
on<00:01:30.779> radar<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> same<00:01:31.619> time<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> Air

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429

Force<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.969> verify<00:01:33.179> that<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:34.109> obviously

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
Force can verify that that's obviously

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609 
Force can verify that that's obviously
hugely<00:01:35.340> significant<00:01:36.139> this<00:01:37.139> is<00:01:37.259> absolutely

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
hugely significant this is absolutely

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.589 
hugely significant this is absolutely
fascinating<00:01:37.859> stuff<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.849> people<00:01:39.090> who<00:01:39.359> have

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:39.599 
fascinating stuff and people who have

fascinating stuff and people who have
their<00:01:39.840> own<00:01:40.219> areas<00:01:41.219> of<00:01:41.369> interest<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.060> some<00:01:42.329> of

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
their own areas of interest but some of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.019 
their own areas of interest but some of
the<00:01:42.840> personal<00:01:43.259> highlights<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.130> me<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.490> was

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:45.029 
the personal highlights for me I was

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:47.480 
the personal highlights for me I was
interested<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.689> slightly<00:01:46.349> amused<00:01:46.529> to<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
interested and slightly amused to see a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.959 
interested and slightly amused to see a
very<00:01:47.789> interesting<00:01:48.950> case<00:01:49.950> where<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.700> whole

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
very interesting case where a whole

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.849 
very interesting case where a whole
bunch<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.889> staff<00:01:52.889> and<00:01:53.219> customers<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.999> pub

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
bunch of staff and customers at a pub

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.550 
bunch of staff and customers at a pub
actually<00:01:55.859> saw<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> great<00:01:56.639> white<00:01:56.939> light<00:01:57.560> with

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
actually saw a great white light with

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.679 
actually saw a great white light with
red<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.099> green<00:01:59.189> lights<00:01:59.609> on<00:01:59.939> either<00:02:00.090> side<00:02:00.419> and

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
red and green lights on either side and

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.480 
red and green lights on either side and
I<00:02:00.929> think<00:02:01.169> the<00:02:01.289> clincher<00:02:01.709> in<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.950> case<00:02:02.189> was

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
I think the clincher in this case was

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.699 
I think the clincher in this case was
that<00:02:02.520> when<00:02:03.299> asked<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.779> direction<00:02:04.289> this<00:02:04.439> was

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
that when asked what direction this was

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
that when asked what direction this was
they<00:02:04.919> said<00:02:05.099> well<00:02:05.249> it<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.429> in<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.609> direction

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
they said well it was in the direction

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.830 
they said well it was in the direction
of<00:02:06.060> Gatwick<00:02:06.479> Airport<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.889> think

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
of Gatwick Airport and I think

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.669 
of Gatwick Airport and I think
possibility<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> might<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.440> been<00:02:10.560> an

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
possibility that might have been an

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.880 
possibility that might have been an
aeroplane<00:02:10.979> 25<00:02:11.819> /<00:02:12.290> 1922<00:02:13.290> there's<00:02:13.709> very

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
aeroplane 25 / 1922 there's very

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.699 
aeroplane 25 / 1922 there's very
interesting<00:02:14.390> illustration<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.500> fact

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
interesting illustration of the fact

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.950 
interesting illustration of the fact
that<00:02:16.830> actually<00:02:17.430> UFOs<00:02:18.060> are<00:02:18.240> seen<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.480> built-up

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
that actually UFOs are seen in built-up

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.089 
that actually UFOs are seen in built-up
areas<00:02:18.990> people<00:02:19.710> have<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.010> idea<00:02:20.340> they're<00:02:20.520> seen

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
areas people have this idea they're seen
