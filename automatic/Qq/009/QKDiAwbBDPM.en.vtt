00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
so interesting and I could do a lot of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
so interesting and I could do a lot of
3d<00:00:48.510> stuff<00:00:48.930> with<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.379> he's<00:00:49.559> pretty<00:00:49.829> much

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
3d stuff with it so he's pretty much

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.639 
3d stuff with it so he's pretty much

just a melon guy a guy made out of melon
so<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> looks<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.610> wearing

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
so this is what it looks like wearing

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
so this is what it looks like wearing
Hawaiian<00:00:54.600> shirt<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.199> he's<00:00:55.559> got<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
Hawaiian shirt and he's got the the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.400 
Hawaiian shirt and he's got the the
snazzy<00:00:56.940> belt<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.780> well<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.199> one

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
snazzy belt on there as well so this one

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.889 
snazzy belt on there as well so this one
looks<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.949> wasn't<00:00:59.430> totally<00:01:00.420> happy<00:01:00.750> with

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
looks like I wasn't totally happy with

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.319 
looks like I wasn't totally happy with
the<00:01:01.199> light<00:01:01.949> green<00:01:02.219> color<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> bit

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the light green color because it's a bit

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.030 
the light green color because it's a bit
too<00:01:03.629> light<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> shaders<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
too light but if the shaders on it

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
too light but if the shaders on it
actually<00:01:05.369> looks<00:01:05.580> ok<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.119> he's<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> 3d

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
actually looks ok so he's got the 3d

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420 
actually looks ok so he's got the 3d
glasses<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.650> decided<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> make

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
glasses on there I decided not to make

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.160 
glasses on there I decided not to make
those<00:01:08.700> 3d<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.540> had<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> whole<00:01:09.900> mouth

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
those 3d because I had the whole mouth

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
those 3d because I had the whole mouth
thing<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> I've<00:01:11.340> rounded<00:01:11.610> off<00:01:11.880> his

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
thing going on and I've rounded off his

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
thing going on and I've rounded off his
head<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.390> well<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
head as well because you know it's a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.410 
head as well because you know it's a
melon<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.430> they're<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> round

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
melon so they're kind of round

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.719 
melon so they're kind of round
well<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.350> Minecraft<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> looks<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.490> lot

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
well not in Minecraft but it looks a lot

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.730 
well not in Minecraft but it looks a lot
better<00:01:17.790> round<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.630> did<00:01:18.780> square<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
better round and it did square just do a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.859 
better round and it did square just do a
quick<00:01:19.979> fly<00:01:20.369> around<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.600> front

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
quick fly around this is the the front

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
quick fly around this is the the front
of<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.229> Hawaiian<00:01:22.680> shirt<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.070> stuff<00:01:23.220> like

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of it with Hawaiian shirt and stuff like

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.249 
of it with Hawaiian shirt and stuff like
there's<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:23.729> too<00:01:23.909> much<00:01:24.030> shading<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.049> rest

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
there's not too much shading on the rest

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.770 
there's not too much shading on the rest
of<00:01:25.380> his<00:01:25.470> skin<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:26.070> all<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:26.700> apart<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
of his skin at all really apart from the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
of his skin at all really apart from the
back<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.950> really

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
back which is the bit I was really

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.100 
back which is the bit I was really
getting<00:01:29.460> interested<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.240> especially<00:01:30.540> like

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
getting interested to do especially like

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
getting interested to do especially like
the<00:01:31.290> front<00:01:31.590> I've<00:01:31.680> kind<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.920> done<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the front I've kind of done it like the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.130 
the front I've kind of done it like the

was<00:01:39.630> incredibly<00:01:40.259> fun<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.680> check<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.009> out

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
was incredibly fun to do check that out

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.940 
was incredibly fun to do check that out
is<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.729> his<00:01:41.939> melon<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> open<00:01:42.960> his<00:01:43.409> brain<00:01:43.740> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
is like his melon is open his brain is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
is like his melon is open his brain is
spinning<00:01:44.100> out<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> sides<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
spinning out the sides and I think the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.260 
spinning out the sides and I think the
3d<00:01:46.409> actually<00:01:46.860> came<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.579> well<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.149> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
3d actually came out really well here it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
3d actually came out really well here it
looks<00:01:48.450> awesome<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> shaders<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.560> as

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
well and this is just the back pretty

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.090 
well and this is just the back pretty
much<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> same<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> front<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> main

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
much the same as the front but the main
