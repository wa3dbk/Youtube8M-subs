00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
have one more millimeter to go and I'll

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.640 
have one more millimeter to go and I'll
be<00:01:50.510> at<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.890> inch<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.729> all<00:01:53.270> film<00:01:53.900> that<00:01:54.170> one<00:01:54.350> too
