that<00:03:02.690> will<00:03:02.840> come<00:03:03.050> out<00:03:03.230> with<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.650> can<00:03:04.060> try

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
that will come out with it you can try

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.330 
that will come out with it you can try
to<00:03:05.150> catch<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.660> or<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.140> can<00:03:06.349> just<00:03:06.620> let<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.190> fall

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
to catch it or you can just let it fall

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.770 
to catch it or you can just let it fall
on<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.550> pan<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.940> pull<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.209> out<00:03:08.330> later<00:03:10.780> and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
on the pan and pull it out later and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.640 
on the pan and pull it out later and
then<00:03:11.900> you're<00:03:12.050> just<00:03:12.140> going<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.410> let<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.620> oil

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
then you're just going to let the oil

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.830 
then you're just going to let the oil
drain<00:03:12.920> while<00:03:13.580> your<00:03:13.790> oil<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.209> draining<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.660> can

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
drain while your oil is draining you can

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.160 
drain while your oil is draining you can
go<00:03:15.019> ahead<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:16.190> take<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.299> filter<00:03:17.720> off<00:03:17.840> again

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
go ahead and take the filter off again

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.979 
go ahead and take the filter off again
