frames<00:03:00.459> come<00:03:00.640> back<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.180> it's<00:03:01.480> great<00:03:01.630> for

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
frames come back in so it's great for

watching movies in terms of the layout

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:05.670 
watching movies in terms of the layout
of<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.209> keys<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.840> QWERTY<00:03:05.170> keyboard<00:03:05.530> so

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
of the keys it's a QWERTY keyboard so

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.190 
of the keys it's a QWERTY keyboard so
that's<00:03:06.040> pretty<00:03:06.250> easy<00:03:06.310> getting<00:03:06.970> used<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.299> and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
that's pretty easy getting used to and

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.630 
that's pretty easy getting used to and
there<00:03:08.350> are<00:03:08.440> two<00:03:08.530> space<00:03:08.739> bars<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.160> either<00:03:09.310> side

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
there are two space bars on either side

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.990 
there are two space bars on either side
it<00:03:09.820> had<00:03:10.030> which<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:10.930> useful<00:03:11.549> just<00:03:12.549> going<00:03:12.820> down

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
it had which can useful just going down

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.580 
it had which can useful just going down
so<00:03:13.209> if<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.329> press<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.690> don't<00:03:14.290> know<00:03:14.350> if<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.470> can

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
setting that I found that seems to help

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.780 
setting that I found that seems to help
that's<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> point<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:36.010> speed<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.579> click

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
that's the point to speed so you click

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.970 
that's the point to speed so you click
on<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.120> if<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.780> try<00:03:38.139> get<00:03:38.350> all<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.650> way<00:03:38.739> down

on that if I try get all the way down

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.949 
on that if I try get all the way down
it's<00:03:39.370> probably<00:03:39.700> best<00:03:40.269> ways<00:03:40.450> show<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.720> what

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959
