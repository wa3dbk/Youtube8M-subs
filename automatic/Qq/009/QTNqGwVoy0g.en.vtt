00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.290
 good afternoon dear mom dad grandmother 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.340
 and grandfathers a little bird arrived today 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.429
 spring bird 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.920
 these birds used to attract spring 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.570
 and today we will learn to do 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.140
 such wonderful birds to us 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.359
 It will take about 15 flap of fabric 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.750
 15 centimeters is better to use 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:33.300
 cotton fabric 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:35.070
 cotton wool or synthetic winterizer and thread to start 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.020
 we need to find the middle here of this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.710
 rags to do this we need 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.160
 to fold 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.350
 flap like that to make such 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.390
 make a triangle of a square 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 triangle this tip will be ours 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.550
 beak take a red string 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.300
 back down a centimeter a little bit less 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.870
 can be seven millimeters and a thread 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.640
 neatly begin to form 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:06.049
 do not cut the beak of the thread straighten 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 rag and here we got this here 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 then take a piece of cotton or sintepon 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.110
 and start shaping your head if you 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.330
 remember we once did the bunny themselves 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.310
 and used about the same technique 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.689
 we take to the center 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.320
 ball and make out google and start 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.420
 reel 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.570
 head now spread our wings 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.250
 you should be like this 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.820
 the square is still smaller and now 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.939
 diagonal lines we fold 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.439
 top to bottom and two side but this 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.409
 yet all we need is the whole point 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.880
 form a thread that does not have us 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.490
 broke off we begin to form 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.780
 wings breasts once again wings again 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.759
