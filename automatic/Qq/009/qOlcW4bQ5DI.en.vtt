00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 there 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.770
 a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.669
 These are parts of technology 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.669
 exactly 25 years this year 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.630
 25 years ago 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.979
 Amazon Seller Gate, of course, too 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.619
 align concrete goals 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.610
 Percentage traditionally equipped in dental technology 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.400
 with technology though 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.420
 definitely 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.030
 our specialty is 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.010
 Power can be technology 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.289
 had to 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.570
 just fine 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.030
 The question of whether it has been economically worthwhile I can therefore 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.650
 unreservedly with yes answer 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.480
 It was not a stroke of luck for us because the TVE leads him here 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 above 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.949
 little instead 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.060
 re-elected 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.890
 and so far our art has been so much expanded 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.180
 and so you can say so that we now Germany was awp 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.390
 international 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.270
 Customers have gained this without this process probably would have 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.720
 a very good instrument that we have on hand 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.830
 use and use but 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.930
 the us and that craftsmanship in no way 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.740
 is restricted and that's me 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.580
 above all, solved very well 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.850
 I think that's the future 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.240
 certainly bad 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660
 the planned 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.430
 August 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.160
 It can be said that diplomacy happens more urban 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.620
 very innovative leadership 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.250
 So she is always on the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.590
 may become with time 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.430
 But we would also like our students there now 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.520
 an example after some very early too 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310
 the integration 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.490
 Percent of Campanian apartments with the apartment that his hair 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.100
 Reason is that is also not the last things again implemented percent 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.409
 so i understand it is a brief dumb so we have the option 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.049
 Furthermore, the 710 is also new in Frankfurt's approach 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.870
 Of course, the minute the infection will die out 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.809
 and for example a digital world 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.959
 whoever has a lot of room and Stephen and Far more young 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.449
 dynamic leadership 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:28.219
 For many children Hamm was at the base 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.630
 this is also the philosophy 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.870
 applicable 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.659
 for SOS tries to implement the whole I believe so that word is quite 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.659
 thankfully all open 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.840
 in advance 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.079
 old also a huge potential 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.639
 Alba we are complete 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.569
 4 for example, was allowed 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.189
 benefit that percent 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.790
 its interfaces are open interface to SAP or are they themselves 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.459
 but also other systems such as the other direction 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.889
 Unfortunately, the procedure or 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.769
 he prefers to hold 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.279
 that is also for yourself 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.809
 the advantages for the 2 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.869
 the choice for the point 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.530
 to 7 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.660
 seeking to be responsive and I believe and modern dance 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.059
 management 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.399
 Justin Brown meets something like that 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.209
 Use what's developing there as well 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.849
 The understanding must be learned from both sides of all the other commandments of the 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.849
 Dental technician as old 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.179
 we have that 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.409
 Period of two years after which is calculated and 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.999
 we think that we have productivity and even 20 percent 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.559
 increased 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:41.980
 the other is that 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.470
 All systems have all open systems which must inevitably 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:48.869
 the one with the number 1 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.049
 "That's not an attack 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.739
 in the field 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.769
 So it's like charging 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.829
 Rolf possible for future security is achieved 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.019
 you want to deal with it and I think so too 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.419
 Percent a certain spread 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.889
 "So too 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.140
 it always gets like this 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.590
 Soma from the final also percent 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.759
 the Werkself on safe 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.840
 with them, which can also develop in the future 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.999
 and this development 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.870
 how to incorporate the area of ​​the product 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.780
 also the big one in the end 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.819
 User community as emerges 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:23.710
 with your 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.710
 Information also motivates a company 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.490
 for the future that's something 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.699
 to great shape and power 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.020
 that's just the number one thing in the world 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.120
 yes and i just believe that with this product will certainly be a good one 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.139
 Choice too 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.139
 betting 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.909
 against a superior 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.770
 Corner for Wales both goals 3 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.159
 and 76 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.319
 In 1985 we are working here with Herr Reichel together with his big brother 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.680
 Dental laboratory Eike Zahntechnik 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.770
 either he has been for ten years 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.990
 11% company 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.950
 Pips points right in driving areas could be a very good one 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.610
 Gain experience with it 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.789
 all things the reliability of the system 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.130
 yes we were able to eradicate sources of error and Nam Chol for process reliability 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.430
 achieve 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.430
 because of course, in the interest of the patients 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.240
 could like to work together were larger 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.990
 everyone was working 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.749
 otherwise in the lab 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.259
 had left a suspect where the imponderables out 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:32.749
 engineer 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.819
 The people would be down was there have ever been different 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.330
 Different results then came to us here they can be sure 

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:42.889
 be that a consistent quality 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.949
 receive reliable reliable product and no one looks relatively safe 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.699
 the big work comes to mind 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.469
 the treatment time 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.189
 will definitely reduce the length of stay of the patient including the number 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.509
 the sessions can be curbed 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.509
 Above all, not so many Peter Barton and work off 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.050
 one of my not recognized i am for 18 years 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.639
 he traveled busy 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.460
 from my apprenticeship in the year two to Innsbruck Rangsechsten only 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.529
 completed successfully 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:17.770
 proprietress 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.199
 Marquez also passed my master exam in 2008 to the lab 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:24.180
 two cards 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.710
 Haqqani will work 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.199
 Since then my main responsibilities 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.199
 So there are started with the way of his 50th 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.729
 the expected reinforcement was replaced by the way 640 want to be very pleased 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:37.580
 to have 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.999
 We also have the 710 environmental groups 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:44.549
 with in the boat and 8 a FOC to cover the rip off with 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.189
 I can only confirm that 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.389
 willing 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.999
 would have to be achieved but at work so the question is one can 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:55.999
 Nuclear power angry fans knew confirmed 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.280
 yes from home 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.139
 Reichelt given what everyone on it percent 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.270
 Mid-March in your own hands 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.170
 it does not include all the features but you can do many many things with it 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:09.039
 to reach 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.139
 I was also a bit of time a photo one percent 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.440
 with the thought also sets in so there are all boundaries open 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.599
 I had work experience after ten years 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:23.490
 has learned the trade even from scratch 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.759
 but I do not have to say myself often who has the congress 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.819
 not really adapted 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:32.249
 Nobody knows and where the problem for coach Fred Rutten is in all 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:33.119
 mouth 

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:37.019
 if I can but one of the port did not freeze from the full form backfand 

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:40.019
 he can not say exactly 'I want to go for it everywhere 

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:42.719
 only formally 7 pm Colmar 

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:44.369
 Prime Minister Kurt Beck 

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:45.990
 January is 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.879
 a hand-assembled 

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.189
 as the relieved 

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:50.419
 Recommendation is a 2 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:54.690
 a guarantee that a system evolves, I believe 

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:56.460
 because of that with the digital 

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.750
 which a big piece can move forward is unlocked for me 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.529
 to create a secure partner 

00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:02.949
 Altena
