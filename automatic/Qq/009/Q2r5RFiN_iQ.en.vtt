00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello all welcome to my channel in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.210
 this video I want to share the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.490
 mask to hydrate and define the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.710
 curls that I'm using this 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.200
 I made it myself 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.109
 based on the ingredients that I have seen 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.840
 that is doing very well to my hair as I 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.180
 had said in another video since I was 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.060
 already tired of using the gel that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.010
 only gelatin out rather than 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 I defined only the beginnings could 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.900
 have a softer texture in my hair 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.270
 then none of the creams that I 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.320
 I had seen they had defined me well in 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.989
 the curls 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.360
 and hydrated that what I look for in a 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.280
 product for me to ask for what I 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.950
 I did looking at the things that are going well for 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.309
 my hair was elaborate my own I think for 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.649
 define my curls that I did was 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.500
 thinking I'm not looking for a genre but something 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.660
 that goes very smooth to my hair because what 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.480
 what I did was the following as I know that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.670
 in flaxseed gel is doing very well for me 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.519
 I used flaxseed 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.119
 this cream but also I what I'm looking for 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:10.350
 is that she is not a woman but cream 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.869
 What I did was add a facelift that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.200
 have silicone or you can also use 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.229
 that much cheaper is a 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 conditioner that does not have silicone and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.149
 that its consistency is thick for me 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.670
 this conditioner goes very well because 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.890
 that thick is economical and you can 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.800
 get here but as I have seen that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.050
 this is going very well for me and I have in the house 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.720
 well I decided to use this but if 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.179
 you do not have wifi and it is difficult very 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.119
 expensive I can use a conditioner 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.409
 That is economical but in the middle of my 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.929
 I'm going to use this 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.259
 afterwards we ingredients only 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.770
 I will continue giving as I steal the 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.979
 cream because I was also accountant 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.249
 how do you see how my hair is 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.859
 this time I have a few tweets out first 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:05.810
 once I say they throw me or the second time 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.720
 let's say to not hydrate that I 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.629
 they look good that I did what I did was what 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.510
 next as I knew that my fierce was 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.549
 They shrink a lot, what I thought was so 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.610
 I'm going to spend the robert remove all 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.860
 the waves of my hair less than with the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.890
 Theft and a brush without formality 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.140
 just to stretch the hair and then I 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.720
 I made the twins and the sun but I do not know 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.329
 it shrunk so much because it was not wet 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.540
 what is what I wear is the cream 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.180
 that I am using the I was adding 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.829
 and that is going and we are saying the hair 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.440
 but not using it so that it does not 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:46.130
 shrink and this morning 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.170
 here I have my tweets out I'm 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.750
 supercontenta the hair is super soft 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.350
 but he's driving but you do not see that 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.780
 sharp consistency as the gel leaves and 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.710
 it looks healthier prettier then 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.270
 I liked what I tell them, girl is 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.280
 invent this is what we have to 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.100
 do with our but why not all 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.310
 do things at once and looking 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.130
 it's also not just comparing things each 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.860
 expensive product but to go looking at what 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.900
 we have in the house and what is going 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.750
 well in your hair we can bind because not 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.760
 just everything to buy was already thinking there 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.830
 many things this gets you 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.050
 they put of the other but if I put you is 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.810
 If this works for me, I'll do our 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.750
 product I hope that this video will 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.240

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.070

 define the curls as you want to call it 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.370
 As I had already told him, I'm going to 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.860
 use the live it from giovanni here 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.310
 is the gel those that do not leave are left 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.440
 I'm going to put my video on how I did the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.320
 flaxseed but only have it to 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.560
 do to the point that we sneak 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.540
 after that he does not need to put him 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.230
 it's harder because we're going to put it now 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:20.420
 here the following is the spicy lard 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:25.510
 I already have it here that is already diluted 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:28.800
 shea butter vitamin E oil 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.800
 the glycerin 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.740
 and jojoba oil or coconut oil 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.780
 oil having hand very 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.789
 important almonds is that you 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.320
 use it to do its best but in 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:44.510
 this case I will use the jojoba 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.850
 and finally the container where we are going to 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.010
 make the cream I have this here 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.290
 was that I made the previous measure in which 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.260
 it stays a little then it can only do 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.270
 you also need a blender like that if the 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.310
 have in the house but it does not matter 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.210
 use a spoon, not then what 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.300
 what do I do 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.150
 I do not say something like that I have no measure for 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.699
 put it because I what I look for with a 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.240
 cream then I put a 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.240
 quantity 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.340
 here I have it and what I do next 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.780
 adding an ingredient I already have here 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.780
 shea butter 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:35.530
 to watering the shea butter added 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.530
 Miguel, here I have it 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.610
 then what I do is add a 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.889
 tablespoon of oil 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.689
 you will get the amount of agreement 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.389
 What is going to improve your hair? 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.219
 doing what you want me to do 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.770
 If you know that this product is very 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:57.020
 good for your body that's why that 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.719
 was what I did things that I know that 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.710
 we go well to my hair to add then 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:09.979
 I'm going to add two glycerin 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:15.310
 spoonfuls two spoons and then what 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.310
 another is easy for the cta to be done 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:33.619
 here we have it is a cream as you see 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.619
 You can use it like this 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:43.870
 and with that cream you can put it on when 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.970
 are going to make their tweets or when you 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.670
 you are going to define only what you need 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.380
 Define the curls use this cream 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.420
 this is the photo and using it has gone 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.370
 very well you have to keep it in the 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.190
 fridge I the first one I did the 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.130
 keep the refrigerator for three weeks 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.040
 and it did not have a bad smell or anything I put it 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.290
 the fridge and we're going to do well 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.090
 ratico before putting it and then when 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.830
 finish good and put it in the fridge 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.800
 so that it is conserved because as it has 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.990
 the flaxseed can then be damaged 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.180
 will keep the cooler will use 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:19.300
