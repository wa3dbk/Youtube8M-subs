tortured<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.340> at<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.489> same<00:02:50.550> time<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.760> think

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
tortured but at the same time I think

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.040 
tortured but at the same time I think
that's<00:02:51.060> one<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.300> things<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.660> this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
that's one of the things that this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.750 
that's one of the things that this
season<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.709> lacking<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.700> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
season is lacking because one of the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.190 
season is lacking because one of the
things<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:53.970> personally<00:02:54.390> loved<00:02:54.570> was<00:02:54.930> getting

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
things I personally loved was getting

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.360 
things I personally loved was getting
the<00:02:55.320> character<00:02:55.890> development<00:02:56.220> and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
the character development and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.430 
the character development and
characterization<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.209> ken<00:02:57.690> kaneki<00:02:57.959> through

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
characterization of ken kaneki through

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.620 
characterization of ken kaneki through
season<00:02:58.830> 1<00:02:59.010> episode<00:02:59.489> 1<00:02:59.520> through<00:02:59.850> 12<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.300> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
season 1 episode 1 through 12 and the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.360 
season 1 episode 1 through 12 and the
manga<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.140> first<00:03:01.350> 60-something<00:03:02.040> chapters

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
manga the first 60-something chapters

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.280 
manga the first 60-something chapters
that<00:03:02.430> come<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.820> content<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.360> think<00:03:04.020> that

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
that come of that content I think that

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.780 
that come of that content I think that
was<00:03:04.410> one<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.709> best<00:03:04.920> things<00:03:05.100> about<00:03:05.220> Tokyo

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
was one of the best things about Tokyo

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.190 
was one of the best things about Tokyo
ghoul<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.180> when<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.570> take<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.900> out<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
ghoul so when you take that out of the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.990 
ghoul so when you take that out of the
equation<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.160> moreso<00:03:08.520> leaning<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
equation and is moreso leaning on the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.280 
equation and is moreso leaning on the
inspectors<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.690> takes<00:03:09.870> out<00:03:09.989> one<00:03:10.020> of<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
inspectors it takes out one of the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.840 
inspectors it takes out one of the
elements<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.830> personally<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.610> I

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
elements that I personally like and I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.670 
elements that I personally like and I
felt<00:03:12.090> drove<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.510> story<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.989> proper<00:03:13.350> way<00:03:13.380> in

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
felt drove the story in a proper way in

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.410 
felt drove the story in a proper way in
a<00:03:13.739> proper<00:03:14.100> fashion<00:03:14.310> for<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.090> matter<00:03:15.239> because

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
a proper fashion for that matter because

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.760 
a proper fashion for that matter because
it's<00:03:15.690> kind<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:15.959> every<00:03:16.440> time<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.650> see

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
it's kind of like every time we see

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.280 
it's kind of like every time we see
kaneki<00:03:17.250> he's<00:03:17.549> just<00:03:17.760> quiet<00:03:18.060> or<00:03:18.510> he's<00:03:18.720> screaming

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
kaneki he's just quiet or he's screaming

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.140 
kaneki he's just quiet or he's screaming
in<00:03:19.380> agony<00:03:19.650> or<00:03:20.250> he's<00:03:20.370> dealing<00:03:20.700> with<00:03:20.730> something

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
in agony or he's dealing with something

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.400 
in agony or he's dealing with something
and<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.330> think<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.750> feels<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.049> little<00:03:22.140> bit<00:03:22.290> more

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
and I think it feels a little bit more

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.860 
and I think it feels a little bit more
expressive<00:03:23.010> vocally<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.269> know<00:03:24.360> besides

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
expressive vocally you know besides

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.330 
expressive vocally you know besides
screaming<00:03:25.380> like<00:03:25.500> actually<00:03:25.860> talking<00:03:26.250> or

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
screaming like actually talking or

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.650 
screaming like actually talking or
whatever<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.850> would<00:03:27.000> make<00:03:27.180> things<00:03:27.330> flow<00:03:27.630> a

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
whatever it would make things flow a

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.180 
whatever it would make things flow a
little<00:03:27.840> bit<00:03:28.019> better<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.410> yet<00:03:28.560> again<00:03:28.650> Tokyo

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
little bit better and yet again Tokyo

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.860 
little bit better and yet again Tokyo
with<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.400> minimal<00:03:29.970> role<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.299> she<00:03:30.450> has<00:03:30.630> and

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
with the minimal role that she has and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.030 
with the minimal role that she has and
the<00:03:30.930> manga<00:03:31.260> she<00:03:31.290> didn't<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:31.680> any<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.950> these

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
the manga she didn't have any of these

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
manga and for season 1 of the anime that

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.160 
manga and for season 1 of the anime that
was<00:03:41.220> probably<00:03:41.700> my<00:03:42.060> favorite<00:03:42.090> character<00:03:42.420> but

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
was probably my favorite character but

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.259 
was probably my favorite character but
in<00:03:43.320> this<00:03:43.500> one<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.950> again<00:03:44.400> these<00:03:44.730> elements

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
in this one and again these elements

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.640 
in this one and again these elements
really<00:03:45.420> weren't<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:45.959> manga<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.440> that

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
really weren't in the manga like that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.350 
really weren't in the manga like that
heavily<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.160> feel<00:03:47.640> as<00:03:47.760> though<00:03:47.790> that's<00:03:48.180> just

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
heavily I feel as though that's just

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.180 
heavily I feel as though that's just
basically<00:03:48.660> for<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.260> toka<00:03:49.500> fanservice

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
basically for the toka fanservice

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.729 
basically for the toka fanservice
because<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.760> think<00:03:50.910> they<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.750> monocot<00:03:52.320> even

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
because I think they the monocot even

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.259 
because I think they the monocot even
didn't<00:03:53.010> feel<00:03:53.160> like<00:03:53.280> her<00:03:53.579> story<00:03:53.970> was

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.180 
didn't feel like her story was
interesting<00:03:54.630> enough<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.500> keep<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.769> going<00:03:56.040> cuz

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
of her subplot being reduced to just

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.780 
of her subplot being reduced to just
kind<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.019> ultimately<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:10.980> still<00:04:11.610> feel

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
kind of that ultimately I still feel

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.310 
kind of that ultimately I still feel
free<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.239> realized<00:04:12.510> oh<00:04:12.630> we<00:04:12.959> could<00:04:13.140> use

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
free I just realized oh we could use

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.870 
free I just realized oh we could use
that<00:04:13.350> screen<00:04:13.680> time<00:04:13.860> for<00:04:13.890> other<00:04:14.190> things<00:04:14.610> or

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
that screen time for other things or

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640 
that screen time for other things or
maybe<00:04:15.000> more<00:04:15.299> kaneki<00:04:15.870> him<00:04:16.079> talking

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
maybe more kaneki him talking

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.409 
maybe more kaneki him talking
understanding<00:04:17.609> what<00:04:17.729> he<00:04:17.790> feels<00:04:18.000> right<00:04:18.269> now

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
understanding what he feels right now

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.940 
understanding what he feels right now
although<00:04:18.690> technically<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.290> an<00:04:19.410> agony<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:19.919> I

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
although technically is an agony so I

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.020 
although technically is an agony so I
don't<00:04:20.070> know<00:04:20.130> how<00:04:20.190> much<00:04:20.280> talking<00:04:20.700> he<00:04:20.820> would<00:04:20.940> do

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
don't know how much talking he would do

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.099

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
what you did because that ocular though

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.950 
what you did because that ocular though
and<00:04:31.860> just<00:04:32.040> kind<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.280> getting<00:04:32.460> more<00:04:32.640> of<00:04:32.730> their

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.850 
I guess characterization and kind of
character<00:04:37.080> development<00:04:37.350> at<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.560> same<00:04:37.680> time

making advances towards him and the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.690 
making advances towards him and the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
anime that kind of cut it a little bit

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.270

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
more I think we would flow better if we

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.130 
more I think we would flow better if we
got<00:05:59.910> more<00:06:00.090> from<00:06:00.270> his<00:06:00.390> perspective<00:06:00.660> but<00:06:01.020> it

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
got more from his perspective but it

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.060 
got more from his perspective but it
would<00:06:01.230> flow<00:06:01.350> better<00:06:01.560> that's<00:06:01.710> what<00:06:01.830> I<00:06:01.890> honestly

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
would flow better that's what I honestly

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.890 
would flow better that's what I honestly
