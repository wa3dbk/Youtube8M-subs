00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
undetectable the low profile is going to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
undetectable the low profile is going to
be<00:00:28.560> thinner<00:00:28.890> than<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.460> regular<00:00:29.850> super<00:00:30.210> tape

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
be thinner than the regular super tape

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.620 
be thinner than the regular super tape
and<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:31.140> also<00:00:31.320> no<00:00:31.710> shine<00:00:32.120> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> on

and it's also no shine you can use it on
any<00:00:33.840> base<00:00:34.079> design<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.920> especially<00:00:35.220> nice

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
any base design but it's especially nice

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.970 
any base design but it's especially nice
for<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.210> lace<00:00:36.420> base<00:00:36.720> because<00:00:37.290> you're<00:00:37.710> not<00:00:37.800> going

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
for a lace base because you're not going

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
to see shine through it all so if you've

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.440 
to see shine through it all so if you've
used<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> super<00:00:41.520> tape<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.420> very

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
used the super tape you know it's a very

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.650 
used the super tape you know it's a very
thin<00:00:42.960> tape<00:00:43.760> but<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.570> an

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
thin tape but you know for an

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.940 
thin tape but you know for an
undetectable<00:00:46.290> appearance

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
undetectable appearance

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.040 
undetectable appearance
the<00:00:47.160> thinner<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> tape<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> better<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.750> some

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the thinner the tape the better so some

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.720 
the thinner the tape the better so some
people<00:00:49.320> might<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.129> better<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
people might like this better for that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720

is<00:01:53.609> or<00:01:54.359> that<00:01:54.419> poly<00:01:54.810> area<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:56.069> left<00:01:56.279> one<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
is or that poly area we left one of

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.099 
is or that poly area we left one of
these<00:01:56.759> wraps<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.389> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.809> what<00:01:57.989> they

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
these wraps so you can see what they

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.349 
these wraps so you can see what they
look<00:01:58.349> like<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:59.309> you<00:01:59.429> receive<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.029> it'll<00:02:00.270> be

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
look like when you receive it it'll be

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.779 
look like when you receive it it'll be
packaged<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.139> this<00:02:01.169> that's<00:02:02.069> not<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.579> tape

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
packaged like this that's not the tape

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.609 
packaged like this that's not the tape
at<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.149> that's<00:02:03.359> that<00:02:03.630> yellow<00:02:03.840> color<00:02:04.200> that's

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
at all that's that yellow color that's

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.850 
at all that's that yellow color that's
just<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> packaging<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> wrapper

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
just the packaging it's the wrapper

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.880 
just the packaging it's the wrapper
when<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:08.610> order<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.000> -<00:02:09.390> you'll<00:02:09.930> get<00:02:10.140> packs

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
when you order it - you'll get packs

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
when you order it - you'll get packs
like<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.670> there's<00:02:12.000> 36<00:02:12.630> pieces<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.290> every

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
like this and there's 36 pieces in every

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.790 
like this and there's 36 pieces in every
pack<00:02:13.940> that's<00:02:14.940> with<00:02:15.450> any<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.840> these<00:02:15.990> now<00:02:16.740> I'm

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
pack that's with any of these now I'm

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.030 
pack that's with any of these now I'm
going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.010> show<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.250> what<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.580> looks<00:02:17.790> like

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
going to show you what it looks like

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.360 
going to show you what it looks like
it'll<00:02:20.040> say<00:02:20.310> super<00:02:20.670> tape<00:02:20.880> low<00:02:21.090> profile<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:22.370> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
it'll say super tape low profile on the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.920 
it'll say super tape low profile on the
one<00:02:23.580> side<00:02:23.880> that's<00:02:24.240> how<00:02:24.420> you'll<00:02:24.630> know<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
one side that's how you'll know the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.450 
one side that's how you'll know the
difference<00:02:25.230> between<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.100> regular

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
difference between that and the regular

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.120 
difference between that and the regular
super<00:02:26.850> tape<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.810> put<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.290> side<00:02:28.620> down<00:02:28.890> to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
super tape that put that side down to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.000 
super tape that put that side down to
the<00:02:29.250> base<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:30.570> then<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.410> far<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.740> other

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the base and then as far as the other

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.700 
the base and then as far as the other
side<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:33.150> split<00:02:33.600> down<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.840> middle<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.380> make<00:02:34.560> it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
side it split down the middle to make it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.010 
side it split down the middle to make it
easy<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.100> work<00:02:35.310> with<00:02:35.420> you're<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.570> gonna<00:02:36.690> peel

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
easy to work with you're just gonna peel

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.350 
easy to work with you're just gonna peel
it<00:02:37.050> off<00:02:37.320> there<00:02:40.520> like<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.670> said<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.060> even

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
it off there like I said it's even

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.450 
it off there like I said it's even
thinner<00:02:42.690> than<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.290> regular<00:02:43.680> super<00:02:44.040> tape<00:02:44.250> so

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
thinner than the regular super tape so

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.370 
thinner than the regular super tape so
it<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.670> take<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.940> little<00:02:45.180> practice<00:02:45.420> on<00:02:45.870> working

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
it can take a little practice on working

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.160 
it can take a little practice on working
with<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.100> get<00:02:47.340> stuck<00:02:47.700> together<00:02:48.170> but

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
with it it can get stuck together but

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.260 
with it it can get stuck together but
you'll<00:02:49.290> get<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.560> with<00:02:49.800> some<00:02:50.100> practice<00:02:50.580> there

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
you'll get it with some practice there

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.470 
you'll get it with some practice there
you<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.750> see<00:02:51.990> how<00:02:52.620> flexible<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.330> it's

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
you can see how flexible it is so it's

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.800 
you can see how flexible it is so it's
going<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.690> adhere<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.500> lace<00:02:55.709> really<00:02:56.220> well

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
going to adhere to the lace really well

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.470 
going to adhere to the lace really well
and<00:02:57.810> again<00:02:58.410> that's<00:02:58.620> new<00:02:58.890> shine<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.640> then<00:03:00.270> with

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
and again that's new shine and then with

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.810 
and again that's new shine and then with
those<00:03:00.720> does<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.440> matter<00:03:01.620> what<00:03:02.310> goes<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.730> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
those does it matter what goes to the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.350 
those does it matter what goes to the
back<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.450> really<00:03:03.720> doesn't<00:03:04.880> most<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.180> time

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
back it really doesn't most of the time

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.240 
back it really doesn't most of the time
it's<00:03:06.630> easier<00:03:07.020> if<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.470> actually<00:03:07.860> apply<00:03:08.220> it

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
it's easier if you actually apply it

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.040 
it's easier if you actually apply it
like<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.870> peel

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
like this and then you can just peel

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.100 
like this and then you can just peel
your<00:03:10.230> liner<00:03:10.470> right<00:03:10.890> off<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.870> same

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
your liner right off of it it's the same

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.199 
your liner right off of it it's the same
thing<00:03:13.470> as<00:03:13.800> with<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.340> contours<00:03:14.850> I'm<00:03:15.060> just

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
thing as with the contours I'm just

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.050 
thing as with the contours I'm just
gonna<00:03:15.360> cut<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:18.709> it's<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.800> same<00:03:20.040> thing<00:03:20.459> like

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
gonna cut that it's the same thing like

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.880 
gonna cut that it's the same thing like
I<00:03:21.180> said<00:03:21.209> you'll<00:03:21.600> want<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.840> apply<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.170> most<00:03:22.800> of

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
I said you'll want to apply it most of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.470 
I said you'll want to apply it most of
the<00:03:22.920> people<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.640> like<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.000> way<00:03:24.330> it's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
the people do it like this that way it's

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.790 
the people do it like this that way it's
just<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.780> little<00:03:24.959> bit<00:03:25.080> easier<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.530> peel<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
just a little bit easier to peel the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.880 
just a little bit easier to peel the
backing<00:03:26.010> off<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.420> super<00:03:28.050> tacky<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.769> it

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
backing off and it is super tacky and it

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.570 
backing off and it is super tacky and it
is<00:03:29.010> super<00:03:29.310> thin<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:31.160> just<00:03:32.160> show<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
is super thin so just show you the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.740 
is super thin so just show you the
texture<00:03:32.970> you<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:34.320> see<00:03:34.700> same<00:03:35.700> thing<00:03:36.000> it's<00:03:36.690> very

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
texture you can see same thing it's very

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.040 
texture you can see same thing it's very
stretchy<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.580> is<00:03:38.730> no<00:03:38.970> shine<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.900> is

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
stretchy and it is no shine so it is

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.020 
stretchy and it is no shine so it is
great<00:03:40.350> for<00:03:40.380> lace<00:03:40.830> pieces<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.730> way<00:03:41.850> you're

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
great for lace pieces that way you're

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.759 
great for lace pieces that way you're
not<00:03:42.060> gonna<00:03:42.300> get<00:03:42.540> any<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:42.930> you're<00:03:43.680> not

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
not gonna get any of that you're not

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.350 
not gonna get any of that you're not
gonna<00:03:43.890> see<00:03:44.130> any<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.580> teeth<00:03:44.790> through<00:03:45.209> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
gonna see any of the teeth through the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.370
