00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
go for this me list build and I guess

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.859 
go for this me list build and I guess
this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> kind<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.670> units<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
this is kind of like a all units kind of

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
this is kind of like a all units kind of
going<00:01:07.350> roaches<00:01:07.740> first<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.400> hydras<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
going roaches first and then hydras and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
going roaches first and then hydras and
using<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.080> defend<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.590> then

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
using them to kind of defend and then

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.010 
using them to kind of defend and then
eventually<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.369> utilize<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.840> going

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
eventually going utilize I'm not going

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
eventually going utilize I'm not going
to<00:01:13.080> say<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.920> bill<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> go

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
to say that this is the bill to go

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.460 
to say that this is the bill to go
probably<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.570> most<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.020> best<00:01:16.229> deal<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
probably not the most the best deal to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.609 
probably not the most the best deal to
go<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.229> think<00:01:19.530> this

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
go but I think like this I think this

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.469 
go but I think like this I think this
game<00:01:19.830> showcase<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:20.759> pretty<00:01:21.060> exciting

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
will unfold and it is going to get a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.149 
will unfold and it is going to get a
little<00:01:27.060> better<00:01:27.470> but<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> eye<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
little better but as the eye can see I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
little better but as the eye can see I
am<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.579> kind<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.790> building<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.180> Mac<00:01:30.479> growing

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
am just kind of building up Mac growing

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.370 
am just kind of building up Mac growing
up<00:01:30.900> getting<00:01:31.470> gas<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> bones<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
expansions and kind of just spreading

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.649 
expansions and kind of just spreading
the<00:01:36.840> drones<00:01:37.110> out

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
the drones out

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.349 
the drones out
or<00:01:39.170> right<00:01:39.439> now<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:42.530> here<00:01:43.369> we<00:01:43.490> go<00:01:43.520> my<00:01:43.880> opponent

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
or right now and here we go my opponent

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.539 
or right now and here we go my opponent
is<00:01:44.530> deciding<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.679> move<00:01:45.710> Adam<00:01:46.159> he's<00:01:46.310> got<00:01:46.520> a

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
is deciding to move Adam he's got a

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.940 
is deciding to move Adam he's got a
pretty<00:01:46.969> large<00:01:47.509> force<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.500> I'm<00:01:48.590> thinking<00:01:48.619> to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
pretty large force so I'm thinking to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.559 
pretty large force so I'm thinking to
myself<00:01:48.979> hey<00:01:49.429> I<00:01:49.460> could<00:01:49.759> go<00:01:49.909> in<00:01:50.030> with<00:01:50.179> my<00:01:50.329> own<00:01:50.450> me

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
myself hey I could go in with my own me

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.359 
myself hey I could go in with my own me
to<00:01:50.630> listen<00:01:50.810> attacked<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.530> economy<00:01:51.979> meanwhile

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
to listen attacked the economy meanwhile

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.419 
to listen attacked the economy meanwhile
but<00:01:53.209> then<00:01:53.600> I<00:01:53.630> realized<00:01:54.079> if<00:01:54.319> I<00:01:54.469> do<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:55.130> I'm

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
but then I realized if I do that I'm

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.770 
but then I realized if I do that I'm
probably<00:01:55.729> not<00:01:55.939> gonna<00:01:56.090> be<00:01:56.209> able<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.420> defend<00:01:56.539> my

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
probably not gonna be able to defend my

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.539 
probably not gonna be able to defend my
base<00:01:56.959> in<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.200> public<00:01:57.500> house<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:57.859> I've<00:01:58.039> got<00:01:58.369> to

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
base in a public house so I've got to

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.609 
base in a public house so I've got to
defend<00:01:58.819> right<00:01:59.060> here<00:01:59.329> and<00:01:59.539> I<00:02:00.079> even<00:02:00.200> got<00:02:00.469> my

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
defend right here and I even got my

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.260 
defend right here and I even got my
clean<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:01.069> in<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.280> mix<00:02:01.429> as<00:02:01.609> well<00:02:01.640> my<00:02:01.909> opponent

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
clean up in the mix as well my opponent

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.490 
clean up in the mix as well my opponent
getting<00:02:02.509> on<00:02:02.630> my<00:02:02.750> creek<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.170> he<00:02:03.259> gets<00:02:03.409> a

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
getting on my creek so he gets a

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.069 
getting on my creek so he gets a
movement<00:02:03.859> bonus<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.729> he's<00:02:05.240> got<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:05.899> many

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
movement bonus and he's got so many

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.870 
movement bonus and he's got so many
roaches<00:02:06.409> I'm<00:02:06.770> not<00:02:06.890> sure<00:02:07.069> how<00:02:07.310> he<00:02:07.369> had<00:02:07.609> so<00:02:07.789> many

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
roaches I'm not sure how he had so many

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.479 
roaches I'm not sure how he had so many
roaches<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.780> suppose<00:02:09.560> he<00:02:09.709> just<00:02:09.920> decided<00:02:10.280> to

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
roaches I suppose he just decided to

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.670 
roaches I suppose he just decided to
stop<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.150> mute<00:02:11.360> attack<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:12.349> pump

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
stop the mute attack and just pump

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.710 
stop the mute attack and just pump
straight-out<00:02:13.129> roaches<00:02:13.579> and<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.269> bad<00:02:14.690> for

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
straight-out roaches and this is bad for

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.500 
straight-out roaches and this is bad for
me<00:02:15.230> all<00:02:16.129> I've<00:02:16.340> got<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.549> needless<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.360> air

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
me all I've got is needless in the air

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.229 
me all I've got is needless in the air
and<00:02:17.690> how<00:02:17.959> he<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.799> essentially<00:02:19.549> annihilated

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
and how he just essentially annihilated

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.819 
and how he just essentially annihilated
all<00:02:20.510> my<00:02:20.629> roaches<00:02:20.810> anhydrous<00:02:21.319> with<00:02:21.680> that

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
all my roaches anhydrous with that

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.759 
all my roaches anhydrous with that
massive<00:02:22.250> roach<00:02:22.640> army<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.140> my<00:02:24.290> opponent

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
massive roach army and so my opponent

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.850 
massive roach army and so my opponent
what<00:02:25.040> he<00:02:25.160> did<00:02:25.459> was<00:02:25.849> a<00:02:26.420> burrow<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.019> he's<00:02:27.500> got<00:02:27.709> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
what he did was a burrow to he's got the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.830 
what he did was a burrow to he's got the
borough<00:02:28.040> tech<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.239> do<00:02:29.360> have<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.599> bring<00:02:29.720> my

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
borough tech so I do have to bring my

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.990 
borough tech so I do have to bring my
overseer<00:02:30.319> in<00:02:30.560> but<00:02:31.069> my<00:02:31.250> opponent<00:02:31.609> essentially

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
overseer in but my opponent essentially

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.930 
overseer in but my opponent essentially
after<00:02:32.359> he<00:02:32.599> realized<00:02:33.109> i<00:02:33.440> had<00:02:33.590> hydras<00:02:34.040> stops

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
after he realized i had hydras stops

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.000 
after he realized i had hydras stops
pumping<00:02:35.239> up<00:02:35.540> meters<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.379> use<00:02:36.530> all<00:02:36.799> this

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
pumping up meters and just use all this

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.339 
pumping up meters and just use all this
economy<00:02:37.549> for<00:02:37.700> roaches<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.299> he<00:02:38.390> is<00:02:38.569> capturing

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
economy for roaches and he is capturing

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.380 
economy for roaches and he is capturing
a<00:02:39.500> natural<00:02:39.980> right<00:02:40.129> now<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.400> well<00:02:40.579> I'm<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.910> big

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
a natural right now as well I'm in big

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.390 
a natural right now as well I'm in big
trouble<00:02:41.540> I'm<00:02:42.260> gonna<00:02:42.530> lose<00:02:42.799> my<00:02:42.859> natural

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
trouble I'm gonna lose my natural

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.069 
trouble I'm gonna lose my natural
meanwhile<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.030> might<00:02:44.329> just<00:02:44.569> use<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.840> game

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
meanwhile so I might just use this game

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.550 
meanwhile so I might just use this game

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.990 
guys I've got some medalist in the air
right<00:02:48.590> now<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.190> that's<00:02:49.370> great<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.910> all<00:02:49.940> but

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
right now and that's great and all but

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.750 
right now and that's great and all but
as<00:02:50.329> I've<00:02:50.540> said<00:02:50.569> before<00:02:51.250> roaches<00:02:52.250> come<00:02:52.609> out

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
as I've said before roaches come out

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.300 
as I've said before roaches come out
with<00:02:52.970> two<00:02:53.269> armor<00:02:53.840> which<00:02:54.410> means<00:02:54.650> there<00:02:54.980> they

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
with two armor which means there they

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.159 
with two armor which means there they
have<00:02:55.430> more<00:02:55.669> armor<00:02:56.090> than<00:02:56.120> an<00:02:56.329> ultra<00:02:56.780> list<00:02:56.989> as

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
have more armor than an ultra list as

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.500 
have more armor than an ultra list as
when<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.620> respond<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.060> butyl<00:02:59.419> has

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
when it to respond and so a butyl has

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.650 
when it to respond and so a butyl has
done<00:02:59.720> absolutely<00:02:59.930> no<00:03:00.620> damage<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.340> roach<00:03:01.660> as

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
done absolutely no damage to a roach as

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.300 
done absolutely no damage to a roach as

medalists over my opponent's face and

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.350 
medalists over my opponent's face and
that<00:05:16.870> is<00:05:17.140> it<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.710> have<00:05:17.830> nothing<00:05:18.160> else<00:05:18.610> my

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
that is it I have nothing else my

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.880 
that is it I have nothing else my
opponent<00:05:19.540> does<00:05:19.870> have<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.050> Hydra<00:05:20.380> he's<00:05:20.530> focused

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
opponent does have a Hydra he's focused

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.440 
opponent does have a Hydra he's focused
firing<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.280> one<00:05:21.430> that's<00:05:21.610> weeks<00:05:21.880> I'm<00:05:22.090> pulling

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
firing the one that's weeks I'm pulling

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.800 
firing the one that's weeks I'm pulling
it<00:05:22.510> out<00:05:23.370> but<00:05:24.370> meanwhile<00:05:24.850> my<00:05:25.060> main<00:05:25.300> base<00:05:25.510> is

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
it out but meanwhile my main base is

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.140 
it out but meanwhile my main base is
under<00:05:26.230> attack<00:05:26.500> I<00:05:26.920> am<00:05:27.040> gonna<00:05:27.220> lose<00:05:27.520> all<00:05:27.790> my

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
under attack I am gonna lose all my

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.870 
under attack I am gonna lose all my
buildings<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:28.840> so<00:05:29.320> this<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.740> bad<00:05:30.130> but<00:05:30.760> I've

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
buildings and so this is bad but I've

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.350 
buildings and so this is bad but I've
realized<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.480> uh<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:33.490> realized<00:05:34.180> that<00:05:34.270> my

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
realized that uh I realized that my

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.790 
realized that uh I realized that my
opponent<00:05:34.630> actually<00:05:35.110> isn't<00:05:35.290> building

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
opponent actually isn't building

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800 
opponent actually isn't building
anything<00:05:36.130> else<00:05:36.400> from<00:05:36.520> his<00:05:36.700> eggs<00:05:36.970> from<00:05:37.660> his

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
anything else from his eggs from his

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.510 
anything else from his eggs from his
larvae<00:05:38.230> and<00:05:38.470> he<00:05:38.890> doesn't<00:05:39.160> have<00:05:39.250> any<00:05:39.370> more

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
larvae and he doesn't have any more

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.550 
larvae and he doesn't have any more
drones<00:05:39.700> mining<00:05:40.030> so<00:05:40.180> perhaps<00:05:40.360> right<00:05:40.810> now<00:05:40.960> is

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
drones mining so perhaps right now is

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.740 
drones mining so perhaps right now is
the<00:05:41.800> time<00:05:42.040> to<00:05:42.100> go<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.610> defend<00:05:43.330> with<00:05:43.600> my

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
the time to go and defend with my

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.290 
the time to go and defend with my
medalist<00:05:44.200> and<00:05:44.380> if<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.310> can<00:05:45.490> kill<00:05:45.850> up<00:05:46.000> all<00:05:46.150> these

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
medalist and if I can kill up all these

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.760 
medalist and if I can kill up all these
roaches<00:05:46.570> there's<00:05:46.930> a<00:05:47.050> chance<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:47.500> I<00:05:47.620> could

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
roaches there's a chance that I could

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.070 
roaches there's a chance that I could
win<00:05:48.010> this<00:05:48.160> game<00:05:48.460> so<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:49.270> am<00:05:49.480> going<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:49.720> pull<00:05:49.930> back

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
win this game so I am going to pull back

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.900 
win this game so I am going to pull back
all<00:05:50.320> of<00:05:50.620> my<00:05:50.740> muta<00:05:50.950> list<00:05:51.130> and<00:05:51.280> defend<00:05:51.700> against

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
all of my muta list and defend against

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.900 
all of my muta list and defend against
these<00:05:52.000> roaches<00:05:53.100> and<00:05:54.100> I<00:05:54.160> do<00:05:54.220> have<00:05:54.400> an<00:05:54.490> overseer

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
these roaches and I do have an overseer

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.580 
these roaches and I do have an overseer
overhead<00:05:55.390> to<00:05:55.510> see<00:05:55.690> if<00:05:55.780> they<00:05:55.900> do<00:05:55.960> borough<00:05:56.350> as

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
overhead to see if they do borough as

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.520 
overhead to see if they do borough as
well<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.360> my<00:05:58.360> opponent<00:05:58.780> has<00:05:58.810> no<00:05:59.080> units<00:05:59.260> that

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
well and my opponent has no units that

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.290 
well and my opponent has no units that
can<00:05:59.620> attack<00:05:59.890> the<00:06:00.040> air<00:06:00.190> I<00:06:00.400> see<00:06:00.610> that<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:00.880> larvae

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
can attack the air I see that the larvae

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.880 
can attack the air I see that the larvae
and<00:06:01.450> attach<00:06:01.720> it<00:06:01.750> was<00:06:02.080> not<00:06:02.260> more<00:06:02.500> fan<00:06:02.740> you

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
and attach it was not more fan you

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.370 
and attach it was not more fan you
anything<00:06:03.340> which<00:06:03.880> means<00:06:04.090> he<00:06:04.210> probably<00:06:04.540> has<00:06:04.990> no

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
anything which means he probably has no

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.640 
anything which means he probably has no
more<00:06:05.620> minerals<00:06:06.540> so<00:06:07.540> could<00:06:07.900> I<00:06:07.990> win<00:06:08.260> this<00:06:08.410> game

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
more minerals so could I win this game

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.110 
more minerals so could I win this game
this<00:06:08.860> is<00:06:09.040> going<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.250> be<00:06:09.340> amazing<00:06:09.610> if<00:06:09.880> I<00:06:09.970> can

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
this is going to be amazing if I can

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.260 
this is going to be amazing if I can
come<00:06:10.240> back<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:11.470> munis<00:06:11.920> tumulus<00:06:12.550> against<00:06:13.120> one

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
come back the munis tumulus against one

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.700 
come back the munis tumulus against one
roach<00:06:13.450> that<00:06:13.690> means<00:06:13.810> I<00:06:13.900> rich<00:06:14.080> is<00:06:14.230> eventually

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
roach that means I rich is eventually

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.970 
roach that means I rich is eventually
going<00:06:15.310> to<00:06:15.460> die<00:06:15.880> others<00:06:16.870> as<00:06:17.110> Irving<00:06:17.560> coming<00:06:17.890> in

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
going to die others as Irving coming in

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.540 
going to die others as Irving coming in
as<00:06:18.100> well<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:19.500> yeah<00:06:20.500> my<00:06:20.680> opponent<00:06:21.040> has<00:06:21.070> nothing

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
as well and yeah my opponent has nothing

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.520 
as well and yeah my opponent has nothing
to<00:06:21.640> defend<00:06:21.790> against<00:06:22.240> as<00:06:22.390> he<00:06:22.540> has<00:06:22.630> no<00:06:23.050> minerals

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
to defend against as he has no minerals

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.840 
to defend against as he has no minerals
or<00:06:23.770> gas<00:06:24.070> to<00:06:24.340> build<00:06:24.610> any<00:06:24.880> units<00:06:25.270> and<00:06:26.100> so<00:06:27.100> there

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
or gas to build any units and so there

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.070 
or gas to build any units and so there
is<00:06:27.970> an<00:06:28.090> egg<00:06:28.270> morphing<00:06:28.660> right<00:06:28.810> now<00:06:28.930> I'm<00:06:29.050> not

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
is an egg morphing right now I'm not

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.470 
is an egg morphing right now I'm not
sure<00:06:29.230> what<00:06:29.590> it's<00:06:29.680> going<00:06:29.770> to<00:06:29.830> come<00:06:30.010> out<00:06:30.130> of<00:06:30.190> that

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
sure what it's going to come out of that

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.120 
sure what it's going to come out of that
but<00:06:31.480> I<00:06:31.510> don't<00:06:32.170> think<00:06:32.350> my<00:06:32.440> opponent<00:06:32.860> is<00:06:32.950> going

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
but I don't think my opponent is going

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.860 
but I don't think my opponent is going
to<00:06:33.220> be<00:06:33.310> able<00:06:33.400> to<00:06:33.580> produce<00:06:34.120> anything<00:06:34.540> it<00:06:34.750> is<00:06:34.840> a

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
to be able to produce anything it is a

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.140 
to be able to produce anything it is a
drone<00:06:35.290> it's<00:06:35.320> a<00:06:35.650> drone<00:06:35.680> so<00:06:36.490> that's<00:06:36.670> all<00:06:36.880> he's

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
drone it's a drone so that's all he's

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 
the reason why I won this game the the

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.159 
the reason why I won this game the the
main<00:07:07.710> reason<00:07:08.159> is<00:07:08.250> because<00:07:08.490> this<00:07:09.419> map<00:07:09.659> is<00:07:09.690> just

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:10.169 
main reason is because this map is just

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.680 
main reason is because this map is just
so<00:07:10.530> strong<00:07:10.830> for<00:07:11.430> hair<00:07:11.639> no<00:07:12.150> doubt<00:07:12.330> you<00:07:12.479> guys

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:27.659 
so strong as the I saw right there going

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:29.149 
so strong as the I saw right there going
for<00:07:27.840> the<00:07:27.870> counter-attack<00:07:28.349> with<00:07:28.710> the<00:07:28.830> meatless

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:29.159 
for the counter-attack with the meatless

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:31.640 
for the counter-attack with the meatless
and<00:07:29.340> my<00:07:29.430> opponent<00:07:29.819> had<00:07:29.940> no<00:07:30.389> nothing<00:07:31.080> just<00:07:31.110> stop

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:31.650 
and my opponent had no nothing just stop

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.469 
and my opponent had no nothing just stop
it<00:07:31.860> he<00:07:32.220> couldn't<00:07:32.520> pull<00:07:32.729> back<00:07:32.879> his<00:07:33.060> forces

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 
it he couldn't pull back his forces

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.330 
it he couldn't pull back his forces
because<00:07:33.810> it's<00:07:34.139> so<00:07:34.440> far<00:07:34.470> away<00:07:34.740> to<00:07:34.949> pull<00:07:35.190> back

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 
because it's so far away to pull back
