very<00:00:58.170> unique<00:00:59.129> take<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.180> their<00:01:00.420> Jim<00:01:00.800> just<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
very unique take on their Jim just a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.560 
very unique take on their Jim just a
little<00:01:02.100> bit<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.760> their<00:01:02.969> slogan<00:01:03.420> is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
little bit about them their slogan is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.240 
little bit about them their slogan is
it's<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.650> everyone

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it's not for everyone

it's not for everyone
and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> things<00:01:07.290> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and I think that one of the things that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.219 
and I think that one of the things that
they're<00:01:07.650> trying<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.630> help<00:01:09.630> people<00:01:10.110> that

what's<00:01:18.330> also<00:01:18.540> unique<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.470> -<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
what's also unique about this - the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.730 
what's also unique about this - the
bottle<00:01:20.310> stands<00:01:20.670> alone<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:22.140> completely

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that's a nice contrast so seeing this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
that's a nice contrast so seeing this
bottle<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.470> shelf<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:29.280> definitely

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
bottle on the shelf would definitely

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.149 
bottle on the shelf would definitely
stand<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.270> as<00:01:30.509> opposed<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> other<00:01:31.799> gins

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
stand out as opposed to the other gins

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039 
stand out as opposed to the other gins
now<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:32.759> they<00:01:32.880> did<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.509> something<00:01:33.810> a

have a lot of different complexities

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.600 
have a lot of different complexities
going<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> nickname<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> o<00:01:56.460> is

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
going on but when the nickname is o is

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280 
going on but when the nickname is o is
just<00:01:56.790> water<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.600> goes<00:01:57.930> down<00:01:58.110> so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
just water because it goes down so

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
so let's go ahead and take a taste and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.740 
so let's go ahead and take a taste and
see<00:02:37.210> where<00:02:37.360> we're<00:02:37.540> at

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.920 

it's<00:02:44.320> real<00:02:44.560> light<00:02:44.860> coming<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:46.480> cucumber

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
it's real light coming in the cucumber

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.700 
it's real light coming in the cucumber
definitely<00:02:47.260> cools<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.740> off<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:50.290> may<00:02:50.440> classify

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
definitely cools it off you may classify

this<00:02:51.100> as<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.430> London<00:02:51.700> Dry<00:02:52.120> although<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:53.550> think

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
this as a London Dry although I think

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.460 
this as a London Dry although I think
that<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.060> kind<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.390> league<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.660> its<00:02:55.810> own<00:02:56.020> so

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
that it's a kind of league of its own so

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.410 
that it's a kind of league of its own so
I<00:02:56.740> think<00:02:57.100> as<00:02:57.280> far<00:02:57.310> as<00:02:57.550> sipping<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.180> pretty

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
I think as far as sipping it's pretty

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.940 
I think as far as sipping it's pretty
good<00:02:58.570> but<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.750> think<00:02:58.840> we<00:02:58.990> really<00:02:59.260> shines<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.860> in

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
good but I think we really shines is in

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.190 
good but I think we really shines is in
a<00:03:00.040> cocktail<00:03:00.690> especially<00:03:01.690> when<00:03:01.840> you're<00:03:01.960> going

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
a cocktail especially when you're going

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.280 
a cocktail especially when you're going
to<00:03:02.320> be<00:03:02.700> amplifying<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.880> cucumber<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.050> think

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
to be amplifying that cucumber so think

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.550 
to be amplifying that cucumber so think
of<00:03:05.380> different<00:03:05.590> types<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:07.470> concoctions<00:03:08.470> that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
of different types of concoctions that

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.190 
of different types of concoctions that
you<00:03:08.740> could<00:03:08.920> make<00:03:09.130> with<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.640> cucumber<00:03:10.200> infuse

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
you could make with the cucumber infuse

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.250 
you could make with the cucumber infuse
gin<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.860> get<00:03:12.490> very<00:03:13.420> creative<00:03:13.780> it's

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
gin and get very creative it's

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.650 
gin and get very creative it's
definitely<00:03:14.680> not<00:03:14.800> something<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.670> just<00:03:16.480> wants

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
definitely not something that just wants

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.880 
definitely not something that just wants
to<00:03:16.750> sit<00:03:16.930> alone<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.290> think<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.500> wants<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.740> come

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
to sit alone I think it wants to come

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.310 
to sit alone I think it wants to come
out<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.100> play<00:03:18.190> like<00:03:18.280> on<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.640> beach<00:03:18.820> so<00:03:19.540> all<00:03:20.050> in

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
out and play like on the beach so all in

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.810 
out and play like on the beach so all in
all<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.710> think<00:03:20.740> from<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.340> bartender's

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
all I think from a bartender's

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.670 
all I think from a bartender's
perspective<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.840> definitely<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.410> gin

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
perspective this is definitely a gin

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.020
