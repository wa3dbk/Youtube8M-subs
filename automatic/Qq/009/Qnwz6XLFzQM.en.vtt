00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
switches out his ghost up I was thinking

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.540 
switches out his ghost up I was thinking
he's<00:00:32.610> not<00:00:32.850> gonna<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.270> because<00:00:33.540> crafty<00:00:34.200> in

me<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.760> possibility<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> mega<00:00:36.660> evolution<00:00:36.750> on

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
me the possibility of mega evolution on

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.590 
me the possibility of mega evolution on
this<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.309> know<00:00:38.399> earthquake<00:00:39.030> does<00:00:39.300> connect

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this you know earthquake does connect

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.319 
this you know earthquake does connect
hit<00:00:39.780> twice<00:00:39.989> well<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.890> wasn't<00:00:41.550> really<00:00:41.730> expect

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
hit twice well I wasn't really expect

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.940 
hit twice well I wasn't really expect
him<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> directly<00:00:43.079> switch<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.469> think<00:00:43.649> his<00:00:43.739> ghost

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
him to directly switch I think his ghost

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.200 
him to directly switch I think his ghost
I<00:00:44.129> mean<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> little<00:00:45.120> bit

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
I mean that it is a little bit

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
I mean that it is a little bit
predictable<00:00:45.600> could<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.200> earthquake<00:00:46.649> there

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
predictable could just earthquake there

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.279 
predictable could just earthquake there
but<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> switch<00:00:48.090> which<00:00:48.870> would<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.200> been

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
but on the switch which would have been

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
but on the switch which would have been
up<00:00:49.410> probably<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> better<00:00:50.340> choice<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.940> general

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
up probably a better choice in general

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.689 
up probably a better choice in general
but<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.410> decided<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> playing<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.219> safe

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
but I just decided to playing it safe

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
but I just decided to playing it safe
anyways<00:00:54.329> afterwards<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.379> going<00:00:55.559> for

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
anyways afterwards I'm just going for

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
anyways afterwards I'm just going for
some<00:00:55.860> damage<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.480> eg<00:00:57.480> slash<00:00:57.719> because

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
some damage on this eg slash because

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.569 
some damage on this eg slash because
it's<00:00:58.320> pretty<00:00:58.440> much<00:00:58.559> my<00:00:58.800> main<00:00:58.829> intent<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
it's pretty much my main intent of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
it's pretty much my main intent of
taking<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:00.149> before<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> guy<00:01:01.050> gets<00:01:01.410> to--

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280

very<00:01:40.350> powerful<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.159> ways<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:42.060> switching<00:01:42.420> out

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
very powerful and ways I'm switching out

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.819 
very powerful and ways I'm switching out
to<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:42.689> girl<00:01:42.869> ranch<00:01:43.079> after<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.590> range

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
to my girl ranch after this range

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
to my girl ranch after this range
survives<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> acrobatics<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.299> decided<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
survives the acrobatics I decided to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
survives the acrobatics I decided to
stay<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.500> don't<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.040> much<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
stay and I don't really have much to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
stay and I don't really have much to
lose<00:01:47.970> from<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.930> he<00:01:49.110> creates<00:01:49.560> me<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:50.040> this

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
lose from it but he creates me with this

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.200 
lose from it but he creates me with this
hydro<00:01:50.520> pump<00:01:50.700> crit<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:54.030> don't

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
hydro pump crit and this one is I don't

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.330 
hydro pump crit and this one is I don't
really<00:01:54.420> talk<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.689> crits<00:01:55.229> too<00:01:55.380> often<00:01:55.799> but

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
really talk about crits too often but

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
really talk about crits too often but
this<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.969> believe<00:01:57.030> deserved<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.409> bit

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
this one I believe deserved a little bit

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.399 
this one I believe deserved a little bit
of<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.909> circle<00:01:59.909> back<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.479> Reverse<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.229> talk

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
of a circle back in Reverse and talk

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
of a circle back in Reverse and talk
about<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.920> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.159> later<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.640> because

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
about it a little bit later on because

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.810 
about it a little bit later on because
it's<00:02:03.899> gonna<00:02:04.049> play<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.290> bit<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.920> bit<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.610> role

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it's gonna play a bit of a bit of a role

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.119 
it's gonna play a bit of a bit of a role
here<00:02:06.060> anyways<00:02:06.540> he<00:02:07.469> switches<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:07.950> these

fairy-type go for the dragon pose which
was<00:02:10.890> dumb

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
was dumb

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.550 
was dumb
until<00:02:12.330> respect<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:13.080> because

checking out the steam slot one was

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.290 
checking out the steam slot one was
better<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.980> general<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.459> because<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> way

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
not because this mega aggron actually

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.370 
not because this mega aggron actually
runs<00:03:04.819> speed<00:03:05.819> EVs<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.750> plus<00:03:07.110> speed

this thing is a run under sticky web

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.270 
this thing is a run under sticky web
the<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.870> same<00:03:16.080> move<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.380> was<00:03:16.500> trying<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.830> go<00:03:16.980> for

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
the the same move I was trying to go for

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.210 
the the same move I was trying to go for
but<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.030> Hydra<00:03:18.329> bank<00:03:18.510> rate<00:03:18.750> happened<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:20.040> this

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
but the Hydra bank rate happened in this

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.259 
but the Hydra bank rate happened in this
case<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.579> doesn't<00:03:20.730> really<00:03:20.940> matter<00:03:21.120> because

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
case it doesn't really matter because

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.330 
case it doesn't really matter because
normally<00:03:21.780> I'd<00:03:21.959> world<00:03:22.200> speed<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.620> Pokemon

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
normally I'd world speed this Pokemon

normally I'd world speed this Pokemon
either<00:03:23.579> way<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.630> very<00:03:24.989> slow<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:26.130> axe

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
either way it is very slow this axe

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.400 
either way it is very slow this axe
pokémon<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.329> I'm<00:03:27.780> pretty<00:03:28.049> sure<00:03:28.109> is<00:03:28.200> not

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
pokémon that I'm pretty sure is not

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.460 
pokémon that I'm pretty sure is not
called<00:03:28.769> axe<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:30.540> famous<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.140> know<00:03:31.230> iron

head take him out first time facing this
so<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.579> pretty<00:03:35.760> cool<00:03:35.880> but<00:03:36.920> stealth

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
so that was pretty cool but stealth

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.770 
so that was pretty cool but stealth
rocks<00:03:38.160> was<00:03:38.400> mostly<00:03:38.910> for<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> no<00:03:39.390> weren't

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
rocks was mostly for the no weren't

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.390 
rocks was mostly for the no weren't
there<00:03:39.959> because<00:03:40.290> no<00:03:40.440> room<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.980> can<00:03:41.190> make

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
there because no room it can make

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.780 
there because no room it can make
possible<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:43.200> shot<00:03:43.440> now<00:03:44.069> our<00:03:44.310> one<00:03:44.549> shot

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
possible to shot now our one shot

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.789 
possible to shot now our one shot
possibility<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:45.840> was<00:03:45.989> pretty<00:03:46.470> much<00:03:46.620> my

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
possibility so that was pretty much my

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.860 
possibility so that was pretty much my
main<00:03:46.829> intent<00:03:47.370> there<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:48.060> he<00:03:48.450> switches<00:03:48.690> out

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
main intent there but he switches out

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
the Gengar to pretty much go for the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.949 
the Gengar to pretty much go for the
kill<00:03:50.549> go<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.060> revenge<00:03:51.450> kill<00:03:51.720> would

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
kill go for that revenge kill would

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.410 
kill go for that revenge kill would
share<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> ball<00:03:52.819> directly<00:03:53.819> into<00:03:54.030> my<00:03:54.150> stomach

make a big hole in their background

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.150 
make a big hole in their background
simply<00:03:57.329> cannot<00:03:57.690> take<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.079> so

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
simply cannot take that so

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.069 
simply cannot take that so
Agron<00:03:59.579> is<00:03:59.670> gonna<00:03:59.819> be<00:03:59.940> taken<00:04:00.180> down<00:04:00.299> afterwards

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
I could switch goodra directly into make

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.780 
I could switch goodra directly into make
again<00:04:05.880> but<00:04:06.060> then<00:04:06.180> again<00:04:06.269> that's<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.900> big<00:04:07.230> threat

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
again but then again that's a big threat

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.009 
again but then again that's a big threat
especially<00:04:08.790> if<00:04:08.850> he's<00:04:08.970> got<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.209> ferry<00:04:09.540> tab<00:04:09.810> to

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
especially if he's got a ferry tab to

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.800 
especially if he's got a ferry tab to
kind<00:04:10.200> of<00:04:10.260> cover<00:04:10.769> its<00:04:11.069> move<00:04:11.730> set<00:04:12.030> even<00:04:12.450> further

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
kind of cover its move set even further

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.770 
kind of cover its move set even further
but<00:04:13.739> I<00:04:14.040> do<00:04:14.220> go<00:04:14.670> for<00:04:14.850> directly<00:04:15.180> for<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.480> dragon

that Givenchy life by any miracle that

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.760 
that Givenchy life by any miracle that
quit<00:05:05.880> who'd<00:05:06.060> have<00:05:06.210> not<00:05:06.390> happened<00:05:06.690> able<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.620> put

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
quit who'd have not happened able to put

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.700 
quit who'd have not happened able to put
up<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:08.040> stick<00:05:08.280> web<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.820> afterwards<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:10.050> would

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
up the stick web and afterwards I would

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.680 
up the stick web and afterwards I would
have<00:05:10.860> had<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.010> little<00:05:11.790> bit<00:05:11.880> of<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.060> better<00:05:12.240> chance

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
have had a little bit of a better chance

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.690 
have had a little bit of a better chance
because<00:05:12.990> good<00:05:13.440> Rock<00:05:13.680> could<00:05:13.830> handle<00:05:14.310> mega

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
because good Rock could handle mega

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.220 
because good Rock could handle mega
vinca<00:05:14.970> or<00:05:15.090> on<00:05:15.210> stone<00:05:15.480> so<00:05:15.690> that<00:05:15.900> would<00:05:16.110> have

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
vinca or on stone so that would have

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.930 
vinca or on stone so that would have
kind<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.500> forced<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:16.860> switch<00:05:17.130> he<00:05:17.730> would<00:05:17.850> have

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
kind of forced a switch he would have

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.940 
kind of forced a switch he would have
probably<00:05:18.120> his<00:05:18.450> sack<00:05:18.720> his<00:05:18.990> Haxorus<00:05:19.410> instead<00:05:19.830> of

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
probably his sack his Haxorus instead of

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.980 
probably his sack his Haxorus instead of
no<00:05:20.100> even<00:05:20.340> just<00:05:20.580> because<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:21.030> immunity<00:05:21.780> to

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
no even just because the immunity to

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.380 
no even just because the immunity to
stick<00:05:22.680> web<00:05:22.980> so<00:05:23.550> that's<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.910> little<00:05:24.060> bit<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.300> a

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
stick web so that's a little bit of a

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.970 
stick web so that's a little bit of a
change<00:05:24.600> that<00:05:24.720> with<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.080> probably<00:05:25.530> happens

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
change that with the probably happens

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.890 
change that with the probably happens
but<00:05:26.640> then<00:05:26.790> again<00:05:26.880> who<00:05:27.420> knows<00:05:27.480> whatever

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
but then again who knows whatever

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.140 
but then again who knows whatever
happened<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:29.010> know<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.520> game<00:05:29.910> would<00:05:30.060> have

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
happened you know the game would have

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.140 
happened you know the game would have
probably<00:05:30.450> been<00:05:30.660> a<00:05:30.720> little<00:05:31.500> bit<00:05:31.650> more<00:05:31.980> more<00:05:32.940> in

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
probably been a little bit more more in

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.410 
probably been a little bit more more in
there<00:05:33.390> but<00:05:34.160> happened<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.460> know<00:05:35.580> crits<00:05:35.880> happen

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
there but happened you know crits happen

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.690 
there but happened you know crits happen
it's<00:05:36.780> all<00:05:37.020> part<00:05:37.290> of<00:05:37.350> the<00:05:37.470> game<00:05:37.620> we<00:05:37.920> learn<00:05:38.160> our

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
it's all part of the game we learn our

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.330 
it's all part of the game we learn our
past<00:05:39.300> mistakes<00:05:39.480> my<00:05:40.380> my<00:05:40.770> mistake<00:05:41.130> was<00:05:41.160> not

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
past mistakes my my mistake was not

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.250 
past mistakes my my mistake was not
running<00:05:41.670> focusing<00:05:42.360> on<00:05:42.630> my<00:05:42.750> good<00:05:42.900> bench<00:05:43.110> I

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
running focusing on my good bench I

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.650 
running focusing on my good bench I
still<00:05:43.500> didn't<00:05:43.710> have<00:05:43.800> focus<00:05:44.160> on<00:05:44.280> it<00:05:44.670> but<00:05:45.270> that

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
still didn't have focus on it but that

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.920 
still didn't have focus on it but that
was<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.020> game<00:05:46.170> so<00:05:46.440> Rollins<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.970> good<00:05:48.300> game<00:05:48.510> man

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
this was out pretty early match we both

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.400 
this was out pretty early match we both
had<00:05:55.530> so<00:05:55.830> pretty<00:05:56.430> new<00:05:56.700> to<00:05:56.910> it<00:05:57.090> my<00:05:57.810> first<00:05:58.080> team<00:05:58.290> I

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
had so pretty new to it my first team I

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.500 
had so pretty new to it my first team I
was<00:05:58.530> really<00:05:58.800> using<00:05:59.160> and<00:05:59.550> most<00:06:00.150> of<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.300> things

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
was really using and most of the things

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.480 
was really using and most of the things
still<00:06:00.780> didn't<00:06:01.050> have<00:06:01.170> the<00:06:01.410> mega<00:06:02.010> stone<00:06:02.310> for

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
still didn't have the mega stone for

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.280 
still didn't have the mega stone for
example<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:03.060> believe<00:06:03.420> kingís<00:06:03.900> game<00:06:04.050> still

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
example I believe kingís game still

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.440 
example I believe kingís game still
didn't<00:06:04.800> have<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:04.920> mega<00:06:05.160> stone<00:06:05.340> back<00:06:05.580> then<00:06:05.850> now

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
didn't have the mega stone back then now

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.770 
didn't have the mega stone back then now
it<00:06:06.570> does<00:06:06.720> have<00:06:06.930> it<00:06:07.080> but<00:06:07.260> yeah<00:06:08.240> that<00:06:09.240> was<00:06:09.480> pretty

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
it does have it but yeah that was pretty

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.490 
it does have it but yeah that was pretty
much<00:06:10.020> that<00:06:10.920> and<00:06:11.330> I<00:06:12.330> was<00:06:12.660> kind<00:06:12.870> of<00:06:12.900> eager<00:06:13.260> to<00:06:13.470> use

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
much that and I was kind of eager to use

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.400 
much that and I was kind of eager to use
mega<00:06:14.070> aggron<00:06:14.730> I<00:06:14.970> believe<00:06:15.540> this<00:06:15.690> was<00:06:15.930> my<00:06:16.080> first

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
mega aggron I believe this was my first

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.160 
mega aggron I believe this was my first
time<00:06:16.680> using<00:06:16.740> it<00:06:17.570> the<00:06:18.570> funny<00:06:18.780> thing<00:06:18.990> is<00:06:19.020> that

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
time using it the funny thing is that

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.680 
time using it the funny thing is that
mega<00:06:19.800> mega<00:06:20.460> Giga<00:06:20.850> would<00:06:21.000> probably<00:06:21.390> be<00:06:21.510> the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
mega mega Giga would probably be the

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.660 
mega mega Giga would probably be the
better<00:06:21.870> option<00:06:22.170> in<00:06:22.590> this<00:06:22.740> case<00:06:23.040> he's<00:06:23.430> checking

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
better option in this case he's checking

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.640 
better option in this case he's checking
out<00:06:23.820> his<00:06:24.000> team<00:06:24.300> I<00:06:24.660> should<00:06:24.990> think<00:06:25.260> about<00:06:25.350> that

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
out his team I should think about that

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.280 
out his team I should think about that
one<00:06:25.860> one<00:06:26.040> is<00:06:26.190> actually<00:06:26.400> -<00:06:27.330> Lee<00:06:27.510> turning<00:06:28.020> into

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
one one is actually - Lee turning into

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.260 
one one is actually - Lee turning into
mega<00:06:28.560> aggron<00:06:28.980> like<00:06:29.190> that<00:06:29.400> but<00:06:29.760> that<00:06:29.790> was<00:06:30.030> the

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
mega aggron like that but that was the

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.830 
mega aggron like that but that was the
game<00:06:30.360> for<00:06:30.570> today

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840
