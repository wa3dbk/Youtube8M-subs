real blocks they're not just paper
they're<00:01:07.189> durable<00:01:09.459> essentially<00:01:10.459> what<00:01:10.579> I<00:01:10.609> did

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.300 
they're durable essentially what I did
is<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.119> took<00:01:11.780> these<00:01:11.959> little<00:01:12.289> one-inch<00:01:12.920> square

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
is I took these little one-inch square

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.190 
is I took these little one-inch square
cubes<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.999> I<00:01:14.060> got<00:01:14.240> at<00:01:14.359> Hobby<00:01:14.539> Lobby<00:01:14.659> really

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
cubes that I got at Hobby Lobby really

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.870 
cubes that I got at Hobby Lobby really
expensive<00:01:15.560> can<00:01:16.100> I<00:01:16.159> have<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.429> find<00:01:16.609> a<00:01:16.670> cheaper

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
expensive can I have to find a cheaper

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.160 
expensive can I have to find a cheaper
place<00:01:16.999> to<00:01:17.149> get<00:01:17.270> them<00:01:17.359> but<00:01:17.539> I<00:01:18.380> took<00:01:18.770> these<00:01:19.069> then

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
place to get them but I took these then

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.389 
place to get them but I took these then
after<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.619> very<00:01:22.100> long<00:01:22.249> time<00:01:23.439> in<00:01:24.439> my<00:01:24.829> editing

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
after a very long time in my editing

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.389 
after a very long time in my editing
program<00:01:25.819> I<00:01:26.200> as<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.859> can<00:01:27.950> see<00:01:28.069> I<00:01:28.100> pretty<00:01:28.340> much

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
program I as you can see I pretty much

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.730 
program I as you can see I pretty much
just<00:01:28.520> took<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:28.939> tops<00:01:29.179> and<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.509> bottoms<00:01:29.740> put

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
just took the tops and the bottoms put

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.029 
just took the tops and the bottoms put
little<00:01:31.659> what<00:01:32.659> are<00:01:32.719> they<00:01:32.840> called<00:01:33.049> wings<00:01:33.590> on<00:01:33.920> the

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
little what are they called wings on the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.769 
little what are they called wings on the
edges<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:34.520> they<00:01:34.729> can<00:01:34.849> wrap<00:01:34.999> around<00:01:35.029> easier<00:01:35.569> and

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:35.779 
edges so they can wrap around easier and

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:39.010 
edges so they can wrap around easier and
then<00:01:36.469> I<00:01:36.889> just<00:01:37.219> put<00:01:37.429> these<00:01:37.579> on<00:01:37.639> the<00:01:37.819> sides<00:01:38.029> this

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
then I just put these on the sides this

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.300 
then I just put these on the sides this
one<00:01:39.229> I'm<00:01:39.349> trying<00:01:39.499> something<00:01:39.679> different<00:01:40.159> with

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
one I'm trying something different with

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.399 
one I'm trying something different with
because<00:01:40.700> as<00:01:41.240> I<00:01:41.630> go<00:01:41.810> I'm<00:01:41.959> trying<00:01:42.109> to<00:01:42.319> learn

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
because as I go I'm trying to learn

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.839 
because as I go I'm trying to learn
different<00:01:42.920> techniques<00:01:43.039> than<00:01:43.520> make<00:01:43.639> them<00:01:43.700> work

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
different techniques than make them work

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.940 
different techniques than make them work
better<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.810> uh<00:01:44.869> basically<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:45.770> put<00:01:45.919> on

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
better but uh basically I just put on

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.499 
better but uh basically I just put on
the<00:01:46.130> top<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.490> bottom<00:01:46.639> and<00:01:46.969> then<00:01:47.179> I<00:01:47.209> wrap

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
the top on the bottom and then I wrap

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.809 
the top on the bottom and then I wrap
this<00:01:47.689> around<00:01:47.749> the<00:01:48.109> middle<00:01:48.459> some<00:01:49.459> of<00:01:49.579> them<00:01:49.700> are

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
this around the middle some of them are

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.309 
this around the middle some of them are
harder<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:50.329> these<00:01:50.509> they're<00:01:50.840> easier<00:01:51.229> because

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
harder like these they're easier because

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.779 
harder like these they're easier because
you<00:01:51.469> can<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:51.740> wrap<00:01:51.889> around<00:01:51.919> without<00:01:52.399> having

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
you can just wrap around without having

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.639 
you can just wrap around without having
to<00:01:52.880> line<00:01:53.179> them<00:01:53.359> up<00:01:53.479> however<00:01:54.169> ones<00:01:54.380> like<00:01:54.529> the

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
to line them up however ones like the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.199 
to line them up however ones like the
chests<00:01:55.130> oh<00:01:55.340> my<00:01:56.209> cat<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.599> up<00:01:56.749> here<00:01:56.959> hi<00:01:57.289> Sara<00:01:58.209> she

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
chests oh my cat is up here hi Sara she

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.499 
chests oh my cat is up here hi Sara she
wants<00:01:59.389> attention<00:02:00.310> um<00:02:01.310> let<00:02:01.909> me<00:02:01.939> try<00:02:02.119> doing<00:02:02.299> this

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
wants attention um let me try doing this

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.389 
wants attention um let me try doing this
video<00:02:02.749> with<00:02:03.139> her<00:02:03.649> over<00:02:04.520> there<00:02:04.729> um<00:02:06.399> basically

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
video with her over there um basically

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.630 
video with her over there um basically
what<00:02:07.759> I<00:02:07.819> do<00:02:07.939> is<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:09.080> glue<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.649> top<00:02:09.830> on<00:02:10.009> first<00:02:10.399> in

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
what I do is I glue the top on first in

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.670 
what I do is I glue the top on first in
the<00:02:10.729> bottom<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.150> then<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.360> wrap

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
the bottom and then I wrap

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.360 
the bottom and then I wrap
around<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:12.939> almost<00:02:13.719> seamless<00:02:14.319> um<00:02:14.590> like

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
around and it's almost seamless um like

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.530 
around and it's almost seamless um like
the<00:02:15.489> ones<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.879> actually<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.359> line<00:02:16.510> up

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the ones that actually have to line up

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.500 
the ones that actually have to line up
like<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:19.150> chest<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:20.170> jukebox<00:02:20.769> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
like like the chest the jukebox the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.550 
like like the chest the jukebox the
crafting<00:02:22.510> table<00:02:22.629> they<00:02:22.900> had<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.140> kind<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.379> line

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
crafting table they had to kind of line

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.520 
crafting table they had to kind of line
up<00:02:23.739> or<00:02:23.920> else<00:02:24.010> they<00:02:24.189> wouldn't<00:02:24.370> fit<00:02:25.530> those

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
up or else they wouldn't fit those

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.369 
up or else they wouldn't fit those
didn't<00:02:26.829> come<00:02:26.950> out<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.219> good<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:28.329> I<00:02:28.840> still

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
didn't come out as good but I still

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.830 
didn't come out as good but I still
think<00:02:29.769> they<00:02:29.889> came<00:02:30.040> out<00:02:30.159> pretty<00:02:30.280> cool<00:02:30.519> um<00:02:31.269> like

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
think they came out pretty cool um like

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.449 
think they came out pretty cool um like
here's<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.139> diamond<00:02:32.409> block<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.889> I<00:02:32.950> made<00:02:33.250> of

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
here's the diamond block that I made of

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.479 
here's the diamond block that I made of
course<00:02:33.790> I'll<00:02:33.939> using<00:02:34.209> my<00:02:34.329> texture<00:02:35.189> it's<00:02:36.189> pretty

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
course I'll using my texture it's pretty

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.729 
course I'll using my texture it's pretty
seamless<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:37.150> mean<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:38.230> have<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.439> look<00:02:38.560> really

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
seamless I mean you have to look really

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.069 
seamless I mean you have to look really
hard<00:02:38.859> to<00:02:39.189> find<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.659> where<00:02:40.659> I<00:02:40.689> glued

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
hard to find the where I glued

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.440 
hard to find the where I glued
everything<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.310> think<00:02:42.939> they<00:02:43.180> came<00:02:43.329> out

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
everything but I think they came out

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.220 
everything but I think they came out
pretty<00:02:43.629> cool<00:02:43.870> what<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.680> plan<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.040> doing<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:46.230> have

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
pretty cool what I plan on doing I have

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.259 
pretty cool what I plan on doing I have
like<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.099> said<00:02:48.129> I'm<00:02:48.400> trying<00:02:48.669> to<00:02:48.909> print<00:02:49.060> out

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
like I said I'm trying to print out

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.050 
like I said I'm trying to print out
almost<00:02:49.829> one<00:02:50.829> of<00:02:50.950> every<00:02:51.220> block<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.669> course<00:02:51.849> some

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
almost one of every block of course some

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.659 
almost one of every block of course some
blocks<00:02:52.329> are<00:02:52.450> going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.720> be<00:02:52.810> harder<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.169> do

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
blocks are going to be harder to do

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.129 
blocks are going to be harder to do
especially<00:02:54.669> the<00:02:55.030> transparent<00:02:55.659> ones<00:02:55.870> but<00:02:56.109> I

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
especially the transparent ones but I

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.949 
especially the transparent ones but I
have<00:02:56.319> ideas<00:02:56.680> for<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:57.639> also<00:02:58.299> I'm<00:02:58.629> going<00:02:58.840> to

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
have ideas for that I also I'm going to

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.039 
have ideas for that I also I'm going to
start<00:02:59.230> mass<00:02:59.500> printing<00:03:00.189> and<00:03:00.700> doing<00:03:01.120> ones<00:03:01.870> like

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
start mass printing and doing ones like

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.159 
start mass printing and doing ones like
logs<00:03:02.319> playing<00:03:03.099> scraps<00:03:03.790> blocks<00:03:04.150> pretty<00:03:05.019> much

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
logs playing scraps blocks pretty much

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.869 
logs playing scraps blocks pretty much
all<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.469> basic<00:03:05.980> building<00:03:06.189> materials<00:03:06.730> that

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
all the basic building materials that

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.089 
all the basic building materials that
you<00:03:07.030> use<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.359> most<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.840> I'm<00:03:08.530> actually<00:03:08.739> going

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
you use the most and I'm actually going

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.220 
you use the most and I'm actually going
to<00:03:09.219> do<00:03:09.400> like<00:03:09.579> little<00:03:09.730> setup<00:03:10.120> here<00:03:10.359> and<00:03:10.450> build

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
to do like little setup here and build

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.860 
to do like little setup here and build
stuff<00:03:11.859> in<00:03:12.129> real<00:03:12.189> life<00:03:12.790> with<00:03:13.000> Minecraft<00:03:13.419> blocks

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
stuff in real life with Minecraft blocks

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.399 
stuff in real life with Minecraft blocks
um<00:03:14.669> but<00:03:15.669> yeah<00:03:15.930> that's<00:03:16.930> what<00:03:17.079> I've<00:03:17.199> been<00:03:17.229> doing

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
um but yeah that's what I've been doing

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.240 
um but yeah that's what I've been doing
for<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.889> past<00:03:18.040> two<00:03:18.280> days<00:03:18.430> uh<00:03:19.650> which<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.829> also

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
for the past two days uh which is also

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.979 
for the past two days uh which is also
probably<00:03:21.729> why<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.180> haven't<00:03:22.479> put<00:03:22.659> up<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.840> let's

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
probably why I haven't put up a let's

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.369 
probably why I haven't put up a let's
play<00:03:23.199> video<00:03:23.349> I've<00:03:23.590> been<00:03:23.799> kind<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.099> obsessed

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
play video I've been kind of obsessed

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.189 
play video I've been kind of obsessed
what<00:03:26.379> oh<00:03:26.699> crap<00:03:27.699> I<00:03:28.090> think<00:03:28.629> I<00:03:28.689> messed<00:03:28.900> up<00:03:29.019> this

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
what oh crap I think I messed up this

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.050 
what oh crap I think I messed up this
camera<00:03:29.709> again<00:03:29.949> there<00:03:30.129> we<00:03:30.340> go<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.790> should<00:03:30.819> be

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
camera again there we go that should be

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.360 
camera again there we go that should be
centered<00:03:31.419> really<00:03:31.959> centered<00:03:32.319> enough<00:03:32.560> anyway

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
centered really centered enough anyway

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.099 
centered really centered enough anyway
that's<00:03:33.879> what<00:03:34.030> I've<00:03:34.120> been<00:03:34.150> doing<00:03:34.299> like<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:34.930> said

I want to know what you guys think of
the<00:03:37.299> project<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.930> also<00:03:38.709> have<00:03:39.069> tons<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.790> great

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
the project I also have tons of great

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.589 
the project I also have tons of great
ideas<00:03:40.139> besides<00:03:41.139> just<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.709> blocks<00:03:41.949> because

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
ideas besides just the blocks because

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.849 
ideas besides just the blocks because
actually<00:03:43.599> got<00:03:43.720> inspiration<00:03:44.049> from<00:03:44.290> minecon

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
actually got inspiration from minecon

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.830 
actually got inspiration from minecon
because<00:03:45.159> someone<00:03:45.400> did<00:03:45.549> something<00:03:46.389> similar

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
because someone did something similar

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.979 
because someone did something similar
but<00:03:47.199> the<00:03:47.319> blocks<00:03:47.530> are<00:03:47.680> much<00:03:47.829> bigger<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:48.989> I

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
but the blocks are much bigger and I

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.679 
but the blocks are much bigger and I
just<00:03:50.349> felt<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.799> could<00:03:51.159> have<00:03:51.669> made<00:03:52.329> slight

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:52.689 
just felt I could have made slight

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.179 
just felt I could have made slight
improvements<00:03:53.290> so<00:03:53.379> I<00:03:53.409> tried<00:03:53.709> doing<00:03:53.829> my<00:03:54.069> own

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
improvements so I tried doing my own

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.550 
improvements so I tried doing my own
design<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:54.970> I'm<00:03:55.659> not<00:03:55.780> stopping<00:03:56.049> at<00:03:56.319> just<00:03:56.500> the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
design and I'm not stopping at just the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.080 
design and I'm not stopping at just the
blocks<00:03:56.799> either<00:03:57.099> I<00:03:57.220> have<00:03:57.669> a<00:03:57.759> bunch<00:03:57.970> of

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
blocks either I have a bunch of

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.080 
blocks either I have a bunch of
different<00:03:58.509> ideas<00:03:58.659> that<00:03:58.900> I'm<00:03:59.169> going<00:03:59.199> to<00:03:59.530> try

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
different ideas that I'm going to try

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.159 
different ideas that I'm going to try
again<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.290> my<00:04:02.290> biggest<00:04:02.979> problem<00:04:03.370> when<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.989> has

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
again I my biggest problem when it has

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.960 
again I my biggest problem when it has
anything<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.680> do<00:04:05.829> with<00:04:05.859> art<00:04:06.189> or<00:04:06.280> creativity<00:04:06.849> is

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
anything to do with art or creativity is

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.999 
anything to do with art or creativity is
making<00:04:07.299> something<00:04:07.509> look<00:04:07.750> as<00:04:07.930> good<00:04:08.169> as<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:08.979> is

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
making something look as good as it is

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.699 
making something look as good as it is
in<00:04:09.250> my<00:04:09.370> head<00:04:09.549> so<00:04:09.939> I<00:04:10.299> have<00:04:10.900> no<00:04:11.109> idea<00:04:11.409> how<00:04:11.560> they're

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
in my head so I have no idea how they're

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.619 
in my head so I have no idea how they're
gonna<00:04:11.859> actually<00:04:12.129> come<00:04:12.430> out<00:04:12.459> my<00:04:12.849> other<00:04:13.090> ideas<00:04:13.509> I

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
gonna actually come out my other ideas I

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.360 
gonna actually come out my other ideas I
mean<00:04:13.810> so<00:04:14.079> far<00:04:14.139> the<00:04:14.409> blocks<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.889> think<00:04:15.129> came<00:04:15.280> out

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
mean so far the blocks I think came out

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.640 
mean so far the blocks I think came out
pretty<00:04:15.579> cool<00:04:15.759> I<00:04:15.970> was<00:04:16.570> also<00:04:17.019> thinking<00:04:17.049> of

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
pretty cool I was also thinking of

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.029 
pretty cool I was also thinking of
possibly<00:04:18.659> giving<00:04:19.659> those<00:04:19.750> out<00:04:19.959> in<00:04:20.229> contests<00:04:20.919> as

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
possibly giving those out in contests as

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.800 
possibly giving those out in contests as
well<00:04:21.250> because<00:04:21.820> I<00:04:21.909> mean<00:04:22.090> they're<00:04:22.690> not

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
well because I mean they're not

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.370 
well because I mean they're not
expensive<00:04:23.529> or

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
expensive or

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.300 
expensive or
or<00:04:24.500> hard<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.340> make<00:04:25.630> time-consuming<00:04:26.630> yes<00:04:26.990> but<00:04:27.380> I

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
or hard to make time-consuming yes but I

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.440 
or hard to make time-consuming yes but I
think<00:04:28.910> would<00:04:29.000> be<00:04:29.090> interesting<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:31.130> know

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
think would be interesting to you know

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.360 
think would be interesting to you know
maybe<00:04:32.450> give<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.720> block<00:04:33.020> away<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.380> one<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.310> my

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
maybe give a block away to one of my

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.830 
maybe give a block away to one of my
fans<00:04:34.670> or<00:04:35.060> something<00:04:35.360> from<00:04:35.570> one<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.780> my

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
fans or something from one of my

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.000 
fans or something from one of my
contests<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:37.660> possibly<00:04:38.660> like<00:04:39.290> have<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.500> grand

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
contests and possibly like have a grand

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.640 
contests and possibly like have a grand
contest<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:40.940> just<00:04:41.360> give<00:04:41.480> away<00:04:41.510> an<00:04:41.930> entire<00:04:42.230> set

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
contest and just give away an entire set

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.160 
contest and just give away an entire set
like<00:04:43.400> one<00:04:43.610> of<00:04:43.730> each<00:04:43.910> block<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.660> then<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:45.020> few

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
like one of each block and then a few

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.140 
like one of each block and then a few
multiples<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.860> certain<00:04:46.100> other<00:04:46.190> blocks<00:04:46.490> like

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
multiples of certain other blocks like

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.640 
multiples of certain other blocks like
you<00:04:47.270> know<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.480> basic<00:04:47.750> building<00:04:48.020> materials<00:04:48.470> in

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
you know the basic building materials in

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.310 
you know the basic building materials in
a<00:04:49.490> neat<00:04:50.030> little<00:04:50.060> container<00:04:50.750> which<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.170> also

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
a neat little container which I also

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.560 
a neat little container which I also
have<00:04:51.530> an<00:04:51.620> interesting<00:04:52.130> idea<00:04:52.220> for<00:04:53.770> but<00:04:54.770> yeah<00:04:55.570> I

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
have an interesting idea for but yeah I

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.360 
have an interesting idea for but yeah I
want<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.350> do<00:04:57.440> what<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.650> guys<00:04:57.830> think<00:04:58.100> of<00:04:58.190> my

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
want to do what you guys think of my

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
want to do what you guys think of my
real-life<00:04:58.790> minecraft<00:04:59.330> pot<00:04:59.570> project<00:05:00.140> um<00:05:00.440> I

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
real-life minecraft pot project um I

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.190 
real-life minecraft pot project um I
know<00:05:02.390> what<00:05:02.540> you're<00:05:02.690> thinking<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.020> could<00:05:03.170> have

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
know what you're thinking I could have

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.630 
know what you're thinking I could have
also<00:05:03.440> made<00:05:03.740> them<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.920> little<00:05:03.980> bit<00:05:04.190> bigger<00:05:04.370> but<00:05:04.580> I

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
also made them a little bit bigger but I

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.240 
also made them a little bit bigger but I
think<00:05:04.910> I<00:05:05.450> found<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.140> perfect<00:05:06.380> size<00:05:06.770> for<00:05:06.800> the

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
think I found the perfect size for the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.460 
think I found the perfect size for the
blocks<00:05:07.520> because<00:05:07.880> too<00:05:08.120> small<00:05:08.450> and<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:08.870> can't

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
blocks because too small and you can't

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.160 
blocks because too small and you can't
really<00:05:10.240> notice<00:05:11.240> what<00:05:11.540> you're<00:05:11.690> building<00:05:12.020> or

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
really notice what you're building or

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.110 
really notice what you're building or
it's<00:05:12.830> not<00:05:12.980> really<00:05:13.040> as<00:05:13.400> cool<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.820> have<00:05:14.000> to

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
it's not really as cool and you have to

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.140 
it's not really as cool and you have to
you<00:05:14.360> know<00:05:14.450> use<00:05:14.660> a<00:05:14.690> lot<00:05:14.930> more<00:05:15.310> too<00:05:16.310> big<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:16.970> it

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
you know use a lot more too big and it

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.910 
you know use a lot more too big and it
becomes<00:05:17.360> bulky<00:05:17.750> like<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:18.170> house<00:05:18.380> would<00:05:18.590> take<00:05:18.650> up

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
becomes bulky like a house would take up

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.910 
becomes bulky like a house would take up
like<00:05:19.780> pretty<00:05:20.780> much<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.080> entire<00:05:21.350> desk<00:05:21.710> right

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
like pretty much the entire desk right

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.480 
like pretty much the entire desk right
there<00:05:22.120> so<00:05:23.120> I<00:05:23.540> have<00:05:23.960> 1-inch<00:05:24.620> cubes<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:25.250> they're

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
there so I have 1-inch cubes and they're

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.810 
there so I have 1-inch cubes and they're
you<00:05:25.880> know<00:05:25.910> perfect<00:05:26.570> size<00:05:26.720> for<00:05:27.140> building<00:05:27.820> also

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
you know perfect size for building also

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.970 
you know perfect size for building also
once<00:05:29.360> I'm<00:05:29.570> done<00:05:30.080> because<00:05:30.560> I'm<00:05:30.830> still

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
once I'm done because I'm still

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.760 
once I'm done because I'm still
perfecting<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:31.760> like<00:05:32.020> from<00:05:33.020> from<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.590> first

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
perfecting it like from from the first

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.920 
perfecting it like from from the first
time<00:05:33.920> I<00:05:34.070> started<00:05:34.250> till<00:05:34.610> today<00:05:34.970> I've<00:05:35.690> made<00:05:35.750> a

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
time I started till today I've made a

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.660 
time I started till today I've made a
lot<00:05:36.200> of<00:05:36.230> improvements<00:05:36.890> and<00:05:37.040> advances<00:05:37.520> that

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
lot of improvements and advances that

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.880 
lot of improvements and advances that
make<00:05:37.850> everything<00:05:38.150> much<00:05:38.390> easier<00:05:38.810> but<00:05:39.440> once<00:05:39.740> I'm

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
make everything much easier but once I'm
