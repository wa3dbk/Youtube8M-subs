holes on the inside of the rim will

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.910 
holes on the inside of the rim will
cause<00:03:55.660> all<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.959> excess<00:03:56.290> water<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.680> come

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.030 
now that you've cleaned your motor out
and<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.910> squeezed<00:04:19.239> your<00:04:19.390> tires<00:04:19.600> out<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.950> a

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
and you squeezed your tires out it's a

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.280 
and you squeezed your tires out it's a
good<00:04:21.220> idea<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.519> buy<00:04:21.790> yourself<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.419> bearing<00:04:23.169> and

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
good idea to buy yourself a bearing and

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.590 
good idea to buy yourself a bearing and
bushing<00:04:23.590> oiler<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.160> just<00:04:25.090> go<00:04:25.180> over<00:04:25.390> all<00:04:25.510> the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
bushing oiler and just go over all the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.480 
bushing oiler and just go over all the
bushings<00:04:25.930> on<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.169> truck<00:04:26.410> so<00:04:26.979> they<00:04:27.160> don't<00:04:27.340> get

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
bushings on the truck so they don't get

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.750 
bushings on the truck so they don't get
corroded<00:04:28.500> on<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.680> back<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.100> motor<00:04:30.310> put<00:04:30.729> a

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
corroded on the back of the motor put a

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.460 
corroded on the back of the motor put a
little<00:04:30.970> drop<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.690> let<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.960> soak<00:04:32.080> in<00:04:32.260> as<00:04:32.380> you

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
little drop and let it soak in as you

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.260 
little drop and let it soak in as you
turn<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.650> tires<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.250> you'll<00:04:33.910> have<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.180> take

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
turn the tires and you'll have to take

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.730 
turn the tires and you'll have to take
the<00:04:34.330> tires<00:04:34.600> off<00:04:34.840> which<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.229> should<00:04:35.440> do<00:04:35.590> the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
the tires off which you should do the

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.480 
the tires off which you should do the
squeeze<00:04:36.010> them<00:04:36.160> out<00:04:36.220> anyways<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.950> get<00:04:39.070> access

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
squeeze them out anyways to get access

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.890 
squeeze them out anyways to get access
to<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.700> bushings<00:04:40.060> in<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.270> wheel<00:04:40.390> hubs<00:04:40.630> so

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
to the bushings in the wheel hubs so

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.480 
to the bushings in the wheel hubs so
I'll<00:04:40.960> have<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.169> take<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.440> hex<00:04:41.620> off

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
I'll have to take the hex off

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.040 
I'll have to take the hex off
and<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:44.150> should<00:04:44.330> be<00:04:44.420> able<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.660> sneak<00:04:44.840> the

and you should be able to sneak the

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.960 
and you should be able to sneak the
needle<00:04:45.320> behind<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:46.130> shim<00:04:46.340> just<00:04:46.640> put<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:46.820> little

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
needle behind the shim just put a little

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.140 
needle behind the shim just put a little
drop<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.720> let<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:47.990> soak<00:04:48.140> in<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:49.820> get<00:04:49.970> to<00:04:50.060> the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
drop and let it soak in to get to the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.150 
drop and let it soak in to get to the
back<00:04:50.360> one<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:51.410> will<00:04:51.590> have<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.890> take<00:04:52.010> the

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
back one you will have to take the

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.120 
back one you will have to take the
knuckle<00:04:53.380> angle<00:04:54.380> it<00:04:54.440> a<00:04:54.470> little<00:04:54.620> bit<00:04:54.740> forward<00:04:55.040> by

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
knuckle angle it a little bit forward by

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.430 
knuckle angle it a little bit forward by
taking<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.520> upper<00:04:55.700> link<00:04:55.850> off<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:57.260> squirts

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
taking the upper link off and it squirts

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.530 
taking the upper link off and it squirts
them<00:04:57.620> in<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.770> back<00:04:58.120> then<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.210> can<00:04:59.330> go<00:04:59.420> ahead

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
them in the back then you can go ahead

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.570 
them in the back then you can go ahead
and<00:04:59.660> put<00:04:59.870> it<00:04:59.960> back<00:05:00.050> together<00:05:00.230> do<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.430> all

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
and put it back together do this to all

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.640 
and put it back together do this to all
four<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.000> wheels<00:05:02.180> on<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.420> truck<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.840> also<00:05:03.560> do

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
four the wheels on the truck and also do

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.840 
four the wheels on the truck and also do
the<00:05:03.770> front<00:05:04.010> bushing<00:05:04.340> on<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.520> motor<00:05:04.700> which

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
the front bushing on the motor which

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.010 
the front bushing on the motor which
you'll<00:05:05.000> have<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.210> take<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.450> gear<00:05:05.600> cover<00:05:05.750> off

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
you'll have to take the gear cover off

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.530 
you'll have to take the gear cover off
to<00:05:06.170> get<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.350> it<00:05:07.220> is<00:05:07.340> also<00:05:07.490> very<00:05:07.820> important<00:05:08.360> that

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
to get to it is also very important that

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.810 
to get to it is also very important that
after<00:05:08.750> every<00:05:09.320> couple<00:05:09.650> runs<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:10.310> double<00:05:10.640> check

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
after every couple runs you double check

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.580 
after every couple runs you double check
all<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.270> screws<00:05:11.600> on<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.870> entire<00:05:12.170> truck

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
all the screws on the entire truck

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.200 
all the screws on the entire truck
because<00:05:13.280> while<00:05:13.490> it's<00:05:13.700> driving<00:05:14.090> it's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
because while it's driving it's

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.730 
because while it's driving it's
vibrating<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:14.840> they<00:05:14.900> could<00:05:15.080> come<00:05:15.260> loose<00:05:15.470> and

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
vibrating and they could come loose and

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.820 
vibrating and they could come loose and
you<00:05:16.220> could<00:05:16.430> lose<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.610> couple<00:05:17.650> simply<00:05:18.650> go<00:05:18.800> over

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
you could lose a couple simply go over

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.950 
you could lose a couple simply go over
them<00:05:19.160> don't<00:05:19.910> over<00:05:20.150> tighten<00:05:20.300> them<00:05:20.510> just<00:05:20.810> make

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
them don't over tighten them just make

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.070 
them don't over tighten them just make
sure<00:05:21.110> they're<00:05:21.290> all<00:05:21.410> snug<00:05:22.900> after<00:05:23.900> you're<00:05:24.050> done

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
sure they're all snug after you're done

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.840 
sure they're all snug after you're done
that<00:05:24.410> you<00:05:24.890> should<00:05:24.920> be<00:05:25.160> off<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:25.520> ready<00:05:25.640> to<00:05:25.760> go
