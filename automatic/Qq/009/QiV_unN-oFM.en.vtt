bi-directional skis from k2 so in the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.099 
bi-directional skis from k2 so in the
past<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:13.889> had<00:00:14.040> factory<00:00:14.549> team<00:00:15.109> basically

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
past we had factory team basically

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.500 
past we had factory team basically
factory<00:00:16.650> team<00:00:16.859> has<00:00:17.039> gone<00:00:17.279> away<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.119> wider

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
factory team has gone away for the wider

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.650 
factory team has gone away for the wider
waisted<00:00:19.109> skis<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.310> we've<00:00:20.609> included<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.510> new

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
waisted skis and so we've included a new

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.359 
waisted skis and so we've included a new
series<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.230> called<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> shreditor<00:00:22.920> series

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
series is called the shreditor series

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.609 
series is called the shreditor series
and<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:24.150> our<00:00:24.300> bride<00:00:24.630> erection<00:00:25.050> approach<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and it's our bride erection approach to

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
and it's our bride erection approach to
freeride<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> directional<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
freeride so we have a directional and a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.259 
freeride so we have a directional and a
bi-directional<00:00:27.810> freeride<00:00:28.800> category<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
bi-directional freeride category and

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.269 
bi-directional freeride category and
these<00:00:30.420> are<00:00:30.599> bi-directional<00:00:31.170> skis<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.130> their

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
these are bi-directional skis so their

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.930 
these are bi-directional skis so their
twin<00:00:32.520> tip<00:00:32.700> skis<00:00:33.350> they're<00:00:34.350> made<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:35.070> surfy

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
twin tip skis they're made to be surfy

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.049 
twin tip skis they're made to be surfy
super<00:00:36.780> agile<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.620> playful<00:00:38.070> really<00:00:38.760> let<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
super agile and playful really let the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.299 
super agile and playful really let the
terrain<00:00:39.450> dictate<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.649> skis<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.129> being

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
terrain dictate how these skis are being

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.830 
terrain dictate how these skis are being
skied<00:00:41.640> rather<00:00:41.910> than<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> hard-charging

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
skied rather than the hard-charging

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.720 
skied rather than the hard-charging
counterpart<00:00:43.500> Center<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> NX<00:00:44.280> collection

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
counterpart Center on the NX collection

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.630 
counterpart Center on the NX collection
so<00:00:45.270> within<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.719> shreditor<00:00:46.140> series<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.610> a

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
so within the shreditor series we have a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.040 
so within the shreditor series we have a
102<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.570> 112<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.039> 120<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.000> 120<00:00:51.539> being<00:00:51.750> Sean

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
102 a 112 and a 120 the 120 being Sean

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.470 
102 a 112 and a 120 the 120 being Sean
Pettit<00:00:52.320> SPRO<00:00:52.680> model<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.820> each<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.120> them

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
Pettit SPRO model and so each of them

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.270 
Pettit SPRO model and so each of them
have<00:00:54.719> characteristics<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.800> rocker

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
have characteristics they have rocker

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.700 
have characteristics they have rocker
tip<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> tail<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.020> symmetrical<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
tip and tail that are symmetrical in

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.369 
tip and tail that are symmetrical in
terms<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> rocker<00:00:59.370> profile<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
terms of the rocker profile and

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
terms of the rocker profile and
basically<00:01:01.379> they're<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> category<00:01:02.370> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
basically they're all in a category that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
basically they're all in a category that
makes<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:02.940> skis<00:01:03.210> super<00:01:03.750> fun<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.019> easy<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
makes these skis super fun and easy to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
makes these skis super fun and easy to
ski<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:04.920> release<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.549> easy<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.119> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
ski they release really easy and you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690 
ski they release really easy and you
really<00:01:06.900> let<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.680> terrain<00:01:08.040> dictate<00:01:08.549> how

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
really let the the terrain dictate how

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.480 
really let the the terrain dictate how
these<00:01:08.880> skis<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.210> being<00:01:09.510> skied<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.530> starting

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
these skis are being skied so starting

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
these skis are being skied so starting
off<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.820> line<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.210> 102<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.020> 102

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
off in the line is the 102 so 102

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.190 
off in the line is the 102 so 102
millimeters<00:01:13.830> underfoot<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.840> playful<00:01:15.840> ski<00:01:16.080> that
