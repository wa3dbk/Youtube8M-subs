00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
they don't really offer a sharp edge

they don't really offer a sharp edge
straight<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> box<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.390> exactly

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
straight out the box so this is exactly

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.460 
straight out the box so this is exactly
yeah<00:00:28.130> we're<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.279> show<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> here<00:00:30.470> this

has<00:00:31.650> never<00:00:31.800> been<00:00:32.040> used<00:00:32.279> all<00:00:32.820> I've<00:00:33.000> done<00:00:33.120> is

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
has never been used all I've done is

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.240 
has never been used all I've done is
open<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.899> now<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.140> look<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
open it up now to look at it just to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
open it up now to look at it just to
make<00:00:35.399> sure<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:35.880> thing<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
make sure it's the right thing this is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.180 
make sure it's the right thing this is
never<00:00:37.020> actually<00:00:37.170> been<00:00:37.380> used<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
never actually been used at all and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.830 
never actually been used at all and
there<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.399> an<00:00:41.550> edge<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.390> honest<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
there is an edge but to be honest I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.930 
there is an edge but to be honest I
don't<00:00:42.989> think<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> cut<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.760> paper

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
don't think it's going to cut the paper

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.450 
don't think it's going to cut the paper
but<00:00:45.210> we'll<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.539> see<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:46.190> standard<00:00:47.190> piece<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
but we'll just see now standard piece of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:57.049 
but we'll just see now standard piece of
paper<00:00:47.660> myself<00:00:48.660> ago<00:00:50.899> well<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.989> does<00:00:52.170> hmm<00:00:56.059> that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
paper myself ago well it does hmm that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.630 
paper myself ago well it does hmm that
is<00:00:57.090> cutting<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.920> little<00:00:58.920> bit<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.190> feathering<00:00:59.460> on

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
is cutting a little bit of feathering on

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.349 
is cutting a little bit of feathering on
it<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.800> that's<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.280> too<00:01:02.579> bad<00:01:02.850> that's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it so really that's not too bad that's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.640 
it so really that's not too bad that's
better<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:04.320> I've<00:01:04.439> been<00:01:04.470> led<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.890> believe<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
better than I've been led to believe and

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.340 
better than I've been led to believe and
so<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:08.630> there's<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> proof<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.260> it's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
so that's there's the proof for you it's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
so that's there's the proof for you it's
not<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> cleanest<00:01:11.430> cut<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.390> some

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
not the cleanest cut there is some

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.219 
not the cleanest cut there is some
resistance<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:14.600> seems<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.780> maybe<00:01:16.020> back

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
resistance and seems that maybe back

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
resistance and seems that maybe back
there<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> worst<00:01:17.610> bitter<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.000> should

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
there that's the worst bitter I should

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.910 
there that's the worst bitter I should
feel<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> roughness<00:01:19.320> along<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
feel a little bit of roughness along the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.080 
feel a little bit of roughness along the
edge<00:01:20.070> there<00:01:22.100> yeah<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.310> could<00:01:23.520> do<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> little

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
edge there yeah I could do with a little

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.850 
edge there yeah I could do with a little
bit<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.360> tidy<00:01:24.659> up<00:01:24.689> book<00:01:24.900> better<00:01:25.619> than<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
bit of a tidy up book better than I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
bit of a tidy up book better than I
thought<00:01:26.100> better<00:01:26.490> than<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> people<00:01:27.540> had

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
thought better than all the people had

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.999 
thought better than all the people had
said<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.759> bad

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
said so that's not bad

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.359 
said so that's not bad
the<00:01:32.009> next<00:01:32.220> knife<00:01:32.400> home<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.439> more

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the next knife home is the more

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.950 
the next knife home is the more
companion<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> heavy-duty<00:01:36.540> one

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
companion this is the heavy-duty one

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.920 
companion this is the heavy-duty one
again<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.759> both<00:01:39.210> knives<00:01:39.479> delivered

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
again this is the both knives delivered

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.980 
again this is the both knives delivered
today<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.880> hasn't<00:01:42.119> caught<00:01:42.390> anything<00:01:42.750> at

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
today and this hasn't caught anything at

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.749 
today and this hasn't caught anything at
all<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:46.320> straight<00:01:46.710> out<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.610> box

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
all so it's straight out of the box

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.139 
all so it's straight out of the box
against<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.299> carbon<00:01:48.659> steel<00:01:49.040> version

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
against the carbon steel version

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.249 
against the carbon steel version
it's<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.689> nice<00:01:51.899> size<00:01:52.189> actually<00:01:54.020> I'm<00:01:55.020> glad<00:01:55.170> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it's a nice size actually I'm glad I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
it's a nice size actually I'm glad I
went<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.679> one<00:01:55.890> rather<00:01:56.700> than<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
went for this one rather than the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.679 
went for this one rather than the
standard<00:01:57.600> smaller<00:01:58.079> standard<00:01:58.710> size<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
standard smaller standard size and

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.169 
standard smaller standard size and
that's<00:02:00.689> nice<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.109> the<00:02:01.170> hand<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.179> so

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
that's nice in the hand I like that so

that's nice in the hand I like that so
let's<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.509> look<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.750> some<00:02:03.929> paper<00:02:05.810> okay

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840

sure<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.030> don't<00:02:21.269> know<00:02:21.330> whether<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.930> sharp<00:02:23.269> is<00:02:24.269> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
sure I don't know whether a sharp is the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.500 
sure I don't know whether a sharp is the
opener<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:26.340> not<00:02:26.489> bad<00:02:26.640> though<00:02:26.790> it's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
opener it's not bad though it's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.179 
opener it's not bad though it's
different<00:02:27.720> type<00:02:28.379> blade<00:02:28.680> obviously<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.159> a

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
different type blade obviously with a

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.949 
different type blade obviously with a
Scandi<00:02:29.610> grind<00:02:29.760> I've<00:02:30.239> never<00:02:30.420> had<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> Scandi

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
Scandi grind I've never had a Scandi

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.309 
Scandi grind I've never had a Scandi
grind<00:02:30.989> before<00:02:31.439> so<00:02:32.209> alright<00:02:33.209> that's<00:02:33.870> better

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
grind before so alright that's better

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.140 
grind before so alright that's better
we<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.769> need<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.040> approach<00:02:35.549> the<00:02:35.730> paper<00:02:35.909> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
we just need to approach the paper the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.729 
we just need to approach the paper the
better<00:02:36.269> angle<00:02:36.659> all<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.959> here<00:02:37.170> that's<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.590> lot

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
better angle all that here that's a lot

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.860 
better angle all that here that's a lot
better<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.299> way<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.420> was<00:02:39.569> holding

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
better it's just the way I was holding

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.119 
better it's just the way I was holding
the<00:02:39.989> blade<00:02:40.140> really<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.590> reference<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
the blade really in reference to the

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:47.259 
the blade really in reference to the
paper<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:42.140> when<00:02:43.190> except<00:02:44.190> another<00:02:44.400> go<00:02:45.709> yes

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
paper so when except another go yes

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.000 
paper so when except another go yes
there's<00:02:48.269> about<00:02:48.450> half<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.959> resistance<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.829> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
there's about half the resistance on the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.000 
there's about half the resistance on the
actual<00:02:50.310> cut<00:02:50.489> I'm<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.480> blade<00:02:51.920> compared<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
actual cut I'm that blade compared to

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.619 
actual cut I'm that blade compared to
the<00:02:53.099> opener<00:02:53.519> but<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.879> open<00:02:54.150> eye<00:02:54.239> was<00:02:54.329> not<00:02:54.450> bad

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
the opener but the open eye was not bad

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.800 
the opener but the open eye was not bad
it<00:02:54.930> did<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> paper<00:02:55.409> cut<00:02:56.030> test<00:02:57.030> straight<00:02:57.569> out<00:02:57.780> of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it did a paper cut test straight out of

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.649 
it did a paper cut test straight out of
the<00:02:57.989> box<00:02:58.139> so<00:02:58.590> I'm<00:02:58.709> happy<00:02:58.859> with<00:02:58.980> that<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:03.090> that's

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
the box so I'm happy with that so that's

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.449 
the box so I'm happy with that so that's
a<00:03:03.780> nice<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.680> quite<00:03:04.889> a<00:03:04.920> clean<00:03:05.220> cut<00:03:07.250> no<00:03:08.250> real

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
a nice it's quite a clean cut no real

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
I do with a slight two chip that one

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.580 
I do with a slight two chip that one
buddies<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.780> plenty<00:03:28.140> sharp<00:03:28.170> enough

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
really quite sure that would work out

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.740 
really quite sure that would work out
out<00:03:33.000> in<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.300> woods<00:03:33.450> quite<00:03:33.600> well<00:03:35.420> back<00:03:36.420> in<00:03:36.570> that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
out in the woods quite well back in that

out in the woods quite well back in that
and<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:38.550> open<00:03:38.850> or<00:03:39.200> yeah<00:03:40.200> quite<00:03:40.590> plays<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:40.950> up

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
and the open or yeah quite plays it up

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.500 
and the open or yeah quite plays it up
could<00:03:43.650> do<00:03:43.800> with<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.980> little<00:03:44.100> touch<00:03:44.400> up<00:03:44.610> but<00:03:45.210> not

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
could do with a little touch up but not
