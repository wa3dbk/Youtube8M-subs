00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.990
 when they leave in large quantities 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.390

 or a sun or a mouth or brandy 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.159
 a canary lemon peel boiled in 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.170
 water 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.280

 absolutely effective you can chew 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.250
 two charcoal complexes with 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.080
 slowness is not very good but it can be 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.260
 try you can suck a clove of 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.600
 lemon me or less effective 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.700
 nothing to solve what then me 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.510
 I want to occupy instead it is like 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.180
 neutralize the effects of the air first 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.330
 to eat it starting from the kitchen that 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.679
 then exactly what I can do 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.679
 let's see how we move to the table 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.849
 first let's remember 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.580
 use only whole garlic 6 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.700
 dented or if you are voting even in 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.840
 we can do a lot of cooking 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.120
 we press the segments with our hand 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.730
 it comes out under the blade of a knife 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.799
 the alicin from the clove moving away 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.720
 the skin that covers it and so it is already 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.230
 much easier to eliminate this me 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.780
 already seems like a good thing 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.120
 once the clove is peeled we open it 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.250
 in half and we eliminate the bud 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.989
 interior that would later be the year 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.750
 launch next year if not 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.840
 we had cooked we put to boil 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.190
 of water with a pinch of salt 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.129
 when it reaches full boiling c 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.489
 we pour and half cloves 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.530
 we leave it to cook for 5 10 minutes 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.480
 as long as they are soft we can 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.500
 check cooking by stinging there with 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.650
 a toothpick or a skewer 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.710
 there we drain let you fall into a 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.170
 jar and we cover them with oil 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.750
 extra virgin olive oil since the operation 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.670
 takes some time I suggest 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.260
 preparing a good quantity is one 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.750
 once preserved with a tin of 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.760
 oil-covered glass we can keep them in 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.770
 almost indefinite time refrigerator 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.770
 it's about taking it from time to time 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.930
 time the quantity we need 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.060
 we can use them as we want like 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.459
 pure garlic to accompany artichokes 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.170
 asparagus or even for a sumptuous dip 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.180
 cauda here the garlic finally is 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.890
 simply the only a good friend 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.540
 now we can give us all the kisses 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.950
 what we want 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.950
