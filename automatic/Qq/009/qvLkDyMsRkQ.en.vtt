00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
well cowboy you're entitled to your

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.750 
well cowboy you're entitled to your
opinion<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.590> think<00:02:24.650> Chiclets<00:02:25.280> flavor<00:02:25.580> is

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
opinion but I think Chiclets flavor is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.320 
opinion but I think Chiclets flavor is
outside<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:26.660> decode<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:28.330> another

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
outside and I can decode it another

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.809 
outside and I can decode it another
example<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:30.140> superficial<00:02:30.709> thinking<00:02:31.370> coverage

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
example of superficial thinking coverage

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.420
