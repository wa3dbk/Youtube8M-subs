about<00:02:14.480> modern<00:02:14.870> warfare<00:02:15.050> 3<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.530> really

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
about modern warfare 3 that really

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.270 
about modern warfare 3 that really
bothers<00:02:16.220> me<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:17.510> it's<00:02:18.380> very<00:02:18.500> inconsistent

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
bothers me is it's very inconsistent

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.699 
bothers me is it's very inconsistent
like<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.849> start<00:02:20.090> off<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.239> game<00:02:20.510> earlier<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.930> was<00:02:21.170> 19

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
like I start off a game earlier I was 19

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.600 
like I start off a game earlier I was 19
and<00:02:21.920> 0<00:02:22.250> with<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.640> bread<00:02:23.030> 50<00:02:23.420> Cal<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.610> after

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
and 0 with the bread 50 Cal and after

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.430 
and 0 with the bread 50 Cal and after
that<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:26.030> think<00:02:26.180> my<00:02:26.450> final<00:02:26.810> score<00:02:27.080> ended<00:02:27.350> up

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that I think my final score ended up

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.300 
that I think my final score ended up
being<00:02:27.650> something<00:02:27.890> like<00:02:28.190> 34<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.480> um<00:02:30.049> I<00:02:30.470> think

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
being something like 34 and um I think

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.860 
being something like 34 and um I think
was<00:02:31.670> 34<00:02:32.150> 11<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.709> not<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> stellar<00:02:34.370> gameplay<00:02:34.910> but

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
was 34 11 so not a stellar gameplay but

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.600 
was 34 11 so not a stellar gameplay but
it<00:02:36.049> just<00:02:36.230> saw<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.560> consistent<00:02:37.160> like<00:02:37.280> how<00:02:37.400> do<00:02:37.459> I

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
it just saw it consistent like how do I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.610 
it just saw it consistent like how do I
get<00:02:37.670> 20<00:02:38.120> kills<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.540> row<00:02:38.569> without<00:02:38.810> dying<00:02:39.230> and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
get 20 kills in a row without dying and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.070 
get 20 kills in a row without dying and
then<00:02:39.890> died<00:02:40.069> fifteen<00:02:40.489> thousand<00:02:40.910> times<00:02:41.120> that's

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
then died fifteen thousand times that's

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.539 
then died fifteen thousand times that's
one<00:02:42.290> thing<00:02:42.410> about<00:02:42.500> modern<00:02:42.950> warfare<00:02:43.130> 3<00:02:43.280> that

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
one thing about modern warfare 3 that

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.830 
one thing about modern warfare 3 that
definitely<00:02:43.910> does<00:02:44.150> bother<00:02:44.390> me<00:02:44.569> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
definitely does bother me the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.770 
definitely does bother me the
inconsistency<00:02:45.849> for<00:02:46.849> example<00:02:47.239> i<00:02:47.330> was<00:02:47.480> playing

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
inconsistency for example i was playing

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.170 
inconsistency for example i was playing
um<00:02:48.230> i<00:02:48.730> was<00:02:49.730> playing<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:51.280> resistance<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.910> i<00:02:53.000> was

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
um i was playing of resistance and i was

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
streak that used on so they ran through

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.020 
streak that used on so they ran through
my<00:03:14.030> Claymore<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.190> it<00:03:16.190> really<00:03:16.400> sucked<00:03:16.790> because

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
my Claymore and it really sucked because

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.720 
my Claymore and it really sucked because
you<00:03:17.329> know<00:03:17.450> i<00:03:17.720> do<00:03:18.049> everything<00:03:18.500> right<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:19.220> the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
you know i do everything right and the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.870 
you know i do everything right and the
game<00:03:19.910> just<00:03:20.150> decides<00:03:20.540> oh<00:03:20.870> whatever<00:03:21.680> f<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.579> we're

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
game just decides oh whatever f is we're

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.370 
game just decides oh whatever f is we're
gonna<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.269> kill<00:03:23.510> him<00:03:23.630> anyway<00:03:23.720> by<00:03:24.049> spotting

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380
