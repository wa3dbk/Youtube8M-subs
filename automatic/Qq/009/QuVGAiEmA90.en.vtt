asking me for tutorial video on the new

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.240 
asking me for tutorial video on the new
pendulum<00:00:06.210> summon<00:00:06.600> Spenlow<00:00:07.109> mechanic<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.680> how

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
pendulum summon Spenlow mechanic and how

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.410 
pendulum summon Spenlow mechanic and how
it<00:00:08.400> works<00:00:08.670> so<00:00:09.139> with<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.260> video<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.830> will<00:00:11.010> be

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
it works so with this video it will be

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.180 
it works so with this video it will be
hopefully<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.540> will<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> bit<00:00:13.410> more<00:00:13.590> clear<00:00:13.980> on

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
hopefully it will be a bit more clear on

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.050 
hopefully it will be a bit more clear on
how<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.880> pendulum<00:00:15.599> mechanic<00:00:15.990> works<00:00:16.460> I'll<00:00:17.460> try

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
how the pendulum mechanic works I'll try

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.380 
how the pendulum mechanic works I'll try
not<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.449> drag<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> video<00:00:19.439> too<00:00:19.740> long<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.390> yeah

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
not to drag the video too long and yeah

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.259 
not to drag the video too long and yeah
obviously<00:00:22.050> keep<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.769> short<00:00:23.189> but<00:00:23.789> efficient

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
obviously keep it as short but efficient

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.050 
obviously keep it as short but efficient
as<00:00:24.480> possible<00:00:25.580> let's<00:00:26.580> start<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
as possible let's start with the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.210 
as possible let's start with the
beginning<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.680> will<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
beginning as you see this will be in a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.189 
beginning as you see this will be in a
new<00:00:29.369> field<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:30.060> yugioh<00:00:30.689> when<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> pendulum

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
new field for yugioh when the pendulum

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.220 
new field for yugioh when the pendulum
mechanic<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.120> both<00:00:33.480> pendulum

pendulum<00:01:11.700> cards<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.450> summoned<00:01:12.810> as

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pendulum cards can be summoned as

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890 
pendulum cards can be summoned as
regular<00:01:13.680> monsters<00:01:14.159> let's<00:01:15.090> take<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> look<00:01:15.630> at

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
regular monsters let's take a look at

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.590 
regular monsters let's take a look at
for<00:01:16.290> example<00:01:16.320> pendulum<00:01:17.189> dragon<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.420> level

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
for example pendulum dragon it's a level

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.679 
for example pendulum dragon it's a level
7<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> regular<00:01:20.549> monster<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> seems<00:01:21.420> not

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
7 so as a regular monster it seems not

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.440 
7 so as a regular monster it seems not
useful<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> card<00:01:24.299> is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
useful but that's not what this card is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.620 
useful but that's not what this card is
for<00:01:25.250> pendulum<00:01:26.250> dragon<00:01:26.400> spell<00:01:26.850> effect<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.330> far

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
for pendulum dragon spell effect is far

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
for pendulum dragon spell effect is far
more<00:01:27.900> important<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.280> use<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> spell<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> card

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
more important if you use a spell a card

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.819 
more important if you use a spell a card
effect<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.689> activate<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.079> from<00:01:31.259> your<00:01:31.470> hands

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
effect you activate it from your hands

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.740 
effect you activate it from your hands
and<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> dragon<00:01:32.970> will<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.240> placed<00:01:33.540> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and then the dragon will be placed in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.780 
and then the dragon will be placed in
one<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.290> Yap<00:01:34.799> pendulum<00:01:35.280> zones<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
one of your Yap pendulum zones on the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
one of your Yap pendulum zones on the
field<00:01:36.119> where<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.049> phase<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> spell<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> card

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
field where it's a phase of spell a card

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.090 
field where it's a phase of spell a card
at<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:39.390> moment<00:01:39.600> your<00:01:40.140> pendulum<00:01:40.470> card<00:01:40.770> will

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
at this moment your pendulum card will

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.670 
at this moment your pendulum card will
get<00:01:41.340> its<00:01:41.549> spell<00:01:41.939> card<00:01:42.240> effect<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.439> makes

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
get its spell card effect and this makes

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.889 
get its spell card effect and this makes
pendulum<00:01:44.159> dragon<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.790> good<00:01:44.939> hear<00:01:45.390> me<00:01:45.540> out

then<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.570> dragon<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.140> destroyed<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
then the dragon is destroyed on the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.800 
then the dragon is destroyed on the
field<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.729> placed<00:02:02.969> face-up<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.659> your

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
field it will be placed face-up in your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.289 
field it will be placed face-up in your
own<00:02:04.079> Extra<00:02:04.649> Deck<00:02:04.680> keep<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.790> mind<00:02:05.939> this

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
own Extra Deck keep this in mind this

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.240 
own Extra Deck keep this in mind this
will<00:02:06.479> be<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.840> crucial<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.619> few<00:02:07.799> moments

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
will be very crucial in a few moments

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.809 
will be very crucial in a few moments
okay<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.200> our<00:02:10.379> example<00:02:10.830> we<00:02:11.250> already<00:02:11.489> have

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
okay so in our example we already have

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.390 
okay so in our example we already have
one<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.270> magicians<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:12.780> hands

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
one of the magicians in hands

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.729 
one of the magicians in hands
the<00:02:13.549> one<00:02:13.730> we<00:02:14.000> searched<00:02:14.420> out<00:02:14.659> with<00:02:15.290> pendulum

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
the one we searched out with pendulum

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.309 
the one we searched out with pendulum
dragon<00:02:15.890> during<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.340> end<00:02:16.489> phase<00:02:16.549> last<00:02:17.000> turn

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
dragon during the end phase last turn

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.080 
dragon during the end phase last turn
let's<00:02:18.319> say<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.680> was<00:02:19.159> a<00:02:19.220> bit<00:02:19.370> lucky<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.879> I

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
let's say I was a bit lucky and I

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.940 
let's say I was a bit lucky and I
already<00:02:20.239> had<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.870> other<00:02:21.080> magician<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.680> hand

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.569 
let's say my opponent passes and and
it's<00:02:53.690> my<00:02:53.840> turn<00:02:53.900> again<00:02:54.079> now<00:02:54.680> if<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.099> want<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.519> can

so they'll be placed in both your
pendulum<00:03:03.530> zones<00:03:03.920> one<00:03:04.790> on<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.000> left<00:03:05.209> one<00:03:05.810> on

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
pendulum zones one on the left one on

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.479 
pendulum zones one on the left one on
the<00:03:05.959> right

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
the right

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.339 
the right
no<00:03:07.489> pendulum<00:03:07.970> summon<00:03:08.329> just<00:03:08.599> yet<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:09.049> just

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
no pendulum summon just yet you just

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.559 
no pendulum summon just yet you just
place<00:03:09.650> them<00:03:09.890> both<00:03:10.129> in<00:03:11.090> their<00:03:11.299> respective

place them both in their respective

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.920 
place them both in their respective
pendulum<00:03:12.230> zones<00:03:12.879> now<00:03:13.879> here's<00:03:14.629> where<00:03:14.840> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
pendulum zones now here's where the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.009 
pendulum zones now here's where the
scale<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.440> crucial<00:03:16.040> as<00:03:16.370> s<00:03:16.879> mentioned<00:03:17.450> one

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
scale is crucial as s mentioned one

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.289 
scale is crucial as s mentioned one
magician<00:03:18.380> has<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.530> scale<00:03:18.859> of<00:03:19.040> 1<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:20.150> other

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299

and<00:05:36.890> go<00:05:37.280> from<00:05:37.550> there<00:05:37.820> so<00:05:38.030> we<00:05:38.660> see<00:05:38.930> here<00:05:39.050> setting

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
and go from there so we see here setting

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.380 
and go from there so we see here setting
up<00:05:39.650> your<00:05:39.770> pendulum<00:05:40.130> mechanic<00:05:40.550> at<00:05:40.730> this<00:05:41.120> time

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
up your pendulum mechanic at this time

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.170 
up your pendulum mechanic at this time
of<00:05:41.600> the<00:05:41.630> video<00:05:41.990> takes<00:05:42.860> up<00:05:43.070> a<00:05:43.160> few<00:05:43.340> turns<00:05:43.640> but

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
of the video takes up a few turns but

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.480 
of the video takes up a few turns but
the<00:05:44.420> reward<00:05:44.810> is<00:05:44.930> very<00:05:45.260> high<00:05:45.500> look<00:05:46.310> at<00:05:46.400> the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
the reward is very high look at the

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.180 
the reward is very high look at the
fields<00:05:46.820> and<00:05:47.200> yeah<00:05:48.200> you<00:05:48.260> can<00:05:48.440> for<00:05:48.830> example

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
fields and yeah you can for example

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.950 
fields and yeah you can for example
still<00:05:49.340> make<00:05:49.520> a<00:05:49.550> few<00:05:49.760> exits<00:05:50.090> make<00:05:50.660> for<00:05:50.870> example

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
still make a few exits make for example

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.550 
still make a few exits make for example
here<00:05:51.770> guy<00:05:51.950> context<00:05:52.310> or<00:05:53.150> art<00:05:53.510> knight<00:05:53.750> or<00:05:54.020> Draco

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
here guy context or art knight or Draco

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.800 
here guy context or art knight or Draco
SEC<00:05:54.830> with<00:05:54.980> both<00:05:55.220> fortress<00:05:56.180> and<00:05:56.330> pendulum

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
SEC with both fortress and pendulum

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.810 
SEC with both fortress and pendulum

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
but not our pendulum dragon that card

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.790 
but not our pendulum dragon that card
will<00:06:17.060> be<00:06:17.180> sent<00:06:17.210> back<00:06:17.600> to<00:06:17.870> your<00:06:18.350> extra<00:06:18.710> deck

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
your pendulum zone you can do pretty

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.590 
your pendulum zone you can do pretty
much<00:06:30.230> the<00:06:30.380> same<00:06:30.740> next<00:06:31.040> earn<00:06:31.340> a<00:06:31.580> special<00:06:32.270> sum<00:06:32.510> in

much the same next earn a special sum in

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.830 
much the same next earn a special sum in
the<00:06:32.660> neck<00:06:33.070> because<00:06:34.070> you<00:06:34.190> can<00:06:34.370> pendulum<00:06:34.790> 7<00:06:35.120> once

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
the neck because you can pendulum 7 once

each<00:06:36.140> turn<00:06:36.730> something<00:06:37.730> important<00:06:38.150> let's<00:06:38.420> say

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
each turn something important let's say

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.519 
each turn something important let's say
I<00:06:38.690> made<00:06:39.110> a<00:06:39.290> trade

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
I made a trade

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.609 
I made a trade
Kosek<00:06:39.919> with<00:06:40.279> fortress<00:06:41.209> and<00:06:41.419> pendulum<00:06:42.409> dragon

00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:42.619 
Kosek with fortress and pendulum dragon

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:44.769 
Kosek with fortress and pendulum dragon
and<00:06:42.919> detached<00:06:43.909> pendulum<00:06:44.299> dragon<00:06:44.479> has<00:06:44.689> an

and detached pendulum dragon has an

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.829 
and detached pendulum dragon has an
exceed<00:06:45.079> material<00:06:45.529> it<00:06:45.979> will<00:06:46.189> not<00:06:46.459> be<00:06:46.849> sent<00:06:47.659> back

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:47.839 
exceed material it will not be sent back

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.499 
exceed material it will not be sent back
to<00:06:47.869> the<00:06:48.049> extra<00:06:48.319> tech<00:06:48.559> because<00:06:48.889> it<00:06:49.069> was<00:06:49.189> not

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
to the extra tech because it was not

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.169 
to the extra tech because it was not
sent<00:06:50.509> from<00:06:50.659> the<00:06:50.779> field<00:06:50.929> to<00:06:51.109> the<00:06:51.139> graveyard

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:52.179 
sent from the field to the graveyard

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:55.449 
sent from the field to the graveyard
same<00:06:53.179> it<00:06:54.079> sits<00:06:54.469> for<00:06:54.679> examples

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:55.459 
same it sits for examples

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:58.119 
same it sits for examples
yeah<00:06:55.789> same<00:06:56.029> counts<00:06:56.419> as<00:06:56.599> it's<00:06:56.779> a<00:06:56.989> sent<00:06:57.979> from

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:58.129 
yeah same counts as it's a sent from

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.449 
yeah same counts as it's a sent from
your<00:06:58.279> hand<00:06:58.519> or<00:06:58.729> deck<00:06:58.789> to<00:06:59.119> the<00:06:59.149> graveyard<00:07:00.459> okay

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:01.459 
your hand or deck to the graveyard okay

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:04.509 
your hand or deck to the graveyard okay
I<00:07:01.609> think<00:07:01.759> that<00:07:02.059> I<00:07:02.239> pretty<00:07:02.839> much<00:07:02.959> covered<00:07:03.559> more

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:04.519 
I think that I pretty much covered more

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:06.939 
I think that I pretty much covered more
important<00:07:05.089> things<00:07:05.239> on<00:07:05.359> pendulum<00:07:05.839> summon<00:07:06.229> guys

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:06.949 
important things on pendulum summon guys

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:08.919 
important things on pendulum summon guys
if<00:07:07.189> I<00:07:07.279> made<00:07:07.459> a<00:07:07.699> mistake<00:07:07.819> somewhere<00:07:08.509> in<00:07:08.839> the

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:08.929 
if I made a mistake somewhere in the

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:11.079 
if I made a mistake somewhere in the
video<00:07:09.049> don't<00:07:09.769> hesitate<00:07:10.279> and<00:07:10.339> informed<00:07:10.999> me

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:13.579 
about it I will make an attachment to

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:15.819 
about it I will make an attachment to
the<00:07:13.609> video<00:07:13.939> to<00:07:14.029> correct<00:07:14.479> things<00:07:14.829> okay

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:15.829 
the video to correct things okay

the video to correct things okay
hopefully<00:07:16.219> this<00:07:17.059> is<00:07:17.329> so<00:07:17.659> not<00:07:17.869> yeah<00:07:18.259> makes<00:07:18.649> it

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:18.799 
hopefully this is so not yeah makes it

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:21.429 
hopefully this is so not yeah makes it
more<00:07:19.009> clear<00:07:19.429> on<00:07:19.669> how<00:07:19.909> the<00:07:20.049> pendulum<00:07:21.049> mechanic

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:21.439 
more clear on how the pendulum mechanic

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.379 
more clear on how the pendulum mechanic
works<00:07:21.709> out<00:07:21.919> any<00:07:22.249> questions<00:07:22.729> are<00:07:22.999> always
