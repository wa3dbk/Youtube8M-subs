00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:07.250
 a little trick not too bad afterwards for 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.870
 go with that suit ben we'll go 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.700

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.590
 sure I have a little pants that 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.360

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.170
 been arrested for a little shirt in 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.550
 a science of that that's enough my offer 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.290
 always that changes the tones because 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.210
 that the flip flops with the suit are not going 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.700
 at all but before we stop for a 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.200
 hat so you have pictures or 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.300

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.250
 little too classic in black 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.870
 after the hat so you have them 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.850
 shoes that are next door and me 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.080
 I just took chic shoes 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.700
 because I think I did not have any 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.480
 father so I took some shoes with 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.820
 tips 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.700
 black and here we are getting a suit 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.250
 rather nice for the saint 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.470
 valentin if I ever meet a pretty 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.360
 damsel in the street after that we go 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.730
 to go to the armory and buy 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.880
 the tommy gunn so the tommy gunn it's 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.130
 the sulphate dueenberg so with with 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 a species of camembert load you 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.560
 can have the woman you want 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.540
 me green army orange spd in me 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.290
 I write platinum that I prefer 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.880
 and we will immediately see how 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.680
 this weapon behave outdoors 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.120
 when you shoot so already if you 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.290
 look for this weapon you will find it at 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.660
 side of machine guns 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.670
 the character does not live with faty 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.260
 lagoon just close to the body so that's 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.620
 a sight that is not very very accurate 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.480
 but with a species of at the strike a 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.850
 performance still high enough the cepd 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.130
 not bad then we went to the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.200
 search for the special car of the dlc 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.750
 can very well buy on the site 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.070
 legendary motorsport we saw we were 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.720
 just lucky to fall on a 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.330
 guy who drove this car there in 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.040
 the street and we stole her car all 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.230
 just like good concerts would have 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.600
 done at that time you can 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.640

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.540

 hardcore between the flashy green and the

 to leave your comments below and 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.600
 could quit on an action that 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.280
 tried to make a sprint sir 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.740
 essosso so where they went back 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.260
 they got the flirt into the c 130 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.190
 I'll take off with and we'll see what 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.210
 what's going to happen with that so the thing 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.090
 is that normally when you come back 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.860
 the car in the back it explodes enough 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.270
 quickly but that's it I do not know 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.000
 why we managed to take off but that 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.590
 will not explode but I must 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.810
 I straighten the plane that made them 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.350
 completely exploded both were 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.930
 suicides I lost two engines on my 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.729
 plane and there it was very hard to 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.440
 and the bar of season 30 so 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.500
 result I was a little further 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.050
 and I jumped into a parachute and they are 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.610
 came to pick me up by car it's this 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.039
 which is rather nice because otherwise I 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.520
 will find myself alone on this 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.080
 part go on that tell you to very 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.590
 soon for a new video chat 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.590
 cat will have more
