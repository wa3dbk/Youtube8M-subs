be really fun to draw a character like
that<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.640> impressed<00:01:42.000> by<00:01:42.180> Thorin<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
that but I was impressed by Thorin and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
that but I was impressed by Thorin and
he's<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.740> lead<00:01:44.070> character<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
he's kind of like the lead character of

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
he's kind of like the lead character of
the<00:01:44.820> series<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.990> whole<00:01:46.140> story<00:01:46.439> is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the series because the whole story is

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.160 
the series because the whole story is
revolving<00:01:47.009> around<00:01:47.130> his<00:01:47.670> kingdom<00:01:48.240> or<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.930> least

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
trying to reestablish his home and all

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.380 
trying to reestablish his home and all
that<00:01:52.290> kind<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.530> good<00:01:52.710> stuff<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.250> Bilbo<00:01:53.939> Bilbo

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that kind of good stuff and Bilbo Bilbo

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.749 
that kind of good stuff and Bilbo Bilbo

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
is obviously the main main character but

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
is obviously the main main character but
he<00:01:56.880> didn't<00:01:57.119> seem<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.479> interesting<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.350> draw

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
he didn't seem as interesting to draw

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.660 
he didn't seem as interesting to draw
with<00:01:59.219> Thorin

kind<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:40.079> feel<00:03:40.230> like<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.650> cheating<00:03:40.950> at<00:03:41.190> times

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
kind of feel like it's cheating at times

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.460 
kind of feel like it's cheating at times
but<00:03:41.760> there's<00:03:42.000> no<00:03:42.150> reason<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:42.630> make<00:03:43.110> our<00:03:43.260> lives

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
but there's no reason to make our lives

very<00:03:48.450> efficient<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.049> Photoshop<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.890> I'm<00:03:50.070> glad

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
very efficient on Photoshop and I'm glad

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.130 
very efficient on Photoshop and I'm glad
to<00:03:50.700> have<00:03:51.030> discovered<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.720> started<00:03:52.049> this

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
to have discovered it and started this

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.650 
to have discovered it and started this
channel<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.920> keep<00:03:53.100> learning<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.420> as

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
channel so I can keep learning it so as

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.479 
channel so I can keep learning it so as
always<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.440> likeness<00:03:55.890> was<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.340> main

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
always the likeness was the main

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.759 
always the likeness was the main
difficulty<00:03:57.120> for<00:03:57.329> this<00:03:57.450> piece<00:03:57.720> but<00:03:58.049> after<00:03:58.590> that

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
difficulty for this piece but after that

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.710 
difficulty for this piece but after that
it<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.130> all<00:03:59.280> about<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.670> hair<00:03:59.910> right<00:04:00.480> now<00:04:00.660> you

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
at the end of the day I realized just

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.560 
at the end of the day I realized just
how<00:04:31.500> many<00:04:32.100> kind<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.550> textures<00:04:33.000> I<00:04:33.120> was<00:04:33.270> playing

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
how many kind of textures I was playing

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.480 
how many kind of textures I was playing
with<00:04:33.720> them<00:04:33.900> on<00:04:34.020> this<00:04:34.110> piece<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:35.280> makes

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
with them on this piece and that makes

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.790 
with them on this piece and that makes
it<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.670> lot<00:04:35.820> of<00:04:35.970> fun<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.360> me<00:04:36.420> because<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:37.290> have<00:04:37.590> so

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
it a lot of fun for me because I have so

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.890 
it a lot of fun for me because I have so
much<00:04:37.950> variety<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.610> have<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:38.940> tend<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.300> if

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
much variety I have to tend to if

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.630 
much variety I have to tend to if
everything<00:04:40.380> was<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.680> same<00:04:40.920> kind<00:04:41.160> of<00:04:41.250> texture

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
everything was the same kind of texture

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.430 
everything was the same kind of texture
it'd<00:04:41.940> be<00:04:42.060> pretty<00:04:42.360> boring<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.930> paint<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.320> know

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
it'd be pretty boring to paint you know

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.740 
it'd be pretty boring to paint you know
you<00:04:43.560> stick<00:04:43.980> with<00:04:44.100> one<00:04:44.280> brush<00:04:44.610> or<00:04:44.910> or<00:04:45.240> stick<00:04:45.600> to

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
you stick with one brush or or stick to

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.750 
you stick with one brush or or stick to
one<00:04:45.900> painting<00:04:46.380> technique<00:04:46.770> but<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.520> wouldn't

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
one painting technique but that wouldn't

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.310 
one painting technique but that wouldn't
be<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.910> case<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.390> would<00:04:48.540> have<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.870> jump<00:04:49.140> around

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
be the case I would have to jump around

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.100 
be the case I would have to jump around
a<00:04:49.620> bit<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.490> keeps<00:04:50.730> you<00:04:50.850> on<00:04:50.970> your<00:04:51.000> toes<00:04:51.150> I<00:04:51.660> can

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
a bit that keeps you on your toes I can

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.050 
a bit that keeps you on your toes I can
never<00:04:52.230> really<00:04:52.470> tell<00:04:52.860> when<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.400> piece<00:04:53.730> is<00:04:53.910> ready

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
never really tell when a piece is ready

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.910 
never really tell when a piece is ready
to<00:04:54.270> be<00:04:54.390> finished<00:04:54.750> up<00:04:54.930> as<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.410> kind<00:04:55.590> of<00:04:55.680> just

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
to be finished up as it kind of just

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.040 
to be finished up as it kind of just
happens<00:04:56.400> but<00:04:56.940> once<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.210> do<00:04:57.270> realize<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:57.780> the

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
happens but once I do realize that the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.780 
happens but once I do realize that the
finishing<00:04:58.320> phase<00:04:58.560> is<00:04:58.800> coming<00:04:59.100> up<00:04:59.250> nothing

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
finishing phase is coming up nothing

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.730 
finishing phase is coming up nothing
beats<00:04:59.970> that<00:05:00.120> sense<00:05:00.450> of<00:05:00.600> accomplishment<00:05:00.840> so

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
beats that sense of accomplishment so

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.040 
beats that sense of accomplishment so
