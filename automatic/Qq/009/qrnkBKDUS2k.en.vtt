00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.950
 hello friends I already have here what is the 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.460
 ingredients for green sauce for 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.040
 the tamales then I need tomato 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.259
 green tree chile 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.919
 I prefer this one because it 's more spicy 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:29.020
 it can also be serrano or jalapeño 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:31.480
 I like children I have onions 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.700
 and I have some ground bread in case it's 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.240
 necessary to express the sauce a bit 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.540
 and I have the chicken broth or broth 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:45.370
 chicken I have it hot it's almost 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:48.059
 boiling because this sauce has not 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.970
 six sauces that remain as sour 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.290
 sweet or bitter to me usually to 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.590
 sometimes I get sour if you are today I am going to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.060
 experiment with you I will practice 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.550
 because I've heard that for a 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.580
 Green sauce is good with elton 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.649
 do it with the raw tomato and with water 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.020
 boiling or in this case I'm going to do it 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.869
 I will replace it with good broth 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.630
 we start by grinding garlic the same 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.990
 Onion and a little oregano do not 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.860
 here with a little oregano we grind it and 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.840
 I'm going to reserve it and I'm going to grind everything 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.659
 this together 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.909
 with the field look at another way is that 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.939
 you can also do this 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.439
 I had my broth here boiling then 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:45.530
 just blanch the tomatoes and 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.530
 let them leave them there for 58 euros 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.090
 grab me a more intense color that's 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.190
 how to bleach and then we are going to cover 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.680
 to cover the pot but without fire and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.140
 then we pass them to grind is another 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.710
 way that we can do I have everything 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.740
 ground garlic onion oregano 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.200
 tomato chile I forgot to say sorry 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.300
 they do many things there are some 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.739
 coriander twigs for flavor are 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.150
 also grind here in the tomato and the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.820
 chile and I already have here I feel with a 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.910
 little oil forgiving a little in 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.910
 shape 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:31.870
 and I'm going to add 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.870
 he also added 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.430
 I do it like that the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.880
 the recipe of mole not the mole do not sting 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.770
 the nothing 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.710
 and then always when I do the 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.130
 tamales I try to make different 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.610
 variables have the option of the mole that 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.190
 The tomato that is regular and 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.980
 the rajas is like this they will be peak if 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.450
 you are more spicy and so what sweet 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.150
 for children or for the big ones 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.510
 also that we like 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.799
 let's leave here to boil and we're going 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.349
 to season with salt and pepper forgiveness in 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.620
 Once I'm safe, I'm going to use consommé consommé 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.099
 chicken powder here already passed as 5 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.010
 minutes the sauces are boiling 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.099
 so here I have the ground bread if the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.220
 I need to thicken because it is very watery 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.380
 and why 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.240
 this flight for the formal ones and so that 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.960
 do not quit, it's better to be a little 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.840
 thick 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.630
 here I have bread ground as I said with 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.760
 a little broth and I finished my sauce 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.790
 green is already ready and the species well 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:54.680
 it is already with the perfect consistency 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.380
 for heels need I do not know 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.400
 because I have left so my blender is not 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.840
 so nice very well then that's why 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.870
 that you see the subject a bit but you do not know 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.940
 worry about you just liquify lists 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.340
 well, well, I'm going to start doing 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.530
 the tamales of green I already have here my 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.359
 green sauce as they see if they feel that it is 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.880
 very thick that they were expressed a day 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.370
 for another one, just a little 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.530
 of broth a little water and if it does 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.740
 lack of salt to the ché here I have a little 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.040
 from creator I have the meat that they see 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.620
 I kept on challenges and all the rejection of 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.889
 I saved all the bones because the 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.610
 I'm going to use and I have my mom first I'm going to 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.910
 start by cleaning the leaves the side that 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.400
 I already remember that it makes them that I'm going to 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.250
 use is the most opaque side the beautiful side 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.220
 quoted I'm going to leave the other side good 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.340
 this is a way of doing them with the 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.889
 broth was put together like this and this is going to 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.590
 help the dough slide, this is a 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.410
 way so that they are well delgaditos and 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.230
 just play the mass just play the and 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.300
 spread throughout the city 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.720
 of your sheet it does not matter if you smear 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.120
 the rest 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.370
 how it's going to be used and this is a 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.810
 way that will fit well 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.810
 delgadito its size 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.730
 and we put the meat 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.930
 I like to put a little bone and 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.330
 a little meat 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.840
 If you have already seen the recipe for tamales de 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.580
 mole there comes is the same and from 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.830
 preference one tablespoon of these 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.310
 those we use for food double 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.310
 towards here 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.350
 and this is here 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.090
 and try to bend them like that not so 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.000
 strong do not push because you can 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.360
 break and they already raise them forming here 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.360
 the doubles 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.400
 and here as well and they have their table 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.400
 was explaining the other way of being able 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.200
 do the channel is only grab one 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.200
 apple ball put here 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.050
 and with him 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.880
 I need it more 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.740
 and in extending more to the edges because they 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.710
 will be more skinny but will 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.030
 stay this way and then nothing 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:35.420
 more the medium meat 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.420
 another sauce and we doubled again 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.889
 and well, it's on some sheet 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:46.729
 broken if it were so can 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:50.319
 put a leaf of those that have a 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.319
 leftover and over rings
