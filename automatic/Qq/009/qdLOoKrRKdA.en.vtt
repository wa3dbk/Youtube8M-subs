they seem kind of pointless because

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.790

them<00:03:28.209> then<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.380> Wi-Fi<00:03:30.040> antenna<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:31.180> actually

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
them then the Wi-Fi antenna is actually

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.760 
them then the Wi-Fi antenna is actually
attached<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.020> back<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.500> motherboard

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
attached to the back of the motherboard

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.690 
attached to the back of the motherboard
unclip<00:03:33.550> that<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.650> motherboard<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.370> free

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
unclip that and the motherboard is free

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.900 
unclip that and the motherboard is free
to<00:03:36.850> go

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
to go

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.370

see<00:03:39.910> both<00:03:40.120> sides<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:40.630> there<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.080> then<00:03:41.260> the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
see both sides of it there and then the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.050 
see both sides of it there and then the
Wi-Fi<00:03:41.739> antenna<00:03:42.100> is<00:03:42.220> what<00:03:42.370> I'm<00:03:42.459> removing<00:03:42.730> right

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060
