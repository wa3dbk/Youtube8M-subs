00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.949
 Wuppertal will be able to lead by teams 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 called the total Francis of Germany 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.550
 at the same time, they are not so wrong because at last it is in the American 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.170
 city 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.380
 it goes in Wuppertal 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 and downhill 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.730
 of course also criss-cross with the famous Wuppertal 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.790
 monorail 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.500
 But that's another topic 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 if you're going to San Francisco 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.990
 for similar warning systems were used here as virtue of an emergency 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 born 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.020
 Wuppertal's Bormann 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.840
 it was a mountain 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 1894 saw the electric light of the world 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 and Mrs. Merkel is inaugurated 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.060
 it was on a distance of 1 point six kilometers 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.610
 Heimann Munich 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.320
 of 169 uniform can with a maximum slope 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 at 18 come 5 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.340
 as they rise 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.740
 with the team of engineer-so-called speechless 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.520
 the partition Spahn 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.870
 was not possible 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.600
 another solution had to be sought 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.670
 for a discussion stood next to a rack railway 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.760
 not yet with what causes induced stem cells 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.159
 finally one decided for one of the company Siemens &amp; Halske 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.189
 proposed two-track system without soft 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.950
 without switches 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.950
 also did not need to avoid the tracks 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.969
 that then possible of a regular timetable unguarded 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:12.659
 times 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.739
 because of missing evasive maneuvers 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.869
 and consistently replace at both ends 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.869
 there was time to ask workbench Schlie 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.269
 but now away from the areas to the hard facts about the accidents 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.079
 they existed during the entire 65-year life of the railway 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.259
 only with the 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.129
 as it is called in the history books 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.129
 motorized private transport 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.590
 given individuals in the mountain 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.949
 Bahn prevented four independent braking systems 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.329
 Damage to the car itself during the entire service life 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.819
 fear her pension 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.979
 there were the two bullets on the platform down to the valley 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.340
 a calming 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.340
 because of authorization 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.639
 Electricity should power the train 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.649
 which was it oh yes direct current 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:23.169
 The thus on the first electric railway of Germany on a lease 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.989
 Track moving car 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.010
 On the descent, they even fed electricity back into the grid 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.499
 Motors act as generators 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.599
 this stream 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.119
 but had to be picked up by a train traveling uphill 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.049
 in this way could 50 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.269
 Percent of energy for the 12 to 15 minute drive 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.709
 be saved 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.119
 a highly modern process for the time 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.369
 from the even closer gates around 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.399
 Generations should speak 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.069
 a Wuppertaler of the older generation Klaus Kathan 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.759
 also his memories of the construction workers 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:08.579
 realized in a lovingly built model in scale 1 to 87 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.859
 the role model 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.800
 65 years ago to the delight of the Wuppertal and many visitors of the 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.710
 Bottom station sticks 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.689
 up to killing 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.610
 which is still in the midst of a civilian force today 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.599
 vain 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:33.599
 and sadly waiting for her 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.419
 all this technical innovation the security 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.969
 the nostalgia and DVD over the counter 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.249
 could despite massive protests from the population 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:49.590
 so as not to prevent 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.150
 this is a little far-sighted and unreasonable city administration 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.569
 on 15th of June 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.959
 1959 shut down the workbench 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.569
 and the year after that did with her what she did best 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.389
 to produce 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.710
 Today you would like to reopen the line 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.249
 but unfortunately that's just a dream 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.460
 Do not go Klaus Kotter 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.039
 in his hotel 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.030
 realized
