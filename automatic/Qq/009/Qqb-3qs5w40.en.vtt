on<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:39.980> side<00:02:40.220> turns<00:02:41.030> bright<00:02:41.570> yellow<00:02:41.989> when<00:02:42.890> it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
on the side turns bright yellow when it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.030 
on the side turns bright yellow when it
gets<00:02:43.190> hot<00:02:44.110> telling<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.290> when<00:02:45.680> you're<00:02:45.860> done

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
gets hot telling you when you're done

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.039 
gets hot telling you when you're done
cooking<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.880> boils<00:02:47.060> two<00:02:47.450> cups<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.810> water

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
cooking I and it boils two cups of water

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.080 
cooking I and it boils two cups of water
i<00:02:48.170> think<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.799> two<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.280> half<00:02:49.430> three<00:02:49.670> minutes

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
i think in two and a half three minutes

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.660 
i think in two and a half three minutes
something<00:02:50.269> like<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.840> okay<00:02:51.709> that's<00:02:52.489> one

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
something like that okay that's one

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.569 
something like that okay that's one
cooking<00:02:53.000> system<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:55.310> next<00:02:55.640> one<00:02:57.579> I'll

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
cooking system the next one I'll

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.770 
cooking system the next one I'll
stainless<00:02:59.180> steel<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.450> have<00:02:59.780> my<00:02:59.930> GSR<00:03:00.470> coffee<00:03:00.769> cup

buy this folks you get this cleared

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.069 
buy this folks you get this cleared
before<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:13.100> see<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:13.370> there<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.030> two<00:03:14.660> coffee

cups the coffee cups are insulated they

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.160 
cups the coffee cups are insulated they
don't<00:03:17.570> hold<00:03:17.720> very<00:03:17.959> much<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.840> kind<00:03:21.079> of

don't hold very much and the kind of
freaking<00:03:21.530> heavy<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:23.650> way<00:03:24.650> i<00:03:24.680> went<00:03:25.070> with

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
freaking heavy so a way i went with

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.880 
freaking heavy so a way i went with
those<00:03:25.400> their<00:03:26.180> their<00:03:26.540> history<00:03:26.930> they<00:03:27.620> don't

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
those their their history they don't

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.180 
those their their history they don't
come<00:03:28.130> with<00:03:28.160> right<00:03:28.940> okay

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
come with right okay

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.980 
come with right okay
arm<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:32.170> handle<00:03:34.260> flips<00:03:35.260> over<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.840> is

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
arm the handle flips over and this is

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.490 
arm the handle flips over and this is
the<00:03:38.140> way<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.320> rocket<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:43.150> happens<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.720> be<00:03:43.840> just

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
the way I rocket this happens to be just

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.670 
the way I rocket this happens to be just
what<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.710> brought<00:03:45.040> with<00:03:45.250> me<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
what I brought with me this is the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.040 
what I brought with me this is the
knockoff<00:03:48.100> of<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.430> pocket<00:03:48.790> rocket<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.390> think

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
knockoff of the pocket rocket I think

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.600 
knockoff of the pocket rocket I think
the<00:03:50.140> pocket<00:03:50.500> rocket<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.920> made<00:03:51.780> sturdier<00:03:53.610> is

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
the pocket rocket is made sturdier is

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.150 
the pocket rocket is made sturdier is
liable<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.300> work<00:03:55.510> longer<00:03:55.870> but<00:03:56.350> this<00:03:56.620> one<00:03:56.860> for

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
liable to work longer but this one for

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.500 
liable to work longer but this one for
all<00:03:58.290> honesty<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.500> working<00:03:59.860> fine<00:04:00.070> right<00:04:00.370> now

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
all honesty is working fine right now

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:10.470 
all honesty is working fine right now
okay<00:04:02.520> you<00:04:03.520> open<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.760> only<00:04:10.210> difference

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
okay you open this the only difference

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.229 
okay you open this the only difference
is<00:04:10.870> with<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.470> pocket<00:04:11.800> rocket<00:04:13.800> you<00:04:14.800> need<00:04:14.980> a

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
is with the pocket rocket you need a

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.180 
is with the pocket rocket you need a
spark<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.390> some<00:04:16.660> kind<00:04:16.900> or<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.410> lighter<00:04:17.920> or<00:04:18.040> a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
spark of some kind or a lighter or a

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.250 
spark of some kind or a lighter or a
match<00:04:18.400> or<00:04:18.549> something<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:19.000> ignite<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.480> this<00:04:19.989> has

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
match or something to ignite it this has

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.830 
match or something to ignite it this has
one<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.620> those<00:04:21.150> don't<00:04:22.150> need<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.420> know<00:04:22.570> what<00:04:22.750> you

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
one of those don't need to know what you

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.760 
one of those don't need to know what you
call<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.050> but<00:04:23.170> in<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.560> igniter<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:29.500> push

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
call it but in the igniter and you push

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.670 
call it but in the igniter and you push
the<00:04:29.980> thingy<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:31.630> its<00:04:32.110> parks<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:35.470> actually

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
the thingy and its parks and it actually

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.390 
the thingy and its parks and it actually
works<00:04:37.020> now<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:39.550> big<00:04:39.850> difference<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:42.160> is

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
works now the big difference this is

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.960 
works now the big difference this is
bigger<00:04:43.350> not<00:04:44.350> really<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.950> much<00:04:45.190> heavier<00:04:45.640> but

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
bigger not really that much heavier but

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.840 
bigger not really that much heavier but
it's<00:04:46.150> bigger<00:04:46.419> okay<00:04:47.410> this<00:04:48.250> one's<00:04:48.520> smaller

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
it's bigger okay this one's smaller

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:57.590 
it's bigger okay this one's smaller
about<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.630> same<00:04:49.870> weight<00:04:54.600> it's<00:04:55.600> smaller<00:04:56.020> and

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
about the same weight it's smaller and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.850 
about the same weight it's smaller and
the<00:04:58.600> main<00:04:58.810> difference<00:04:59.290> that<00:04:59.440> you're<00:04:59.590> going<00:04:59.770> to

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
the main difference that you're going to

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:08.370 
the main difference that you're going to
see<00:05:00.070> what<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.520> see<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:05.190> this<00:05:06.810> burns<00:05:07.810> 10

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
see what I see is that this burns 10

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.130 
see what I see is that this burns 10
times<00:05:08.710> the<00:05:08.980> fuel<00:05:09.310> what<00:05:09.640> the<00:05:09.850> jetboil<00:05:10.330> does<00:05:10.570> the

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
times the fuel what the jetboil does the

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.340 
times the fuel what the jetboil does the
jetboil<00:05:11.590> seems<00:05:11.919> to<00:05:12.250> seriously<00:05:13.350> seriously

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
jetboil seems to seriously seriously

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.450 
jetboil seems to seriously seriously
seriously<00:05:16.260> conserve<00:05:17.260> on<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.620> fuel<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:18.220> lasts

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
seriously conserve on the fuel it lasts

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.760 
seriously conserve on the fuel it lasts
10<00:05:18.700> times<00:05:18.910> longer<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.390> let's<00:05:19.540> no<00:05:19.770> real

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
10 times longer and let's no real

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.970 
10 times longer and let's no real
exaggeration<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:23.050> will<00:05:23.260> burn<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.590> up<00:05:23.680> in<00:05:23.860> no

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
exaggeration this will burn it up in no

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.680 
exaggeration this will burn it up in no
time<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.520> as<00:05:25.240> well<00:05:25.480> as<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.780> pocket<00:05:26.140> rocket<00:05:26.290> so

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
time and as well as the pocket rocket so
