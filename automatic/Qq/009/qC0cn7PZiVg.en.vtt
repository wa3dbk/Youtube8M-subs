this slide out we make it a little bit
further<00:02:18.090> start<00:02:19.090> here<00:02:19.420> here's<00:02:20.230> your<00:02:20.320> sewer<00:02:20.650> is

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
further start here here's your sewer is

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.030 
further start here here's your sewer is
Montana<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.380> happens<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.709> have<00:02:23.770> that

huge deal there you got a valve right
here<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.670> make<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.030> seek<00:02:28.239> reach<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.750> valve

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
here we make it seek reach that valve

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.350 
here we make it seek reach that valve
you<00:02:30.070> zip<00:02:30.280> it<00:02:30.310> right<00:02:30.610> back<00:02:30.760> up<00:02:30.970> around<00:02:31.270> your

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
you zip it right back up around your

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.780 
you zip it right back up around your
steward<00:02:31.690> get<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.959> good<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.140> tight<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:33.640> going

to let the cold in there it'll keep the

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.860 
to let the cold in there it'll keep the
warm<00:02:35.590> air<00:02:35.770> inside<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:37.270> curl<00:02:37.480> under<00:02:37.660> there

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870

warm air inside I can curl under there
right<00:02:38.020> now<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.320> probably<00:02:38.560> about<00:02:38.650> 70<00:02:39.070> degrees

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100

not to get the turn buttons we're all
your<00:02:45.880> pieces<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:47.410> won't<00:02:47.709> do<00:02:47.890> that<00:02:47.920> if<00:02:48.190> we

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
your pieces are we won't do that if we

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.440 
your pieces are we won't do that if we

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
can help it look how fast those turn

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360 
can help it look how fast those turn
buttons<00:02:52.750> go<00:02:52.840> on<00:02:53.049> and<00:02:53.200> off<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.709> can<00:02:54.100> take<00:02:54.250> this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
buttons go on and off I can take this

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.789
