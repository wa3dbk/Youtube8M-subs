go ahead and extract it because it's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.920 
go ahead and extract it because it's
going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> be<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> zip<00:00:23.820> folder<00:00:23.970> once<00:00:24.779> you've

going to be in a zip folder once you've

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.640 
going to be in a zip folder once you've
extracted<00:00:25.050> you'll<00:00:25.830> get<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> folder<00:00:26.369> called<00:00:27.650> SCP

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
extracted you'll get a folder called SCP

check this box so you can install the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.369 
check this box so you can install the
boots<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> driver<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.840> should<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.079> checked

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
boots of driver it should be checked

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
boots of driver it should be checked
automatically<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.219> i<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.640> i<00:00:53.699> accidentally

unchecked it when i open it up if you're

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
unchecked it when i open it up if you're
using<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.260> by<00:00:58.410> USB<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:59.370> ahead<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.699> uncheck

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
using it by USB go ahead and uncheck

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.700 
using it by USB go ahead and uncheck
that<00:01:00.329> box<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.930> make<00:01:01.020> sure<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.379> unchecked

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.020 
to useless except for the ps3 controller
so<00:01:49.890> that's<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.250> warning<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> guys

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
so that's a little warning for you guys

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.520 
so that's a little warning for you guys
so<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.600> why<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so that's why I kind of think it's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.380 
so that's why I kind of think it's
better<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:53.009> USB<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.030> use<00:01:54.180> blue

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
better to do USB because if you use blue

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.389 
better to do USB because if you use blue
to<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:54.899> bluetooth<00:01:55.530> dongle<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.070> rendered

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
to your bluetooth dongle we rendered

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.420 
to your bluetooth dongle we rendered
these<00:01:56.579> lists<00:01:56.969> only<00:01:57.090> except<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.430> ps3

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
these lists only except for the ps3

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.410 
these lists only except for the ps3
controller<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.880> appreciate<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.270> can

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
uninstall a bluetooth driver and then

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.459 
uninstall a bluetooth driver and then
the<00:02:01.920> dongle<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.520> ok<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.509> using<00:02:03.990> every

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the dongle will be ok for using every

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.510 
the dongle will be ok for using every
other

driver<00:02:12.550> messed<00:02:12.850> up<00:02:13.000> your<00:02:13.090> bluetooth<00:02:13.590> dongle

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
driver messed up your bluetooth dongle

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.730 
driver messed up your bluetooth dongle
it's<00:02:14.800> just<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.610> makes<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.620> dedicated<00:02:17.620> for

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740

it's just that it makes it dedicated for
the<00:02:17.800> piece<00:02:17.950> of<00:02:18.070> control<00:02:18.340> only<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.820> nothing

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
the piece of control only and nothing

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.050 
the piece of control only and nothing
else<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:20.230> with<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.470> said<00:02:20.860> go<00:02:21.430> ahead<00:02:21.610> and

example only the X button which detects
a<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.239> I'm<00:03:34.540> only<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.870> circle<00:03:35.200> button<00:03:35.290> which

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
a is a I'm only the circle button which

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.470 
a is a I'm only the circle button which
is<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.709> Texas<00:03:36.070> be<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:37.390> forth

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
is the Texas be and so on and so forth

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.000 
is the Texas be and so on and so forth
so<00:03:37.989> just<00:03:38.170> make<00:03:38.290> sure<00:03:38.320> all<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.650> buttons<00:03:38.920> are

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
so just make sure all the buttons are

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.710 
so just make sure all the buttons are
working<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.550> everything<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:40.420> good<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.600> go

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
working and everything is good to go

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.009 
working and everything is good to go
once<00:03:41.530> you've<00:03:42.130> done<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.400> then<00:03:42.930> you're<00:03:43.930> pretty

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
once you've done that then you're pretty

once you've done that then you're pretty
