want to have dreams like that hey Jim
can<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.670> teach<00:01:18.000> me<00:01:18.030> how<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.510> these<00:01:18.690> sure

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
can you teach me how to make these sure

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
can you teach me how to make these sure
if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.100> hey<00:01:20.369> both<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.090> guys<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.510> weird

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
if you want hey both you guys have weird

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:32.130 
if you want hey both you guys have weird
dreams<00:01:21.810> too<00:01:22.320> ah

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.980 

the<00:01:33.100> Kimura<00:01:33.520> section<00:01:34.150> usually<00:01:34.360> becomes

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
the Kimura section usually becomes

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.710 
the Kimura section usually becomes
isolated<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.800> it's<00:01:36.460> expelled<00:01:36.940> as<00:01:37.180> an<00:01:37.330> intron

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
isolated and it's expelled as an intron

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.170 
isolated and it's expelled as an intron
during<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.050> process<00:01:38.440> of<00:01:38.560> splicing<00:01:38.830> so<00:01:39.670> we

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
during the process of splicing so we

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.020 
during the process of splicing so we
used<00:01:40.420> synapse<00:01:41.200> inhibiting<00:01:41.830> antibiotics<00:01:42.729> to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
used synapse inhibiting antibiotics to

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.330 
used synapse inhibiting antibiotics to
try<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.300> avoid<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.780> expulsion<00:01:44.229> prior<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:45.220> the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
try to avoid the expulsion prior to the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.570 
try to avoid the expulsion prior to the
splicing<00:01:46.380> however<00:01:47.380> all<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.830> experiments

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
splicing however all the experiments

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.230 
splicing however all the experiments
conducted<00:01:48.820> at<00:01:49.270> White<00:01:49.509> House<00:01:49.750> have<00:01:50.110> failed<00:01:51.240> yes

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
conducted at White House have failed yes

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.109 
conducted at White House have failed yes
in<00:01:53.229> her<00:01:53.530> case<00:01:53.740> we<00:01:54.070> have<00:01:54.220> confirmed<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.820> she

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
in her case we have confirmed that she

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.990 
in her case we have confirmed that she
carries<00:01:55.479> 23<00:01:56.050> palindrome<00:01:56.619> so<00:01:56.860> I'm<00:01:57.550> sure<00:01:57.790> we'll

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
carries 23 palindrome so I'm sure we'll

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.940 
carries 23 palindrome so I'm sure we'll
be<00:01:58.030> able<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.450> collect<00:01:58.900> quite<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.320> bit<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.680> data

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
be able to collect quite a bit of data

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.740 
be able to collect quite a bit of data
from<00:02:00.369> her<00:02:02.159> yes<00:02:03.159> we<00:02:03.790> are<00:02:03.880> now<00:02:04.030> proceeding<00:02:04.270> with

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
from her yes we are now proceeding with

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.480 
from her yes we are now proceeding with
the<00:02:04.780> preparations<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.830> transgenic

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the preparations of the transgenic

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.070 
the preparations of the transgenic
samples<00:02:06.970> with<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.270> use<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.450> surrogate

samples with the use of surrogate

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.520 
samples with the use of surrogate
mothers<00:02:08.550> you'll<00:02:09.550> be<00:02:09.700> paid<00:02:09.940> later<00:02:10.179> I've<00:02:11.140> heard

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
mothers you'll be paid later I've heard

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.370 
mothers you'll be paid later I've heard

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that you've sent us someone superior

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.600 
that you've sent us someone superior
thank<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.560> goodbye

so our general yah goon wishes to take

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.640 
so our general yah goon wishes to take
over<00:02:20.490> Galileo's<00:02:21.090> position<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.320> some

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
over Galileo's position just like some

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:46.930 
over Galileo's position just like some
silly<00:02:22.920> schoolyard<00:02:23.520> brawl

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
me too your Grandpa's just hiding

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.910 
me too your Grandpa's just hiding
somewhere<00:04:16.519> cause<00:04:16.730> of<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.910> cold<00:04:17.120> weather

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
somewhere cause of the cold weather

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.650 
somewhere cause of the cold weather
maybe<00:04:18.920> you'll<00:04:19.220> come<00:04:19.459> back<00:04:19.670> once<00:04:20.000> it's<00:04:20.209> warmer

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
maybe you'll come back once it's warmer

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.820 
maybe you'll come back once it's warmer
outside

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.300 

I<00:04:29.050> was<00:04:30.050> afraid<00:04:30.289> that<00:04:30.409> things<00:04:30.770> might<00:04:31.039> turn<00:04:31.099> out

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
I was afraid that things might turn out

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.040 
I was afraid that things might turn out
