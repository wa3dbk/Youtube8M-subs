glitches<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:11.880> offer<00:00:12.030> just<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.630> much<00:00:12.840> if<00:00:13.049> not

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
glitches can offer just as much if not

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.799 
glitches can offer just as much if not
more<00:00:13.290> entertainment<00:00:14.190> than<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> game<00:00:14.730> itself

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
more entertainment than the game itself

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.090 
more entertainment than the game itself
now<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.170> usually<00:00:16.500> where<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.859> say

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
now this is usually where I say

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.620 
now this is usually where I say
something<00:00:17.130> about<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.640> countdown<00:00:18.090> but<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.480> date

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
something about a countdown but to date

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.300 
something about a countdown but to date
it's<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> little<00:00:19.500> bit<00:00:19.650> different

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it's a little bit different

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.450 
it's a little bit different
why<00:00:20.789> well<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> forest<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.160> steam

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
why well this is the forest it's a steam

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.160 
why well this is the forest it's a steam
game<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.060> an<00:00:24.150> alpha<00:00:25.910> 0.01<00:00:26.910> B<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.900> wouldn't

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
game that is an alpha 0.01 B so wouldn't

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.810 
game that is an alpha 0.01 B so wouldn't
be<00:00:28.199> fair<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> countdown<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> because

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
be fair to do a countdown on it because

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.209 
be fair to do a countdown on it because
it's<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.119> such<00:00:30.420> early<00:00:30.570> development<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.949> game

it's in such early development this game

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.979 
it's in such early development this game
is<00:00:32.399> actually<00:00:32.579> still<00:00:33.059> pretty<00:00:33.300> fun<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:33.780> you'd

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
is actually still pretty fun if you'd

the<00:00:45.480> good<00:00:45.629> part<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.950> glitches<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.460> games

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
the good part so glitches in games

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.350 
the good part so glitches in games
sometimes<00:00:48.989> they're<00:00:49.559> enjoyable<00:00:50.360> sometimes

sometimes they're enjoyable sometimes

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
sometimes they're enjoyable sometimes
they're<00:00:51.899> even<00:00:52.140> helpful<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.340> other<00:00:53.489> times

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
they're even helpful but other times

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.529 
they're even helpful but other times
they<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.809> downright<00:00:59.149> like<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.420> ahead

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539

always do is make sense right I mean who
wouldn't<00:01:25.170> expect<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> throw<00:01:26.070> a

logs fire + shelter equals logs I mean

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.069 
logs fire + shelter equals logs I mean
it's<00:01:33.390> common<00:01:33.630> sense<00:01:34.049> right<00:01:35.869> right

maybe<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:42.570> glitch<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.990> more<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.380> less

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:06.190 
thought honestly most the time I'd have
to<00:01:54.570> say<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.290> tend<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.920> be

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.930 

uncompromising<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.680> doing<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.610> just

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
uncompromising here doing this it's just

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.839 
uncompromising here doing this it's just
a<00:02:09.060> complete<00:02:09.420> waste<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.989> time<00:02:10.050> yet<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.430> some

a complete waste of time yet for some
reason<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.540> can't

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
reason I can't

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.310 
reason I can't
it's<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.370> too<00:02:14.610> entertaining<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:16.110> worry

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
it's just too entertaining don't worry

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.780 
it's just too entertaining don't worry
I've<00:02:16.980> been<00:02:17.040> there<00:02:17.430> too

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
I've been there too
