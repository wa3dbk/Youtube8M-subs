00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.100 
case of a variety of different colors to
match<00:00:35.430> your<00:00:35.489> styles<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.600> whole<00:00:36.750> install

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

step<00:00:39.239> would<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.600> install<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.260> silicon

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
step would be to install the silicon

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.340 
step would be to install the silicon
layer<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.640> once<00:00:41.879> that's<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.719> move<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.140> to

layer now once that's on you move on to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
layer now once that's on you move on to
the<00:00:43.440> polycarbonate<00:00:43.950> frame<00:00:44.430> which<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.760> find<00:00:45.180> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
easy to start by lining the bottom end

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.959 
easy to start by lining the bottom end
of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.640> phone<00:00:47.879> once<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:49.050> set<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.640> move<00:00:50.850> to
