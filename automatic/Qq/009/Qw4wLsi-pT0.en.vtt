and<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:00.900> video<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.230> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.410> answer<00:00:01.469> some

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
and this video I'm going to answer some

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.470 
and this video I'm going to answer some
questions<00:00:01.860> that<00:00:02.460> will<00:00:02.669> hopefully<00:00:02.820> clear<00:00:03.300> up

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
questions that will hopefully clear up

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.720 
questions that will hopefully clear up
some<00:00:03.720> myths<00:00:03.990> or<00:00:04.799> some<00:00:05.160> fogginess

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
some myths or some fogginess

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.629 
some myths or some fogginess
surrounding<00:00:06.470> the<00:00:07.470> whole<00:00:07.799> idea<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.309> taking

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
surrounding the whole idea of taking

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.730 
surrounding the whole idea of taking
tonic<00:00:09.120> herbs<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> form<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.290> extract

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
tonic herbs in the form of an extract

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.879 
tonic herbs in the form of an extract
because<00:00:11.130> there's<00:00:11.700> an<00:00:12.630> idea<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.290> that's<00:00:13.650> out

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
because there's an idea that that's out

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.160 
because there's an idea that that's out
there<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.219> people<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:15.170> somehow

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
there that people have that somehow

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.830 
there that people have that somehow
processing<00:00:17.039> plants<00:00:17.789> or<00:00:17.970> cooking<00:00:18.240> plants<00:00:18.750> or

processing plants or cooking plants or
using<00:00:19.080> some<00:00:19.320> sort<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.619> extraction<00:00:20.250> process<00:00:20.730> is

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
using some sort of extraction process is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.349 
using some sort of extraction process is
harmful<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.949> less<00:00:23.340> than<00:00:23.519> ideal<00:00:23.670> than<00:00:24.119> just

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
harmful and is less than ideal than just

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.210 
harmful and is less than ideal than just
consuming<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> plant<00:00:25.199> raw<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.710> basically<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
consuming the plant raw so basically the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.460 
consuming the plant raw so basically the
belief<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> all<00:00:27.510> plants<00:00:28.080> should<00:00:28.320> be

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
belief is that all plants should be

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
belief is that all plants should be
consumed<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.189> their<00:00:29.340> raw<00:00:29.490> state<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> best

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
consumed in their raw state for the best

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170 
consumed in their raw state for the best
effect<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.099> true<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.399> some<00:00:32.610> cases<00:00:32.850> in

effect now this is true in some cases in
some<00:00:33.210> cases<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:33.989> definitely<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.680> true

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
some cases it's definitely not true

you're eating an orange it's pretty much

that whole paradigm shift out of the way

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.840 
that whole paradigm shift out of the way
the<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.629> thing<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.890> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.339> say<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the first thing that I want to say is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.780 
the first thing that I want to say is
that<00:01:06.350> heat<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.560> cooking<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> tool<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that heat and cooking is a tool of the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.820 
that heat and cooking is a tool of the
technology<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> process<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> has<00:01:10.530> useful

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
technology as a process that has useful

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.940 
technology as a process that has useful
applications<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.939> many<00:01:12.720> different<00:01:13.020> ways<00:01:13.380> but

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
applications in many different ways but

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
applications in many different ways but
to<00:01:14.070> assume<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.729> bad<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to assume that it's bad all the time is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
to assume that it's bad all the time is
somewhat<00:01:16.259> silly<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.150> true

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
somewhat silly and it's not really true

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.300 
somewhat silly and it's not really true
and<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.140> such<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.500> absolute<00:01:20.070> or

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
and to have such from absolute or

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
and to have such from absolute or
either-or<00:01:21.000> kind<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.360> mentality<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.990> limiting

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
either-or kind of mentality is limiting

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.100 
either-or kind of mentality is limiting
and<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> basically<00:01:23.549> hindrance<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.930> first

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and is basically hindrance so the first

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.770 
and is basically hindrance so the first
question<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.210> why<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.689> active<00:01:28.350> constituents

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
question is why are active constituents

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.030 
question is why are active constituents
available<00:01:30.780> through<00:01:31.439> some<00:01:31.799> sort<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
available through some sort of

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.240 
available through some sort of
extraction<00:01:32.640> process<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.680> how<00:01:34.680> does<00:01:34.740> cooking

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
extraction process and how does cooking

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.120 
extraction process and how does cooking
free<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.880> well<00:01:36.600> basically<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.409> example

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
free this up well basically for example

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
free this up well basically for example
things<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.460> reishi<00:01:38.790> mushroom<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.630> things

things like reishi mushroom or things
like<00:01:39.869> ginseng<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:40.710> things<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:42.049> let's<00:01:43.049> say<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
and fibrous you can't really eat that
sure<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.220> take<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.790> powder<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.240> down

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
sure you can take it and powder it down

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.870 
sure you can take it and powder it down
very<00:01:51.659> fine<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.170> physically<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.850> know

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
very fine and physically you know

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.420 
very fine and physically you know
masticate<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.899> swallow<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
masticate it and swallow it but the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.219 
masticate it and swallow it but the
active<00:01:56.850> constituents<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.630> want<00:01:57.899> are<00:01:57.990> so

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
active constituents that we want are so

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.709 
active constituents that we want are so
bound<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.100> cell<00:01:59.430> wall<00:01:59.700> they're<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.479> in

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
bound up in the cell wall they're so in

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
bound up in the cell wall they're so in
such<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> tough<00:02:01.500> fibrous<00:02:02.070> shell<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.700> can't

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
such a tough fibrous shell that we can't

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.340 
such a tough fibrous shell that we can't
really<00:02:03.090> break<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.600> down<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.960> get<00:02:04.079> enough

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
really break that down and get enough

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.319 
really break that down and get enough
out<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.670> need<00:02:05.820> some<00:02:06.060> sort<00:02:06.240> of

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
out of it so we need some sort of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
out of it so we need some sort of
extraction<00:02:06.899> process<00:02:07.320> whether<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> tea<00:02:08.009> or

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
extraction process whether it's a tea or

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.600 
extraction process whether it's a tea or
a<00:02:08.280> tincture<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:09.140> some<00:02:10.140> sort<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.530> more<00:02:10.830> advanced

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
a tincture or some sort of more advanced

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.560 
a tincture or some sort of more advanced
more<00:02:11.730> high<00:02:12.120> potency<00:02:12.810> more<00:02:13.080> effective

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
more high potency more effective

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.910 
more high potency more effective
concentrated<00:02:15.570> extraction<00:02:16.200> process<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.770> can

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
concentrated extraction process that can

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.010 
concentrated extraction process that can
basically<00:02:17.100> take<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.880> whole<00:02:18.270> lot<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.510> herb<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
basically take a whole lot of herb and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.420 
basically take a whole lot of herb and
concentrate<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> down<00:02:19.800> into<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.100> very<00:02:20.280> small

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
concentrate it down into a very small

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.870 
concentrate it down into a very small
amount<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.060> fine<00:02:21.930> easily<00:02:22.890> absorbable<00:02:23.280> easily

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
amount of fine easily absorbable easily

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.030 
amount of fine easily absorbable easily
digestible<00:02:24.450> powder<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.410> having<00:02:25.650> some<00:02:25.800> sort<00:02:25.920> of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
digestible powder so having some sort of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.890 
digestible powder so having some sort of
extraction<00:02:26.580> process<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.000> beneficial<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.720> two

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
extraction process is beneficial in two

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.410 
extraction process is beneficial in two
ways<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.770> one<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.730> allow<00:02:29.940> us<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.180> actually

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
ways for one it can allow us to actually

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.560 
ways for one it can allow us to actually
get<00:02:30.690> access<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.100> active<00:02:32.430> constituents<00:02:32.790> so

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
get access to the active constituents so

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.360 
get access to the active constituents so
that<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.900> actually<00:02:34.080> get<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.710> benefit<00:02:35.160> out

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
that we can actually get the benefit out

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.480 
that we can actually get the benefit out
of<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.640> herb<00:02:35.840> -<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.620> concentrate<00:02:38.100> those

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
of the herb - it can concentrate those

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.460 
of the herb - it can concentrate those
constituents<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.270> such<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> way<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.350> can

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
constituents in such a way that we can

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.930 
constituents in such a way that we can
take<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> small<00:02:41.070> amount<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.550> get<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.730> good

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
take a small amount and get a good

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.760 
take a small amount and get a good
effect<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.140> know<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.350> we<00:02:43.470> don't<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.709> a

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
effect so you know if we don't have a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.440 
effect so you know if we don't have a
concentrated<00:02:44.370> herb<00:02:44.730> where<00:02:45.240> you're<00:02:45.330> gonna

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
concentrated herb where you're gonna

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.490 
concentrated herb where you're gonna
have<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.600> make<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:45.750> tea<00:02:45.990> we're<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.320> make<00:02:46.470> a

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
have to make a tea we're have to make a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.690 
have to make a tea we're have to make a
tincture<00:02:46.800> or<00:02:46.920> if<00:02:47.130> we're<00:02:47.280> gonna<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.670> eat

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
tincture or if we're gonna want to eat

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.460 
tincture or if we're gonna want to eat
it<00:02:47.970> we're<00:02:48.330> gonna<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.630> eat<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> whole<00:02:49.080> bunch

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
it we're gonna have to eat a whole bunch

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.340 
it we're gonna have to eat a whole bunch
just<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.520> get<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.970> effect<00:02:51.360> now<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:52.140> could<00:02:52.290> be

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
just to get the effect now this could be

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.930 
just to get the effect now this could be
a<00:02:52.440> burden<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.980> justice<00:02:53.370> system<00:02:53.700> make<00:02:53.820> it

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
a burden to the justice system make it

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.270 
a burden to the justice system make it
fill<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.120> our<00:02:54.360> belly<00:02:54.570> causing<00:02:55.410> ingestion<00:02:55.770> all

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
fill up our belly causing ingestion all

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.460 
fill up our belly causing ingestion all
these<00:02:56.520> different<00:02:56.850> things<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> most<00:02:58.200> ideal

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
these different things so the most ideal

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.490 
these different things so the most ideal
way<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.220> basically<00:02:59.810> get<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.290> goodies

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
way is to basically get all the goodies

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.020 
way is to basically get all the goodies
out<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.070> there's<00:03:02.670> some<00:03:02.820> sort<00:03:02.970> of

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
out of it there's some sort of

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.690 
out of it there's some sort of
extraction<00:03:03.600> process<00:03:04.080> separate<00:03:04.980> all<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.489> you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
extraction process separate all the you

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.600 
extraction process separate all the you
know<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.380> chitin<00:03:07.680> or<00:03:08.070> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
know just this the the chitin or the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.340 
know just this the the chitin or the
cellulose<00:03:09.120> or<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.660> fiber<00:03:09.900> that's<00:03:10.170> going

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
cellulose or all the fiber that's going

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.750 
cellulose or all the fiber that's going
to<00:03:10.410> basically<00:03:10.620> get<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.070> way<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.489> impede

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
to basically get in the way and impede

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.820 
to basically get in the way and impede
the<00:03:11.880> process<00:03:12.140> separate<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.290> off<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:13.620> we're

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
the process separate that off so we're

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.370 
the process separate that off so we're
left<00:03:14.010> with<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> very<00:03:14.310> fine<00:03:15.080> product<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.260> can

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
left with a very fine product that can

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.949 
left with a very fine product that can
allow<00:03:16.620> us<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.830> one<00:03:17.239> experience<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.420> benefits

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
allow us to one experience the benefits

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.870 
allow us to one experience the benefits
in<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.320> magic<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.160> herb<00:03:20.340> has<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.760> offer

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
in the magic that this herb has to offer

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.600 
in the magic that this herb has to offer
in<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.600> small<00:03:21.870> space<00:03:22.170> at<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> great<00:03:22.799> price<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.400> a

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
in a small space at a great price in a

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.949 
in a small space at a great price in a
way<00:03:23.760> that's<00:03:23.970> actually<00:03:24.239> going<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.420> allow<00:03:24.690> us<00:03:24.930> to

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
way that's actually going to allow us to

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.680 
way that's actually going to allow us to
get<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.440> effect<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:26.400> we're<00:03:26.549> after<00:03:26.880> which<00:03:27.450> is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
get the effect that we're after which is

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.390 
get the effect that we're after which is
the<00:03:27.870> whole<00:03:28.049> point<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.950> whole<00:03:29.100> point<00:03:29.340> of

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
the whole point the whole point of

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.580 
the whole point the whole point of
taking<00:03:29.580> herbs<00:03:29.880> isn't<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.450> practice<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.140> Dogma

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
taking herbs isn't to practice a Dogma

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.560 
taking herbs isn't to practice a Dogma
and<00:03:31.769> practice<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.400> belief<00:03:32.610> it's<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.239> get<00:03:33.420> the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
and practice and belief it's to get the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.900 
and practice and belief it's to get the
effect<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.350> herb<00:03:34.470> has<00:03:34.799> now<00:03:35.430> if<00:03:35.730> there's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
effect that the herb has now if there's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.250 
effect that the herb has now if there's
one<00:03:36.180> path<00:03:36.390> that's<00:03:36.690> going<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.900> get<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.080> better

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
one path that's going to get the better

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.810 
one path that's going to get the better
result<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.950> makes<00:03:38.130> more<00:03:38.340> sense<00:03:38.400> that's

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
result and it makes more sense that's

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.670 
result and it makes more sense that's
more<00:03:39.030> economical<00:03:39.570> it's<00:03:39.690> more<00:03:39.870> efficient<00:03:40.230> then

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
more economical it's more efficient then

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.870 
more economical it's more efficient then
we<00:03:40.739> need<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.950> take<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.830> second<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.489> is

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
we need to take that so the second is is

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.870 
we need to take that so the second is is
or<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:46.019> guess<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.260> third<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.799> consuming<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.640> raw

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
or I guess the third is consuming a raw

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.420 
or I guess the third is consuming a raw
herb<00:03:48.180> or<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.600> raw<00:03:49.170> root<00:03:49.470> or<00:03:49.739> raw<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.340> know

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
herb or a raw root or raw you know

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.729 
herb or a raw root or raw you know
mushroom<00:03:50.910> basically<00:03:51.630> pointless<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
mushroom basically pointless and the

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.740 
mushroom basically pointless and the
answer<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.130> most<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.610> time<00:03:53.820> yes<00:03:54.090> now

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
answer is most the time yes now

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.259 
answer is most the time yes now
obviously<00:03:55.380> there<00:03:55.680> are<00:03:55.769> some<00:03:56.209> exceptions<00:03:57.209> to

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
obviously there are some exceptions to

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.090 
obviously there are some exceptions to
