00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.370
 it is a small sensation what 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.740
 sondengänger in the southern 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.360
 front Palatinate probably illegal days 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.950
 and promoted by the 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.810
 Directorate-General cultural heritage 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.000
 Rhineland-Palatinate on Tuesday morning

 first presented to the public 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.980
 has been 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.560
 we have the fifth 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.860
 Century communicates the inventory 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.120
 a very high princely official 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.680
 Directory of folding chair sign is 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.810
 the denglish but also the gold 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.000
 Application of the robe all in 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.739
 to stand in that context and in the context of 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.359
 what we have seen so far from media 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.489
 belong to Germanic area 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.530
 speaks in the field of disabled people 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.609
 the in this room also in this time 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.280
 yes were on the way 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.469
 the fund opens up the archaeologist 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.179
 the time of the migrations in the late 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.949
 roman emperor rich the big one 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.140
 silver bowl the ours we make 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.089
 You can clearly see Eastern Europe 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.330
 sort hungary direction there is 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.800
 Comparable pieces in gold and the big one 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.720
 parts that have been said that is 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.400
 clearly late antiquity so that they are things 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.290
 where you can assign 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.690
 that the big silver plate in three 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.430
 Pieces is part of that speaks 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.680
 it is in the fund to prey of 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.720
 they could have acted barbarously 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.170
 Were not only worth the material though 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.060
 an art object in itself interested 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.360
 robbery and robbery rey ​​back then and today 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.470
 are from legal and archeology 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.860
 historical consideration a problem 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.650
 because by robbing hour also robs 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.450
 a piece far away from their base 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.580
 be and then only hard it 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.560
 to reconstruct certain things for 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.930
 The archaeologists are both the bunch 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.940
 also the place where the finds 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.310
 take place of great importance 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.480
 easy to understand in a concrete case 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.490
 we have many robes 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 Applications will be at one 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.190
 magnificent coat on one 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.240
 probably been garment 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.680
 was the garment itself too 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.090
 there and he should like it has not 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.950
 recognized and it is lost and 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.980
 destroyed and we only have without 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.200
 Link the precious metal pieces each 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.420
 archaeological finds can be found in posterity 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.950
 context of the fund 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.290
 develop such as the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.060
 silver bowl with semi-precious stones man 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.709
 can see that the shell is not turned 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060
 So it's made on a lathe 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.010
 but she is driven out 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.430
 silver that's technically what 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.020
 which rather us in the Germanic space 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.370
 On the other hand, she is from 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.110
 appearance forth oriented to 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.090
 Imperial Roman art from Byzantium 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.980
 from above in time that means here 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.420
 was someone from the germanic area of ​​the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.610
 something imperial Roman 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.010
 has reworked several times mentioned the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.260
 By the way, folding chair is currently only available 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.390
 from parts here the figurative 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.920
 But he probably can 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.920
 completely restored
