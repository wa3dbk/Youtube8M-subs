Stage one of the process one raw egg in

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.830 
Stage one of the process one raw egg in
one<00:00:06.390> cup<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> vinegar<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:09.090> egg<00:00:09.300> starts<00:00:09.599> to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
one cup of vinegar the egg starts to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.650 
one cup of vinegar the egg starts to
break<00:00:10.080> apart<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:11.219> roll<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.240> turn<00:00:12.540> around

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
break apart and roll and turn around

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.129 
break apart and roll and turn around
this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.710> after<00:00:14.009> 24<00:00:14.549> hours<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.299> egg<00:00:15.480> starts<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this is after 24 hours the egg starts to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.939 
this is after 24 hours the egg starts to
expand<00:00:16.710> breaking<00:00:17.490> down<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.240> shell<00:00:18.680> as<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
expand breaking down the shell as the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.490 
expand breaking down the shell as the
shell<00:00:20.189> starts<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> break<00:00:20.970> down<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.689> comes<00:00:22.230> off

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
shell starts to break down it comes off

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.710 
shell starts to break down it comes off
in<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.160> vinegar<00:00:24.380> making<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.590> translucent

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
in the vinegar making a translucent

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.710 
in the vinegar making a translucent
state<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.349> then<00:00:29.099> taking<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.150> gently

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
state and then taking it out gently

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.580 
state and then taking it out gently
washing<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:34.140> egg<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.559> very

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
washing it you can see the egg is very

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.270 
washing it you can see the egg is very
rubbery<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:36.770> translucent<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.160> almost

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
rubbery and translucent and can almost

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.720 
rubbery and translucent and can almost
see<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:39.030> through<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.770> at<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.040> stage<00:00:41.340> we're

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
see right through it at this stage we're

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
see right through it at this stage we're
going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.940> take<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.450> part<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.140> egg<00:00:43.350> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
going to take this part of the egg you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.069 
going to take this part of the egg you
can<00:00:44.430> actually<00:00:44.610> bounce<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.780> wanted

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
can actually bounce this if you wanted

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.660 
can actually bounce this if you wanted
to<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:46.559> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.739> take<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> put

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to but we're going to take this and put

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.549 
to but we're going to take this and put
it<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.940> glass<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.570> sugar<00:00:49.170> water<00:00:50.149> making<00:00:51.149> it

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
it in a glass of sugar water making it

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.060 
it in a glass of sugar water making it
actually<00:00:52.559> shrink<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:54.570> after<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.199> we

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
actually shrink and then after that we

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.580 
actually shrink and then after that we
will<00:00:56.399> take<00:00:56.699> food<00:00:57.539> coloring<00:00:58.050> let<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.320> set<00:00:58.559> for

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
will take food coloring let that set for

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.830 
will take food coloring let that set for
24<00:00:59.070> hours<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.489> then<00:00:59.640> take<00:00:59.879> food<00:01:00.210> coloring<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
24 hours and then take food coloring and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.920 
24 hours and then take food coloring and
inject<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> small<00:01:02.579> needle<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.359> you'll

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
inject it with a small needle and you'll

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.800 
inject it with a small needle and you'll
see<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> egg<00:01:04.470> expand<00:01:05.129> again

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.480 

oh<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.200> float<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.250> sugar

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
oh and you can see it float in the sugar

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.130 
oh and you can see it float in the sugar
water<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.899> just

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
water now if you have that in just

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.620 
water now if you have that in just
regular<00:01:16.380> water<00:01:16.920> without<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> sugar<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.390> egg

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
regular water without the sugar the egg

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.899 
regular water without the sugar the egg
would<00:01:18.840> actually<00:01:19.409> sink<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.789> bottom<00:01:22.909> so

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
would actually sink to the bottom so

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.950 
would actually sink to the bottom so
what<00:01:24.420> we're<00:01:24.600> doing<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.350> placing<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:26.009> egg

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
what we're doing here is placing an egg

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
what we're doing here is placing an egg
submerging<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> egg<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.530> vinegar<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
submerging the egg in vinegar and the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.240 
submerging the egg in vinegar and the
shell<00:01:29.909> dissolves<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.049> vinegar<00:01:31.470> contains<00:01:31.679> an

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
shell dissolves the vinegar contains an

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.910 
shell dissolves the vinegar contains an
acetic<00:01:32.700> acid<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.450> breaks<00:01:33.840> apart<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> solid

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
acetic acid which breaks apart the solid

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
acetic acid which breaks apart the solid
the<00:01:35.579> solid<00:01:35.610> calcium<00:01:36.270> carbonate<00:01:37.170> crystals

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the solid calcium carbonate crystals

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.529 
the solid calcium carbonate crystals
that<00:01:38.009> make<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.520> egg<00:01:38.729> shell<00:01:39.119> into<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
that make up the egg shell into the

atoms that are missing electrons while
the<00:01:49.170> carbonate<00:01:49.679> goes<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.340> make<00:01:50.580> carbon

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
the carbonate goes to make carbon

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.480 
the carbonate goes to make carbon
dioxide<00:01:51.869> that's<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.740> bubbles<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.310> see

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
dioxide that's the bubbles that you see

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.899 
dioxide that's the bubbles that you see
in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.509> first<00:01:54.720> part<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.200> video<00:01:55.909> another

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
in the first part of the video another

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.419 
in the first part of the video another
thing<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.599> can<00:01:57.810> try<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.860> reaction

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
thing that you can try is the reaction

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.609 
thing that you can try is the reaction
of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> egg<00:01:59.819> shell<00:01:59.849> and<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.330> vinegar<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.049> an

vinegar and see what happens and you can

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.640 
vinegar and see what happens and you can
actually<00:02:14.910> use<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.329> mixture<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.170> explode

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
actually use this mixture to explode

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.710 
actually use this mixture to explode
like<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> plastic<00:02:17.549> bag<00:02:17.760> which<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.120> very<00:02:18.510> cool

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
like a plastic bag which is very cool

floating the egg in the sugar water this

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.130 
floating the egg in the sugar water this
will<00:02:30.630> make<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.049> egg<00:02:31.260> actually<00:02:32.010> shrink<00:02:33.140> once

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
will make the egg actually shrink once

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.190 
will make the egg actually shrink once
the<00:02:34.380> egg<00:02:34.530> shrinks<00:02:35.220> by<00:02:35.370> tomorrow<00:02:36.049> it'll<00:02:37.049> be

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200

down almost a half its size

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.099 
down almost a half its size
we'll<00:02:40.500> take<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.980> out<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.579> that<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.420> then<00:02:42.840> we
