00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello, this is a small informational 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.799
 the video will be about software 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.990
 that you know perfectly well as beginners 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.120
 something like that and mac user and what is 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.730
 such an app store which 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.560
 called appstore and you have enough 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.150
 create your apple log in to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 register here and you can 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.189
 absolutely free or for money 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 it all depends on the application to download 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.039
 hence all sorts of software soft and covered and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.109
 so on so on if one of you 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.649
 want to live did not develop the application 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.510
 for os x or so 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.800
 you know very well to your 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 the application got here 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.450
 you need to go moderation where you are that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.420
 moderators of the company and by pretty 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.520
 picky people if they see that your 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.129
 the application does not respond any there 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.230
 requirements let's say there copyright 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.180
 either they just see that applications 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.930
 nice but stylish and it's not exactly 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.760
 in the style of apple you are given 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.359
 recommendations for you to correct your 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.280
 attachment 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.379
 if you don't want to fix your 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.799
 applications then she never come here 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.490
 It got here it was information such 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.920
 message 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.659
 but what about the people who created 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 good application but which to 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.430
 Unfortunately, they did not pass moderation in the appstore 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.040
 and what they do then was created here 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.080
 this site this site create girl you 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.570
 can bones gotti saying go 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.750
 see here there is information about it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.579
 the site is called hackintosh curtains 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.009
 can run this commercial 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.570
 true he is in English but you can 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.119
 at least google and translate 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.759
 this text here says that the following 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.650
 this site on this site will be available 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.600
 download absolutely free application 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.880
 which simply did not pass moderation in 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 appstore and what you need to do 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.560
 we download the program so I download 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.159
 program it is small after 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.840
 we downloaded 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.560
 a program let me install 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.179
 on the desktop, look at it below 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 us store and appstore and and here 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.409
 called hacks tori 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.119
 but before I install it on 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.150
 just in case and have an hour to scan 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.980
 antivirus 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.720
 In general, all applications and I recommend 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.900
 which you install from the internet 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.330
 scan antivirus god save 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.610
 saves but seems to be no viruses here 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.329
 So the app store and store as 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.120
 the parties set the order we have it 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.069
 have established 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.840
 gave it to us here we are 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:41.269
 run it after we do it 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.500
 launched we see something like that 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:48.590
 copy of the appstore store and here 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.250
 such and also let's say there is music there 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.829
 soft 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.799
 You can see for yourself, in general, I 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.629
 it makes no sense to explain all this 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.540
 there is a recommendation here 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.519
 popular software the very throat you should 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.010
 know what you do not need to enter here 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.600
 yours and go yes here you will need 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.310
 register but you can from 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.200
 lantern indicate any there 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.090
 email address which is right there 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.349
 instantly you think there is a name 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.200
 username and password 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.180
 whether it is necessary to check antivirus each of 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.569
 of these applications but which is already yours 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.730
 the choice 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.040
 I told you earlier that I personally all 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.630
 I check the antivirus here but it does not 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.549
 absolutely does not mean that here is rude 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.400
 saying what is there pirate software with 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.319
 those are dynamite and so on 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.709
 here is software which for some 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.950
 reasons do not ask for porn as moderation 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.620
 in the appstore and here it is there is quite 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.049
 OK, by the way 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.440
 remember this one by very popular in 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.569
 appstore and thats when you download you 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.120
 the appstore and he found out you don't go to 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.040
 operating system and uncheck when 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.650
 people go to the developer site of this 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.750
 player and downloads it from there so here 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.239
 if you download his developer site 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.329
 consider that in parallel with this player you 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.769
 download all sorts of a bunch of junk it 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.230
 mini such viruses 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.150
 the thing is , I remember that earlier too 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.159
 I did not know my 7 I have it 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.129
 power did not go to the site 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.590
 the manufacturer downloaded it from there but when 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.440
 I checked it with Dr. Web . 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.169
 me that in 20 of our viruses there is no 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.509
 as there is not particularly such strong viruses 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.669
 These are the viruses that touched correctly. 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.840
 all kinds of programs like that is when 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.759
 I opened the safari 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.460
 after installing this player from me 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:34.009
 there were these banners there then everything is shorter 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.810
 speaking right away your computer just 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.430
 had to smithereens completely 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.720
 format the hard drive and 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.910
 reinstall the operating system 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.100
 so learn this and that 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.699
 popular this player and how would such 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.770
 setup 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.229
 but it was just a digression 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.210
 so here you can go to this store 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.680
 hacks tours 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.900
 Download these software features that you 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.060
 like or dislike but think 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.130
 I donâ€™t have any further say 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.020
 figure it out the video was 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.389
 solely for information because 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.490
 not all novice hackintosh books are like 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.710
 mac user and knows that there is such 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.460
 the shop is like its own alternative 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.919
 appstore 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.849
 Thank you all who watched this video and 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.849
 good luck to you
