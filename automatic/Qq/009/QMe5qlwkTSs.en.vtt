00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
coffee so we might have just been

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
half Jim gave it 81 Bob gave it 80 so we

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.310

in this kind of damage you see right
here<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.290> typical<00:01:08.290> Sumatra<00:01:08.890> in<00:01:09.369> fact<00:01:09.700> right

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
here can we get that one there we have a

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.750 
here can we get that one there we have a
little<00:01:13.540> bit<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:14.409> bit<00:01:14.680> boring<00:01:14.950> insect<00:01:15.549> damage

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
little bit of a bit boring insect damage

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.760 
little bit of a bit boring insect damage
that<00:01:16.330> happens<00:01:16.659> on<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.900> plant<00:01:17.200> it's<00:01:17.470> not<00:01:17.619> in

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
that happens on the plant it's not in

that happens on the plant it's not in
the<00:01:17.860> coffee<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:20.140> definitely<00:01:20.530> affects<00:01:20.770> the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
the coffee that definitely affects the

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.940 
the coffee that definitely affects the
quality<00:01:21.360> you're<00:01:22.360> kind<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.689> cracking<00:01:23.200> here<00:01:23.680> on

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
quality you're kind of cracking here on

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.600 
quality you're kind of cracking here on
the<00:01:24.159> ends<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.759> they<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:25.689> know<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:27.040> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.370 

partly<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.759> problem<00:01:31.299> in<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:31.630> contest<00:01:32.170> was

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
partly the problem in this contest was

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.679 
partly the problem in this contest was
the<00:01:32.710> blending<00:01:33.250> through<00:01:33.579> me<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:33.970> Steve<00:01:34.390> we

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
the blending through me and Steve we

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.899 
the blending through me and Steve we
weren't<00:01:34.930> ready<00:01:35.079> for<00:01:35.229> that<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.829> we<00:01:36.670> didn't

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
weren't ready for that and we didn't

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.230 
weren't ready for that and we didn't
realize<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:39.640> opinion<00:01:40.060> would<00:01:40.180> be

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
realize that the my opinion would be

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.230 
realize that the my opinion would be
less<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.320> used<00:01:41.560> Sumatra<00:01:42.159> really<00:01:42.549> effectively

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
less you used Sumatra really effectively

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.740 
less you used Sumatra really effectively
in<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.420> blend<00:01:43.659> unless<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.259> say<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:46.240> know<00:01:46.360> we

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
in a blend unless you say you know we

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.840 
in a blend unless you say you know we
use<00:01:46.930> it<00:01:46.960> kind<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.320> boldly<00:01:47.710> if<00:01:48.189> you<00:01:48.399> use<00:01:48.579> it<00:01:48.700> sort

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
use it kind of boldly if you use it sort

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.630 
use it kind of boldly if you use it sort
of<00:01:48.970> tepidly<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.960> half-heartedly<00:01:50.680> it<00:01:51.340> ends<00:01:51.579> up

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
of tepidly and half-heartedly it ends up

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.870 
of tepidly and half-heartedly it ends up
just<00:01:51.850> mucking<00:01:52.149> up<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.450> blend<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:54.130> think

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
just mucking up the blend so I think

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.630 
just mucking up the blend so I think
Sumatra's<00:01:55.479> are<00:01:55.600> just<00:01:55.810> tough<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.369> Kate

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
Sumatra's are just tough this is Kate

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.950 
Sumatra's are just tough this is Kate
now<00:01:58.509> this<00:01:59.049> is<00:01:59.350> number<00:01:59.649> six

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
now this is number six

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.630 
now this is number six

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
is might be the winning coffee I think

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.580 
is might be the winning coffee I think
it<00:02:10.030> was<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.269> highest<00:02:10.450> score<00:02:10.869> for<00:02:11.170> me<00:02:11.230> and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
it was the highest score for me and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.690 
it was the highest score for me and
Steve<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:13.360> think<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.680> pure

you're haile selassie and it definitely
if<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.920> could<00:02:25.080> even<00:02:26.080> definitely<00:02:26.500> call

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
if it is it could even definitely call

number<00:04:46.900> 12<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.740> we<00:04:50.860> can<00:04:51.010> start<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.400> really<00:04:51.580> look

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
number 12 so we can start to really look

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.640 
number 12 so we can start to really look
at<00:04:51.940> some<00:04:52.090> of<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.270> issues<00:04:54.060> 12<00:04:55.060> was<00:04:55.870> surprising

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
at some of the issues 12 was surprising

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.350 
at some of the issues 12 was surprising
because<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.070> actually<00:04:57.310> cooked<00:04:57.850> pretty<00:04:58.090> good

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
because it actually cooked pretty good

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.590 
because it actually cooked pretty good
but<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:59.020> was<00:04:59.200> because<00:04:59.710> of<00:04:59.980> the<00:05:00.100> coffee<00:05:00.600> used

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600
