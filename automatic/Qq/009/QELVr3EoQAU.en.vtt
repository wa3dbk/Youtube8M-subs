acts of Pontius Pilate and we're not a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.950 
acts of Pontius Pilate and we're not a
hundred<00:00:26.699> percent<00:00:26.820> certain<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.720> book

is Matthew Matthew's resurrection

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.860 
is Matthew Matthew's resurrection
account<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.340> very<00:02:24.670> similar<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.390> second

strong likelihood that Matthew actually

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.150 
strong likelihood that Matthew actually
derived<00:02:31.780> his<00:02:31.959> resurrection<00:02:32.530> account<00:02:33.010> from

derived his resurrection account from
the<00:02:33.220> acts<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.760> pilot<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.390> since<00:02:34.959> Justin

an axe of Pontius Pilate to the point of

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
any of the synoptics so I think we have

any of the synoptics so I think we have
a<00:04:29.840> priority<00:04:30.470> text<00:04:30.830> over<00:04:31.040> Matthew<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.670> though

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
a priority text over Matthew and though

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.700 
a priority text over Matthew and though
it's<00:04:32.030> not<00:04:32.210> necessarily<00:04:32.930> required<00:04:33.410> it

it's not necessarily required it

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.730 
it's not necessarily required it
probably<00:04:34.310> predates<00:04:34.550> marquee<00:04:35.210> on<00:04:35.240> as<00:04:35.480> well

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740
