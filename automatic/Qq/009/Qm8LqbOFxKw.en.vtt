00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 before showing how to solve the last 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.720
 I'll have to show it to you. 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.410
 how to apply a new formula that is 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.030
 second form that today is this 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.670
 formula learned in the rafael channel 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.490
 siloto whose link I'll leave right here 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 this way you will be able to apply 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.430
 hour with the right hand or left 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.099
 Let's start here with vat that is already 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.410
 fully assembled just so you 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.199
 understand the result in such a way that it 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.750
 modify it so let's start there 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.630
 first formula by the right hand 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.700
 then you will rotate considering that the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.010
 cube face ok you will turn right 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:49.129
 and you're going to turn here to the side 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.989
 left and then turned left and 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.129
 sent right 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.219
 now we'll go back the right side and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.180
 send to the left will come back to the side 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.869
 left and right here 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.799
 so look what happened to our play 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.080
 what was that green yellow and red it 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.869
 came here so it's the piece that was here 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.820
 From above she came here I said that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.860
 she fell 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.409
 she had to the color red and the color 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.869
 red went to the left side 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.229
 Ok, let's see what happened to the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.310
 piece that was here that is red and 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.009
 white with green that part is the look 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170
 What happened to the red that was 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.439
 here and he too 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.229
 bonbon and he falls to the side then 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.290
 you look here our letter l 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.240
 both the piece that is up here 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.299
 how much the piece that was here 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.939
 they have red modified to the 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.180
 right here on the body then 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.189
 I was on the face went to the side and here the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 same thing the red came to the 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:08.009
 and what happened to the part that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.739
 it was here that the blue and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.599
 White, she comes here. 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.740
 And look how cool this is here. 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.010
 point of the letter 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.070
 there she not so good she simply 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.050
 turned to this piece was here when 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.460
 we apply formula 1 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.110
 she did it right and this piece that 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.560
 it was up here what happened with 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.980
 she 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.600
 that's exactly where she did it and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.600
 this is not it 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.640
 Now I'll show you the application of 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.570
 formula on the left side is the same 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.530
 way, but starting to look so 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:53.120
 left turn right and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.370
 right gender manage left 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.040
 turn left turn up to the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.880
 right turn right 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.430
 the top turn to the left and then look 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.300
 what happened here is that our l was 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.300
 modified 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.810
 she was not notified because she did not 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.810
 is in the cast 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.130
 so now we are going to the resolution of the part 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.610
 upper body 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.170
 so let's apply the good formula 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.450
 I can already see that this piece is 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.850
 so I have two options 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.930
 apply the formula or here by hand 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.840
 left 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.090
 the sl is that on this side 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.630
 or apply the formula by hand 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:42.210
 right with it is that this right side 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.690
 here I can play this part 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.060
 Here, this blue will stay here to simulate. 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.190
 angela ricci to the side and yellow to 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.050
 I 'm going to be able to put this piece here 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.370
 Alright then come on, let's see what 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:01.650
 will give this strategy here such a spin 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:07.230
 left and pushed the right turn to 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:13.350
 right push to the left back to 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.859
 left the right thigh back right 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.020
 I run to the left 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.940
 happened I hoped I could 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.700
 fix this piece now has two 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.790
 correct parts and now has a condition 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.360
 here is a special condition where I 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.270
 have 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.990
 these two red pieces here turned 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.389
 to the same side and I have this 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.180
 good yellow and white we'll do 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.780
 here in this case we'll get the two 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.430
 red pieces here the two pieces of 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.590
 Equal leather could be any other 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.199
 color but we 'll get the two 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.560
 pieces of the same color 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.560
 Let's put it down and now this is it. 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.900
 here is that the front hub in ok 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.930
 so this is to work on the blue side 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.029
 to work on the red side and go 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.520
 apply the same form again 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:14.870
 starting with the right hand turning right 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.870
 I turn right turn left and pushed 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:26.550
 right turn left turn on 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.669
 now I'm going to take a turn in my body here 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.169
 clockwise and apply the same 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:46.169
 only now with the left hand 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:49.560
 I managed to come back, I went back to what 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.259
 ready our body 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.199
