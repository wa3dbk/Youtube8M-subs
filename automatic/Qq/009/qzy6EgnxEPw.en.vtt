00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.460
 hello I am permanent mister 24 and today you 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.590
 I will teach how to build the cane 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.290
 of ice or the blue cane as you want 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.040
 say good first thing we have to catch 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.320
 the blue disc 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.650
 that we can find in these three 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.240
 locations the three locations 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.390
 they are in the example in the sector 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.070
 2 or generator 2 as you want to say and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.320
 now we are going to teach the last 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.880
 location that is on the table 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 and we are seeing it 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.530
 well we take it these are the three 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.200
 sites that we can find the disk 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 blue the following are the three pieces of 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.920
 the canes and how is it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.000
 digging and digging only when 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.980
 this one lift 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.470
 these pieces will come out randomly by 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.690
 the map here we can see how I get the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.729
 last piece of blue or ice cane 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.970
 whatever you want to call it, nothing 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.920
 I approach and I take it now what we have 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.350
 what to do is look for the gramophone and its 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 corresponding good black disc what 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 first is the location of the gramophone 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.920
 which is inside the excavation 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.290
 as we are seeing we get closer and what 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.119
 we take now we have to take the disk 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.800
 black and it has three locations the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.690
 First is behind the letter 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.550
 excavation the second climbing up the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.590
 Excavation poster pointing to the pac 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.750
 there it is on top of the cart we take it 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.740
 the last location is found by 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.990
 this way as if it were like this 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.600
 but long before I arrived you 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.610
 you find there is we take it once 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.490
 picked up the gramophone and its black disk 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.860
 we have to go generated 6 where is 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.659
 the cave and place the gramophone myself 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.789
 I was taking care of the zombie and I told my 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.119
 friends who put it when he gave me 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.280
 the signal my friend I would lower you not 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.950
 you have to do this just go put the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.619
 megaphone and it will open to the portal you put 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.990
 we are already inside now what we have 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.940
 that go to catch the ice crystal that 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.640
 will give us this site as I do not know what 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.040
 I expose in only place we approach and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.410
 the stone will rise up we take it 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.840
 and we go back to the same place where we have 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.750
 come out we wait for the portal to open 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.880
 Once opened we enter 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.030
 we went out in the same place that we have 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.090
 entered and we take the megaphone that is not 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.430
 forget to catch the megaphone ok we go out 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.700
 upwards that we will find 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.620
 front with the generator 6 good now 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.870
 we just have to go get the cane 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.030
 which is at the bottom of the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.069
 digging I just want to tell you one thing 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.230

 thank good we're almost in the 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.349
 bottom we just have to lower this 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.739
 ladder and we will find 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.379
 in front of us there is the blue and 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.510
 we build it will have our opposite and 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.639
 we took it from friend there I was 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.739
