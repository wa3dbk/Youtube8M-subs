00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
5 fills that particular one we don't

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.180 
5 fills that particular one we don't
have<00:02:25.120> an<00:02:25.240> alt<00:02:25.480> but<00:02:25.810> on<00:02:26.290> others<00:02:26.680> like<00:02:26.920> here's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
so here's riff 1 so it's just slightly

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.970 
so here's riff 1 so it's just slightly
to<00:02:46.990> work<00:02:47.170> with<00:02:47.610> she<00:02:48.610> got<00:02:48.730> crashes<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:50.770> got

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
to work with she got crashes you got

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.780 
to work with she got crashes you got
fills<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.390> got<00:02:52.570> alts<00:02:53.110> generally<00:02:53.860> okay<00:02:54.610> on

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
fills and you got alts generally okay on

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.780 
fills and you got alts generally okay on
each<00:02:55.000> one<00:02:55.240> of<00:02:55.360> those<00:02:56.430> down<00:02:57.430> there<00:02:57.580> at<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
each one of those down there at the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
each one of those down there at the
bottom<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.270> have<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.720> snare<00:02:59.680> single<00:03:00.220> hits

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
bottom we have the snare single hits

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.800 
bottom we have the snare single hits
snare<00:03:03.280> single<00:03:03.640> hits<00:03:03.850> are<00:03:04.060> in<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.510> particular

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
snare single hits are in the particular

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.800 
snare single hits are in the particular
folder<00:03:05.440> because<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.370> snare<00:03:06.670> sound<00:03:07.090> changes

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
folder because the snare sound changes

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.690 
folder because the snare sound changes
very<00:03:08.260> slightly<00:03:08.860> over<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.100> several<00:03:09.400> days<00:03:09.670> of

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
very slightly over the several days of

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.449 
very slightly over the several days of
text<00:03:10.209> for<00:03:10.450> us<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.750> record<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.200> volume<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:12.280> then

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
text for us to record a volume but then

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.699 
text for us to record a volume but then
all<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.940> other<00:03:13.090> single<00:03:14.050> hits<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.650> don't

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
all the other single hits and I don't

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.400 
all the other single hits and I don't
think<00:03:14.860> I've<00:03:15.070> got<00:03:15.100> them<00:03:15.400> installed<00:03:15.910> are<00:03:16.420> in

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
think I've got them installed are in

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.210 
think I've got them installed are in
their<00:03:17.800> own<00:03:18.330> folder<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:20.410> so<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.680> didn't<00:03:20.920> install

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
their own folder and so I didn't install

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.729 
their own folder and so I didn't install
those<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:22.630> have<00:03:22.810> an<00:03:22.959> ending<00:03:23.290> there's<00:03:23.590> usually

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
those you have an ending there's usually

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.930 
those you have an ending there's usually
an<00:03:24.010> ending<00:03:24.340> or<00:03:24.459> two<00:03:25.410> rings<00:03:26.410> way<00:03:26.590> out

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
an ending or two rings way out

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.410 
an ending or two rings way out
there's<00:03:28.360> standalone<00:03:29.050> fills<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:33.180> there<00:03:34.180> are

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
there's standalone fills and there are

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.199 
there's standalone fills and there are
also<00:03:35.320> what<00:03:35.860> I<00:03:35.890> call<00:03:36.220> loop<00:03:36.489> layers<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.120> what

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
also what I call loop layers and what

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.440 
also what I call loop layers and what
these<00:03:37.420> are<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.959> they're<00:03:38.500> simple<00:03:41.519> loops<00:03:42.519> that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
these are is they're simple loops that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.890 
these are is they're simple loops that
you<00:03:43.510> can<00:03:44.730> use<00:03:45.730> for<00:03:46.060> breakdowns

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
you can use for breakdowns

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.650 
you can use for breakdowns
or<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.230> build<00:03:47.530> your<00:03:47.800> own<00:03:47.830> loop<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:49.330> can<00:03:49.450> take

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
or to build your own loop you can take

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.979 
or to build your own loop you can take
that<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.670> use<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.570> however<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.170> want<00:03:54.989> just

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
that and use it however you want just

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.600 
that and use it however you want just
put<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.290> on<00:03:56.350> a<00:03:56.470> separate<00:03:56.950> channel<00:03:57.400> and

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
put that on a separate channel and

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.550 
put that on a separate channel and
combine<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.600> with<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.840> snare<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.440> can

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
combine that with the snare and you can

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.590 
combine that with the snare and you can
totally<00:03:59.739> build<00:04:00.130> your<00:04:00.340> own<00:04:00.370> grooves<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.030> that's

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
totally build your own grooves so that's

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.890 
totally build your own grooves so that's
basically<00:04:02.110> an<00:04:02.320> overview<00:04:02.739> of<00:04:03.120> what's<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.420> any

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
basically an overview of what's in any

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.740 
basically an overview of what's in any
one<00:04:05.470> song<00:04:05.950> set<00:04:06.340> that's<00:04:06.640> just<00:04:06.910> one<00:04:07.120> song<00:04:07.450> set

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
one song set that's just one song set

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.940 
one song set that's just one song set
and<00:04:07.959> of<00:04:08.380> course<00:04:08.650> we<00:04:09.220> can<00:04:10.139> speed<00:04:11.139> things<00:04:11.350> up<00:04:11.620> or

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
and of course we can speed things up or

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.620 
and of course we can speed things up or
slow<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.370> down<00:04:12.400> now<00:04:13.090> I'm<00:04:13.180> going<00:04:13.329> to<00:04:13.420> quickly

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
slow it down now I'm going to quickly

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.979 
slow it down now I'm going to quickly
throw<00:04:14.019> together<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:15.329> song

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
almost out of time here so I'll turn it

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.570 
almost out of time here so I'll turn it
back<00:04:21.609> on<00:04:22.120> in<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.360> second<00:04:22.979> okay<00:04:23.979> just<00:04:24.220> for<00:04:24.370> fun
