 to come and that's what this video is about 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.670
 the highs or the bank 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.850

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.980
 tough and if the only drawback is 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.750
 this car broke from the front 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.879

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.109

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.489
 vintage pistol and yes this looks like itself 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.650
 nice ride bikes which are not really flat 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.910
 for added value it has on 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.799
 his appearance after then 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.810
 but well yes there is something again 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.040

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.810
 some people serving myself and it 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.060

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.489
 added and actually mine 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.609
 personal favorite is this shirt with 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.739
 Need a focus on what concerns napkin 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.739

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.389
 find hairstyles that you can put on your head 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.290
 paste or let us cut or something 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.850
 queer news do that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.740

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.440
 how you can jure your car 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.420
 You can now leave the car 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.220

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.060
 a few very strange new bells 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.960
 for your car that personally really isn't 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.090
 go use it but yes it is funny 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.250
 also there were countless new jobs 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.510
 added by being rockstar itself 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.160
 there are actually too many to mention and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.140
 too much to deal with in this 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.280
 video alone maybe I will 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.710
 a dark no ways 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.940
 because there are so many jobs that can do and 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.690
 there are still so many jobs that I hold 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.160
 you want to show 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.600
 so it might do another time 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.790
 then then had a few more 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.440
 little things that have been adjusted 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.180
 for example, the tale of god does more now 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.640
 damage 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.260
