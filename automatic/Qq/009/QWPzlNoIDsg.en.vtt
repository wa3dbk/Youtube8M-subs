00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.990
 and hello everyone and welcome to bang 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.560
 strong first is available on the beta 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.320
 opened by blizzard here is the butcher 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.820
 first boss of the second second hump 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.380
 technically from the instance knowing that 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.789
 the instance and ultra open you can 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.829
 you walk a little as you want 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.460
 so I think the first boss enough 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.640
 relative as 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.710
 as not so right now the pool that 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.640
 will happen soon you see that everything 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.440
 the world is connected 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.379
 we had planned to leave on an art is 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.040
 of 20 finally the far this year is 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.140
 of 12 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.730
 finally 11 mom because the players 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.530
 arrived not to connect 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.390
 so mechanical the boss was seeing this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 species of blood circle you saw 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.040
 which will reappear normally at the same 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.400
 place hop it's a doubt it's a 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.010
 bleeding that at this stage 5 times and if that 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.850
 get staxyn times the person who are attacking 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.019
 dies dies there is direct dies 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.400
 party on the group of cac 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.650
 the biggest loan left and so that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 actually forces the cacs and casters 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.259
 business of groups that will alternate 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.259
 the kaka make their group 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.700
 groups for more have the debuff and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.740
 we quaestors we will regroup and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.180
 vice versa the goal of making sure 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.280
 that ever more than three stack 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.930
 tanks can not come with us 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.490
 for the simple reason that when the boss 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.870
 type a time, in fact it gives a 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.670
 second shot within five meters of 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.080
 him except that if the person with less than 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.170
 five meters from him 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.210
 give a second shot and this second 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.630
 Suddenly she would be seen going to pv 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.180
 tanks drop and that's why you have to 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.160
 know that this little country but she 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.400
 admit what you are not with others 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.410
 caster means that because you're reading 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.120
 should have been with others 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.630
 the estac is everything eh bah it's very 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.370
 simple is that I may have a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.020
 video but on this evening I'm 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.720
 absolutely sorry i did really 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.640
 anything I was punctured I the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.940
 war if you look down it's 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.940
 not see on a rekord but I had it 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.940
 completely 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.210
 and 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.530
 I do not have this anymore 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.300
 thing to handle next what makes me 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.870
 am really sorry atuge on crane 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.310
 Aegean not this problem at the club 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.900
 Batavian get to 100 of energy when you 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.480
 get to 100 of energy will make a 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.690
 big shot around him that will push back 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.490
 everyone has by pushing everything back but 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.140
 he does moderate damage and then he 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.650
 will start to make an idol ride 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.630
 Let's go 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.280
 and when he's in tower bill hall mode 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.720
 he will go and get the place where there is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.870
 the most players and he will go for it 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.970
 in this course we are is king and 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.890
 have to get away we take damage 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.900
 note that we have small damages in 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.480
 permanence but it's especially when we 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.560
 is about the boss includes ends on the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.560
 web who all want us to have damage 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.430
 this is the last hen we have the chance 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.650
 because see that it restarts in 6 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.310
 7 minutes and finally we did a little 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.260
 the 30% 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.930
 the boss to a zerg that when there is less 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.730
 from 30% health it to 10% damage and 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.380
 30% speed of attacked things like that 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.420
 so that normally will have to keep 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.440
 heroism for its classic but good 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.850
 our presumption finally our one 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.760
 pension not already arrived so far 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.740
 knowing that we had to completely down 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.920
 courses at the stratum by ourselves and 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.440
 So it's not too bad so me 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.050
 From that moment on, I say good-bye 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.720
 will die dying knowing that we had very 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.280
 afraid that if people release that can 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.000
 make them bugger because here you 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.840
 knew all the bugs about I have 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.900
 I'm sure you're going to break it 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.760
 and we're going vanilla and we're going to save 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.930
 people for now actually the ones 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.460
 stops are not closed I think there 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.190
 will have mechanisms to close that more 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.620
 late for now this is not the case 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.069
 I'm running away 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.890
 I run 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.840
 and I do not look safe seen or not 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.129
 nevertheless its value technically the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.180
 second bone at the moment on the moment 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.560
 the mechanics are really not 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.200
 complicated it takes this package itself 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.269
 packages the times that has almost no 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.730
 job for them aside he 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.230
 well we still learn the dishes of 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.209
 new mechanics of wolof dreknor 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.709
 so it's not necessarily obvious on 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.180
 all the reds down are not yet been 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.639
 given the evenings we're doing 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.599
 do it right there are going to serve to 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.580
 calibrate the raids 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.680
 that's good, I wish you 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.000
 a good evening then did not see burns 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.000
 burn is available
