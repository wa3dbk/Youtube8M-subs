there's<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.830> variety<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.400> different<00:02:32.640> ways<00:02:32.940> that

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
there's a variety of different ways that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.580 
there's a variety of different ways that
the<00:02:33.300> W<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.840> go<00:02:33.930> about<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.440> they're

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the W can go about this but they're

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.290 
the W can go about this but they're
scrambling<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.460> see<00:02:35.610> why<00:02:35.730> creative<00:02:36.150> is

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
scrambling and I can see why creative is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.000 
scrambling and I can see why creative is
scrambling<00:02:36.960> because<00:02:37.140> when<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> set

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
scrambling because when you have a set

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.800 
scrambling because when you have a set
plan<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.610> when<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.270> look<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.570> into<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
plan and when you look it into the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.300 
plan and when you look it into the
future<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.350> have<00:02:40.470> things<00:02:40.740> set<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.190> way

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
future and you have things set the way

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.040 
future and you have things set the way
