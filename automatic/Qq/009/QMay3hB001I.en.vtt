over here which is the next route

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
over here which is the next route
throughout<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.670> here's<00:00:41.700> Rob<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
throughout all right so here's Rob is

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.229 
throughout all right so here's Rob is
kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> long<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.989> now<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> route<00:00:44.399> 30<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
kind of long so now this is route 30 and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.540 
kind of long so now this is route 30 and
of<00:00:45.899> course<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.469> music<00:00:46.800> changes<00:00:47.160> every<00:00:47.430> now

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
of course the music changes every now

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
of course the music changes every now
and<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:47.940> though<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.960> believe<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.559> only<00:00:49.710> like

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and then though I believe it's only like

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.880 
and then though I believe it's only like
two<00:00:50.250> different<00:00:50.460> types<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> music<00:00:51.500> now<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
two different types of music now I do a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.560 
two different types of music now I do a
lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> different<00:00:53.489> types<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.789> music<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
lot of different types of music but it

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.420 
lot of different types of music but it
just<00:00:54.750> doesn't<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:55.379> battle<00:00:55.770> phase<00:00:55.949> music

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
just doesn't have battle phase music

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
just doesn't have battle phase music
that's<00:00:56.730> something<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.390> throughout

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that's something I don't like throughout

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.900 
that's something I don't like throughout
the<00:00:58.530> route<00:00:58.710> every<00:00:59.100> time<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> change<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> city

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.910 
the route every time to change the city
or<00:01:00.120> route<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.570> changes<00:01:00.989> music<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.649> just

city can we get into this house um no in
most<00:01:21.570> cases<00:01:21.750> though<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
most cases though just as a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.600 
most cases though just as a
foreshadowing<00:01:24.570> warning<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.170> guess<00:01:25.610> pretty

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
foreshadowing warning I guess pretty

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.999 
foreshadowing warning I guess pretty
much<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:27.330> can't<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:28.080> into<00:01:28.110> any<00:01:28.710> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
much we can't really get into any of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.380 
much we can't really get into any of
these<00:01:29.130> houses<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.729> least<00:01:29.909> most<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
these houses or at least most of the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.090 
these houses or at least most of the
houses<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.900> game<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.470> guess<00:01:31.920> they

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
houses in this game because I guess they

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.399 
houses in this game because I guess they
haven't<00:01:32.250> finished<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> yet<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.810> course<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
haven't finished it yet so of course you

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.020 
haven't finished it yet so of course you
know<00:01:34.500> yeah<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.100> gotta<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.610> got<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.790> do

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
know yeah you gotta do what we got to do

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
know yeah you gotta do what we got to do
so<00:01:36.840> over<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.890> actually<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.280> over

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so over there we can actually go over

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.190 
so over there we can actually go over
there<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> plant<00:01:39.420> let's<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.900> ahead<00:01:40.049> and

down<00:03:46.320> when<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.100> game<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.730> able<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.299> do

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
down when the game is like able to do

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.599 
down when the game is like able to do
that<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.989> process<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.220> should<00:03:50.519> think

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
that and process that but I should think

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.610 
that and process that but I should think
can<00:03:51.000> somebody<00:03:51.239> hmm<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.810> done<00:03:52.019> because<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.380> saw

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
can somebody hmm is done because I saw

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.349 
can somebody hmm is done because I saw
someone<00:03:52.859> two<00:03:53.070> patches<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.760> he<00:03:53.910> fixed

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
someone two patches that he fixed

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.560 
someone two patches that he fixed
surfing<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.799> only<00:03:56.070> pokemon<00:03:56.390> with<00:03:57.390> the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
surfing so that only pokemon with the

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.250 
surfing so that only pokemon with the
move<00:03:57.750> surf<00:03:58.049> can<00:03:58.489> actually<00:03:59.489> surf<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.880> water<00:04:00.260> so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
move surf can actually surf on water so

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.340 
move surf can actually surf on water so
I<00:04:01.290> think<00:04:01.440> he<00:04:01.709> has<00:04:01.799> some<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.220> them<00:04:02.370> done<00:04:02.670> but

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
I think he has some of them done but

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.510 
I think he has some of them done but
really<00:04:04.740> use<00:04:05.070> them<00:04:05.570> all<00:04:06.570> right<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:07.620> pretty<00:04:08.460> much

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
really use them all right so pretty much

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
really use them all right so pretty much
like<00:04:09.150> X<00:04:09.630> or<00:04:09.900> perhaps<00:04:10.710> or<00:04:11.220> all<00:04:11.640> right<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:12.420> we're

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
like X or perhaps or all right so we're

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.240 
like X or perhaps or all right so we're
just<00:04:12.600> gonna<00:04:12.810> pretty<00:04:13.110> much<00:04:13.200> a<00:04:13.350> zigzag<00:04:13.920> our<00:04:14.070> way

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
just gonna pretty much a zigzag our way

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
across it there's no way of absolutely

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.110 
across it there's no way of absolutely
