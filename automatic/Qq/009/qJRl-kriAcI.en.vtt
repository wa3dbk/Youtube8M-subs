now<00:01:27.640> tell<00:01:27.940> you<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.060> little<00:01:28.210> bit<00:01:28.360> about<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
now tell you a little bit about the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.080 
now tell you a little bit about the
corrals<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.860> first<00:01:30.100> interesting<00:01:30.670> fact<00:01:30.940> is

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
corrals the first interesting fact is

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.880 
corrals the first interesting fact is
the<00:01:31.210> coral<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.690> actually<00:01:32.080> an<00:01:32.170> animal<00:01:32.500> not<00:01:32.830> a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
the coral is actually an animal not a

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.100 
the coral is actually an animal not a
plant<00:01:33.280> which<00:01:33.880> really<00:01:34.120> spins<00:01:34.570> people<00:01:34.990> out

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
plant which really spins people out

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.560 
plant which really spins people out
because<00:01:35.290> they<00:01:35.590> look<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:35.770> cosmic<00:01:36.760> but<00:01:37.360> they're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
because they look so cosmic but they're

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.290 
because they look so cosmic but they're
coral<00:01:37.930> being<00:01:38.440> an<00:01:38.620> animal<00:01:38.950> does<00:01:39.430> actually<00:01:39.910> rely

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
coral being an animal does actually rely

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.240 
coral being an animal does actually rely
on<00:01:40.330> little<00:01:40.720> algie's<00:01:41.200> called<00:01:41.530> zoo<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.920> Feli

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
on little algie's called zoo and Feli

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.490 
on little algie's called zoo and Feli
that<00:01:42.550> grow<00:01:42.790> within<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.270> coral<00:01:43.780> which<00:01:44.260> not

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
that grow within the coral which not

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.740 
that grow within the coral which not
only<00:01:44.770> give<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.070> coral<00:01:45.430> its<00:01:45.580> color<00:01:45.910> but<00:01:46.390> allows

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
only give the coral its color but allows

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.920 
only give the coral its color but allows
the<00:01:47.080> coral<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.890> use<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.430> light<00:01:48.790> energy<00:01:49.450> as<00:01:49.630> an

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
the coral to use the light energy as an

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.740 
the coral to use the light energy as an
actual<00:01:50.290> food<00:01:50.680> source<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:51.700> basically<00:01:52.210> the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
actual food source so basically the

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.630 
actual food source so basically the
coral<00:01:53.080> is<00:01:53.200> an<00:01:53.320> animal<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:54.070> coral<00:01:54.340> has<00:01:54.520> the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
coral is an animal the coral has the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.000 
coral is an animal the coral has the
little<00:01:54.790> algie's<00:01:55.330> within<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.840> which<00:01:56.560> rely<00:01:56.979> on

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
little algie's within it which rely on

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.550 
little algie's within it which rely on
light<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:57.880> we<00:01:58.000> must<00:01:58.300> have<00:01:58.540> enough<00:01:58.780> light<00:01:59.050> we

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
light so we must have enough light we

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.890 
light so we must have enough light we
also<00:01:59.710> must<00:02:00.070> have<00:02:00.220> enough<00:02:00.550> water<00:02:00.820> flow<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.690> wash

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
also must have enough water flow to wash

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.380 
also must have enough water flow to wash
away<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.229> waste<00:02:02.680> from<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.070> coal<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.670> also<00:02:04.330> to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
away the waste from the coal and also to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.630 
away the waste from the coal and also to
bring<00:02:04.660> new<00:02:04.930> nutrients<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.800> coral<00:02:06.220> itself

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
bring new nutrients to the coral itself

bring new nutrients to the coral itself
a<00:02:07.000> coral<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> sense<00:02:08.500> all<00:02:08.709> organism<00:02:09.369> which

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
a coral is a sense all organism which

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.449 
a coral is a sense all organism which
means<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.390> can't<00:02:10.840> actually<00:02:11.080> move<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.250> wherever

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
means it can't actually move so wherever

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.220 
means it can't actually move so wherever
you<00:02:12.790> position<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.390> coral<00:02:13.720> in<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> aquarium

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
you position the coral in the aquarium

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.050 
you position the coral in the aquarium
is<00:02:14.470> where<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.220> pretty<00:02:15.430> much<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.000> stay

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
is where it's pretty much going to stay

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.840 
is where it's pretty much going to stay
on<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:17.440> other<00:02:17.560> hand<00:02:17.890> there's<00:02:18.160> also<00:02:18.220> Fung

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
on the other hand there's also Fung

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.670 
on the other hand there's also Fung
gears<00:02:19.150> which<00:02:19.330> looked<00:02:19.600> just<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.050> coral<00:02:20.500> and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
gears which looked just like a coral and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.850

excrete<00:02:21.550> calcium<00:02:22.090> carbonate<00:02:22.630> bases<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.680> they

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
excrete calcium carbonate bases but they

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.610 
excrete calcium carbonate bases but they
can<00:02:24.160> move<00:02:24.489> along<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.030> bottom<00:02:25.290> there's<00:02:26.290> also

main types of corals that you're likely
to<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.120> involved<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.810> are<00:02:56.019> soft<00:02:56.650> corals<00:02:57.130> and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
to be involved in are soft corals and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.360 
to be involved in are soft corals and
hard<00:02:58.060> corals<00:02:58.600> basically<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> hard<00:02:59.800> coral<00:03:00.250> is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
hard corals basically a hard coral is

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.840 
hard corals basically a hard coral is
any<00:03:00.580> coral<00:03:00.940> retracts<00:03:01.540> into<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:02.440> hard<00:03:02.850> calcium

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
any coral retracts into a hard calcium

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.600 
any coral retracts into a hard calcium
carbonate<00:03:04.450> base<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.830> other<00:03:05.980> hand<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.340> soft

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
carbonate base on the other hand a soft

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.540 
carbonate base on the other hand a soft
coral<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.420> either<00:03:07.600> contract<00:03:08.590> or<00:03:08.980> droop<00:03:09.370> over

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
coral will either contract or droop over

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.470 
coral will either contract or droop over
that<00:03:10.390> into<00:03:10.750> itself<00:03:11.200> not<00:03:11.860> into<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> hard<00:03:12.880> calcium

that into itself not into a hard calcium
carbonate<00:03:14.019> base<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.950> when<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.130> soft<00:03:15.580> coral<00:03:15.910> dies

carbonate base so when a soft coral dies

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.300 
carbonate base so when a soft coral dies
nothing<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.320> basically<00:03:17.800> left<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.280> that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
nothing is basically left in that

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.000
