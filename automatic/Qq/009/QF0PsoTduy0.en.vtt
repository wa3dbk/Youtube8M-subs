00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
about what would he attribute this

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.370 
about what would he attribute this
recent<00:00:34.860> success<00:00:35.280> too<00:00:35.809> um<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.140> don't<00:00:37.230> think

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
recent success too um I don't think

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.729 
recent success too um I don't think
there's<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.739> thing<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:39.270> could<00:00:39.719> point<00:00:40.620> my

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
there's one thing that I could point my

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.200 
there's one thing that I could point my
finger<00:00:40.800> into<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.340> say<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.790> why<00:00:42.030> we're

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
finger into and say this is why we're

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.940 
finger into and say this is why we're
successful<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.809> think<00:00:43.079> there's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.770> lot<00:00:43.890> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
successful I think there's a lot of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.750 
successful I think there's a lot of
factors<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.210> into<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:46.489> one<00:00:47.489> beam

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
factors I think that go into it one beam

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.690 
factors I think that go into it one beam
you<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.289> new<00:00:49.440> residency<00:00:49.860> program<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
you know the new residency program and

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.819 
you know the new residency program and
blame<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.149> gives<00:00:51.480> Angela<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.140> myself<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
blame it gives Angela and myself and the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
blame it gives Angela and myself and the
audit<00:00:53.070> college<00:00:53.340> players<00:00:53.579> opportunity<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
audit college players opportunity to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.189 
audit college players opportunity to
compete<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> high<00:00:55.350> level<00:00:55.500> level<00:00:56.340> every<00:00:56.670> day

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
compete at a high level level every day

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.750 
compete at a high level level every day
so<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.379> one<00:00:58.590> huge<00:00:58.800> factor<00:00:59.280> another<00:00:59.579> huge

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so that's one huge factor another huge

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.720 
so that's one huge factor another huge
factor<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> team<00:01:01.859> within<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
factor is I think as a team within the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.369 
factor is I think as a team within the
last<00:01:02.760> two<00:01:03.149> years<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> turnover<00:01:03.899> from<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
last two years with a turnover from the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.200 
last two years with a turnover from the
2006<00:01:05.040> Olympics<00:01:05.869> we<00:01:06.869> realized<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:08.210> need

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
2006 Olympics we realized that we need

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
2006 Olympics we realized that we need
to<00:01:09.330> go<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.600> compete<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> league<00:01:10.439> tournament

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
to go and compete at a league tournament

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.830 
to go and compete at a league tournament
I<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.640> times<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.210> were<00:01:12.270> satisfied<00:01:12.540> with

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
I think at times we were satisfied with

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200 
I think at times we were satisfied with
just<00:01:13.140> where<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> USA<00:01:13.890> jersey<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.520> being

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
just where in the USA jersey and being

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
just where in the USA jersey and being
happy<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:16.920> realized

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
happy about it but I think we realized

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.950 
happy about it but I think we realized
that<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> compete<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that if we got to compete we can be the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.020 
that if we got to compete we can be the
best<00:01:19.170> team<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> world<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.220> think

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
best team in the world and I think

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
best team in the world and I think
that's<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.509> reason<00:01:21.750> why<00:01:22.380> we've<00:01:22.619> been

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that's one reason why we've been

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.200 
that's one reason why we've been
successful<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.340> past<00:01:23.610> year<00:01:23.850> winning<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
successful this past year winning the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
successful this past year winning the
World<00:01:24.390> Championships<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> Four<00:01:25.500> Nations

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
World Championships and the Four Nations

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.020 
World Championships and the Four Nations
last<00:01:26.130> week<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:28.200> then<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.070> January

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
last week and then you know in January

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
last week and then you know in January
when<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.360> named<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> coach<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.290> that's

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
when they named a coach I think that's

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.649 
when they named a coach I think that's
gonna<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> good<00:01:32.100> piece<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.520> puzzle<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
gonna be a good piece of the puzzle to

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.330 
gonna be a good piece of the puzzle to
help<00:01:33.810> us<00:01:33.930> move<00:01:34.079> forward<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> Olympics<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
help us move forward to the Olympics in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.969 
help us move forward to the Olympics in
a<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.729> positive<00:01:35.970> way<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.619> we<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.829> gotta

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
a very positive way so we just gotta

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.620 
a very positive way so we just gotta
continue<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.430> build<00:01:38.640> off<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> success<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.479> had

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
continue to build off the success we had

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
continue to build off the success we had
this<00:01:39.780> last<00:01:40.020> past<00:01:40.229> year<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.850> if<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.270> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
this last past year and if we do that I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.910 
this last past year and if we do that I
think<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.840> guy's<00:01:43.079> limit<00:01:43.439> for<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.680> team

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
think this guy's limit for this team

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.030 
think this guy's limit for this team
