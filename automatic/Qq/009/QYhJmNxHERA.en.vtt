plus one you have to now add one more so
we<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.640> one<00:02:28.540> two<00:02:28.890> three<00:02:29.890> now<00:02:30.519> for<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.909> next

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
we have one two three now for the next

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.479 
we have one two three now for the next
problems<00:02:31.689> we<00:02:31.900> are<00:02:32.109> going<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.470> use<00:02:32.709> toothpicks

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
problems we are going to use toothpicks

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.300 
problems we are going to use toothpicks
they're<00:02:33.760> tied<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.299> groups<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.959> tens<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.530> we

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
they're tied in groups of tens and we

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.069 
they're tied in groups of tens and we
have<00:02:36.519> similar<00:02:36.879> toothpicks<00:02:37.299> over<00:02:37.540> here<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:38.019> are

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
have similar toothpicks over here we are

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.039 
have similar toothpicks over here we are
going<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.379> use<00:02:38.530> them<00:02:38.829> for<00:02:38.859> us

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
going to use them for us

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.369 
going to use them for us
we<00:02:41.049> are<00:02:41.139> now<00:02:41.260> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.709> add<00:02:42.090> three<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.379> ninety

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
we are now going to add three and ninety

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.599 
we are now going to add three and ninety
for<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.159> we<00:02:45.609> are<00:02:45.700> going<00:02:45.879> to<00:02:45.970> take<00:02:46.209> nine<00:02:46.599> tens

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
for that we are going to take nine tens

00:02:47.609 --> 00:03:02.990 
for that we are going to take nine tens
ten<00:02:49.829> 20<00:02:50.829> 30<00:02:52.980> 40<00:02:54.209> 50<00:02:56.040> 60<00:02:57.040> 70<00:02:58.019> 80<00:02:59.459> and<00:03:01.139> 90<00:03:02.139> each

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
ten 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 each

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.470 
ten 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 each
bundle<00:03:04.000> has<00:03:04.480> ten<00:03:04.900> sticks<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.310> we<00:03:06.459> have<00:03:06.639> 90<00:03:06.909> here

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
bundle has ten sticks so we have 90 here

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.530 
bundle has ten sticks so we have 90 here
and<00:03:07.720> now<00:03:08.319> we<00:03:08.379> have<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.829> add<00:03:09.010> three<00:03:09.579> more<00:03:09.609> so<00:03:10.419> we

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and now we have to add three more so we

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.039 
and now we have to add three more so we
take<00:03:10.780> single<00:03:11.290> toothpicks<00:03:11.769> as<00:03:12.040> 91<00:03:13.859> 92<00:03:14.859> and<00:03:17.699> 93

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
take single toothpicks as 91 92 and 93

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.949 
take single toothpicks as 91 92 and 93
20<00:03:20.049> plus<00:03:20.530> seven<00:03:21.069> you're<00:03:21.879> going<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.150> take<00:03:22.359> 20

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
20 plus seven you're going to take 20

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.250 
20 plus seven you're going to take 20
first<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.889> is<00:03:24.099> 10<00:03:24.340> plus<00:03:24.849> 10<00:03:25.120> makes<00:03:25.449> 20<00:03:25.959> and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
first this is 10 plus 10 makes 20 and

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:35.490 
first this is 10 plus 10 makes 20 and
then<00:03:27.159> we<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.430> 21<00:03:28.290> 22<00:03:29.290> 23<00:03:30.220> 24<00:03:30.840> 25<00:03:32.400> 26<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.500> 27

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
then we have 21 22 23 24 25 26 and 27

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.069 
then we have 21 22 23 24 25 26 and 27
that's<00:03:36.190> our<00:03:36.340> answer

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
that's our answer

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.580 
that's our answer
for<00:03:38.079> more<00:03:38.590> than<00:03:38.620> 70<00:03:39.549> here<00:03:40.510> we<00:03:40.690> have<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.900> make<00:03:41.049> 70

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
for more than 70 here we have to make 70

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.159 
for more than 70 here we have to make 70
first<00:03:41.859> and<00:03:42.220> then<00:03:42.729> we<00:03:42.879> have<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.180> add<00:03:43.329> 4<00:03:43.750> more<00:03:43.780> in

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
first and then we have to add 4 more in

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.000 
first and then we have to add 4 more in
that<00:03:44.379> to<00:03:45.340> make<00:03:45.489> 70<00:03:46.030> we<00:03:46.180> have<00:03:46.419> 7<00:03:47.409> bundles<00:03:47.829> of

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
that to make 70 we have 7 bundles of

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:57.119 
that to make 70 we have 7 bundles of
tens<00:03:48.310> that's<00:03:49.209> 10<00:03:49.599> 20<00:03:50.519> 30<00:03:51.519> 40<00:03:52.620> 50<00:03:53.620> 60<00:03:54.449> and<00:03:55.620> 70<00:03:56.620> now

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
tens that's 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 now

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:03.649 
tens that's 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 now
we<00:03:57.189> need<00:03:57.519> 4<00:03:57.879> more<00:03:58.229> so<00:03:59.229> we<00:03:59.409> have<00:03:59.439> 71<00:04:00.419> 72<00:04:01.419> 73<00:04:02.370> and

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
we need 4 more so we have 71 72 73 and

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.659 
we need 4 more so we have 71 72 73 and
74
