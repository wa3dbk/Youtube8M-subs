00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
and opened okay so finally I got it open

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.910 
and opened okay so finally I got it open
this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.409> challenge<00:02:04.830> to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
this is a little bit of a challenge to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.580 
this is a little bit of a challenge to
get<00:02:05.010> it<00:02:05.070> open<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:06.510> know<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.870> be<00:02:07.020> prepare<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
get it open you know just be prepare the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.559 
get it open you know just be prepare the
you<00:02:07.920> need<00:02:08.039> something<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.550> sharp<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.090> open<00:02:09.450> it

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you need something not sharp to open it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.160 
you need something not sharp to open it
with<00:02:09.720> whether<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> scissor<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:12.170> Stanley

knife or whatever you might have
so<00:02:15.560> inside<00:02:16.560> we've<00:02:16.890> got<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.430> operating<00:02:18.360> and

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
so inside we've got the operating and

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.820 
so inside we've got the operating and
safety<00:02:19.770> instructions<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:22.080> lots<00:02:22.650> of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
safety instructions so lots of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.699 
safety instructions so lots of
information<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.459> read<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.350> then<00:02:25.350> in

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
information to read there and then in

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:40.640 
information to read there and then in
the<00:02:25.830> packaging<00:02:26.400> comes<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.800> silver<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:39.650> then

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
the packaging comes this silver and then

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.160 
the packaging comes this silver and then
in<00:02:40.830> here<00:02:41.160> we've<00:02:41.400> got<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:45.350> packaging<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.959> we've

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
in here we've got the packaging so we've

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.160 
in here we've got the packaging so we've
got<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.530> unit<00:02:49.890> itself<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:51.180> I'm<00:02:51.780> gonna<00:02:51.930> get

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
got the unit itself and I'm gonna get

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.430 
got the unit itself and I'm gonna get
this<00:02:52.320> out<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.650> way<00:02:53.570> so<00:02:54.570> we've<00:02:54.690> got<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.110> two

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
this out of the way so we've got the two

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.040 
this out of the way so we've got the two
parts<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.860> come<00:02:56.310> with<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.090> packaging<00:02:57.630> now

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
parts that come with the packaging now

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.500 
parts that come with the packaging now
let<00:02:58.950> me<00:02:59.040> just<00:02:59.220> make<00:02:59.340> sure<00:02:59.400> because<00:03:00.209> there

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
let me just make sure because there

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.170 
let me just make sure because there
isn't<00:03:00.690> anything<00:03:01.019> else<00:03:01.320> there<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:04.910> inside<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
isn't anything else there is inside the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.509 
isn't anything else there is inside the
packaging<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.019> two<00:03:07.829> other<00:03:08.010> things<00:03:10.280> for<00:03:11.280> one

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
packaging is two other things for one

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.280 
packaging is two other things for one
you<00:03:12.299> get<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.810> brush<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.360> two<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.750> comes<00:03:16.049> with<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
you get a brush and two it comes with a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.310 
you get a brush and two it comes with a
plastic<00:03:16.680> cover<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.519> says<00:03:17.820> man<00:03:18.180> groomer<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
plastic cover that says man groomer that

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.539 
plastic cover that says man groomer that
actually<00:03:19.739> goes<00:03:20.010> over<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.850> top<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:22.549> my

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
actually goes over the top and my

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.670 
actually goes over the top and my
initial<00:03:23.940> thoughts<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.600> sign<00:03:25.019> it's<00:03:25.290> got<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> nice

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
initial thoughts of sign it's got a nice

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.590 
initial thoughts of sign it's got a nice
soft<00:03:26.100> rubber<00:03:26.430> feel<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.950> can<00:03:29.450> let's<00:03:30.450> see

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
soft rubber feel to it you can let's see

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.600 
soft rubber feel to it you can let's see
see<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.380> do<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.829> couple<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.310> different

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
see you can do it a couple of different

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.000 
see you can do it a couple of different
settings<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.120> guess<00:03:33.329> that's<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.560> full

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
settings I guess that's the full

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.509 
settings I guess that's the full
extension<00:03:35.370> there<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.920> then

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
extension there and then you can then

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.270 
extension there and then you can then
have<00:03:39.239> easy<00:03:39.450> access<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.019> your<00:03:40.170> back<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.650> again

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
have easy access to your back and again

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.770 
have easy access to your back and again
if<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.579> want<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.880> extend<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.329> further<00:03:42.600> you've

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
if you want to extend the further you've

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.080 
if you want to extend the further you've
got<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.019> button<00:03:43.350> here<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:44.670> looks<00:03:44.820> like<00:03:44.880> I

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
got this button here and it looks like I

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.539 
got this button here and it looks like I
think<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.420> press<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.470> then<00:03:46.769> you've<00:03:47.340> got

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
think you press that and then you've got

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.310 
think you press that and then you've got
a<00:03:47.579> further<00:03:47.910> extension<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.750> really<00:03:49.140> can

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
a further extension so you really can

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.220 
a further extension so you really can
get<00:03:49.440> down<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:50.360> lower<00:03:51.360> part<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.840> your<00:03:51.900> back

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
get down to the lower part of your back

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.970 
get down to the lower part of your back
so<00:03:52.650> very<00:03:53.190> cool<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.959> also<00:03:55.140> have<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.799> and

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
so very cool you also have your on and

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.180 
so very cool you also have your on and
off<00:03:56.100> button<00:03:56.160> there<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.859> that<00:03:58.859> sounds<00:03:59.100> like

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
off button there and that sounds like

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.810 
off button there and that sounds like
it's<00:03:59.370> actually<00:03:59.549> ready<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.970> go<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:01.700> again<00:04:02.700> this

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
it's actually ready to go so again this

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.860 
it's actually ready to go so again this
is<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.230> professional<00:04:04.230> version<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:06.510> then

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
is the professional version and and then

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.110 
is the professional version and and then
I<00:04:06.900> guess<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.500> close<00:04:07.860> this<00:04:08.190> extender<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.910> just

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
I guess to close this extender you just

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.990 
I guess to close this extender you just
close<00:04:09.750> that

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.020 

and<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.349> just<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.920> guess<00:04:14.280> if<00:04:14.730> you<00:04:14.849> have<00:04:14.939> a

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
and you can just I guess if you have a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.219 
and you can just I guess if you have a
bag<00:04:15.180> or<00:04:15.359> something<00:04:15.390> I<00:04:15.569> want<00:04:15.689> to<00:04:15.719> put<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.019> in

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
bag or something I want to put this in

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.529 
bag or something I want to put this in
you<00:04:16.680> can<00:04:16.829> do<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.009> so<00:04:17.850> again<00:04:18.090> these<00:04:18.269> are<00:04:18.329> the

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
you can do that so again these are the

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.860 
you can do that so again these are the
three<00:04:18.900> parts<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.919> have<00:04:20.039> come<00:04:20.190> together<00:04:20.430> and

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
three parts that have come together and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.820 
three parts that have come together and
and<00:04:21.870> then<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.139> course<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.470> got<00:04:22.620> your

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
and then of course you got your

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.460 
and then of course you got your
instruction<00:04:23.370> sheet<00:04:24.020> let<00:04:25.020> me<00:04:25.110> see<00:04:25.289> if<00:04:25.380> there's

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
instruction sheet let me see if there's

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.610 
instruction sheet let me see if there's
anything<00:04:25.860> else<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:27.120> share<00:04:27.600> with<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.930> as<00:04:28.259> far

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
anything else to share with you as far
