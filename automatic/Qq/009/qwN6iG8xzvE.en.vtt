 a look at his look here from the storm 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 spiritism does not look like the face of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.180
 mortal kombat for those who had game 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.859
 mortal kombat remember very well not 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.779
 remembering the affection but it seems to be in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.119
 weighed the values ​​that the other 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 raulzinho sa first study storm let's 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.870
 there to see what is the first time that makes it 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.450
 she has a copy of Storm himself 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.000
 gives an area damage and this damage him 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.920
 increases as the last 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.270
 a radius of 261 or its area is 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.250
 260 also area then and is the 12 second 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.140
 this snake you can do until 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 four straight copies 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.449
 before disappearing human the two three not 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.210
 make the cup here now will assume the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.100
 another dilates and it is the time that lasts the copy 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.780
 that those who pass on these copies have not yet 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.310
 I'm going to use it here near the lean field 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.799
 for you to have an idea the magician has died 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.710
 the second time the storm 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.570
 enemy that is, it pulls the enemy with 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.820
 a certain maximum level two duration 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.479
 seconds and a half and only it has a detail 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.650
 story ends up losing 50% of 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.200
 speed let's pull here for you to see 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.540
 the superb 50% for three seconds 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.799
 lightest for three seconds 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.420
 so he ended up shocked to be left undone 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.640
 Nothing in this second, not only that if you 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.220
 stay alert for three seconds 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.590
 also does not impede anything hinders at all 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.180
 this beauty that you get when you 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.040
 Pull the guy, can you walk? 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.659
 anything does not have to stand still 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.890
 and the bud can walk on instead of 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.399
 highlight he will get stuck in this 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.890
 center vortex here then you can 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.390
 do various things as the car arrives 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.579
 in more detail let's go 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.159
 the third skill that makes 76 which is a 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.950
 passive that she slows the movement 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.170
 80% slow food on the face gives a fit soon 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.580
 at the beginning also a duration of six 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.619
 seconds 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.730
 how does it work when you do not 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.730
 postpones the storm it creates a 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.860
 a radio as if it were 11 ours 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.659
 there a field in his hand I will use to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.640
 You'll see in more detail I'll go 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.310
 use the one that takes a look at their hand 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.340
 looked looked used I was like distance 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.580
 here calling and were beating a 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.319
 area damage and still change the slogan to 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.319
 to use again that in these two 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.030
 links walking area and longer 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.579
 chicken other attacks 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.260
 and then it's a great writing if the 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.500
 pact any magic you use 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.870
 Storm both to pull the copy is 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.810
 can beat down slow to pull 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.459
 manages to beat down slow and ultimate 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.170
 opened the game and said he wanted to 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.760
 I had to talk about them and I also noticed 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.349
 any margin and use 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.769
 Come on what the team does and I'm done. 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.250
 using here lately he plays with it 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:07.480
 plays at a distance according to the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:11.379
 Your mana because you spend the mana is according 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.940
 he spends a percentage of his mana and 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.579
 The speed at which he plays varies from 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.230
 according to the level and if the area 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.459
 gives you the damage also varies according to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.760
 The level and amanda the course of the mana is 15 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.120
 plus 7% of your mana total ie 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.910
 of this total demand that 2 700 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.000
 is this percentage in relation to the week 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.160
 What did you call a monkey? 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.950
 it spends the initial cost of 200 human 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.380
 but what was wasting were more 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.989
 so let's see if give any more 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:50.709
 thing is in courses in units darkness of the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:53.019
 dogma the demand that left you the activation 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.849
 it spends 15 but 7% of the total hand and 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.340
 then how long he's been traveling 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:02.290
 spent another 10 percent of the total 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.660
 mana the damage it is dispensed the damage to 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.150
 also kind of cradles 100 units 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.959
 lego says I do not know how the damage works if 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.190
 which gives you a damage 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.530
 according to the size of the trip is this 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.680
 even as the damage so much that he 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.169
 travels it hurts I probably 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.060
 I'm going to kill the newspaper clip tina bee 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.550
 Life looks like he imagines the clip 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.060
 then according to the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.090
 is the distance increases damage and this damage 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.190
 in hal it's like as I said here from 275 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.870
 in everything he crosses the road that 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.180
 are going through it will give the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.419
 damage is so interesting to use here 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.979
 further back, they awaited the 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:47.680
 opinion and clip that is coming 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:49.150
 to 45 not to go here taking the clips and 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.460
 abating human 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.919
 everything passes in this ray of this line 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.780
 and it's a damage and that's what things are 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.719
 I hate to talk about the items, what 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.129
 do to the storm spirit 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:03.340
 I usually do for history this 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.650
 media that even just before that what 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.569
 I do here I usually take a break 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.919
 and trix but before making the power tribes 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.810
 I produce a boot week because 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.310
 I'm going to do a lot of story to 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.599
 do some history you need 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.840
 energie butt 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.370
 so with the energie bout you already have to 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.990
 buy your set with the demand boot 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.389
 already does a routine demand because you have 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.969
 goodstone grana you separate the booty 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.099
 week and ride on stone 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.900
 done in many games will make the 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.509
 course was done was a violence that the 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.389
 chade here to stop being worth violence that 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.520
 is a great item that gives birds in the 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.560
 guys and then the goal says what's more 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.199
 another saying ah and if there is left thinking 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.569
 well and this makes a mash vaz also a 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.430
 great item to make links too 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.830
 depending on the game is good even up 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.400
 make way for an excellent one for him 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:59.889
 So that's a thousand said that I usually 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.599
 To make a show is good I'll show a horny 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.190
 It's true that people usually use 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.930
 There are a lot of people who do not know 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.050
 but there must also be many people who know 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.729
 This is when you play with history. 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.069
 Let's talk a little bit about the combo. 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.940
 usually when you're the guy plays 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.800
 and circus face loose copy hits and the guy 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.080
 will have a device play again 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.539
 Why did she pull and play with him? 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.310
 will not fix your cheap and paints and 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.900
 see that cheap animation and play 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.120
 on the other hand, external 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.800
 so it was that when he is 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.310
 joking like that does not mean that 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.270
 innumerable the storm is very interesting 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.210
 something that is interesting too 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.460
 When you travel this way, I do not know if 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.830
 everybody knows but to the malevolence mouth 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.520
 that I will travel here in Christ targeted 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.470
 no mage 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.170
 before I arrive I can already use the 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.150
 violence has also been on sites before 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.090
 even reaching the ground so much 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.340
 People do not know this is much easier. 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.590
 in the combos, that is, play in the car and already 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.220
 giving the malevolence then took out the cajá 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.920
 will not have any reaction 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:08.970
 he is going to run out of power just imagine and 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:11.310
 nothing you end up feeding him and then 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.700
 This is it, people, the storm that you 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.020
 have enjoyed this tutorial and not 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:20.070
 come back again here is majority 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.990
 for you to have an idea I used it already 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:25.610
 the test cache and took the year after 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.610
 still so much 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.690
 I believe that doing the same thing 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.480
 probably the same thing I actually have 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:39.990
 almost sure that the func 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.330
 but I will try here just to just to take 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.710
 doubt if kong works I know the 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.930
 Most discussions this way 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.000
 works kobe how each 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:49.710
 shakespeare that there has to say 'good 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.880
 and everything else will work 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.680
 so this is it now I hope you 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.140
 have enjoyed house the story spirit 

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.610
 here liking pure favorite favor for 

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:01.400
 help channel growth us 

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.400
 Thank you all a hug and I went
