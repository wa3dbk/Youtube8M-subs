00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.500 
hospital but it's pretty much explaining
you<00:03:27.010> know<00:03:27.100> what<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.340> went<00:03:27.550> through<00:03:27.640> saying<00:03:28.390> it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
you know what I went through saying it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.670 
you know what I went through saying it
can<00:03:28.630> be<00:03:28.720> caused<00:03:28.900> by<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.080> couple<00:03:29.410> different

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
can be caused by a couple different

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.890 
can be caused by a couple different
things<00:03:29.709> which<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.700> even<00:03:31.090> more<00:03:31.120> reason<00:03:31.570> for<00:03:31.840> me

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
things which is even more reason for me

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.050 
things which is even more reason for me
to<00:03:32.050> go<00:03:32.290> get<00:03:33.010> my<00:03:33.160> blood<00:03:33.340> work<00:03:33.550> done<00:03:33.700> which<00:03:33.940> I

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
to go get my blood work done which I

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.090 
to go get my blood work done which I
have<00:03:34.239> not<00:03:34.390> done<00:03:34.450> maybe<00:03:35.230> there's<00:03:35.470> some<00:03:35.680> vitamin

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
have not done maybe there's some vitamin

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.560 
have not done maybe there's some vitamin
or<00:03:36.190> something<00:03:36.459> i'm<00:03:36.550> liking<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.150> says<00:03:37.360> that

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
or something i'm liking it it says that

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.180 
or something i'm liking it it says that
a<00:03:37.600> low<00:03:37.810> magnesium<00:03:38.170> can<00:03:38.590> call<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.950> caused

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
a low magnesium can call that caused

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.430 
a low magnesium can call that caused
this<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.660> definitely<00:03:40.840> something<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.290> need

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
this so that definitely something I need

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.470
