thing<00:00:57.879> I<00:00:58.000> can't<00:00:58.329> see<00:00:58.659> it's<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.409> little<00:00:59.559> less

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920

thing I can't see it's a little less
glossy<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:01.600> I<00:01:01.629> think<00:01:01.930> that's<00:01:02.109> because<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.439> kind

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
glossy but I think that's because I kind

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.009 
glossy but I think that's because I kind
of<00:01:02.829> sprayed<00:01:03.189> over<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.699> again<00:01:03.820> when<00:01:04.600> I<00:01:04.629> did<00:01:04.750> this

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
of sprayed over it again when I did this

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.440 
of sprayed over it again when I did this
coat<00:01:05.320> over<00:01:05.619> here

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
coat over here

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.350 
coat over here
but<00:01:07.990> it's<00:01:08.439> no<00:01:09.220> damage<00:01:09.520> at<00:01:09.640> all<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.180> thought

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
but it's no damage at all and I thought

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.880 
but it's no damage at all and I thought
it<00:01:10.509> would<00:01:10.630> be<00:01:10.750> there<00:01:10.900> there<00:01:11.439> will<00:01:11.560> be<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.680> lot<00:01:11.860> of

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
it would be there there will be a lot of

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.719 
it would be there there will be a lot of
damage<00:01:12.070> because<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:13.659> work<00:01:13.869> I<00:01:14.170> sprayed<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:15.130> piece

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
damage because at work I sprayed a piece

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.969 
damage because at work I sprayed a piece
of<00:01:15.880> scrap<00:01:16.119> home<00:01:16.420> but<00:01:17.229> I<00:01:17.259> think<00:01:17.500> it<00:01:17.590> wasn't<00:01:17.740> as

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
of scrap home but I think it wasn't as

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.760 
of scrap home but I think it wasn't as
tough<00:01:18.220> as<00:01:18.399> this<00:01:18.610> was<00:01:19.540> real<00:01:19.750> soft<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:20.439> it<00:01:20.560> ate

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
tough as this was real soft and it ate

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.730 
tough as this was real soft and it ate
it<00:01:20.890> away<00:01:21.070> like<00:01:21.280> acid<00:01:21.790> wood<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.570> skin

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
it away like acid wood on the skin

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.679 
it away like acid wood on the skin
completely<00:01:24.369> completely<00:01:24.939> toured<00:01:25.329> through<00:01:25.570> it

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
completely completely toured through it

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.010
