00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.470
 I have 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.910
 Hello 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.910
 hello girls how are they but it is 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.940
 they find very well because this is the tag 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.870
 My nails and I have already been nominated 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.750
 enough time but I had not been able 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.629
 was nominated by resident and nativity that 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.660
 first one is to the terminal then I'm going to 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.600
 try to do it fast what's your name 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.750
 in my name is shilling about how many 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.310
 years you have on April 15 is 27 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.100
 married or single married 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.780
 what products of tricks do you like to use or 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.200
 you would like to use to taste come out and imc 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.060
 I also like to try new brands and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.280
 I would love to use in that 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.070
 you have children and how you organize for 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.810
 make nails and I have a 2 year old baby and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.789
 well apparently I do not organize very well 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.930
 because as you know it almost always comes out 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.120
 there in the videos 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.840
 you are cheap were your nails good I 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.359
 honestly I do not do it from the business 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.890
 and you do not like about some clients well 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.259
 here I want to open a small parenthesis 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.759
 since many of you in my video 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.679
 earlier they asked me why not 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.159
 I have clients because I do not do it 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:50.310
 business honestly because I do not like it 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.500
 put a is I like to put nails myself 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.230
 but she did not have nails 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.390
 shop I do not like I feel that this is 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.540
 like my little world and if I'm 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.149
 angry 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.490
 overwhelmed I come I lose an hour two 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.979
 hours practicing and return to 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.580
 actually I do not see this as a 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.330
 way to get money 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.820
 Not me 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.980
 pretend that when I do because if 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.750
 has served clients but when I 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.720
 I attend a client I feel like 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.950
 invade something that is very child my place my 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.670
 space 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.540
 honestly, I do not see it as a 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.579
 way to get money 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.280
 but I'm not saying I'll never do it 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:37.069
 because as it says the fastest there is 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.700
 a talker that a lame now better if 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.580
 in any case next 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.800
 I had the need to do it I would 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.430
 more would not be my first choice 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.519
 I think I would first look for work 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.840
 my career and exhaust and other options 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:01.240
 before I put myself to zero business 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:04.360
 because this is my space my place 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.240
 something very child then not 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.270
 I do not like the idea of having clients 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.150
 the simple truth is that 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.800
 It does not give me a satisfaction to have a 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.820
 client 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.120
 so I prefer it to be something for 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.120
 my 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.540
 something that I enjoy and that I like 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.150
 do but nothing else 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.230
 honestly not to me that of having 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.430
 clients how do you want 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:39.530
 It is not my maximum because I feel that this 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:42.790
 is my little one with my place for me 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:48.080
 like having a cassano span something for you 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.150
 well decoration you prefer to use me 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.400
 love the leader I think it's from the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.280
 decoration that I like the most 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.950
 and food you like more the mole 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.540
 what color do you like I like white the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.610
 purple and turquoise blue 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.890
 Some page or place to buy 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.569
 favorite nail products yo 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.150
 I honestly do not buy much for 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.069
 internet but if I can recommend it to 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.009
 the girl of one of them here I'm going to 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.799
 leave facebook is a very girl 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:21.560
 reliable very very safe I to her 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.180
 I bought the denim and the truth is that I 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.480
 it came super fast nothing 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.970
 there is no distrust 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.190
 what videos of youtube nails do you like 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.020
 see actually while the nail is on me 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.629
 like to see all 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.830
 I would like to make an exchange with 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.830
 who and why 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.130
 yes yes I would like to make an exchange 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.860
 but I do not have a specific person 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.630
 I would like to do it with, I feel 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.360
 that all exchanges are beautiful 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.290
 because they send you things they are looking for 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.070
 you 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.980
 who take the time to 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.600
 to see if you're going to like it 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.150
 well and well these are all the questions 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.860
 I do not expect not to have them angry and I want 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.740
 that most already and drop but I'm going to 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.480
 check who is missing and leave them my 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.610
 unnamed here at the end of the video 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.720
 good that they are well we see ourselves in the 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.720
