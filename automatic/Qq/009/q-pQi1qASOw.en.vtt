00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.600

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.290
 I remember only collar 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.440
 then it's a new type it really is 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.050
 important because effective against the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.130
 dragon food is also a lot of little bit 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.799

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.810
 new as it's called I'm called two 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.159
 of them a 3ds actually what 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.049
 if they were all the same games a 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.720
 almost all the same features only 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.640
 does not have the screen with the 3d effect 15 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.649
 year for a while I don't mean for everyone either 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.659
 an economic version that can therefore 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.490
 to interest those who are not interesting 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.439
 3d effect but playing games for 3ds 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.420
 a hundred percent per hour for all but 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.520
 tell me your favorite people myself 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.049
 I could have preferred eta inflation which is one 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.240
 pokemon of pokemon gold and 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.399
 silver and a better solution than like 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.500
 so much a solution that I really like and 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.959
 leg the exhaust that serves a rock star 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.390
 of zocca xo yy 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.579
 and why respect the cover but here 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.260
 he likes the cover then mariotti 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.630
 my then I know that with this not 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.210
 we can play online 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.650
 yes there is like also episodes of the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.360
 previous generations there is the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.780
 But online functionality is a lot now 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.740
 more developed 6 the function of the player 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.120
 search that the pss that allows 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.830
 save a lower diagram the list 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.230
 of your friends who are connected and 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.760
 the years connected players you don't have 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.870
 never met and therefore you 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.060
 allow to organize exchanges 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.890
 even casual fights on the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.080
 cts they have in operation to exchange 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.970
 the pokémon asking for someone and going 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.530
 the offer has been improved because 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.240
 now they can look for someone who 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.950
 have not yet seen so there is 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.320
 always fun for everyone with 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.380
 these forces go towards you can really 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.510
 play with everyone arctic this time I am 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.880
 then found me he pointed to damon lorenzo e 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.770
 jacopo our historical player of 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.210
 partisan videogames I want to talk with 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.940
 because I know he had ours 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.920
 little game we preview became like I have 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.660
 finished the main story but still there 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.700
 there are so many things that I have to understand 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.440
 same that I am a fan before 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.450
 among all my evolutions I have not 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.340
 still found all the stones do not 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.860
 hide but better this way because then the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.360
 game 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.360
 but always feel more like playing and 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.390
 takes like every other game has panoramas 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.760
 taken in the past that I started 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.260
 then ow did the first 25 years 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.840
 average and I was given pokemon 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.370
 red I spent my life believe us if 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.900
 I say he spent his life I believe 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.310
 very well i was in first grade 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.620
 you have given red pokemon 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.840
 it makes me laugh because I'm waiting 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.489
 one of those that did not start the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.739
 ship for the legend that where of 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.020
 move the pie truck to lo 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.599
 I swear the legend that I do not 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.459
 where to move with force 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.950
 pickup truck that was next to the ship is 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.830
 found my future guys i tried 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.050
 hours and hours of cigo are me and efficient 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.019
 or certainly not a drop from entering by force 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.300
 in order to find news it's snowing 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.610
 using her trainer who came out later 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.510
 the version was widespread on the internet 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.810
 Italian a swear you swear it wasn't 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.970
 found myself a white gap thief who was a 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.320
 historic player of the first two 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.479
 generations like when he had them 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.220
 baric statement that the former and we say that 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.350
 this group spread in the community 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.120
 just because he was the one we give him though 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.200
 I add because I remember that not 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.480
 he had to host a coach 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.610
 one particular path I don't remember 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.960
 but neither was I a good thing 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.480
 this type must do a series of 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.640
 operations talk to him 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.200
 don't challenge another to fly for 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.490
 going from side to side in short 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.320
 then a whole series of steps 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.630
 directly to find my harp 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.190
 wild but that was not a mistake 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.380
 of the game because I remember that I had 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.120
 found a wrong thing about the island i 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.310
 numbers that I was surfing in a 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.050
 something strange looking more like e 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.260
 that one never arrived 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.580
 it was a deputy who came out 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.650
 by rigging then exit the duties 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.120
 pomari area complete the steps going down 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.950
 towards the sea now back down it does 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.840
 so many times if the thing anymore 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.370
 bad that I really know past 8 now 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.350
 you know how to do as the guide said and to 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.880
 internet to look for it in the grass not 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.650
 I say that it is perhaps more a mistake though 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.540
 I mean at the beginning he didn't know that in 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.770
 games had been entered new had been 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.990
 a surprise even for nintendo 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.900
 I don't understand these things, we talk 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.520
 of this little maris the novelty is 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.170
 internet that you can play on the internet 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.790
 I was already of the previous titles yes 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.230
 can use the internet to search with 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.540
 the players but in this game in 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.980
 particular connectivity will be 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.750
 simplified and filled with modes 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.970
 innovative at any time of the 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.400
 game thanks to the touch screen to the dss 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.650
 players out sister can chat 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.270
 play swap with any other 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.920
 player who is currently connected 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.270
 in a game of tago 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.220
 giorgio's article already have gods 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.870
 little others like that and they go to boys 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.250
 like us 20 25 30 35 years 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.990
 exact and for all ages is enough 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.520
 fall in love and then in this way 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.050
 and always like that but you are a player of 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.060
 this point with xy 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.890
 then I came back with this little 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.580
 they go to play this still room 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.400
 still but we are the player again 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.390
 we are legendary define you 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.880
 legendary of the videogames party 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.160
 tell us a little about your story as it is 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.950
 born part always benefited video games 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.930
 since childhood I am no longer a 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.400
 baby i'm pretty big but i do 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.050
 more inner oar we are always of 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.630
 baby yes absolutely yes 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.920
 among these games the first two 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.430
 generations of pokémon better reason 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.700
 my third vision is very controlled 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.830
 a little less then also for 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.630
 to focus on other study games 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.540
 university students and everything is buzzing 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.640
 this saga with the announcement of xy also 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.260
 because I mean the very clever one 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.440
 move to bet a lot on the first 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.420
 generations, that is , 30 very intelligent 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.610
 I don't remember the first generations 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.190
 they do not have a prominent role in this 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.830
 game is definitely all recall 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.960
 those players who played worldly 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.230
 elementary to middle school or even a little more 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.760
 old men like me make them want to 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.810
 I 'm not playing different people than a 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.610
 she came back she felt like it 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.169
 but to play at modena because of this 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.690
 the voice I go to as a child then we do 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:14.370
 so I call our people employed 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.320
 miu of videogames party because for us 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.150
 makes the legendary incurable exact 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.740
 to say we recommend this pokémon a 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.130
 all our listeners 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.810
