not<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.840> whole<00:00:44.960> lot<00:00:45.170> of<00:00:45.200> color<00:00:45.470> differential

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
not a whole lot of color differential

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.890 
not a whole lot of color differential
that<00:00:46.190> I<00:00:46.220> know<00:00:46.340> of<00:00:46.610> that<00:00:46.640> you<00:00:46.970> can<00:00:47.120> spot<00:00:47.480> they

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
something like that or you can put them

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.919 
something like that or you can put them
on<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:07.490> lighting<00:02:07.880> pattern<00:02:08.269> I'll<00:02:08.450> probably<00:02:08.689> be

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
on a lighting pattern I'll probably be

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.809 
on a lighting pattern I'll probably be
doing<00:02:09.049> a<00:02:09.200> video<00:02:09.319> on<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.829> a<00:02:10.099> little<00:02:10.519> later<00:02:10.700> on

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
doing a video on that a little later on

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.179 
doing a video on that a little later on
a<00:02:11.209> lot<00:02:12.079> of<00:02:12.200> different<00:02:12.470> species<00:02:12.650> that<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.069> can

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.189 
a lot of different species that you can

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.589 
a lot of different species that you can
get<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.430> breed<00:02:13.640> just<00:02:13.939> on<00:02:14.090> base

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
get to breed just on base

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.619 
get to breed just on base
the<00:02:14.840> lighting<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.980> timing<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.609> right<00:02:16.879> so

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
the lighting and timing that right so

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.059 
the lighting and timing that right so
it's<00:02:17.780> kind<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:17.989> interesting<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.709> anyways

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
it's kind of interesting but anyways

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.640 
it's kind of interesting but anyways
back<00:02:19.219> to<00:02:19.280> these<00:02:19.549> guys<00:02:19.870> once<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:21.049> breed<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.499> do

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
back to these guys once I breed you do

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.989 
back to these guys once I breed you do
want<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.859> take<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.129> parents<00:02:22.519> out<00:02:22.639> because

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:22.999 
want to take the parents out because

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.759 
want to take the parents out because
they<00:02:23.269> are<00:02:23.389> gonna<00:02:23.540> eat<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:23.959> young<00:02:24.109> eat<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
they are gonna eat the young eat the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.009 
they are gonna eat the young eat the
eggs<00:02:25.129> everything<00:02:25.670> like<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.749> fry

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
eggs everything like that the fry

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.690 
eggs everything like that the fry
usually<00:02:27.439> hats<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.769> believe<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:28.219> within<00:02:28.459> three

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
usually hats I believe it's within three

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.059 
usually hats I believe it's within three
to<00:02:28.730> four<00:02:28.999> days<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.659> you<00:02:30.499> can<00:02:30.650> start<00:02:30.829> feeding

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
to four days and you can start feeding

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.369 
to four days and you can start feeding
them<00:02:31.219> baby<00:02:31.430> brine<00:02:31.730> shrimp<00:02:31.810> crush<00:02:32.810> flake<00:02:33.139> food

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
them baby brine shrimp crush flake food

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.179 
them baby brine shrimp crush flake food
you<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.799> do<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> yolk<00:02:34.280> mixture<00:02:35.060> for<00:02:35.569> egg<00:02:35.780> yolk

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
you can do a yolk mixture for egg yolk

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.349 
you can do a yolk mixture for egg yolk
but<00:02:37.189> I<00:02:37.219> usually<00:02:37.579> just<00:02:37.730> take<00:02:37.909> the<00:02:38.090> brine<00:02:38.329> shrimp

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
but I usually just take the brine shrimp

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.140 
but I usually just take the brine shrimp
and<00:02:39.099> flake<00:02:40.099> food<00:02:40.280> crush<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.849> up<00:02:40.969> with<00:02:41.090> a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
and flake food crush it up with a

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.449 
and flake food crush it up with a
rolling<00:02:41.359> pin<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.750> ziplock<00:02:42.109> bank<00:02:42.379> and<00:02:42.799> into<00:02:43.250> a

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
rolling pin the ziplock bank and into a

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.580 
rolling pin the ziplock bank and into a
fine<00:02:43.730> powder<00:02:43.939> and<00:02:44.329> it's<00:02:44.450> perfect<00:02:45.019> they<00:02:45.169> gobble

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
fine powder and it's perfect they gobble

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.619 
fine powder and it's perfect they gobble
it<00:02:45.650> right<00:02:45.829> up<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.760> water<00:02:46.969> changes<00:02:47.120> at<00:02:47.599> least

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
it right up do water changes at least

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.110 
it right up do water changes at least
twice<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.079> day<00:02:48.310> or<00:02:49.310> at<00:02:49.459> least<00:02:49.609> every<00:02:49.909> other<00:02:49.939> day

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
twice a day or at least every other day

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.149 
twice a day or at least every other day
at<00:02:50.510> least<00:02:50.629> if<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.079> can<00:02:51.290> do<00:02:51.469> them<00:02:51.590> twice<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.859> day

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
at least if you can do them twice a day

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.709 
at least if you can do them twice a day
and<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:53.030> way<00:02:53.120> you're<00:02:53.269> gonna<00:02:53.389> get<00:02:53.569> the

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:53.719 
and that way you're gonna get the

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.569 
and that way you're gonna get the
optimum<00:02:54.109> growth<00:02:54.349> out<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.560> these<00:02:54.680> guys<00:02:54.919> so

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
optimum growth out of these guys so

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.369 
optimum growth out of these guys so
these<00:02:55.790> guys<00:02:56.030> they're<00:02:56.569> really<00:02:56.870> not<00:02:57.139> all<00:02:57.169> that

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
these guys they're really not all that

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.059 
these guys they're really not all that
picky<00:02:58.750> for<00:02:59.750> any<00:02:59.870> other<00:03:00.109> tank<00:03:00.349> conditions<00:03:00.859> I

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
picky for any other tank conditions I

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.679 
picky for any other tank conditions I
guess<00:03:01.219> I'd<00:03:01.370> usually<00:03:01.669> a<00:03:01.699> ten<00:03:01.939> gallon<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.419> above

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689
