00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.110
 let's go now category mx2 the two benches 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.580
 we will present in this category mx2 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.170
 they are not the strongest of the concept 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.869
 same from before 30 pilots in grid 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:22.660
 excellent panorama that presented auto 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.660
 of the case andrés garcía machine 18 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.400
 this first sleeve the winner was the 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.570
 pilot of clips to cristian fifth 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.840
 second place was for his younger brother 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.070
 volpin todes list also machine 74 in 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.720
 third place was for Alejandro 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.480
 arancibia in the first sleeve with 20 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.650
 units of holy cross while the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 fourth place was occupied by the rider 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.350
 crowned also of santa cruz 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.280
 the fifth place was for the pilot and 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.570
 curly of cochabamba 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.490
 sixth place 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.590
 for Andrea García from Santa Cruz 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.229
 and the seventh fabulous branch of 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.829
 Cochabamba is in the positions in the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.829
 first sleeve 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.369
 great difference that the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.799
 Cochabamba pilots push on the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.560
 national ranking after this third 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.360
 date 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.850
 we repeat again and we are not going to 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.860
 tired of saying it is a prejudice that in 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.350
 Santa Cruz does not have a national date 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.500
 so pilots with dreams can 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.490
 take out can also take advantage in 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.549
 punctuation 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.770
 for your aspirations to be crowned 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.770
 season champions 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.870
 and apparently he would be granted a cup 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.270
 bolivia santa after they finish 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.780
 all dates the seven dates that are 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.729
 the calendar is punctuated 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.770
 there would be the proposal that santa cruz 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.069
 may have a bolivia date a drink 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.069
 bolivia 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.000
 who would serve port not for the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.620
 pilots with dreams simply by the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.200
 just done to participate no more by 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.440
 shine punctually mind would not have 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.440
 advantage 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.040
 running that bolivia cup in what is 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.620
 got 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.780
 in not having a rational date after 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.060
 wrong decisions for us 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.170
 decisions that did not consult with 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.450
 pilots who ran the dates 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.579
 nationals to ask for a license to 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.709
 Santa Cruz does not have a good national date 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.810
 and 2012 also has no date 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.970
 national santa cruz because all the support 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.799
 of the PRD leadership we demand a 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.689
 I dream about the pilots of Santa Cruz in 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.340
 meet the minimum number of pilots 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.879
 Send the regulation as we hear 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.200
 some say that there is no that does not stipulate 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.389
 towards the regulation the lords 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.859
 it's really clear it says at least seven 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.989
 pilots have to meet all the 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.879
 national dates so you 're here 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.819
 can return to have his national position 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.439
 in two members if you do not understand it like that 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.569
 I understand how he wants to 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.540
 leaders your dreams we hope that 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.819
 can sit down to chat 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.599
 and once 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.189

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.930

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.639

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.400

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.590

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.550
 small therefore good you 're not going to 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.470
