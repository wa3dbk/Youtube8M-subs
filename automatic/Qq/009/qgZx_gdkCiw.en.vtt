00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.290
 Hmm 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.550
 Pappa 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:32.770
 Well speaking from my playing style 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:38.019
 Don't let that force break down that aspect and carry your ball forward to decide the ball 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:42.699
 As it is not a type , create a chance while choosing the same image as in the middle name 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:47.230
 And I kind of amazing cars last only say determine the action as a finisher 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.540
 You thought that it is the type that say scorer was won by everyone because 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.540
 Already 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.220
 I really got my own too and was helped around 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.840
 Position that still take the score Speaking of that has changed in me until now in a particular direction 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.820
 To 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.550
 Excellent warriors who can carry you up to that point where you can say that 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.500
 In solo molester but a real 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.190
 Mr Sato is around that 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.460
 I told you that I was helped but I just pulled out the ball 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.930
 And so on 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 I thought I was a player like that and I saw it more and more and more from it. 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:30.149
 While thinking that I want to be a player that can be pulled out 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.950
 Of course the most important thing in me is one by one the flying fore 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.770
 Against the shoot 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:43.009
 Even when that was not decided when to be removed when a fixed Well 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:48.530
 As expected from it, or rather can be a thing of their own learning is firm public is amazing important 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.649
 Even if you have scored a goal, if you have a better response to your opponent 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.680
 Because there are a lot of scenes said to have been prevented 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:59.580
 Ikeru become better as a striker 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.150
 The ones that element to you to look for Well 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.470
 Well such a crime 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:09.399
 Because I think that I can do it because I'm going to create something to say that the pile is going backwards 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:16.100
 I 'm doing it for a long time consciously 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:20.700
 Well the hands of selfishness say of good if wherever you are to take is aware to during the recent 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.180
 Not just being there, at what time there 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.599
 How much 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.240
 I'm very aware of whether I'm going to enter in a state 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.170
 So much that yourself 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.800
 There is no such thing as technology 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.100
 Because I think that it is a game well before that 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.319
 From all the way into the Shumei 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.500
 This is it have to fit in each Honshu on it for 20 minutes Shuzo 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.270
 Yes 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.380
 You don't get tired of doing hard moves and playing hard 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.780
 That big 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.819
 And this cushion 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.840
 It is a fatigue reduction that is the amount that contains the material 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:08.510
 I think I'm connected and my days are still big 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.290
 Koshu road even such a place since it is not the Tteyuu injury 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.060
 I feel that I'm getting support well 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.370
 Nde is often the Tteyuu pretty minute round opportunity in selling physical 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.140
 Up anymore 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:27.240
 Feet in the left stand firm to spike 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.690
 There were a lot of things that I was playing or a saintly woman, but I 'm really hiding it 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.280
 After making me want to publish 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:39.420
 Well that kind of thing is gone and that my play style 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.730
 I think it's a spike that will make the most of that, so open it 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.780
 Say 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.480
 I 'm really glad that I got a Tenno reign. 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.840
 Oh long now 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:58.819
 I think it would be nice if I could keep wearing that, yes 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.650
 Well it is that I won the league this year 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.129
 Log to search 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:09.349
 Looking also to yes eyes also that for yourself 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:14.689
 I think it will change, so if you don't grow up much more like these good results 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:16.110
 I think that it is difficult to keep going out, so I asked for it as a team or as an individual 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:21.840
 I go to I want to be doing 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:26.110
 Well, really they be convinced I'd gotten in the form of say a particular out before mvp the 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:31.580
 not just mvp but really helped around 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.580
 That's really active from my own eyes and from my eyes around last week 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.759
 To say that a great player 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:41.199
 A sense of responsibility in oneself internationally 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:44.770
 It also gives birth to the feeling that you have to be such a player you have to do 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.840
 That really next time 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.040
 I can understand myself 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.529
 I really feel like I want to get 2 in form 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.169
 In the end you will get there 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.580
 truly 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.160
 A team 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.980
 I think that I am myself, I think I want to work hard 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.840
 It does not have ase 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.100
 Shake 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.100
 Eh working hard in representative
