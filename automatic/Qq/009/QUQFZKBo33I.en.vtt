had this little idea in the back of my
head<00:01:01.760> which<00:01:01.910> was<00:01:02.150> what<00:01:03.110> happens<00:01:03.470> when<00:01:03.649> the

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and so phonics this is brilliant

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.040 
and so phonics this is brilliant
simplification<00:02:33.850> it's<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.390> when<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.780> go<00:02:34.989> to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
simplification it's like when you go to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.800 
simplification it's like when you go to
school<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.040> they<00:02:36.130> say<00:02:36.310> atoms<00:02:36.670> hold<00:02:36.940> hands<00:02:37.390> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
school and they say atoms hold hands and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.449 
school and they say atoms hold hands and
of<00:02:37.900> course<00:02:37.930> they<00:02:38.140> don't<00:02:38.350> but<00:02:38.739> for<00:02:38.980> about<00:02:39.190> three

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
of course they don't but for about three

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.699 
of course they don't but for about three
years<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.970> really<00:02:40.360> helps<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.840> work<00:02:41.019> out<00:02:41.230> atoms

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
years it really helps you work out atoms

00:02:41.709 --> 00:03:09.270 
years it really helps you work out atoms
and<00:02:41.860> molecules

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.900 

I<00:03:10.380> think<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.620> what<00:03:11.770> we've<00:03:11.920> tried<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.490> achieve

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
I think that what we've tried to achieve

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.420 
I think that what we've tried to achieve
or<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.450> magazine<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.590> make<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:15.100> it's
