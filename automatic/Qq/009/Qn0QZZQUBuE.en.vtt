00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 or the altagracia 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.740
 the Colombian shopkeeper greeting 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.840
 and I have returned again xd 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.999
 this time I will make a top 10 of the best video games of playstation 1 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.469
 but it is in my opinion 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.219
 these games that I have seen are very good 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.779
 good let's start 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.749
 at number 10 is for galleries 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.759
 This game caught my attention because of the character that has special powers 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.419
 that when an enemy approaches you he explodes his head like a balloon xd 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.150
 the disadvantage of that power 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.080
 that the protagonist of the game gives you a headache that if you do not find a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.760
 tablet 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.740
 die if you lose the game 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.290
 the truth is a very complicated game since you also have to solve 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.660
 riddles 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.530
 but it's still a very entertaining game 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.670
 in the post number 9 is for parasite eve 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.650
 this game caught my attention 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.260
 and I risked to play it and good starts with the protagonist who is 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.770
 police and attends a play 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.500
 where is the wicked that is a monster and that ends up chucking 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.420
 all the spectators of the theater 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.980
 and there begins the action where you have to look for the monster woman 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.420
 and pass many levels and enemies 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.910
 The bad thing about this game is that it has no voices 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.080
 I'd say it's a video game for deaf xd but it's a good game that I 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 entertained a good time 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.790
 in position number eight is to cover the wound 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.150
 This game is about a couple that are in a cabin 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.820
 and then some spirits come out I do not know about the underworld 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.730
 and kidnap the girlfriend or lover 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.150
 and there begins the action where the protagonist has an ax and a 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.430
 chainsaw arms where in almost the entire course of the game you have to kill 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.460
 ghosts 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.130
 they are goods 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.450
 good to disbelieve the flyers and also solve riddles 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.010
 what pisses me off about this game is when I run out of fuel 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.590
 Mountain range 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.880
 healing is over and when you are surrounded by many ghosts and they break your ass 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.120
 killing you and start over 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.440
 but it's a very good game that was worth playing 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.690
 in the position number 7 is for mortal kombat 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.790
 this game is very entertaining 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.240
 since I like the games of fights xd and with this game I played hours and hours 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.489
 doing good fatalities and brutal and tish xd 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.409
 each character has a special power and technique 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.109
 where you can also give the final blow 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.929
 a good game without a doubt 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.349
 in position number 6 is for alone in the dark 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.510
 This game caught my attention because of its music intro 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.019
 and when I started playing you have the option to choose the protagonist 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.229
 who is a girl or the prota who is an uncle 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.480
 both fall in different places 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.349
 since the plane crashed 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.219
 and there begins the suspense where the sounds of the game will give you a good 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:38.159
 scare 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.159
 they have to solve riddles 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.549
 kill monsters that come from the underworld 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.619
 and it's seriously where the end of the game will be there 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.069
 a very good and entertaining video game 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.469
 in position number five is for nick mare creatures 2 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.980
 This game is about the pro that appears in a locked room because 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.230
 maybe it's crazy 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.040
 and it has an area where you have to kill monsters of all kinds where you can 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.789
 apply a combo of blows and fatalities to any monster 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:09.109
 the course of the game bassat wanting new weapons and power is to massacre 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.329
 your enemies 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.499
 It is a highly recommended game 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.529
 in position number four is for parasite eve and 2 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.400
 This game is much better than 1 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.869
 and that's why he's in this position 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.839
 they improved the graphics and techniques of the prota making it look more good 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:25.749
 xd 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:29.699
 what I liked most about this game are its variety of weapons that you can buy 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:30.939
 with your points 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.290
 from a machine gun to grenade launchers and more variety of weapons 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.939
 You can also acquire powers to kill enemies 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.659
 the only bad thing is that it is still a game for the deaf because it has no voices 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.249
 but it's still an excellent game that improved it a lot 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.079
 in position number three is for silent 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.609
 a classic horror video game 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.819
 It's about father and daughter going in their car when they suddenly get injured and 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.989
 end in the silent hill village that is uninhabited and the mission of the prota 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.139
 is looking for his daughter 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.219
 he has to face many monsters the silent 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.509
 It's a game that causes you some fear and suspense 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:12.679
 in this game most are riddles that you have to solve to advance in 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:13.669
 the game 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.609
 I recommend them those who have not played it xd 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.059
 in position number two is for resident evil 2 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:23.029
 it's a classic from the sagas of resident evil 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:27.900
 when I started playing this game I was addicted and I kept playing it xd 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.580
 the game is about two stories or the two proteste ar and lion 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.780
 traveling to raccoon city 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.670
 where you will find the surprise that the whole city is riddled with zombies and 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.590
 monsters 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.740
 where now they have to survive 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.699
 this game you also have to solve riddles to advance with the 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.120
 story of the game 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.809
 I recommend them is an excellent game 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.069
 and we finish with number one 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.500
 the best game of the play station that I played and it is for resident evil 3 me 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:56.340
 you say 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.180
 this game is without a doubt the best one I've played 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.930
 and treats the story that the tour itself to prevent 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.710
 does whatever it takes to survive in raccoon city plagued by zombies and 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.599
 monsters 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.849
 and will have to face a new enemy called nemesis 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.009
 that its objective is to eliminate the members of these 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.449
 it's a game of agility since you have to dodge obstacles and dangers 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.919
 also solve riddles to continue with the game 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.590
 well that's all the games on playstation 1 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.379
 that for me were very good and entertaining 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.909
 in another occasion jare mastouri videogames of other consoles 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:30.949
 and until another video
