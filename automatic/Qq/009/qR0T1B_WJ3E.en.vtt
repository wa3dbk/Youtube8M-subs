00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
cartoon like this is that they make a

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.510 
cartoon like this is that they make a
rough<00:02:32.970> version<00:02:33.000> first<00:02:33.630> with<00:02:34.500> drawings<00:02:34.950> yep

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
rough version first with drawings yep

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.970 
rough version first with drawings yep
and<00:02:35.670> with<00:02:36.540> actors<00:02:37.230> they<00:02:37.380> love<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:37.800> who<00:02:37.860> are

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
and with actors they love but who are

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.650 
and with actors they love but who are
very<00:02:38.160> expensive<00:02:38.460> then<00:02:39.210> they<00:02:39.330> go<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
very expensive then they go to the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.300 
very expensive then they go to the
studio<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.230> now<00:02:40.380> we<00:02:40.440> want<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.710> animate<00:02:41.010> it

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
studio and so now we want to animate it

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.460 
studio and so now we want to animate it
with<00:02:41.610> stop<00:02:41.970> motion<00:02:42.110> which<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.200> very<00:02:43.350> expensive

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
with stop motion which is very expensive

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.800 
with stop motion which is very expensive
and<00:02:43.800> your<00:02:44.070> own<00:02:44.250> studio<00:02:44.880> says<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.330> right<00:02:45.480> but

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
and your own studio says all right but

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.290 
and your own studio says all right but
you've<00:02:45.960> got<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.140> recast<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:47.340> actors<00:02:47.730> or<00:02:47.910> so

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
you've got to recast the actors or so

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.700 
you've got to recast the actors or so
then<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.480> think<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:48.960> quite<00:02:49.110> tough<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
then I think it's quite tough for the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.530 
then I think it's quite tough for the
director<00:02:50.130> he's<00:02:50.550> got<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.820> get<00:02:50.940> someone<00:02:51.210> like<00:02:51.240> me

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
director he's got to get someone like me

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.140 
director he's got to get someone like me
and<00:02:51.690> he<00:02:51.900> doesn't<00:02:51.930> really<00:02:52.200> love<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:53.070> revolve<00:02:56.150> /

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
and he doesn't really love to revolve /

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.440 
and he doesn't really love to revolve /
