00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.700
 when you hear the emotions slowness 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.470
 then you have to open this device 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.860
 Change area 1 and that's what you do 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.240
 of more dimensions 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.509
 you turn it right here once 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.699
 Battle pulls down and turns 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 left to tighten it again 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.050
 now I have just the area 1 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.760
 remodeled where to get from 60 browns per 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:33.420
 A minute to 500 stirring can do that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.500
 I'll show you that here 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.030
 would be 60 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.030
 So 60 rpm 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.720
 here would have me for example 200 rpm as 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:58.200
 200 turns in a minute 300 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:05.430
 revolutions 400 revolutions and 52 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:14.160
 turns and if you have the engine 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:19.770
 this tempo here sets that are around 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.460
 60 to 120 rtm then you can your krems 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.460
 nice cold stir 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.130
 if you want to go up 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:37.979
 So at 2011 pm her roof turns right 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 makes up center to the left and 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:49.460
 now you can pm from 240 to 2011 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.460
 adjust that with 240 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.800
 that if now 1200 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.440
 1600 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.120
 around 2000 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.670
 At this speed you should 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.090
 your krems are listening to the fed wrapping 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.930
 quite finely distributed will be called from 2011 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.930
 you go it up
