00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.590
 with the preparation I say to go back to 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.860
 adding minutes in the front row is the idea 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.809
 that the championship started so 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.449
 every time I feel better and in rhythm and 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.570
 that's good I played in a job today 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.550
 that is not usual 5 just how it went in 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.789
 the party how did you feel I did not feel 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.960
 well obviously that I order 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.019
 veneers and you can do it before a 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.989
 problem in dealing with just my way of the 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.059
 knowledge that I have of seeing him in playing 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.120
 to my partner when a plug like that 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.890
 what 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.050
 that does not let me go on the attack 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.149
 more for that reason their contention signatures 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.190
 but I think it made it quite uncouple 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.129
 the people who go down with the kids look 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.430
 that today they put everything and they were wide 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.550
 first-time winners we had the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.220
 the ball well we master what we 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.440
 missing was the definition the last touch 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.300
 that was in the we had two or three hand to 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.129
 hand that we can define before those 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.649
 things and that you have to improve it but in the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.290
 simple game I think everyone has 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.240
 good foot and it's nice to go down 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.940
 go up because most of the redondita 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.130
 and that's important to keep adding up 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.990
 and obviously to improve what 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.910
 it is the pass although this is a joy 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.399
 disappoints a little I say no not be 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.679
 concentrated now for the superclassic 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.479
 I do not know if it's exceptions, I did go 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.479
 conscious I am aware that you see it 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.619
 happening with lanús between also by some 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.350
 how many casualties we have had in the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.149
 team but I 'm to add if 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.700
 obviously my illusion was in 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.490
 that could be among the concentrates 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.980
 but I came here and I downloaded in the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.020
 party and mission 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.970
 but you feel confident with part 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.490
 of ramón and toned for what is going to be 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.590
 and what can be a return is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 and we have to be conscious myself 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.119
 I'm one the biggest so I have to 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.040
 add be positive for the group we 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.250
 come very difficult matches we have 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.049
 a great talk for you are going to be in 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.759
 go round and classify the 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.500
 liberators and at the same time we have two 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.759
 matches now to position ourselves 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 in the tournament then I have to be 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.130
 all positive and when you download one that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 ramón see that the other is fine and enter 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.420
 to the field and meet venues there 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.730
 think of the group more not so much what 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.319
 individual as he once did the an 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.870
 symbol this team that is ledesma you 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.489
 he played with the medium one almost did not play and today 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.150
 it's a figure that gives you an example 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.370
 also in traction what do you think of the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.310
 I held a friendship with the wolf 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.680
 and I know what happened what he suffered but 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.720
 never stopped training always positive 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.250
 have supported the group or putting groups 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.680
 about above all things and good 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.049
 It has its prize I think acting 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.910
 that way the prize and with the effort and 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.709
 I work after the rest comes only if 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.599
 It will not be long before everything ends 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.220
 but your idea is that art here we have 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.630
 they also renewed the tranquility that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.300
 you have in ribery and the desire 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.190
 to play with this technician yes yes I have 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.090
 eager to play training to play 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.730
 my head goes my position in a match 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.920
 I train for that after technical decides 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.470
 and he knows who is better is you see us from 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.450
 another from another angle and knows who is 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.780
 well who is wrong then I try to 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.970
 be well come an injury of about 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.010
 how many months of inactivity but good 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.140
 back on the court is the only thing I 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.410
 will give continuity and dynamics in the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.410
 game
