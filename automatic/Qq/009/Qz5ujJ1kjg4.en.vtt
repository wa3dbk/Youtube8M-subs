to go ahead and jump right on in and
some<00:00:37.840> of<00:00:37.989> these<00:00:38.080> actually<00:00:38.800> they<00:00:39.160> probably

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
some of these actually they probably

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
some of these actually they probably
could<00:00:39.850> have<00:00:39.960> gone<00:00:40.960> in<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.920> red<00:00:42.129> one<00:00:42.400> like<00:00:42.760> this

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
could have gone in the red one like this

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.439 
could have gone in the red one like this
these<00:00:44.440> two<00:00:44.680> probably<00:00:45.400> could<00:00:46.059> have<00:00:46.089> gone<00:00:46.420> in

the red collection but I think they've

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.910

got just enough purple to them that um

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.539 
got just enough purple to them that um
