00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.740
 hello everyone with you layer and in today's 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.400
 video I will tell about two small but 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:25.400
 quite interesting waters and let's move on 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.860
 to the first he helps teleport 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.900
 between measurements what is for him 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.649
 it takes the most basic 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:38.440
 wooden door spatially 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:42.280
 iron space door and hatch 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:48.649
 unusual hatch emergency hatch 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.059
 so let's start to move to 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.059
 spatial dimension to us 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.760
 you will need a craft door to find 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.690
 On the website in the description, open it and 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:04.309
 right right click and appear 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:10.070
 such sevda teleport we go into it and we 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:13.159
 We appear in the black world well it is black 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.530
 the world is more accurate and I call unstable 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.479
 blocks because they would have them 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.549
 break down here we can fail well and 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:28.640
 as if there is no necessary place we can deliver 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.380
 blog coverage is not required so much 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.840
 how all the blocks here are very good 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.490
 lighted and here we can build houses 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.969
 there is nothing here but unstable 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:47.659
 blocks and so to go back to us 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.630
 need a wooden door set 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.500
 wooden door open it right 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.039

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.200
 the normal world of minecraft plus this 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:05.179
 fashion is something that can create many rooms 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.500
 black you see we created a new room 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.479
 strictly defined new room 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:24.519
 simultaneously built 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:27.250
 sega room here is our room and here 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.060
 to move between rooms to us 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.260

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.019

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.370
 Rome hatch we put a blog 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.180

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.069
 button to break the space and 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:46.780
 binding as an anti bacterium can be said 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:51.819
