we<00:00:06.439> all<00:00:06.559> know<00:00:06.740> that<00:00:06.769> NOAA<00:00:07.129> satellites<00:00:07.700> help<00:00:07.939> us

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
we all know that NOAA satellites help us

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.209 
we all know that NOAA satellites help us
forecast<00:00:08.480> weather<00:00:08.660> on<00:00:08.870> earth<00:00:09.019> but<00:00:09.950> did<00:00:10.129> you

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
forecast weather on earth but did you

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.310 
forecast weather on earth but did you
know<00:00:10.400> that<00:00:10.580> some<00:00:11.059> weather<00:00:11.299> satellites<00:00:11.840> also

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320
