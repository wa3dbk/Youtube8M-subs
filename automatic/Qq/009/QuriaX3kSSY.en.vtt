Zinfandel<00:00:49.200> or<00:00:50.010> whatever<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:51.059> let's<00:00:51.270> break<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
Zinfandel or whatever so let's break it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.180 
Zinfandel or whatever so let's break it
down<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> few<00:00:52.440> different<00:00:52.710> ways<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
down there are a few different ways to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.010 
down there are a few different ways to
actually<00:00:53.370> make<00:00:53.820> Rose<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.270> wine<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.840> most

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
actually make Rose a wine the most

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.889 
actually make Rose a wine the most
common<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.760> direct<00:00:57.149> press<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
common would be like direct press so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.380 
common would be like direct press so
it's<00:00:58.320> red<00:00:59.039> grapes<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.180> are

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it's red grapes that you are

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
it's red grapes that you are
intentionally<00:01:00.750> using<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.559> make<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> rose<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
intentionally using to make a rose a you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.149 
intentionally using to make a rose a you
put<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.969> into<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> press<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.960> press<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.650> let

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
put it into a press you press it you let

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.190 
put it into a press you press it you let
the<00:01:05.369> skin<00:01:05.640> sit<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> juice<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> certain

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the skin sit on the juice for a certain

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960 
the skin sit on the juice for a certain
amount<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.439> time<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.950> could<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.280> hours<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
amount of time it could be hours it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.789 
amount of time it could be hours it
could<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.510> days<00:01:09.750> depending<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.530> grape

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
could be days depending on the grape

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.500 
could be days depending on the grape
variety<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.520> how<00:01:11.610> much<00:01:11.760> color<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.180> want<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
variety and how much color you want to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.440 
variety and how much color you want to
extract<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.530> second<00:01:13.890> thing<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.369> sin<00:01:15.180> yay

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
extract the second thing is sin yay

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.020 
extract the second thing is sin yay
method<00:01:15.930> sandy<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> means<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.670> bleed

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
method sandy a means to like to bleed

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.090 
method sandy a means to like to bleed
off<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.200> happens<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.680> lot<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> time

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
off so this happens a lot of the time

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.429 
off so this happens a lot of the time
when<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.850> wine<00:01:21.150> maker<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.840> already<00:01:22.140> making<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
when a wine maker is already making a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
when a wine maker is already making a
red<00:01:22.619> wine<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.159> wants<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> concentrate<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
red wine but wants to concentrate that

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.240 
red wine but wants to concentrate that
red<00:01:24.420> wine<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.320> he'll<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
red wine and so he'll do a little bit of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
red wine and so he'll do a little bit of
a<00:01:26.340> bleed<00:01:26.610> off<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.689> tank<00:01:27.930> after<00:01:28.200> it's

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
a bleed off of the tank after it's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.109 
a bleed off of the tank after it's
macerated<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> skins<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.970> bit

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
macerated on the skins for a little bit

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.940 
macerated on the skins for a little bit
of<00:01:30.210> time<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.960> bleed<00:01:31.229> off<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
of time and that bleed off is going to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.789 
of time and that bleed off is going to
be<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.400> rose<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.450> paler<00:01:33.720> than<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.869> red<00:01:34.110> but

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
be a rose a so it's paler than a red but

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.130 
be a rose a so it's paler than a red but
it's<00:01:34.920> gonna<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.189> darker<00:01:35.610> than<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:35.909> typical
