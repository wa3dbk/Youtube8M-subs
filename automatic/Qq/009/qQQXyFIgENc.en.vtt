German artist and playwright is the
inventor<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.850> this<00:00:20.850> process<00:00:21.740> nowadays

inventor and this process nowadays

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.509 
inventor and this process nowadays
commercially<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.269> dead<00:00:24.830> stones<00:00:25.830> were<00:00:26.189> used

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
commercially is is dead stones were used

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.509 
commercially is is dead stones were used
these<00:00:26.820> grain<00:00:27.510> slabs<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.410> Bavarian<00:00:28.920> limestone

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
these grain slabs of Bavarian limestone

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.389 
these grain slabs of Bavarian limestone
were<00:00:30.210> used<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.840> until<00:00:31.019> about<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> 1920s<00:00:31.920> or

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
were used up until about the 1920s or

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.030 
were used up until about the 1920s or
30s<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:33.420> since<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.899> time<00:00:33.960> commercially<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
30s but since that time commercially the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.069 
30s but since that time commercially the
process<00:00:35.520> has<00:00:35.700> been<00:00:35.880> done<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.239> aluminum<00:00:36.750> plates

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
process has been done on aluminum plates

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.610 
process has been done on aluminum plates
and<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.030> encounter<00:00:39.629> lime<00:00:39.870> stones<00:00:40.320> it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and so if you encounter lime stones it's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
and so if you encounter lime stones it's
probably<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> university<00:00:41.760> art<00:00:41.969> department

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
probably in a university art department

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400 
probably in a university art department
or<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> fine<00:00:43.890> arts<00:00:44.250> printing<00:00:44.789> shop<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.539> there's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
or a fine arts printing shop and there's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.220 
or a fine arts printing shop and there's
something<00:00:46.700> remarkably<00:00:47.700> sensuous<00:00:48.660> about

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
something remarkably sensuous about

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.700 
something remarkably sensuous about
drawing<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.969> litho<00:00:51.570> stone<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> grease

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
drawing on a litho stone with a grease

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.100 
drawing on a litho stone with a grease
crayon<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.520> different<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:54.510> drawing<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.079> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
crayon it's different from drawing on a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.520 
crayon it's different from drawing on a
piece<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.350> paper<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:57.530> remarkably

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
piece of paper it's really a remarkably

principle of lithography and like a lot
of<00:01:04.019> things<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.589> took<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> while<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.129> people<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.710 
inventor wanted to call it chemical
printing<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.180> good<00:01:12.330> description

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
printing and that's a good description

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.950 
printing and that's a good description
because<00:01:13.320> most<00:01:13.560> printmaking<00:01:14.070> forms<00:01:14.720> have<00:01:15.720> to

probably all done a linoleum cut in

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060 
probably all done a linoleum cut in
junior<00:01:23.490> high<00:01:23.640> art<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.540> woodcut<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
opposite of that would be intaglio
processes<00:01:36.420> where<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.630> carve<00:01:37.170> or<00:01:37.439> etched<00:01:37.650> into

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950

a metal plate in the lowest places

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.770 
a metal plate in the lowest places
receive<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.040> ink<00:01:41.280> well<00:01:42.150> lithography<00:01:42.720> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
receive the ink well lithography is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
receive the ink well lithography is
different<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.710> plano<00:01:44.130> graphic

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
different because it's plano graphic

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.600 
different because it's plano graphic
everything<00:01:45.509> happens<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> same<00:01:46.710> smooth

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
everything happens on the same smooth

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.080 
everything happens on the same smooth
level<00:01:48.360> surface<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.130> areas<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.549> print

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
level surface so the areas that print

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
level surface so the areas that print
are<00:01:51.360> areas<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.140> grease<00:01:52.530> loving<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
are areas that are grease loving and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.030 
are areas that are grease loving and
they<00:01:54.060> accept<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> greasy<00:01:55.020> ink<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.680> areas

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
they accept the greasy ink and the areas

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
they accept the greasy ink and the areas
that<00:01:56.219> don't<00:01:56.460> print<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.540> been<00:01:57.750> chemically

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that don't print have been chemically

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.950 
that don't print have been chemically
processed<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.130> repel<00:01:59.579> ink<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.509> they<00:02:00.659> love

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
processed to repel ink but they love

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.069 
processed to repel ink but they love
water<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.340> when<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.790> print<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.420> sponge<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
water so when you print you sponge the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.139 
water so when you print you sponge the
stone<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.649> keep<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> damp<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.880> pass

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
stone you keep it damp and then you pass

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.919 
stone you keep it damp and then you pass
a<00:02:06.180> heavy<00:02:06.689> inking<00:02:07.170> roller<00:02:07.439> over<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> stone<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
a heavy inking roller over the stone and

we treated to receive the the ink so
