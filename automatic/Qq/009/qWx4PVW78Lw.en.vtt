00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.599
 lovers of driving video games 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 in the open world you are in luck 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.160
 if a few days ago we told you about 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.779
 Forza Horizon's benefits now comes 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.059
 another video game with the intention of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.489
 overtake you on track we refer to 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.140
 need for speed most wanted title 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.360
 developed by the British the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.610
 criterion games responsible for series 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.290
 so dear as a partner and that in this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.479
 they invite us to enjoy the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.790
 driving style sandbox that many 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.790
 we already experienced in the year 2005 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.050
 indeed most wanted is raised 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.630
 as a reboot of the game designed by 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.310
 black box 7 years ago one that comes with 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.140
 its same industrial setting and 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.450
 amount of police persecutions 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.670
 but of course everything adapted to the new 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.220
 times regardless of characters 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.590
 cocky and cute girls only you and you 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.480
 good car that and the new city of 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.390
 fair heaven that stands out for its great 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.760
 varied landscape with all expressways 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.010
 type of secondary roads tunnels 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.610
 alleys and even parks where 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.610
 be lost 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.270
 our main objective in it for 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.700
 speed most wanted is to defeat the ten 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.830
 most wanted pilots of the place although not 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.350
 it is our only task, much less 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.600
 apart we can compete in quantity of 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.939
 events as well as walk us in the most 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.799
 of 30 car models included all 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.080
 available from the same moment in 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.210
 that we find them breaking posters 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.610
 go at full speed by radars 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.320
 repair our vehicle and get 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.479
 milestones like skidding or circulating in 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.340
 opposite direction are some of the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.470
 multiple actions to complete in fair 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.479
 game in an authentic paradise for 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.479
 lovers of driving more arcade 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.890
 no halftime criterion has 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.960
 opted for a management made by and for the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.180
 enjoy all kinds of players 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.700
 of course it will not be the same to bring a 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.660
 supercar an off-road or a 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.330
 tourism 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.210
 there are also enough models from 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.580
 this amazing ariel atom 500 v8 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.170
 up to a lamborghini countach for 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.210
 delight us with the pleasure of 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.910
 driving one that lends special 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.890
 attention to physical impact and 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.890
 of course the art of skidding 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.780
 in fact in my for speed most wanted not 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.819
 it's just important to be the fastest 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.690
 but also the most aggressive in 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.489
 steering wheel 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.440
 the evidence contains cops that we 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.120
 they will make life impossible but also 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.640
 pilots willing to throw us out of the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.349
 track we are already in a race or in a 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.880
 persecution test we will be 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.680
 aware of the extraordinary work 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.890
 done in terms of intelligence 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.660
 artificial and if you do not believe it, wait 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.530
 to compete against the ten most pilots 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.510
 Wanted 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.290
 then you will know what the term is 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.290
 ruthless 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.360
 a very varied city of cars 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.820
 many events to complete police 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.950
 thirsty for fines that the work is missing 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.960
 of the British because probably 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.360
 greater customization possibilities 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.400
 tuning has been ruled out within the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.960
 set but we do not have much 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.210
 depth in regard to the 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.060
 modification of fireballs beyond 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.430
 how many options to change tires 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.620
 Body chassis and of course for 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.790
 enable the use of nitro which we 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.790
 will get out of more than one haste 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.970
 a small detail that does not tarnish the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.980
 final result the online multiplayer 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.530
 the most wanted can become 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.270
 easily in your doom contains 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.160
 even more variety than the modality for 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.130
 a player with absolutely proofs 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.860
 crazy and best of all nothing like 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.930
 so we like it and the online facet is not 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.750
 is there, we can also compare 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.220
 test marks records of radars and 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.800
 a long etcetera by the 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.930
 great love tool no doubt great 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.120
 options for a video game that this 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.150
 way can go beyond 20 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.150
 hours 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.590
 visually the boys of criterion 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.840
 have achieved more results than 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.609
 remarkable the city of hey fer see 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.250
 shows live at any time of the day 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.020
 with a far drawn distance and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.270
 especially a great feeling of 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.610
 speed may certain textures 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.440
 slightly tarnish the final result 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.810
 but the open world offered is 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.000
 downright powerful thanks to an engine 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.700
 powerful graphic and a few physical 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.350
 extraordinary that the violence of 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.300
 the blows does not correspond to the 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.310
 effects on the body although to the 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.310
 least we have quantity of damages 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.870
 the video game is not free of jerks 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.820
 and some programming errors but 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.860
 they are isolated problems that we will go through 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.530
 high not as much as the musical themes 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.630
 with a fairly careful repertoire that 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.000
 includes muse songs or that mikel 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.470
 brothers a perfect companion for a 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.540
 open world of competition and 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.540
 persecution is downright addictive 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.170
 now it only remains for you to put on the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.270
 belt and invent is a good excuse 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.100
 for when you stop the police in the 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.660
 that surely ends up becoming one 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.250
 of the driving titles more 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.250
 searched for this 2002
