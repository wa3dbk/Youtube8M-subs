is the standard improved Meyer lemon one

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.089 
is the standard improved Meyer lemon one

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
of the favored lemons for culinary

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.370 
of the favored lemons for culinary
experts<00:00:28.550> people<00:00:28.939> that<00:00:29.090> like<00:00:29.269> to<00:00:29.449> cook<00:00:29.660> we<00:00:30.079> feel

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
experts people that like to cook we feel

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.280 
experts people that like to cook we feel
that<00:00:30.559> this<00:00:30.710> tree<00:00:30.949> is<00:00:31.160> well<00:00:31.669> chosen<00:00:32.029> on<00:00:32.390> site<00:00:32.750> it

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
that this tree is well chosen on site it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.080 
that this tree is well chosen on site it
has<00:00:33.500> shelter<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.160> protection<00:00:34.519> under<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
has shelter and protection under the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.700 
has shelter and protection under the
larger<00:00:35.480> tree<00:00:35.719> so<00:00:35.930> it<00:00:36.019> doesn't<00:00:36.260> get<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.470> full

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
larger tree so it doesn't get the full

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.490 
larger tree so it doesn't get the full
blast<00:00:36.980> of<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.370> sun's<00:00:37.610> light<00:00:37.730> or<00:00:38.230> wind<00:00:39.230> loads

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
blast of the sun's light or wind loads

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.180 
blast of the sun's light or wind loads
coming<00:00:40.220> on<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.610> it<00:00:40.699> so<00:00:40.930> we<00:00:41.930> feel<00:00:41.960> that<00:00:42.199> it's

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
coming on to it so we feel that it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.060 
coming on to it so we feel that it's
probably<00:00:43.519> time<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.809> go<00:00:44.960> ahead<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.530> remove

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
probably time to go ahead and remove

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.960 
probably time to go ahead and remove
this<00:00:46.550> stake<00:00:47.229> it<00:00:48.229> it's<00:00:49.010> fairly<00:00:49.280> tight<00:00:49.670> on<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
this stake it it's fairly tight on the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.729 
this stake it it's fairly tight on the
stem<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:50.510> don't<00:00:50.690> want<00:00:50.839> it<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:50.989> tourniquet<00:00:51.559> our

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
stem we don't want it to tourniquet our

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.340 
stem we don't want it to tourniquet our
our<00:00:52.339> cambium<00:00:52.909> bark<00:00:53.150> so<00:00:53.720> we're<00:00:54.019> just<00:00:54.049> going<00:00:54.290> to

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
our cambium bark so we're just going to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.130 
our cambium bark so we're just going to
clip<00:00:55.030> our<00:00:56.030> little<00:00:56.449> ties<00:00:56.659> here<00:00:59.650> and<00:01:01.960> free<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
clip our little ties here and free the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.060 
clip our little ties here and free the
restraints<00:01:05.259> there<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.380> can<00:01:06.500> actually<00:01:06.680> see

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
restraints there you can actually see

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.490 
restraints there you can actually see
where<00:01:07.310> these<00:01:07.460> little<00:01:07.790> ties<00:01:08.030> were<00:01:08.420> starting<00:01:09.409> to

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
where these little ties were starting to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.149 
where these little ties were starting to
cause<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.740> little<00:01:10.130> harm<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.729> bark

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
cause a little harm to the bark

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.539 
cause a little harm to the bark
carefully<00:01:13.159> remove<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:14.650> there<00:01:15.650> we<00:01:15.740> go<00:01:18.280> if<00:01:19.280> we

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
carefully remove this there we go if we

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.700 
carefully remove this there we go if we
leave<00:01:19.729> steaks<00:01:20.090> on<00:01:20.390> for<00:01:20.689> too<00:01:20.900> long<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.500> tree

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
leave steaks on for too long the tree

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.270 
leave steaks on for too long the tree
becomes<00:01:22.070> dependent<00:01:22.729> upon<00:01:22.850> them<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.950> ends

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
becomes dependent upon them and it ends

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.429 
becomes dependent upon them and it ends
up<00:01:25.369> causing<00:01:25.640> bark<00:01:26.149> damage<00:01:26.569> to<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.899> main<00:01:27.079> stems

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
up causing bark damage to the main stems

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.609 
up causing bark damage to the main stems
so<00:01:28.280> we've<00:01:28.969> removed<00:01:29.359> our<00:01:29.600> stake<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.350> tree

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
so we've removed our stake the tree

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.200 
so we've removed our stake the tree
feels<00:01:30.979> like<00:01:31.249> it<00:01:31.369> has<00:01:31.520> sufficient<00:01:32.060> Anchorage

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
feels like it has sufficient Anchorage

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.959 
feels like it has sufficient Anchorage
to<00:01:32.659> hold<00:01:32.810> itself<00:01:33.109> up<00:01:33.319> so<00:01:34.130> we're<00:01:34.520> going<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.789> let

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
to hold itself up so we're going to let

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.700 
to hold itself up so we're going to let
the<00:01:35.090> tree<00:01:35.329> then<00:01:35.539> advance<00:01:35.929> its<00:01:36.170> cause<00:01:36.380> from

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the tree then advance its cause from

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.809 
the tree then advance its cause from
this<00:01:36.859> point<00:01:37.159> forward

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
this point forward

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.090 
this point forward
got<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:38.329> nice<00:01:38.539> Meyer<00:01:38.810> lemon<00:01:39.170> here<00:01:39.439> she's

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
got a nice Meyer lemon here she's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.730 
got a nice Meyer lemon here she's
already<00:01:40.460> bearing<00:01:40.880> fruit<00:01:41.170> if<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.350> fruit<00:01:42.560> load

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
already bearing fruit if the fruit load

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.830 
already bearing fruit if the fruit load
gets<00:01:43.039> a<00:01:43.189> little<00:01:43.340> heavy<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.299> young<00:01:44.509> tree

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
gets a little heavy on this young tree

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.529 
gets a little heavy on this young tree
we<00:01:45.469> may<00:01:45.710> remove<00:01:46.490> some<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.030> fruit<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.389> keep

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
we may remove some of the fruit to keep

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.449 
we may remove some of the fruit to keep
the<00:01:47.689> canopy<00:01:48.259> from<00:01:48.469> being<00:01:48.679> overburdened

and<00:01:51.979> strengthen<00:01:52.609> its<00:01:53.119> Anchorage<00:01:53.539> in<00:01:53.719> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
and strengthen its Anchorage in the

and strengthen its Anchorage in the
ground<00:01:54.079> if<00:01:54.530> we<00:01:54.619> have<00:01:54.979> to<00:01:55.130> sacrifice<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.729> few

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
ground if we have to sacrifice a few

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.050 
ground if we have to sacrifice a few

years of a fruit crop for that purpose

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.550 
years of a fruit crop for that purpose
it's<00:01:59.240> quite<00:01:59.450> all<00:01:59.630> right<00:01:59.659> we're<00:02:00.139> looking<00:02:00.259> to

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
it's quite all right we're looking to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.010 
it's quite all right we're looking to
the<00:02:00.649> long<00:02:00.859> term<00:02:01.189> of<00:02:01.459> the<00:02:01.549> trees<00:02:01.789> survival<00:02:02.420> it

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
the long term of the trees survival it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.840 
the long term of the trees survival it
is<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.259> standard<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:03.979> should<00:02:04.249> reach<00:02:04.549> nice

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
is a standard this should reach nice

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.639 
is a standard this should reach nice
size<00:02:05.209> I've<00:02:05.899> got<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.079> little<00:02:06.229> bit<00:02:06.439> of<00:02:06.529> leaf

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649

damage here a little bit a little bit of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.270 
damage here a little bit a little bit of
yellowing<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.530> some<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.860> lower<00:02:10.009> leaves

yellowing of some of the lower leaves

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.400 
yellowing of some of the lower leaves
and<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:11.300> possible<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.050> tree<00:02:12.290> would

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
and it's possible that tree would

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.440 
and it's possible that tree would
benefit<00:02:12.800> from<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.069> feeding<00:02:13.459> we're<00:02:14.150> gonna<00:02:14.240> go

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
benefit from a feeding we're gonna go

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.910 
benefit from a feeding we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.690> bring<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.050> some<00:02:15.110> calcium<00:02:15.680> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
ahead and bring in some calcium and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.589 
ahead and bring in some calcium and
nitrogen<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:17.060> give<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.390> light
