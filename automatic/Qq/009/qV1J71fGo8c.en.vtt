 whatever is 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.980
 to shorten the time of the enabling until May 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.630
 Now they say no 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.060
 has to return the enabling 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.759
 he lacks a little bit of humility 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.940
 and a little bit of realism because I'm not going to return the enabling law is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.470
 very wrong 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.260
 I will not go to bed area to collect the reward that is presented by

 velasco alvarado yes 15 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.230
 it seems to me the best 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.840
 the debate that has opened the national assembly because it removes the mask 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.600
 houbo zeros of the bourgeois 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.380
 that they fill the mouth of the people as I said we do not come to fight for the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.100
 village 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.960
 but then they come to try to dismantle 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.590
 the laws that favor the people that what they understand 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.710
 they have a big problem 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.040
 of identity will end up in nothingness so I think 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.440
 I have held out my hand 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.600
