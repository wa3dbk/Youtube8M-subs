00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
today I'm going to talk about lamp of

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.709 
today I'm going to talk about lamp of
growth<00:00:07.400> lamp<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.550> probe<00:00:08.820> sin<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.360> came<00:00:09.570> from

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
growth lamp of probe sin I came from

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.720 
growth lamp of probe sin I came from
foam<00:00:09.990> craft<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.710> can<00:00:10.860> be<00:00:10.980> found<00:00:11.250> under

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
foam craft that can be found under

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.910 
foam craft that can be found under
office<00:00:12.259> efficacy<00:00:14.330> here<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.800> is

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
office efficacy here it's this is

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.349 
office efficacy here it's this is
reversible<00:00:18.170> and<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.619> increases<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.490> speed<00:00:20.939> of

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
reversible and it increases the speed of

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.269 
reversible and it increases the speed of
wood<00:00:21.570> ight<00:00:21.810> which<00:00:22.350> plant<00:00:23.100> grows<00:00:23.519> near<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
wood ight which plant grows near it and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.759 
wood ight which plant grows near it and
it's<00:00:26.279> mod<00:00:27.289> compatible<00:00:29.179> it<00:00:30.179> needs<00:00:30.510> herba<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.650> do

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
it's mod compatible it needs herba to do

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.729 
it's mod compatible it needs herba to do
that<00:00:32.480> Herber<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.750> stored<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.140> these<00:00:34.440> four

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that Herber can be stored in these four

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.600 
that Herber can be stored in these four
jars<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.149> replaced<00:00:36.510> eight<00:00:36.780> blocks<00:00:37.230> from

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
jars that can replaced eight blocks from

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.000 
jars that can replaced eight blocks from
the<00:00:38.610> lab<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.480> means<00:00:39.719> butts<00:00:39.960> at<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.860> are

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the lab that means butts at there are

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.209 
the lab that means butts at there are
seven<00:00:41.790> blocks<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.300> between<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.980> also

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
seven blocks in between you can also

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
seven blocks in between you can also
transport<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.930> herba<00:00:46.350> through<00:00:46.829> pipes<00:00:47.809> or

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
transport the herba through pipes or

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.240 
transport the herba through pipes or
cubes<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.530> should<00:00:52.710> notice<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> lab

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cubes but you should notice that the lab

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
cubes but you should notice that the lab
won't<00:00:56.699> connect<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> pipe<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.699> way<00:01:00.170> but

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
won't connect to the pipe this way but

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.840 
won't connect to the pipe this way but
if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.640> connect<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:04.650> lamp<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> pipe<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
if you connect the lamp to the pipe and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.050 
if you connect the lamp to the pipe and
stuff<00:01:06.229> like<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.409> placing<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> against<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
stuff like this placing it against it it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.890 
stuff like this placing it against it it
will<00:01:09.360> connect<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> lamp<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:12.330> an<00:01:12.479> effective

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
will connect the lamp has an effective

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
will connect the lamp has an effective
radius<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:18.590> five<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.939> diameter<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.930> 12<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
radius of five or a diameter of 12 is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.880 
radius of five or a diameter of 12 is
more<00:01:23.369> exact<00:01:23.670> because<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.320> different

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
more exact because it is different

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.120 
more exact because it is different
ranges<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.790> different<00:01:27.119> sides<00:01:27.890> rearrange<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
ranges to different sides rearrange the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.840 
ranges to different sides rearrange the
south<00:01:29.430> east<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.530> five<00:01:31.530> blocks<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.549> two

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
south east is five blocks so one two

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.830 
south east is five blocks so one two
three<00:01:33.180> four<00:01:33.509> five<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> five<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.640> beast<00:01:35.840> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
three four five and five to beast and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.130 
three four five and five to beast and
the<00:01:36.990> six<00:01:37.259> blocks<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.270> north<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the six blocks to the north and to the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.679 
the six blocks to the north and to the
south

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
south

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.940 
south
and<00:01:41.869> it<00:01:42.770> also<00:01:43.039> stacks<00:01:43.579> with<00:01:44.270> itself<00:01:44.710> so<00:01:45.710> if<00:01:45.829> you

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and it also stacks with itself so if you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.370 
and it also stacks with itself so if you
have<00:01:46.069> lots<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:47.259> lumps<00:01:48.259> like<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:50.109> it<00:01:51.109> will

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
have lots of lumps like this it will

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.600 
have lots of lumps like this it will
grow<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.829> lot<00:01:52.159> faster<00:01:54.340> as<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:56.299> see<00:01:56.689> here

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
grow a lot faster as you see here

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.450 
grow a lot faster as you see here
it<00:01:59.610> has<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> light<00:02:00.120> level<00:02:00.480> of<00:02:00.740> 13<00:02:01.740> next<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
it has a light level of 13 next to it

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.340 
it has a light level of 13 next to it
as<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.760> can<00:02:05.940> see<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:07.850> 13<00:02:08.850> it's<00:02:09.630> one<00:02:10.050> better

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
as you can see here 13 it's one better

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.620 
as you can see here 13 it's one better
than<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> regular<00:02:11.220> torch<00:02:14.030> if<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.240> have<00:02:15.420> any

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
than a regular torch if you have any

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.680 
than a regular torch if you have any
questions<00:02:16.050> about<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:17.250> lamp<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.610> growth<00:02:17.910> leave
