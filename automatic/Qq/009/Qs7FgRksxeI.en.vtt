different normal glass if you put a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.250 
different normal glass if you put a
block<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.579> next<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> it<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.480> banana

block right next to it we can see banana

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.789 
block right next to it we can see banana
vector<00:01:02.359> yeah<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.719> look<00:01:03.899> at<00:01:04.080> normal<00:01:04.589> glass

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
vector yeah if you look at normal glass

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
vector yeah if you look at normal glass

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
to craft it very simple it's the same as

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.950 
to craft it very simple it's the same as
with<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.640> hardened<00:02:44.030> clay<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.270> put<00:02:44.570> your<00:02:44.720> died

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
with the hardened clay you put your died

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.980 
with the hardened clay you put your died
in<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:45.980> middle<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.460> then<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.060> just<00:02:47.300> put<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
in the middle and then you just put the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.660 
in the middle and then you just put the
glass<00:02:48.230> around<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.010> then<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.340> would<00:02:49.490> end

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
glass around it and then you would end

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.780 
glass around it and then you would end
up<00:02:49.790> with<00:02:49.850> these<00:02:50.209> blocks<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:51.500> ya<00:02:51.800> say<00:02:52.550> mess

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
up with these blocks and ya say mess

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.510 
up with these blocks and ya say mess
with<00:02:53.030> hardened<00:02:53.510> clay<00:02:53.630> makes<00:02:54.230> sense<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.800> of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
with hardened clay makes sense and of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.820 
with hardened clay makes sense and of
course<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.270> glass<00:02:56.450> panes<00:02:56.870> then<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.680> would

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
course the glass panes then you would

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.460 
course the glass panes then you would
make<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.690> could<00:03:00.050> have<00:03:00.170> picked

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
make like that and you could have picked

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.280 
make like that and you could have picked
last<00:03:00.770> pains<00:03:01.160> okay<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.540> will<00:03:02.750> call<00:03:02.959> for<00:03:03.110> some

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
last pains okay that will call for some

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.420 
last pains okay that will call for some
girly<00:03:03.680> bills<00:03:04.660> but<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:06.590> same<00:03:06.860> place<00:03:07.100> actually

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
ones

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.560 
ones
well<00:04:25.370> there<00:04:25.550> are<00:04:25.580> slight<00:04:25.880> differences

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
well there are slight differences

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.360 
well there are slight differences
between<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.320> colored<00:04:27.620> glass<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.040> normal

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
between the colored glass in the normal

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.700 
between the colored glass in the normal
glass<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.669> cannot<00:04:29.060> place<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.660> torch<00:04:29.930> on<00:04:30.260> top<00:04:30.500> of

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
glass you cannot place a torch on top of

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.790 
glass you cannot place a torch on top of
it<00:04:30.860> for<00:04:31.490> whatever<00:04:31.669> reason<00:04:32.210> but<00:04:32.389> I'm<00:04:32.800> circuit

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
it for whatever reason but I'm circuit

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.360 
it for whatever reason but I'm circuit
works<00:04:34.490> just<00:04:35.030> normal<00:04:35.360> like<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.470> should<00:04:36.680> with

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
works just normal like it should with

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.370 
works just normal like it should with
regular<00:04:37.760> glass<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.780> is<00:04:39.020> pretty<00:04:39.260> nice<00:04:41.380> all

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
regular glass so that is pretty nice all

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.200 
regular glass so that is pretty nice all
right<00:04:42.650> guys<00:04:42.860> another<00:04:43.400> funny<00:04:43.700> thing<00:04:43.790> though

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
right guys another funny thing though

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.450 
right guys another funny thing though
with<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.050> glass<00:04:45.260> it<00:04:45.530> looks<00:04:45.740> pretty<00:04:45.889> I<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.250> it

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
with the glass it looks pretty I like it

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.310 
with the glass it looks pretty I like it
I<00:04:46.580> like<00:04:46.610> it<00:04:46.820> already<00:04:47.030> back<00:04:47.389> to<00:04:47.540> your<00:04:47.750> check<00:04:48.169> out

the<00:04:48.440> particles<00:04:48.980> of<00:04:49.100> this<00:04:49.580> torch<00:04:49.880> here<00:04:50.150> if<00:04:50.510> you

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
the particles of this torch here if you

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.430 
the particles of this torch here if you
look<00:04:50.780> at<00:04:50.960> it<00:04:51.010> roop<00:04:52.270> yeah<00:04:53.270> now<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.870> particles

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
look at it roop yeah now the particles

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.740 
look at it roop yeah now the particles
are<00:04:54.530> actually<00:04:54.980> rendered<00:04:55.340> behind<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.480> glass

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
are actually rendered behind the glass

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.469 
are actually rendered behind the glass
there<00:04:57.139> and<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:57.740> should<00:04:57.919> be<00:04:57.950> in<00:04:58.190> front<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:59.360> is

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
there and it should be in front that is

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.420 
there and it should be in front that is
a<00:04:59.510> pretty<00:04:59.870> old<00:05:00.229> bag<00:05:00.530> as<00:05:00.680> well<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.950> can<00:05:01.010> see<00:05:01.340> it

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
here nicely if you look at this torch

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.870 
here nicely if you look at this torch
the<00:05:04.820> effect<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.389> even<00:05:05.720> more<00:05:05.870> dramatic<00:05:06.880> yeah

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
the effect is even more dramatic yeah

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.219 
the effect is even more dramatic yeah
definitely<00:05:08.150> something<00:05:08.840> that<00:05:08.870> should<00:05:09.200> be
