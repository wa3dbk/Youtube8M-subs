of<00:00:19.410> V<00:00:20.100> role<00:00:20.310> recently<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> ran<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.869> very

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
of V role recently I ran a very

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.859 
of V role recently I ran a very
interesting<00:00:22.830> little<00:00:23.340> test<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.060> wanted<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> see

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
interesting little test I wanted to see

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.210 
interesting little test I wanted to see
what<00:00:25.050> would<00:00:25.170> happen<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.800> used<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
what would happen if I used a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.189 
what would happen if I used a
template-based<00:00:26.849> video<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> create<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
template-based video to create a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
template-based video to create a
facebook<00:00:28.769> video<00:00:29.039> ad<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.939> then<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.630> run

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
facebook video ad for and then to run

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.900 
facebook video ad for and then to run
that<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.410> see<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.130> would<00:00:32.219> happen<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.880> I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
that and see what would happen so I

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.330 
that and see what would happen so I
didn't<00:00:33.239> use<00:00:33.270> any<00:00:33.600> expensive<00:00:34.200> camera<00:00:34.829> gear<00:00:35.100> or

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
didn't use any expensive camera gear or

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.610 
didn't use any expensive camera gear or
video<00:00:35.790> editing<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.660> everything<00:00:37.350> was

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
video editing like that everything was

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.830 
video editing like that everything was
kept<00:00:37.890> very<00:00:38.040> simple<00:00:38.760> using<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.300> very<00:00:39.570> basic

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
kept very simple using a very basic

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
kept very simple using a very basic
video<00:00:40.530> template<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:40.950> I'll<00:00:41.160> show<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
video template that I'll show you in a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
video template that I'll show you in a
second<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.469> very

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
second now as this was one of my very

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.459 
second now as this was one of my very
first<00:00:44.280> tests<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> ran<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.660> felt<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
first tests that I ran I felt like a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.410 
first tests that I ran I felt like a
total<00:00:46.559> newb<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:47.879> didn't<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.270> what

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
total newb and I really didn't know what

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
total newb and I really didn't know what
I<00:00:48.480> was<00:00:48.600> doing<00:00:48.870> exactly<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.770> I

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
I was doing exactly and you know I

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.380 
I was doing exactly and you know I
didn't<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> would<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.430> any<00:00:50.640> views<00:00:51.120> any

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
didn't know if I would get any views any

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.619 
didn't know if I would get any views any
traffic<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.500> my<00:00:52.590> site<00:00:52.860> or<00:00:53.070> any<00:00:53.399> conversions<00:00:54.059> so

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
traffic to my site or any conversions so

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.360 
traffic to my site or any conversions so
it<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.199> kind<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.440> left<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> air<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.340> me

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it really kind of left in the air for me

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
it really kind of left in the air for me
to<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.180> happen<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.840> knew<00:00:58.260> was

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
to see what would happen all I knew was

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.349 
to see what would happen all I knew was
that<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.770> Facebook<00:00:59.309> video<00:00:59.640> ad<00:00:59.820> thing<00:01:00.149> was

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that this Facebook video ad thing was

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.110 
that this Facebook video ad thing was
taking<00:01:00.960> off<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.039> wanted<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.789> piece

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
taking off and I wanted to have a piece

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.039 
taking off and I wanted to have a piece
of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.570> action

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
of the action

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.230 
of the action
so<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.559> ran<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.460> test<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.150> be

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so I ran this little test and to be

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.270 
so I ran this little test and to be
honest<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:06.810> rather<00:01:07.049> amazed<00:01:07.470> at<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
honest I was rather amazed at the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.370 
honest I was rather amazed at the
results<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.270> opportunity<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.140> was

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
results and the opportunity that was

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
results and the opportunity that was
staring<00:01:10.830> me<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> face<00:01:11.400> I'll<00:01:11.909> show<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
staring me in the face I'll show you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.850

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
around a 34 percent conversion rate to
