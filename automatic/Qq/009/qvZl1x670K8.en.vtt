of<00:01:47.270> kind<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.810> bond<00:01:48.729> with<00:01:49.729> each<00:01:49.759> other<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.149> think

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
of kind of bond with each other I think

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.209 
of kind of bond with each other I think
about<00:01:50.659> my<00:01:50.780> husband<00:01:51.200> who's<00:01:51.409> got<00:01:51.619> dark<00:01:51.889> hair<00:01:51.950> and

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
about my husband who's got dark hair and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.739 
about my husband who's got dark hair and
dark<00:01:52.310> eyes<00:01:52.639> and<00:01:52.670> how<00:01:53.179> we<00:01:53.240> ended<00:01:53.479> up<00:01:53.539> with<00:01:53.600> an

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
dark eyes and how we ended up with an

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.129 
dark eyes and how we ended up with an
entire<00:01:54.049> redheaded<00:01:54.590> family<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.249> it<00:01:55.520> must<00:01:55.789> be

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.139 
entire redheaded family and it must be

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:58.779 
entire redheaded family and it must be
completely<00:01:57.139> baffling<00:01:57.799> but<00:01:58.459> there<00:01:58.609> is

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
completely baffling but there is

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.709 
completely baffling but there is
certainly<00:01:59.240> a<00:02:00.819> fraternity<00:02:01.819> out<00:02:02.240> there<00:02:02.539> of

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
certainly a fraternity out there of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.250 
certainly a fraternity out there of
redheads

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.320
