on<00:02:09.800> flat<00:02:10.399> surface<00:02:10.849> like<00:02:10.879> this<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:12.410> will<00:02:12.620> not

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
on flat surface like this you will not

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.690 
on flat surface like this you will not
roll<00:02:15.550> pretty<00:02:16.550> well<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.860> if<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.069> put<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:19.459> on

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
roll pretty well but if you put in on

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.229 
roll pretty well but if you put in on
carpet<00:02:20.300> or<00:02:20.800> some<00:02:21.800> other<00:02:21.950> surface<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:24.680> will<00:02:24.830> do

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
carpet or some other surface it will do

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.110 
carpet or some other surface it will do
the<00:02:26.239> job

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the job

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.240 
the job
okay<00:02:29.120> now<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:30.170> transformation<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.950> basically

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
okay now the transformation is basically

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.110 
okay now the transformation is basically
the<00:02:31.459> same<00:02:31.670> as<00:02:32.080> proud<00:02:33.700> first<00:02:34.700> thing<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:34.970> have

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the same as proud first thing you have

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.360 
the same as proud first thing you have
to<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.750> release<00:02:36.170> these<00:02:36.319> panels

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.819 

sometimes<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.730> will<00:02:41.049> go<00:02:42.049> off<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.590> same

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
sometimes this will go off the same

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
down the only thing that we I know this

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.740 
down the only thing that we I know this
fear<00:05:22.010> is<00:05:22.190> here<00:05:23.080> this<00:05:24.080> part<00:05:24.410> of<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.650> legs<00:05:24.860> a

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
fear is here this part of the legs a

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.290 
fear is here this part of the legs a
little<00:05:26.750> too<00:05:27.020> tight<00:05:27.290> more<00:05:28.280> tight<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.730> proud

little too tight more tight and proud

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.470 
little too tight more tight and proud
so<00:05:30.080> sometimes<00:05:30.980> very<00:05:31.550> difficult<00:05:32.000> to<00:05:32.120> put<00:05:32.300> this

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
so sometimes very difficult to put this

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.710 
so sometimes very difficult to put this
vine<00:05:32.660> in<00:05:33.110> some<00:05:33.380> positions<00:05:33.890> but<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:35.540> can

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
vine in some positions but you can

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.280 
vine in some positions but you can
manage<00:05:37.720> and<00:05:38.720> it's<00:05:38.900> a<00:05:39.080> very<00:05:39.650> very<00:05:40.550> nice<00:05:41.290> figure

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
manage and it's a very very nice figure

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.780 
manage and it's a very very nice figure
for<00:05:42.500> this<00:05:42.620> plane<00:05:42.920> I<00:05:43.160> think<00:05:44.440> it's<00:05:45.460> awesome

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
for this plane I think it's awesome

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:53.320 
for this plane I think it's awesome
I<00:05:47.000> like<00:05:47.660> this<00:05:48.340> silver<00:05:49.340> straight<00:05:49.690> classics<00:05:50.690> 2.0
