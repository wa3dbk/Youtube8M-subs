00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.179
 hello because today we will see how they fly me 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.769
 like to fly in this place has 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.769
 quite a lot of obstacles and I've always had 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.420
 The FPV is compatible with immersion and 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:44.710
 false 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:47.380
 which I thought not as always 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.800
 we turn on the station first and then 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.800
 the multi 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.290
 to build this controller we will create 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.610
 the water left will turn on the leds 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.920
 red 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.909
 to disarm to the right 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.909
 let's fly 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.890
 to begin with I say that I find 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.640
 profits a little high for my taste 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 tremble a little 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.759
 the engines are powerful climbs quite 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.759
 Quick 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.400
 in stabilized mode the limits are to 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.760
 45 degrees maximum roll and something more 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.760
 in pitch 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.600
 now change the manual I notice it softer 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:37.890
 responds well to the feet for both 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:41.900
 senses going fast behaves well 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.900
 you could run even more 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.000
 the flight time is around 8 minutes 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.250
 up to 10 going more relaxed 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.840
 I think it 's a multi of races that 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.550
 to come built super in 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.700
 benefits to many of the kits that 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.700
 come 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.520
 in conclusion I think your flight is a 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.910
 little nervous for beginners if you go 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.770
 to start with this do it little by little 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.960
 If you already have some experience and do not 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.310
 you want to build it, I think it's 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.620
 of the best options 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.750
 later I will tell you some improvements 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.750
 that will go well and upload more videos
