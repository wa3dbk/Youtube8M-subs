00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.620 
indoors all day this is the mask that I
turn<00:05:22.890> to<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.340> kind<00:05:23.580> of<00:05:23.669> give<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.180> little<00:05:24.240> boost

back<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.080> my<00:05:25.229> skin<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.740> I'm<00:05:26.669> like<00:05:26.850> I've<00:05:27.570> used

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
back to my skin and I'm like I've used

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.210 
back to my skin and I'm like I've used
quite<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.110> bit<00:05:28.169> at<00:05:28.350> this<00:05:28.500> as<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.710> can<00:05:28.740> tell<00:05:29.070> and

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
quite a bit at this as you can tell and

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.880 
quite a bit at this as you can tell and
I<00:05:29.280> really<00:05:29.520> like<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.910> this<00:05:30.390> lasts<00:05:31.350> quite<00:05:31.620> a<00:05:31.770> long

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
I really like it this lasts quite a long

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.130 
I really like it this lasts quite a long
time<00:05:32.310> I've<00:05:32.640> had<00:05:32.760> it<00:05:32.880> for<00:05:33.000> quite<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.180> bit<00:05:33.419> and<00:05:33.690> I

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
time I've had it for quite a bit and I

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.930 
time I've had it for quite a bit and I
definitely<00:05:34.410> think<00:05:34.800> it's<00:05:35.250> worth<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.610> money<00:05:35.640> it

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
definitely think it's worth the money it

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.300 
definitely think it's worth the money it
is<00:05:36.090> quite<00:05:36.300> an<00:05:36.390> expensive<00:05:36.630> mask<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.650> think

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
is quite an expensive mask but I think

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.700 
is quite an expensive mask but I think
it's<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.580> really<00:05:38.940> great<00:05:39.060> way<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.710> reinvigorate

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710
