00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 guide to forming a flight with 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.470
 goods during transportation to the warehouse 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.900
 class at delivery of goods to the network warehouse 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.809
 supermarket class goods must 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.179
 come no more than two or three positions on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.210
 polity goods must be placed 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.850
 so that when it is unloaded 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.789
 it was easy to calculate or simply not 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.189
 Rowan on either side of the pallet assembly 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.220
 product when forming the flight should 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.399
 carried out the following order if 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.250
 the goods are packed in a box for example glass 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.890
 they are located on the bottom layer of the pallet 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 so that they can be 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.640
 count 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.730
 at the same time it is extreme and the boxes must be in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.520
 single axles with pallet corners for convenience 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.010
 miscalculation of the pallet layer should be 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.120
 the same product ie one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.670
 name 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 the bottom layer of the pallet should be 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.680
 goods in tight packaging to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.500
 installing subsequent layers on it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.539
 flights goods and packaging survived 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.330
 load and not damaged when 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.020
 transportation when loading the next 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.820
 layer of goods such as a pallet with poets 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.549
 you must also consider the placement 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.770
 goods on a pallet it should be available 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.909
 reckon and scan with any 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.850
 pallet sides 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.560
 even if it is several positions of the goods 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.130
 as in our case when installing 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.229
 next layer pallets on top of pallet 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.820
 with pitas sure to fit 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.189
 cardboard layer 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.430
 this is done in order not to hurt 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.060
 integrity of packaging and goods 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.759
 located in it 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.720
 the topmost layer of the pallet allows 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.939
 the content of a single item goods 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.110
 assortment piece goods or goods by 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.850
 one pack of different size and volume 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 This item must be set 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.579
 and put in open boxes this way 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.670
 so that it is clearly visible from all sides 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.189
 and at its reception it was available was considered and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.920
 scanned if piece goods 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.320
 for example bottles stacked in cardboard 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.129
 the box does not completely fill it all 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.310
 the volume of such goods must be shifted 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.200
 cellophane 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.440
 or other convenient material at hand 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.989
 to seal it in a box this 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.690
 done to avoid friction 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.480
 and contact of the goods with each other 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.970
 during its transportation and unloading 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.099
 goods tightly packed in cardboard boxes 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.860
 upright 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.590
 does not leak save and do not hurt 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.140
 packaging without losing its presentation 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.930
 after flight completely 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.450
 formed and installed all pallets with 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.819
 ready- to-fly commodity needed 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.209
 fully wrap transparent film 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.970
 including the entire top pallet if available 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.250
 at the supplier of branded tape for 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.709
 extra protection and stranger 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.319
 interventions need to be stuck 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.360
 ready to fly with scotch to avoid 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.000
 opening of packaged goods 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.910
 if there is one on all the watering and 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.220
 the same flight is formed in layers so 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.340
 so that all the lower layers are 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.410
 equally packed and when unloading goods 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 it was easy to count or 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.810
 scan from either side of the pallet 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.790
 top layer flying with the same item 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.510
 can be laid in random order 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.700
 and differ from the lower layers ready for 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.430
 flight transportation should not 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.950
 exceed 1 meter in height 70 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.690
 centimeters and by weight should not be 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.690
 more than 700 kilograms
