00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.369
 hello my name is tom and me 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.060
 program a game and you can 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.430
 to be there 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.869
 So many, at least many 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.180
 take formally into the game 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.410
 some even program many times 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.730
 can not even program 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.200
 So you have to program that 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.090
 teach and then note that it 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.349
 Really shit a lot of work then lands 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.600
 most likely after a short time 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.950
 research the rpg major and then have 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.440
 but sometime no longer bock 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.880
 why was the fuck a lot of work is me 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.440
 meanwhile have the luck these phases 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.180
 to have experienced several times and so for 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.800
 an incredible fundus aborted 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.660
 to be able to look back on projects okay 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.129
 I was only 16 at the time 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.750
 By now I'm nine years older and 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.460
 can still reasonably program 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.140
 should i at least be able to do that for me 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.030
 stand here in berlin applied 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.530
 computer science and fortunately i have 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.469
 even the one or the other game in 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.570
 programmed my studies 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.519
 vesterbacka pg this is about it 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.290
 to scan barcodes from packaging and 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.240
 these are just the other thermal items 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.400
 converted or a skill to armor 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.380
 shields donner beams no idea 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.479
 and then you can equip and 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.979
 they fight against other players too 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.630
 with her mobile phone on the road are the found 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.300
 I was extremely revolutionary at the time or that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.280
 connects the reality with the 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.430
 Virtual world was a completely different kind 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.430
 and wise 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.430
 Here I have a little push 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.229
 programmed you are nutritionists 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.049
 with a vegan and have this 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.340
 then feed the fat types with vegetables 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.070
 getting thinner and thinner 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.020
 Here I use 3d interpolation 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.360
 Dynamic soil is created 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.899
 be changed meteorites hit 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.700
 I have the whole game in opengl 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.710
 programmed and so is the new 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.679
 I play this in advance 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.789
 be programmed yellow above but 2 like 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.960
 I see you already have a bit 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.509
 experience in the sector 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.860
 game development and that's why I have 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.640
 now bock a bigger project 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.560
 address 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.789
 this new game idea haunts me 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.350
 now about half a year 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.179
 and that's why I want to implement it 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.860
 as I said it is a little bigger 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.569
 play but what exactly it is 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.849
 told next time 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.700
 that means you are curious then 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.390
 So you have to switch and so good 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.819
 this marketing and I think mine 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.670
 motivation is rising with great enthusiasm 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.769
 and participation on your part so with 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.330
 ask suggestions of praise or 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.890
 constructive criticism please just in 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.660
 the comments then i can do that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.160
 perceive when the part works 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.150
 not quite as good in our world yet 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.329
 even if that might be some 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.680
 esoterics mean no and if you 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.180
 want to know that we are working 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.069
 then follow me on twitter 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.590
 or facebook or subscribe here 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.299
 a channel or he is looking at youtube 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.980
 just last game dev i should 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.980
 also work until next time
