00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello recently, on the other hand, a guest 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.200
 storm and he was even so strong that you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.200
 the power failed 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.500
 hello mama thank god i had 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.549
 yes still a handy but I had something 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.969
 from the world even the battery is empty 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.220

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.680
 yes you are really totally love how come 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.660
 that we have never sown 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.890
 hello we are your parents of course 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.170
 i would like to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.070
 do not worry so far but that's the result 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.869
 I noticed that we are pretty 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.580
 depending on our phones are with like 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.960
 I mean, I 'm still 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.940
 somehow pretty sure I'm there 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 not alone there are situations there 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.190
 will no longer what I or 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.840
 my cellphone should make like for 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.309
 for example, in kloten what do I have there 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.620
 Please make it earlier than child where I am 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.000
 even a cell phone had gripped me so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.230
 often on the toilet on the cell phone who is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.270
 meanwhile I have to go to the toilet when I am 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.820
 end or in the bus because my god is there 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 is the music or radio and also 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.210
 besides, no music and besides that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.890
 radio and also the music can be very 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.989
 weird in the car but you have in the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.489
 radio and without distraction so my cellphone 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.780
 I want to air all the pups and the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.190
 weird noises from the weird 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 speak of the comic people around me 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.920
 I can not stand it at all and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.240
 you can deal with the bus from sugar 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 if it looks like you do 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.390
 but call in reality if 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.400
 you just get the news from this 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 a person under contact only with 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.100
 voice messages were just responding 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.350
 reported about what lunch 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.759
 Nobody can know another one 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.530
 situation I once in the on each 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.180
 case need is if this one person 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.380
 someone does not want to see 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.270
 for example, Jennifer the stupid cow 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.759
 hopefully see me not just once 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.840
 as if I would not hey hallo 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.430
 and jennifer yes sometimes works well or 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.170
 evening of toothbrushing when I am with the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.670
 Toothbrush in the mouth quite wild to the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.040
 rhythms from this little part here 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 God is moving his bathroom windows 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.710
 because otherwise you could certainly be afraid 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.090
 to get done and listen to the music itself 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.070
 Although actually this little bed 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.690
 boy here but there is not synonymous 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.450
 always 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.950
 sorry radio anyway thank you in the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.510
 I always use my mobile phone 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.890
 forgetting I 'm too lazy to pick up 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.700
 as it is between real sometimes the popo 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.170
 Incidentally, have you ever your parents 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.980
 followed on which dating site 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.960
 got to know 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.050
 guess you did not have any 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.140
 No apps and why did not I have those 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.700
 Did not have any cell phones is not 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.680
 crazy I mean we have those back then 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.540
 Angry birds did not play with it 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.010
 real birds or or doodle jump 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.660
 So I imagine myself without a cell phone 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.100
 exhausting and also very dangerous 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.340
 commentary ago actually the name of the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.080
 faces of the old people eighth 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.120
 but they are all weird now 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.380
 bradley had an appointment at that time 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.700
 I know but when you look at yourself 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.170
 as a curve date then comes always 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.730
 at least one person too late but the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.980
 call and then they will speak off and 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.360
 there is no thing on it but you can do it sooner 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.100
 stay at home or how and not 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.600
 everyone has a carrier pigeon as well 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.890
 that are very tall and very heavy and have 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.560
 ate a lot or filled everything 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.030
 packed extremely impractical no matter 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.710
 We do not have to ask ourselves that 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.880
 We have our cell phones on 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.040
 my sister is it before two 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.240
 camp and she cried and 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.500
 now we do this when we do not 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.820
 Incidentally, everyone can understand 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.570
 We'll see you next time 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.570
 bye bye
