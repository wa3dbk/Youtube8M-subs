00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
would purchase this you could use this

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.499 
would purchase this you could use this
as<00:01:12.799> your<00:01:12.979> home<00:01:13.159> router<00:01:13.369> if<00:01:13.789> you<00:01:13.969> already<00:01:14.270> have

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
as your home router if you already have

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.200 
as your home router if you already have
a<00:01:14.539> home<00:01:14.780> router<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.829> also<00:01:16.009> acts<00:01:16.369> as<00:01:16.609> an<00:01:16.789> access

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
a home router it also acts as an access

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.300 
a home router it also acts as an access
point<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:17.719> you<00:01:17.780> could<00:01:18.020> simply<00:01:18.409> plug<00:01:19.069> it<00:01:19.189> into

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
point so you could simply plug it into

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.910 
point so you could simply plug it into
your<00:01:19.490> home<00:01:19.670> router<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.240> not<00:01:20.450> have<00:01:20.689> to<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:21.530> you

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
your home router and not have to to you

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.319 
your home router and not have to to you
know<00:01:22.039> switch<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.460> over<00:01:22.700> if<00:01:22.789> you<00:01:22.909> if<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.179> like

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
know switch it over if you if you like

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.749 
know switch it over if you if you like
your<00:01:23.479> home<00:01:23.630> router<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:25.310> one's<00:01:25.579> already

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
your home router and this one's already

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.580 
your home router and this one's already
simplified<00:01:26.179> so<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:26.929> once<00:01:27.109> you<00:01:27.229> plug<00:01:27.439> it

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
simplified so that you once you plug it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.529 
simplified so that you once you plug it
in<00:01:27.710> it's<00:01:28.219> it's<00:01:28.490> very<00:01:28.549> simplified<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:29.359> what

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
in it's it's very simplified so what

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.469 
in it's it's very simplified so what
happens<00:01:29.899> is<00:01:30.079> you<00:01:30.799> you<00:01:31.189> plug<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.579> in<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:31.909> then

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
happens is you you plug it in and then

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.499 
happens is you you plug it in and then
in<00:01:32.840> order<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.829> you<00:01:34.159> have<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.759> couple<00:01:35.030> models

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
in order to you you have a couple models

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.849 
in order to you you have a couple models
of<00:01:35.689> cell<00:01:35.869> phones<00:01:36.109> to<00:01:36.259> choose<00:01:36.439> from<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:36.799> I'm

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
precious GSM minutes right you would use

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.970 
precious GSM minutes right you would use
the<00:02:37.550> cheaper<00:02:37.970> rated<00:02:38.540> Y<00:02:39.260> five<00:02:39.530> minutes<00:02:39.830> right

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
the cheaper rated Y five minutes right

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.010 
the cheaper rated Y five minutes right
right<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.700> mean<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:41.030> lot<00:02:41.240> nowadays<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> lot<00:02:41.959> of

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
right I mean a lot nowadays a lot of

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.170 
right I mean a lot nowadays a lot of
people<00:02:42.110> use<00:02:42.980> their<00:02:43.250> cell<00:02:43.520> phones<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:44.000> their

people use their cell phones as their

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.840 
people use their cell phones as their
main<00:02:44.390> phones<00:02:44.750> right<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.860> they<00:02:46.070> incur<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.640> lot

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
main phones right so so they incur a lot

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.150 
main phones right so so they incur a lot
of<00:02:46.910> usage<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:49.130> will<00:02:49.400> allow<00:02:49.670> them<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.470> use<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
of usage this will allow them to use the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.330 
of usage this will allow them to use the
Wi-Fi<00:02:52.370> instead<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.920> cellular

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
Wi-Fi instead of the the cellular

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.030 
Wi-Fi instead of the the cellular
minutes<00:02:55.730> on<00:02:55.910> their<00:02:56.030> contract<00:02:56.860> when<00:02:57.860> they're

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
minutes on their contract when they're

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.910 
minutes on their contract when they're
within<00:02:58.220> range<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.850> not<00:02:59.090> only<00:02:59.530> is<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.620> when

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
within range so not only is it when

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.470 
within range so not only is it when
they're<00:03:01.100> within<00:03:01.370> range<00:03:01.520> of<00:03:01.820> their<00:03:01.940> home<00:03:02.150> with

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
dropping of the call when there's a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.500 
dropping of the call when there's a
transition<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:54.130> it's<00:03:55.130> very<00:03:55.430> easy<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.970> set<00:03:56.480> up

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
transition and it's very easy to set up

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.910 
transition and it's very easy to set up
and<00:03:56.750> use<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.049> don't<00:03:57.200> have<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.620> worry<00:03:57.799> about

and use you don't have to worry about

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.830 
and use you don't have to worry about
encryption<00:03:58.549> you<00:03:58.640> can<00:03:58.820> set<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.180> encryption<00:03:59.750> on

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
encryption you can set up encryption on

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.460 
encryption you can set up encryption on
the<00:03:59.959> phone<00:04:00.110> as<00:04:00.260> well

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
calling quality

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.900 
calling quality
I<00:04:23.080> mean<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.200> it's<00:04:24.920> what<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:25.460> would<00:04:25.550> expect

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
I mean it it's what you would expect

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.180 
I mean it it's what you would expect
from<00:04:26.120> from<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:27.020> know<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.140> clear<00:04:27.500> digital

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
from from you know a clear digital

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.890 
from from you know a clear digital
signal<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.480> know<00:04:29.570> when<00:04:29.750> you're<00:04:29.870> on

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
signal so you know when you're on

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.540 
signal so you know when you're on
cellular<00:04:30.470> you're<00:04:30.920> getting<00:04:31.190> your<00:04:31.280> clear

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
cellular you're getting your clear

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.760 
cellular you're getting your clear
digital<00:04:31.760> t-mobile<00:04:32.570> signal<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.440> when<00:04:33.620> you're

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
digital t-mobile signal and when you're

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.710 
digital t-mobile signal and when you're
in<00:04:33.830> your<00:04:33.980> home<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.360> know<00:04:35.360> you're<00:04:35.510> getting

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
in your home you know you're getting

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.210 
in your home you know you're getting
your<00:04:35.840> clear<00:04:36.020> connection<00:04:36.440> not<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:37.040> do

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
your clear connection not you you do

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.090 
your clear connection not you you do
need<00:04:37.430> broadband<00:04:38.120> right<00:04:38.480> so<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.170> and<00:04:39.920> it's

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
need broadband right so and and it's

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.440 
need broadband right so and and it's
recommended<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.640> have<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.060> know<00:04:41.150> at<00:04:41.270> least

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
recommended to have you know at least

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.240 
recommended to have you know at least
let's<00:04:42.200> say<00:04:42.320> 300<00:04:42.860> K<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.370> up<00:04:44.360> speed<00:04:44.960> in<00:04:45.830> order<00:04:46.100> to

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
let's say 300 K of up speed in order to

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.970 
let's say 300 K of up speed in order to
have<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.270> best<00:04:47.480> experience<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:48.380> can<00:04:48.530> at<00:04:48.920> that

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
have the best experience you can at that

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.320 
have the best experience you can at that
speed<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.430> could<00:04:49.550> probably<00:04:49.730> have<00:04:49.910> about<00:04:50.000> 4

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
speed you could probably have about 4

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.630 
speed you could probably have about 4
phones<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.870> see<00:04:51.140> in<00:04:51.680> your<00:04:51.830> home<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:52.400> you<00:04:52.460> can

phones I see in your home you so you can

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.970 
phones I see in your home you so you can
have<00:04:52.760> more<00:04:52.910> than<00:04:52.970> one<00:04:53.270> but<00:04:54.050> but<00:04:54.500> yeah<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.680> mean

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
have more than one but but yeah I mean

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.440 
have more than one but but yeah I mean
the<00:04:55.190> quality<00:04:55.340> is<00:04:55.550> gonna<00:04:55.730> be<00:04:55.820> digital<00:04:56.120> quality

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
the quality is gonna be digital quality

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.550 
the quality is gonna be digital quality
it's<00:04:56.540> gonna<00:04:56.660> be<00:04:56.750> very<00:04:56.900> clear<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.140> again<00:04:57.350> going

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
it's gonna be very clear and again going

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.110 
it's gonna be very clear and again going
back<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.160> voice<00:04:58.400> quality<00:04:58.700> because

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
back to the voice quality because

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.580 
back to the voice quality because
sometimes<00:04:59.510> I<00:04:59.630> know<00:04:59.690> that<00:04:59.990> when<00:05:00.170> I'm<00:05:00.290> in<00:05:00.320> my

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
sometimes I know that when I'm in my

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.340 
sometimes I know that when I'm in my
neighborhood<00:05:01.430> or<00:05:01.670> my<00:05:02.030> home<00:05:02.210> or<00:05:02.480> my<00:05:02.690> friend's

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
house that my gsm connection isn't

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.580 
house that my gsm connection isn't
really<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.170> good

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
really so good

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.340 
really so good
but<00:05:07.070> as<00:05:07.310> long<00:05:07.490> as<00:05:07.520> if<00:05:07.790> there's<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.350> nearby

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
but as long as if there's a nearby

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.500 
but as long as if there's a nearby
wireless<00:05:10.010> network<00:05:10.370> nearby<00:05:10.760> right<00:05:10.940> well<00:05:11.390> as

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
wireless network nearby right well as

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.030 
wireless network nearby right well as
long<00:05:11.660> as<00:05:11.810> there's<00:05:11.990> there's<00:05:12.260> one<00:05:12.440> of<00:05:12.560> these<00:05:12.710> one

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
long as there's there's one of these one

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.290 
long as there's there's one of these one
of<00:05:13.070> these<00:05:13.250> around<00:05:13.700> one<00:05:13.880> of<00:05:13.970> these<00:05:14.090> around

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
of these around one of these around

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.540 
of these around one of these around
right<00:05:14.600> then<00:05:14.840> uh<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:15.440> mean<00:05:15.800> I<00:05:16.010> would<00:05:16.100> imagine<00:05:16.310> the

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
right then uh I mean I would imagine the

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.220 
right then uh I mean I would imagine the
quality<00:05:16.940> is<00:05:17.090> gonna<00:05:17.240> be<00:05:17.420> even<00:05:17.510> better<00:05:17.810> than

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
quality is gonna be even better than

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.800 
quality is gonna be even better than
trying<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:18.590> pick<00:05:18.740> up<00:05:18.770> a<00:05:18.980> very<00:05:19.220> low<00:05:19.610> GSM<00:05:20.600> signal

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
trying to pick up a very low GSM signal

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.620 
trying to pick up a very low GSM signal
right<00:05:21.170> well<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:21.560> and<00:05:21.740> that's<00:05:21.890> one<00:05:22.070> of<00:05:22.190> the

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
right well that and that's one of the

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.330 
right well that and that's one of the
negative<00:05:23.630> things<00:05:23.660> about<00:05:23.990> GSM<00:05:24.650> is<00:05:24.860> that<00:05:25.070> when

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
negative things about GSM is that when

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.640 
negative things about GSM is that when
you're<00:05:25.490> inside<00:05:26.270> or<00:05:26.300> when<00:05:27.020> you're<00:05:27.170> in<00:05:27.260> the

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
you're inside or when you're in the

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.300 
you're inside or when you're in the
