gonna fold it inwards just keep folding

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.059 
gonna fold it inwards just keep folding
in<00:03:01.040> men<00:03:01.220> words<00:03:01.630> then<00:03:02.630> take<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.930> top<00:03:03.139> one<00:03:03.440> fold

once you get here you're gonna the last
one<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.739> just<00:03:12.889> fold<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:14.120> might<00:03:14.299> have

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
one you just fold it in you might have

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.010 
one you just fold it in you might have
to<00:03:14.799> push

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
to push

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.010

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
little pocket right here you're gonna

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.470 
little pocket right here you're gonna
take<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:21.960> and<00:03:22.710> fold<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.850> pocket

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
take this one and fold it in that pocket

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.820 
take this one and fold it in that pocket
and<00:03:26.750> you're<00:03:27.750> gonna<00:03:27.870> push<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.320> all<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.470> way<00:03:28.590> in

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
kinds of designs if you want as shown I

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.590 
kinds of designs if you want as shown I
have<00:03:46.100> this<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:49.940> I<00:03:50.940> have<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.150> bunch<00:03:51.420> of

have this this this I have a bunch of

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.230 
have this this this I have a bunch of
them<00:03:51.810> actually<00:03:52.680> met<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> video<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.820> all<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.120> them

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
them actually met a video on all of them

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.150 
them actually met a video on all of them
and<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:55.020> just<00:03:55.200> want<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.410> make<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> video<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.070> how

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
and I just want to make a video on how

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.330 
and I just want to make a video on how
to<00:03:56.310> make<00:03:56.430> up<00:03:56.810> now<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.870> way<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.320> get<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.980> spin

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
to make up now the way I get it to spin

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.680 
to make up now the way I get it to spin
is<00:03:59.610> I<00:04:00.300> take<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.250> once<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.790> X<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.330> have<00:04:03.540> in

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
is I take it and once that X you have in

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.570 
is I take it and once that X you have in
the<00:04:03.780> middle<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.380> you're<00:04:04.920> gonna<00:04:05.070> turn<00:04:05.400> it

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
the middle of it you're gonna turn it

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.910 
the middle of it you're gonna turn it
sideways<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.420> diamond<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.470> you're<00:04:07.740> just

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
sideways like a diamond and you're just

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.840 
sideways like a diamond and you're just
gonna<00:04:08.070> fold<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:09.380> just<00:04:10.380> fold<00:04:10.770> it<00:04:10.920> in<00:04:11.040> half<00:04:11.160> and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
gonna fold it just fold it in half and

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.030 
gonna fold it just fold it in half and
then<00:04:11.910> just<00:04:12.470> keep<00:04:13.470> doing<00:04:13.830> that

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
then just keep doing that

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.640 
then just keep doing that
turn<00:04:14.520> it<00:04:14.730> hold<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.810> turn<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.410> hold<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:19.170> then

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
turn it hold it turn it hold it and then

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.540 
turn it hold it turn it hold it and then
to<00:04:19.799> also<00:04:20.100> make<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.520> fast<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.750> can<00:04:21.959> take<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.550> one

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
to also make it fast you can take a one

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.640 
to also make it fast you can take a one
second<00:04:27.290> you<00:04:28.290> can<00:04:28.470> take<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.790> tack<00:04:29.790> or<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.620> pen<00:04:31.620> a

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
second you can take a tack or a pen a

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.700 
second you can take a tack or a pen a
sharp<00:04:32.160> pen<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.150> can<00:04:33.180> stick<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.930> directly

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
sharp pen and you can stick it directly

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
sharp pen and you can stick it directly
in<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.310> middle

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.450 

and<00:04:41.300> then<00:04:41.480> she<00:04:42.320> pull<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.620> out<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.310> there

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
and then she pull it out and there

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.180 
and then she pull it out and there
should<00:04:43.640> be<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:44.690> little<00:04:44.930> thing<00:04:45.920> on<00:04:46.160> the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
should be this little thing on the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.570 
should be this little thing on the
bottom<00:04:46.340> I<00:04:46.880> don't<00:04:47.180> know<00:04:47.360> if<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:47.570> can<00:04:47.690> see<00:04:47.930> that

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
bottom I don't know if you can see that

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.070 
bottom I don't know if you can see that
it's<00:04:49.580> just<00:04:49.820> this<00:04:50.000> little<00:04:50.330> thing<00:04:50.600> right<00:04:50.630> there

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
it's just this little thing right there

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.800 
it's just this little thing right there
and<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.620> also<00:04:52.040> helps<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:53.270> then<00:04:53.480> once<00:04:53.690> you

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
and that also helps it and then once you

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.770 
and that also helps it and then once you
do<00:04:53.930> that<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.380> can<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.610> spin<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:58.780> that's

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
do that you can just spin it and that's

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.640 
do that you can just spin it and that's
how<00:04:59.930> you<00:04:59.990> make<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.260> paper<00:05:00.530> spinner<00:05:00.920> thanks
