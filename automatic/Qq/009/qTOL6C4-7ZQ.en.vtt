00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
pedaling support but then it's got

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.390 
pedaling support but then it's got
amazing<00:03:37.690> traction<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.980> was<00:03:39.099> one<00:03:39.250> of<00:03:39.340> the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
amazing traction and that was one of the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.849 
amazing traction and that was one of the
things<00:03:39.549> about<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.940> uprising<00:03:40.209> last<00:03:40.599> year<00:03:40.870> you

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
things about the uprising last year you

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.800 
things about the uprising last year you
know<00:03:41.889> it<00:03:42.190> was<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.459> smallest<00:03:42.819> wheeled<00:03:43.329> bike<00:03:43.569> in

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
know it was the smallest wheeled bike in

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.129 
know it was the smallest wheeled bike in
in<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.560> test<00:03:44.829> but<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.519> had<00:03:45.760> as<00:03:46.030> much<00:03:46.750> grip<00:03:46.959> of

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
in the test but it had as much grip of

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.220 
in the test but it had as much grip of
some<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.739> 29<00:03:48.459> stage<00:03:48.790> right<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.109> think

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
some of the 29 stage right so I think

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.839 
some of the 29 stage right so I think
that<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.650> transfers<00:03:51.310> through<00:03:51.459> with<00:03:51.700> this

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
that that transfers through with this

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.470 
that that transfers through with this
bike<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.209> has<00:03:52.239> insane<00:03:52.750> grip<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:54.760> then<00:03:55.000> it's<00:03:55.329> a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
bike it has insane grip but then it's a

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.580 
bike it has insane grip but then it's a
120<00:03:55.870> bike<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:57.129> feels<00:03:57.370> bottomless

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
120 bike and it feels bottomless

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.690 
120 bike and it feels bottomless

with<00:04:28.860> an<00:04:29.220> angle<00:04:30.210> said<00:04:30.450> Dave<00:04:30.750> Wiggles

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
with an angle said Dave Wiggles

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.620 
with an angle said Dave Wiggles
collaborated<00:04:31.740> with<00:04:31.890> FSA<00:04:32.610> yeah<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.450> they've

collaborated with FSA yeah and they've
got<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:34.050> internal<00:04:34.590> angle<00:04:35.130> set<00:04:35.340> you<00:04:35.550> know

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
got this internal angle set you know

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.240 
got this internal angle set you know
adjustable<00:04:36.150> geometry<00:04:37.140> headset<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.100> bike

so right you could change the head angle

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.430 
so right you could change the head angle
from<00:04:41.640> sixty<00:04:42.030> eight<00:04:42.120> point<00:04:42.360> six<00:04:42.540> to<00:04:43.200> at<00:04:43.290> least
