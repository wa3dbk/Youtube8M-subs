00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
think this is a bad figure I'm just

think this is a bad figure I'm just
finding<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> false<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.290> um<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:32.369> is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
finding the false about it um this is

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.600 
finding the false about it um this is
missile<00:01:33.060> launcher<00:01:34.070> well<00:01:35.070> okay<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> was<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
missile launcher well okay that was a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.580 
missile launcher well okay that was a
little<00:01:35.670> bit<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> fail<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
little bit of a fail but this is a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.319 
little bit of a fail but this is a
missile<00:01:37.920> launches<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.729> bow<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.150> don't

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
missile launches that is not bow I don't

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
missile launches that is not bow I don't
care<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:39.689> things<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.950> makes<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
care if these things like that makes it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
care if these things like that makes it
look<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> bow<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> missile

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
look like a bow it's not it's a missile

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.340 
look like a bow it's not it's a missile
launch<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:44.090> I've<00:01:45.090> never<00:01:45.240> seen<00:01:45.390> Hawkeye<00:01:45.930> carry

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
can actually store it on the figure

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.780 
can actually store it on the figure
that's<00:02:04.290> pretty<00:02:04.560> cool<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.040> yeah<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.579> put

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
those in there and interchange it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.339 
those in there and interchange it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.559 
the mobile universe before I'm nobody
got<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.870> la<00:02:17.020> GI<00:02:17.410> Joe<00:02:17.709> stuff<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.420> he<00:02:19.420> also

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
got it in la GI Joe stuff but he also

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.360 
got it in la GI Joe stuff but he also
comes<00:02:19.870> with<00:02:20.020> another<00:02:20.349> two<00:02:20.560> pistols<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.220> right

comes with another two pistols one right
here<00:02:21.610> i'm<00:02:21.880> not<00:02:22.000> going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> actually<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.630> show

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
here i'm not going to actually like show

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.339 
here i'm not going to actually like show
them<00:02:23.080> because<00:02:23.380> they're<00:02:23.739> really<00:02:24.099> basic<00:02:25.349> but

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
them because they're really basic but

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.680 
them because they're really basic but
the<00:02:26.470> holsters<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.130> them<00:02:27.580> there<00:02:28.209> isn't<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.480> hole

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the holsters for them there isn't a hole

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.930 
the holsters for them there isn't a hole
cut<00:02:28.900> out<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.170> bottom<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.280> can't<00:02:30.730> actually

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
cut out the bottom so you can't actually

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.180 
cut out the bottom so you can't actually
get<00:02:31.540> them<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:31.959> like<00:02:32.230> fit<00:02:32.530> in<00:02:32.650> there<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.980> best

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
get them just like fit in there the best

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.970 
get them just like fit in there the best
so<00:02:33.790> I'm<00:02:33.880> afraid<00:02:34.090> they're<00:02:34.270> going<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.450> fall<00:02:34.600> out

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
so I'm afraid they're going to fall out

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.530 
so I'm afraid they're going to fall out

articulation right now this is what

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.610 
articulation right now this is what
really<00:03:21.120> makes<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.390> figure<00:03:22.840> not<00:03:23.049> this<00:03:23.410> is

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
really makes this figure not this is

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.319 
really makes this figure not this is
this<00:03:24.040> is<00:03:24.220> what<00:03:24.370> holds<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.700> figure<00:03:24.910> back<00:03:25.090> for

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
this is what holds the figure back for

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.949 
this is what holds the figure back for
