00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.630
 hello our beloved by viewers in 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.319
 this review we are talking about this nano 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.480
 the seventh generation of the novelty has a very 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.760
 slim and lightweight body thickness ipod nano 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.460
 only 5 and 4 millimeters weight 31 grams 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.049
 the new ipod nano is completely different from 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.530
 halfway generation 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.010
 New displays Vova twice 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.550
 many scold ipo for losing early 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.560
 your charm and many were frustrated 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.080
 that it cannot be used anymore 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.380
 like a clock but let's think about what we are 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 did they want to do this no they 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.990
 wanted to make an ultraportable 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.580
 player and they finally did it 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.789
 ipod nano 6 was good but it was not a player 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.980
 on the other hand there is something to blame and sex 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.880
 this time the seventh nano has a button 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.850
 which does not fit into the design 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.400
 They are convenient to press this is clearly too much for me 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.170
 I liked it and the fact that he used such 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.960
 useless functions like playing 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.950
 video yes the display has become bigger 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.310
 the resolution is 240 0430 two 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.410
 the points it is made by multitouch technology 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.870
 here you can increase 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.370
 photos as their fund but why? 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.470
 i need not understand 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.890
 now about a pleasant ii under will be sold 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.190
 eight colors and only 16 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.510
 gigabytes of memory on board think this 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.950
 right decision considering the cost 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.960
 only 149 dollars 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.060
 war but a latina connector is installed 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.820
 the bundle goes great 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.530
 headphones and from pic they are really 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.300
 the classroom is finally done 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.010
 button to switch songs 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.180
 it is between the volume and buttons 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.619
 works like a headphone if you click 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.979
 once pause twice snooping songs 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.220
 it is convenient abay for everything also has fm radio 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.509
 appeared dishes ties headphones and more 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.000
 accelerometer also do not understand why he 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.119
 need one but useless functions a 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.270
 All the same I found if I tilt my iPod 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.560
 send volume start 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.290
 overflow very useful feature 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.820
 and most importantly the battery and ipod nano 7 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.200
 works 30 hours while listening to music 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.860
 when only 24 of us worked on our lives and 5 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.870
 o'clock 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.320
 the result on ipod nano is good quality 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.140
 easy small and inexpensive field but it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.160
 not cool and watch but then the question is what 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
 do you want a watch or player 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.809
