that<00:01:14.909> way<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> droid

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that way and then you have a droid

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.999 
that way and then you have a droid
attachment<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.270> which<00:01:19.200> attaches<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> the

which is a little bit different and then

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.670 
which is a little bit different and then
you<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.619> your<00:01:25.799> light<00:01:26.159> slave<00:01:26.640> light<00:01:27.060> saber

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680

sling which I won't be able to use

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.440 
sling which I won't be able to use

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
because that level finished I'm just

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.190 
because that level finished I'm just
that<00:01:33.659> good<00:01:34.070> if<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.280> restart<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> level<00:01:36.210> you'll

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that good if we restart the level you'll

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310 
that good if we restart the level you'll

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
see the light saber sling here and this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.280 
see the light saber sling here and this
just<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.329> similar<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.479> King<00:01:42.840> sling<00:01:43.170> I

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
just is like similar to King sling I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230 
just is like similar to King sling I
believe<00:01:43.590> where<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.430> bust<00:01:44.939> through

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
believe where you just bust through

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.380 
believe where you just bust through
makes<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:45.810> bird<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.259> faster<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
makes your bird go a little faster and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.270 
makes your bird go a little faster and
imparts<00:01:48.390> more<00:01:48.450> power<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> structure

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
imparts more power on on the structure

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
imparts more power on on the structure
when<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.460> hit<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:51.990> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
when you hit it and then you have this

that<00:02:54.609> there<00:02:54.760> are<00:02:54.849> five<00:02:55.120> levels<00:02:55.390> available<00:02:55.660> and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
that there are five levels available and

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.390 
that there are five levels available and
there<00:02:56.319> are<00:02:56.349> two<00:02:56.650> days<00:02:56.859> left<00:02:57.069> in<00:02:57.250> this

there are two days left in this

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.800 
there are two days left in this
tournament<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:57.970> believe<00:02:58.269> it's<00:02:58.420> on<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.629> same

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
tournament so I believe it's on the same

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.300 
tournament so I believe it's on the same
schedule<00:02:59.140> as<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.409> Angry<00:02:59.709> Birds<00:02:59.890> friends

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
schedule as the Angry Birds friends

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.149 
schedule as the Angry Birds friends
tournament<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.909> so<00:03:01.870> right<00:03:02.590> now<00:03:02.769> we<00:03:02.829> have

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
tournament and so right now we have

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.849 
tournament and so right now we have
these<00:03:03.970> five<00:03:04.269> levels<00:03:04.690> available<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.379> to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
these five levels available and to

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.569 
these five levels available and to
actually<00:03:06.250> when<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:06.489> go<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.849> to<00:03:07.150> a<00:03:07.299> level

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
actually when you go in to a level

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.099 
actually when you go in to a level
notice<00:03:09.579> that<00:03:09.879> crystal<00:03:10.599> count<00:03:10.810> up<00:03:10.959> here

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
notice that crystal count up here

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.960 
notice that crystal count up here
doesn't<00:03:11.470> change<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:11.920> if<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.159> actually<00:03:12.340> restart

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
doesn't change but if I actually restart

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.619 
doesn't change but if I actually restart
the<00:03:13.209> level

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
the level

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.280 
the level
I'm<00:03:13.690> deducted<00:03:14.620> one<00:03:14.890> crystal<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:16.139> if<00:03:17.139> I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
I'm deducted one crystal and if I

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.180 
I'm deducted one crystal and if I
actually<00:03:17.500> go<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:19.620> exit<00:03:20.620> out<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.889> level

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
actually go in and exit out of the level

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.470 
actually go in and exit out of the level
unducted<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.269> crystal<00:03:23.639> so<00:03:24.639> these<00:03:24.910> crystals<00:03:25.389> you

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
unducted a crystal so these crystals you

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.030 
unducted a crystal so these crystals you
can<00:03:25.510> see<00:03:25.720> there's<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.959> timer<00:03:26.230> here<00:03:26.560> so<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.859> will

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
can see there's a timer here so it will

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.240 
can see there's a timer here so it will
recharge<00:03:27.639> over<00:03:28.209> time<00:03:28.450> but<00:03:29.379> that's<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.739> bit<00:03:30.069> of<00:03:30.190> a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
recharge over time but that's a bit of a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.589 
recharge over time but that's a bit of a
different<00:03:30.639> that's<00:03:30.910> obviously<00:03:31.359> a<00:03:31.389> lot

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599

an unknown how that's going to come over

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.939 
an unknown how that's going to come over
and<00:03:43.389> how<00:03:43.449> we'll<00:03:43.870> see<00:03:44.019> how<00:03:44.169> that<00:03:44.379> how<00:03:44.889> that

money<00:04:37.539> Falcons<00:04:38.139> so<00:04:39.009> if<00:04:39.100> you're<00:04:39.250> really<00:04:39.550> a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
money Falcons so if you're really a

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.060 
money Falcons so if you're really a
serious<00:04:40.090> player<00:04:40.449> and<00:04:41.229> cost<00:04:41.560> isn't<00:04:41.860> a

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
serious player and cost isn't a

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.430 
serious player and cost isn't a
significant<00:04:42.580> factor<00:04:42.940> for<00:04:43.120> you<00:04:43.270> then<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.350> know

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
significant factor for you then you know

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.020 
significant factor for you then you know
this<00:04:44.560> might<00:04:44.740> be<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.949> good<00:04:45.130> option<00:04:45.310> for<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:45.789> I'm

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
this might be a good option for you I'm

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.340 
this might be a good option for you I'm
not<00:04:46.090> going<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.509> judge<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.900> whether<00:04:47.110> or<00:04:47.229> not

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
not going to judge on whether or not

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.870 
not going to judge on whether or not
that<00:04:47.590> that's<00:04:47.830> that's<00:04:48.400> something<00:04:48.759> you<00:04:48.850> should

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
that that's that's something you should

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.300 
that that's that's something you should
do<00:04:49.210> or<00:04:49.330> shouldn't<00:04:49.360> do<00:04:49.860> that's<00:04:50.860> obviously<00:04:51.250> up

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
do or shouldn't do that's obviously up

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.050 
do or shouldn't do that's obviously up
to<00:04:51.520> each<00:04:51.729> player<00:04:52.090> on<00:04:52.570> their<00:04:53.080> own<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:54.520> anyway

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
crystal thing you can see that obviously

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.830 
crystal thing you can see that obviously
now<00:05:11.650> I'm<00:05:12.039> left<00:05:12.220> with<00:05:12.400> three<00:05:12.610> crystals<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.300> one

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
now I'm left with three crystals and one

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.450 
now I'm left with three crystals and one
thing<00:05:14.020> that<00:05:14.169> we<00:05:14.259> did<00:05:14.470> noticed<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.400> don't

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
thing that we did noticed and I don't

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.580 
thing that we did noticed and I don't
know<00:05:15.610> if<00:05:15.699> I<00:05:15.789> have<00:05:15.910> time<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.150> do<00:05:16.419> that<00:05:16.570> right<00:05:17.110> now

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
know if I have time to do that right now

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.629 
know if I have time to do that right now
I<00:05:17.620> haven't<00:05:17.860> played<00:05:17.979> these<00:05:18.190> levels<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:18.610> I

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
I haven't played these levels so I

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.659 
I haven't played these levels so I
apologize<00:05:19.150> if<00:05:19.300> I'm<00:05:19.419> not<00:05:19.539> very<00:05:19.750> good<00:05:20.050> I'm

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
apologize if I'm not very good I'm

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.700 
apologize if I'm not very good I'm
experimenting<00:05:21.669> with<00:05:21.910> these<00:05:22.060> yet<00:05:22.410> but<00:05:23.410> I<00:05:23.440> heard

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
experimenting with these yet but I heard

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.520 
experimenting with these yet but I heard
that<00:05:23.860> if<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.070> complete<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.699> level<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:26.410> I'm

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
that if you complete the level and I'm

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.990 
that if you complete the level and I'm
not<00:05:26.650> sure<00:05:26.830> if<00:05:26.919> it<00:05:27.009> includes<00:05:27.370> failing<00:05:27.880> the

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
not sure if it includes failing the

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.300 
not sure if it includes failing the
level<00:05:28.500> which<00:05:29.500> I'm<00:05:29.650> probably<00:05:29.860> going<00:05:30.070> to<00:05:30.130> do

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
level which I'm probably going to do

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.330 
level which I'm probably going to do
here<00:05:30.930> but<00:05:31.930> I<00:05:31.960> think<00:05:32.199> if<00:05:32.349> you<00:05:32.680> actually<00:05:32.860> compete

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
here but I think if you actually compete

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.300 
here but I think if you actually compete
the<00:05:33.490> level<00:05:33.820> complete<00:05:34.720> the<00:05:34.870> level<00:05:35.199> I've<00:05:35.560> been

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
the level complete the level I've been

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.339 
the level complete the level I've been
told<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:36.699> you're<00:05:36.940> not<00:05:37.150> you<00:05:37.870> don't<00:05:38.080> lose<00:05:38.320> a

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
told that you're not you don't lose a

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.790 
told that you're not you don't lose a
crystal<00:05:39.449> so<00:05:40.449> we'll<00:05:40.630> see<00:05:40.810> here<00:05:41.020> as<00:05:41.169> I<00:05:41.199> fail<00:05:41.560> this

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
crystal so we'll see here as I fail this

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.980 
crystal so we'll see here as I fail this
level<00:05:42.190> if<00:05:42.909> you<00:05:43.030> still<00:05:43.330> are<00:05:43.449> deducted<00:05:43.930> a

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
level if you still are deducted a

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.920 
level if you still are deducted a
crystal<00:05:44.409> or<00:05:44.500> not<00:05:45.000> let's<00:05:46.000> see<00:05:46.270> just<00:05:46.570> takes<00:05:46.810> a

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
crystal or not let's see just takes a

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.960 
crystal or not let's see just takes a
second<00:05:47.520> patience<00:05:48.520> patience<00:05:50.099> last<00:05:51.099> chance<00:05:51.639> no

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
second patience patience last chance no

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.550 
second patience patience last chance no
I<00:05:52.000> don't<00:05:52.330> want<00:05:52.479> to<00:05:52.570> use<00:05:52.750> that<00:05:52.780> that's<00:05:53.320> kind<00:05:53.530> of

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
I don't want to use that that's kind of

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.680 
I don't want to use that that's kind of
a<00:05:53.650> neat<00:05:53.800> little<00:05:53.830> feature<00:05:54.220> though<00:05:57.240> well<00:05:58.240> I<00:05:58.389> did

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
a neat little feature though well I did

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.200 
a neat little feature though well I did
lose<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:58.900> crystal<00:05:59.380> so<00:05:59.889> maybe<00:06:00.669> if<00:06:00.849> you<00:06:00.940> actually

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
lose a crystal so maybe if you actually

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.909 
lose a crystal so maybe if you actually
pass<00:06:01.479> a<00:06:01.509> level<00:06:02.020> you<00:06:02.050> don't<00:06:02.289> lose<00:06:02.409> a<00:06:02.440> crystal

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
pass a level you don't lose a crystal

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.040 
pass a level you don't lose a crystal
we'll<00:06:03.130> have<00:06:03.250> to<00:06:03.340> figure<00:06:03.520> that<00:06:03.639> out<00:06:03.820> but<00:06:04.330> anyway

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
we'll have to figure that out but anyway

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.140 
we'll have to figure that out but anyway
it's<00:06:05.470> one<00:06:05.590> of<00:06:05.680> those<00:06:05.770> things<00:06:06.039> that<00:06:06.190> typically

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
it's one of those things that typically

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.149 
it's one of those things that typically
you<00:06:07.270> are<00:06:07.419> deducted<00:06:07.930> a<00:06:07.990> crystal<00:06:08.440> and<00:06:08.620> we'll<00:06:09.009> see

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
you are deducted a crystal and we'll see

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.070 
you are deducted a crystal and we'll see
how<00:06:09.310> that<00:06:09.490> plays<00:06:09.699> out<00:06:10.000> as<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.630> beta<00:06:10.840> version

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
how that plays out as the beta version

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.219 
how that plays out as the beta version
is<00:06:11.470> is<00:06:12.190> improved<00:06:12.759> and<00:06:13.060> changed<00:06:13.090> I<00:06:13.570> scrolled
