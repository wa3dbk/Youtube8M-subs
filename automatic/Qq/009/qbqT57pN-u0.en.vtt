00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.850
 Y 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.760
 friends let's make the mickey short 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.910
 mouse 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.710
 we are going to occupy a red with white 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.000
 adhesive glue of madness or glue 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:34.330
 instant scissors 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.690
 and to measure we give the rule to 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.690
 to size 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:47.160
 long is going to measure 16 and high is going to 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.700
 measure 11 centimeters ok 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.530
 16 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.900
 eleven 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.750
 since we are going to cut 2 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.140
 two rectangles of that measure 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.340
 since we have them cut out 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.340
 let's mark 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.420
 three centimeters 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.040
 grabbing our pencil we mark 3 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.030
 centimeters and 3 centimeters and 4 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.290
 centimeters down 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.850
 out there in the mold I put the measurements 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.930
 are 4 centimeters and 3 centimeters I will 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.250
 to put 7 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.820
 43 and let's do side by side I do not know 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.820
 my children 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.840
 we are going to cut it 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.840
 the semicircle 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.939
 since we cut it 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.370
 it's going to stay like this and we're going to hit it 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.370
 with glue that hits from madness 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.970
 where we cut so it would be the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.970
 half Moon 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.799
 it has to be well stuck good 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.799
 pegadito 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.840
 that is not going to take off because it is 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.840
 the sun of a thousand 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.870
 because we have so stuck open it 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.780
 and we are going to paste what would be the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.459
 little legs check 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.459
 here are the little legs 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.700
 the other side 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.180
 as well 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.180
 yes 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.890
 there are the two legs we are going to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.180
 paste 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.180
 all over the little hill 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.290
 ah 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.290
 let it be small 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.120
 on the other side we are also going to do what 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.120
 same 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.780
 yes 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.570
 and it is also very good 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.900
 there we have stuck 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.900
 ah 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.709
 the little legs c 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.060
 leaving 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.780
 and you see the little legs stuck then 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.310
 that we stick the legs because we're going 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.190
 to put in our ball of unicel 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.709
 and we are going to stick it to mickey nothing more 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.810
 we 're going to hit it from here and it's going to 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.810
 get ready and we're going to put 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.680
 since it's stuck here 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.680
 we are going to hit to see 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.900
 since it was stuck 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.950
 and here we paste it and nothing else we are going to 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.610
 put the two white circles 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.040
 that the mickey mouse sun bears this 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.409
