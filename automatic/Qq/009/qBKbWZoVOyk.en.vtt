appear<00:02:06.490> better<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.759> guess<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.239> would<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.810> would

appear better I guess I would I would
100%<00:02:09.440> say<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.549> is<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> very<00:02:11.180> lightweight

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569
