importance<00:00:36.429> of<00:00:36.550> curved<00:00:36.760> fingers<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:39.460> is

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
importance of curved fingers I this is

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.340 
importance of curved fingers I this is
not<00:00:39.969> only<00:00:40.179> just<00:00:40.420> for<00:00:40.570> young<00:00:40.749> children<00:00:40.780> but

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
not only just for young children but

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.139 
not only just for young children but
just<00:00:41.530> kind<00:00:42.010> of<00:00:42.100> explain<00:00:42.519> why<00:00:42.699> curved<00:00:42.940> fingers

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
just kind of explain why curved fingers

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.910 
just kind of explain why curved fingers
are<00:00:43.449> important<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.929> lot<00:00:44.109> of<00:00:44.199> people<00:00:44.440> ask<00:00:44.739> me

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
are important a lot of people ask me

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.139 
are important a lot of people ask me
this<00:00:45.010> question<00:00:45.070> I<00:00:45.550> always<00:00:45.730> just<00:00:45.850> thought<00:00:46.059> it

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
this question I always just thought it

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.759 
this question I always just thought it
was<00:00:46.210> too<00:00:46.359> obvious<00:00:46.539> of<00:00:46.960> a<00:00:47.050> concept<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.620> really

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
was too obvious of a concept to really

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.739 
was too obvious of a concept to really
post<00:00:48.010> on<00:00:48.219> but<00:00:48.489> I<00:00:48.670> was<00:00:49.179> teaching<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.600> lesson

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
30s and and we were working on the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:06.180 
30s and and we were working on the
Chopin<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.769> tune<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:05.019> we<00:01:05.710> were<00:01:05.800> just<00:01:05.950> kind<00:01:06.159> of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
Chopin a tune and we were just kind of

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.910 
Chopin a tune and we were just kind of
talking<00:01:06.460> about<00:01:07.140> why<00:01:08.140> curved<00:01:08.380> fingers<00:01:08.619> are

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
talking about why curved fingers are

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.690 
talking about why curved fingers are
important<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.579> I<00:01:09.790> want<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.329> just<00:01:10.450> go<00:01:10.630> over<00:01:10.659> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
important and I want to just go over a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.350 
important and I want to just go over a
concept<00:01:12.700> with<00:01:13.570> you<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.729> it's<00:01:16.060> just<00:01:16.240> a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
concept with you about and it's just a

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.700 
concept with you about and it's just a
physical<00:01:16.840> concept<00:01:17.380> if<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:18.070> play<00:01:18.729> flat<00:01:19.710> from

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
physical concept if you play flat from

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.459 
physical concept if you play flat from
this<00:01:20.890> finger<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:21.610> you<00:01:21.939> you<00:01:22.479> play<00:01:22.810> from<00:01:23.200> this

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
this finger and you you play from this

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.440 
this finger and you you play from this
joint<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:26.229> takes<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.710> whole<00:01:27.039> lot<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.490> effort<00:01:27.729> in

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
joint it takes a whole lot of effort in

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.380 
joint it takes a whole lot of effort in
order<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.960> lift<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.799> then<00:01:30.670> come<00:01:30.969> back<00:01:31.000> up

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
order to lift that and then come back up

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.050 
order to lift that and then come back up
it's<00:01:31.630> just<00:01:31.719> like<00:01:31.899> if<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.380> were<00:01:32.409> holding<00:01:33.060> like

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
it's just like if you were holding like

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.090 
it's just like if you were holding like
a<00:01:34.240> heavy<00:01:34.570> like<00:01:34.930> if<00:01:35.140> you<00:01:35.259> had<00:01:35.409> a<00:01:35.439> bucket<00:01:35.950> of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
a heavy like if you had a bucket of

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.789 
a heavy like if you had a bucket of
water<00:01:36.759> at<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.329> end<00:01:37.450> of<00:01:37.719> a<00:01:37.810> pole<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.350> longer

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
water at the end of a pole the longer

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.149 
water at the end of a pole the longer
that<00:01:38.950> pole<00:01:39.310> got<00:01:39.609> the<00:01:40.240> heavier<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.590> bucket<00:01:42.070> is

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
that pole got the heavier that bucket is

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.429 
that pole got the heavier that bucket is
going<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.640> feel<00:01:42.909> like<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.450> further<00:01:43.899> away<00:01:44.079> but

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
going to feel like the further away but

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.230 
going to feel like the further away but
if<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.560> just<00:01:44.740> have<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.920> short<00:01:45.280> little<00:01:45.460> pole<00:01:45.909> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
if you just have a short little pole and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.760 
if you just have a short little pole and
you're<00:01:46.659> holding<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:47.020> bucket<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:47.439> just<00:01:47.619> right

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
you're holding a bucket it's just right

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.740 
you're holding a bucket it's just right
there<00:01:47.799> but<00:01:48.549> if<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.820> just<00:01:49.000> extend<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.509> pull

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
there but if you just extend that pull

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.779 
there but if you just extend that pull
out<00:01:49.929> that<00:01:50.350> leverage<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.159> going<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:51.520> make<00:01:51.670> it

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
out that leverage is going to make it

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.240 
out that leverage is going to make it
heavier<00:01:52.090> same<00:01:52.329> thing<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.869> guess<00:01:53.649> I<00:01:53.890> don't<00:01:54.159> know

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
heavier same thing I guess I don't know

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.130 
heavier same thing I guess I don't know
if<00:01:54.369> I'm<00:01:54.520> explaining<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.210> physical<00:01:55.359> concepts

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
if I'm explaining the physical concepts

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.580 
if I'm explaining the physical concepts
right<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:57.219> correctly<00:01:57.820> but<00:01:58.030> like<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.140> leverage

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
right or correctly but like the leverage

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.319 
right or correctly but like the leverage
of<00:01:59.710> this<00:01:59.950> seems<00:02:00.490> like<00:02:00.670> it's<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.909> lot<00:02:01.090> more

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
of this seems like it's a lot more

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.279 
of this seems like it's a lot more
effort<00:02:01.509> than<00:02:02.460> utilizing<00:02:03.460> 1<00:02:03.700> 2<00:02:03.999> &amp;<00:02:04.299> 3<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:05.109> first

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
effort than utilizing 1 2 &amp; 3 the first

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.620 
effort than utilizing 1 2 &amp; 3 the first
second<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:05.859> third<00:02:06.189> knuckle<00:02:06.640> there<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.390> just

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
second and third knuckle there and just

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.199 
second and third knuckle there and just
playing<00:02:08.619> here

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:22.929 

see<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.569> barely<00:02:11.900> have<00:02:12.079> to<00:02:12.230> move<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.980> that's<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
see I barely have to move so that's a

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.160 
see I barely have to move so that's a
big<00:02:23.599> thing<00:02:24.489> about<00:02:25.489> efficiency<00:02:26.269> now<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.510> also

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
big thing about efficiency now I also

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.199 
big thing about efficiency now I also
want<00:02:27.349> to<00:02:27.650> talk<00:02:27.980> about<00:02:28.040> instances<00:02:28.879> where<00:02:29.090> you

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
want to talk about instances where you

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.979 
want to talk about instances where you
should<00:02:29.510> should<00:02:30.019> not<00:02:30.170> use<00:02:30.439> curved<00:02:31.159> fingers<00:02:31.609> or

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
should should not use curved fingers or

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.479 
should should not use curved fingers or
not<00:02:32.989> necessarily<00:02:33.439> shouldn't<00:02:33.799> use<00:02:34.069> them<00:02:34.280> but

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
not necessarily shouldn't use them but

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.000 
not necessarily shouldn't use them but
you<00:02:34.639> could<00:02:34.819> also<00:02:35.030> use<00:02:35.389> flat<00:02:35.750> fingers<00:02:36.260> when<00:02:36.859> you

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
you could also use flat fingers when you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.550 
you could also use flat fingers when you
are<00:02:37.250> playing<00:02:37.609> something<00:02:38.030> very<00:02:38.480> beautiful<00:02:39.319> and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
are playing something very beautiful and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.789 
are playing something very beautiful and
very<00:02:39.819> lyrical<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.269> slow<00:02:41.719> you<00:02:42.349> don't<00:02:42.590> need

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
very lyrical and slow you don't need

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.300 
very lyrical and slow you don't need
that<00:02:43.209> incredible<00:02:44.209> speed<00:02:44.720> efficiency<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.889> so

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
that incredible speed efficiency and so

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.129 
that incredible speed efficiency and so
if<00:02:46.430> you're<00:02:46.790> playing<00:02:47.060> like<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.419> beginning<00:02:48.049> of

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
if you're playing like the beginning of

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:57.490 
if you're playing like the beginning of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
Mendelssohn it's serious variations you

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.709 
Mendelssohn it's serious variations you
know<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.700> can<00:02:58.879> play<00:02:59.000> very<00:02:59.299> flat

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
know that you can you can play very flat

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.420 
know that you can you can play very flat
fingers<00:03:00.019> if<00:03:00.349> you're<00:03:00.469> playing<00:03:00.769> something<00:03:01.159> by

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
fingers if you're playing something by

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:13.360 
fingers if you're playing something by
Schubert<00:03:02.409> Schubert<00:03:03.409> a<00:03:03.530> minor<00:03:11.019> or<00:03:12.370> as

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
something as beautiful as a Chopin

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.399 
something as beautiful as a Chopin
Nocturne<00:03:15.379> um<00:03:16.310> I<00:03:16.729> was<00:03:17.359> teaching<00:03:17.720> my<00:03:17.870> student

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
Nocturne um I was teaching my student

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:29.600 
Nocturne um I was teaching my student
this<00:03:19.250> one<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.639> other<00:03:19.669> day

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.520 

you<00:03:30.610> can<00:03:30.790> use<00:03:31.000> flattered<00:03:31.390> fingers<00:03:31.930> because<00:03:32.319> it

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
you can use flattered fingers because it

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.860 
you can use flattered fingers because it
helps<00:03:33.099> you<00:03:33.250> feel<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.760> connections<00:03:34.360> better<00:03:34.629> it

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
helps you feel the connections better it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
gives you more surface area on the keys

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.429 
gives you more surface area on the keys
so<00:03:37.090> those<00:03:37.269> are<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.510> times<00:03:37.780> where<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.140> can<00:03:38.290> use

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.399 
so those are the times where you can use
flat<00:03:38.769> fingers<00:03:38.980> for<00:03:39.640> young<00:03:39.819> children<00:03:40.409> until

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
you have a or even adults until you have

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.319 
you have a or even adults until you have
a<00:03:44.349> strong<00:03:44.769> good<00:03:45.099> technique<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.790> wouldn't<00:03:46.180> ever

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
a strong good technique I wouldn't ever

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.869 
a strong good technique I wouldn't ever
use<00:03:46.840> flat<00:03:47.140> fingers<00:03:47.560> because<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:48.159> need<00:03:48.700> to

use flat fingers because you need to

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.699 
use flat fingers because you need to
learn<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.329> play<00:03:49.480> soft<00:03:49.900> with<00:03:50.170> curved<00:03:50.440> fingers

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
learn to play soft with curved fingers

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.710 
learn to play soft with curved fingers
and<00:03:51.129> then<00:03:51.549> once<00:03:51.849> that's<00:03:52.120> good<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:52.569> you<00:03:52.690> can

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
and then once that's good then you can

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.899 
and then once that's good then you can
start<00:03:53.110> playing<00:03:53.319> flat<00:03:53.709> fingers<00:03:54.159> but<00:03:54.640> until

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
start playing flat fingers but until

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:55.619 
start playing flat fingers but until
you've<00:03:55.030> got<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.239> pretty<00:03:55.480> established

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
you've got a pretty established

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.099 
you've got a pretty established
technique<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.590> would<00:03:56.829> just<00:03:57.069> do<00:03:57.340> curved<00:03:57.730> fingers

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
technique I would just do curved fingers

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.319 
technique I would just do curved fingers
and<00:03:59.109> then<00:03:59.950> later<00:04:00.220> down<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.489> road<00:04:00.640> if<00:04:01.180> you're

the more spread-out surface area on the

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.149 
the more spread-out surface area on the
keys<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.109> going<00:04:11.349> to<00:04:11.440> help<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.799> have<00:04:11.950> more

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
nice and curved that's a great way to

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.379 
nice and curved that's a great way to
push<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.710> weight<00:05:05.949> from<00:05:06.699> the<00:05:06.849> arm<00:05:07.060> down

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
push the weight from the arm down

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.659 
push the weight from the arm down
through<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.780> wrist<00:05:07.990> into<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.530> hand<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.979> holds

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
through the wrist into the hand it holds

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.310 
through the wrist into the hand it holds
up<00:05:09.820> but<00:05:10.210> if<00:05:10.330> you<00:05:10.419> want<00:05:10.449> a<00:05:10.690> more<00:05:10.840> lyrical

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
up but if you want a more lyrical

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.620 
up but if you want a more lyrical
approach<00:05:11.590> you<00:05:11.770> can<00:05:12.039> do<00:05:12.310> flat<00:05:12.580> fingers<00:05:13.030> so<00:05:13.599> I

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
approach you can do flat fingers so I

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.469 
approach you can do flat fingers so I
know<00:05:13.900> this<00:05:14.169> is<00:05:14.260> kind<00:05:14.440> of<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.880> strange<00:05:15.880> concept

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
know this is kind of a strange concept

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.149 
know this is kind of a strange concept
but<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:16.780> think<00:05:17.169> enough<00:05:17.409> people<00:05:17.620> have<00:05:17.860> asked

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159
