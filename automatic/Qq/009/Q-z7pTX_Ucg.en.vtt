then we didn't see if anybody else is

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.850 
then we didn't see if anybody else is
going<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.900> see<00:03:10.020> they<00:03:10.170> know<00:03:10.320> when<00:03:10.500> they<00:03:10.560> put<00:03:10.770> it

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
going to see they know when they put it

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.470 
going to see they know when they put it
out<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.280> black<00:03:11.520> audiences<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.090> going<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.330> run

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
out the black audiences is going to run

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.020 
out the black audiences is going to run
to<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.320> does<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.680> have<00:03:13.890> legs<00:03:14.190> will<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.850> have
