00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.859
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:07.680
 direct and we are in a new news 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.400
 of the moon in our science channel 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.450
 technology and mystery russia will begin to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 colonize the moon from the year 2030 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.990
 and this would not be news but what 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
 session on the screen is a photomontage 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 but it can be reality inside very 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.740
 little and that is that you want to create a polygon and 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 basis for resource extraction 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.039
 minerals all this is in the recent 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.109
 project of the lunar program of russia and 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.960
 for me it worries me because what 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:43.440
 they want to do there on the moon is for 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.809
 good a disaster attention the authors 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.570
 of this study propose the following 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.199
 phases of lunar colonization before 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.909
 year 2040 the first stage planned for 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.729
 the years 2016 2025 supposes the sending of 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.859
 a series of robotic missions to 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:04.620
 our satellite and the purpose of these 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.270
 missions would be to study the composition and 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.750
 the characteristics of the land and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.240
 choose 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.700
 place for the polygon and the base that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 they want to build the second stage 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.370
 planned for the years 2025 and 2030 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 would contain the sending of missions 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:24.300
 manned to the lunar orbit follow a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.920
 and all of these for the purposes that 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.140
 they are already developing a rocket 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 super heavy propeller and a ship 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.190
 manned and the third stage would be the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.900
 2030 and 2040 because it would be for 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.210
 place to the expeditions to the place 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.259
 chosen by the robotic missions and the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.869
 construction of the first 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.840
 infrastructures using materials 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.030
 polka dots of the satellite itself is proposed 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.649
 start building an observatory and 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 devices for the observation of 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.090
 earth in all this comes to us a 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.850
 ask the head who puts the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.950
 money the realization costs of each 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.500
 stage are not calculated accurately 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.869
 especially for the most distant stages 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.330
 over time however the authors of the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.039
 concept of the program whose points will be 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.289
 studied by scientists and others 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.600
 experts highlight the importance of 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.790
 attract private investments 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.580
 it is unlikely that the colonization of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.440
 planet of planets in the future be a 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.620
 subject financed exclusively by the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.920
 Russian government say colonization 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.470
 of planets would therefore be the prerogative of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.030
 private companies it is difficult to imagine a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.550
 government that is willing to spend 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.070
 billions of dollars to build bases 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.500
 moles despite having other problems 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.490
 to be solved not for example 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.820
 medicine education armies 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.190
 no government in its right mind nor 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.580
 this is not my country because I would have so much 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.330
 money to do all this just not but 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.450
 Well, you think this project is real 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.510
 it can be done can not be done well 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.280
 time will tell you we already know ya know 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.860
 as always the last reporting these 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.870
 are the plans of russia and here I am 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.270
 to tell you what you already know like and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.270
 favorites See you at the next ciao
