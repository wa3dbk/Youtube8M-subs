00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.090
 how to do it we will have to cut the eggplant 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.539
 so there was the little head there 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.570
 we peel and four sides and we will leave each other 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.549
 a little bit of black that will help not to do yes 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.770
 let the eggplant flake now 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.480
 we will cut into fairly thin slices 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.460
 where Italy 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.400
 the evangelist to make a proceeding 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.770
 that you will have to do first that is you can 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.360
 make eggplant that Sunday the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.830
 Saturday there is really cut le 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.890
 eggplant take the colander 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.670
 put on a container that mentions 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.270
 write the water set to romanticize count 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.730
 that you make a bar the eggplant layer 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.430
 here you put them on a 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.320
 container that you will go to add a 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.030
 little bit of coarse salt 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.390
 in this way more pinch of salt 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.610
 big that touches all the aubergines e 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.550
 we'll put a saucer on top to do 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.640
 pressure or so many villains or a pergola 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.940
 flat that the eggplants feel the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.710
 Salt pressure throws everything out 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.480
 the bitterness of the eggplant all the liquid 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.550
 that when we 're not going to fry it will 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.280
 a mess of the other the day after the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.460
 scarves and his nets with strong with 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.100
 these b and the alloy in the end we put to 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.560
 heat the oil I recommend several 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.720
 had adopted that eggplant feels 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.230
 immediately I believe that we are there 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.270
 almost 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.070
 against the block my way but the 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.380
 my way 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.650
 we're almost there and that's all she does 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.200
 bubbles around the mixed linen of 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.920
 wood wanted to start putting 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.800
 eggplant 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.380
 as you see click 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.790
 milano well the boiling I recommend scale 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.850
 plead for himself but just so bad 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.760
 otherwise they overlap too much then not 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.730
 can create with about three minutes that 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.830
 suffered the flight part you will go to turn 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.440
 look also at the minutes are also the 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.810
 coloring is taking , we will turn them 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.290
 all on the right side 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.870
 if they do not burn they take a lot 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.070
 cute eating must be written 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.080
 they must be burned when the old woman has taken 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.830
 this color on the brown is 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.110
 ready to be the times we are like this 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.410
 the ruin foam is born 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.630
 drain everything really well 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.490
 back absorbent paper does a little more 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.380
 cronin is gone but leave there is some 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.670
 less so that problems because it was not 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.240
 be a little guarded in and so for all 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.330
 the others 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.490
 if I see the last and eggplant they are 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.520
 applying the cooking I put out and fire e 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.330
 that if it doesn't want burns they seem to be 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:48.060
 in Milan the same joke was we will go to 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.910
 put in a key bowl 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.420
 We overthrow directly inside both 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.150
 we will look for the most equal stars 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.040
 possible next move will be 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.320
 save the aubergines a little bit that 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.440
 they give a little picciotto flavor of the 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.320
 more to stay and do ours under the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.180
 pesto both vinegar fought node garlic and 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.610
 chilli pepper press cooing at 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.140
 nor from the details 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.270
 detect the soul I recommend for it 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.910
 Uncle more if you haven't yet figured out how 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.489
 to say at first steps also acacia bully a 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.430
 less 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.669
 sure that if you have always done a 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.130
 beaten that is not really coarse 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.770
 a rough beat I want to see 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.400
 that you feel boast you eat you do it for 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.310
 keep going so much in itself 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.000
 not even with the musi pine that there is a problem 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.680
 take a small saucepan puts us 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.229
 own a tablespoon of oil not of 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.000
 more because the oil will release it so much 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.870
 hands those fried put to 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.210
 warm it up when it's hot 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.259
 pupil three principles that make good at 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.080
 heart and not just our goal 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:05.280
 said coarsely chopped do 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.550
 sautÃ© it lightly 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.530
 as you can see frigia mourinho lake ago 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.110
 almost changed color before it burns 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.349
 that bitter taste away at the least 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.479
 old we're going to lower slightly 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:22.360
 if not now when we put that is the 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.370
 a hundred that it becomes that we take when 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.139
 you ask him by choice he said it not 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.090
 raised do take lightly 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:32.139
 color that the vinegar of values 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.080
 slightly to blend with the flavor of 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.539
 of the balloon hut he would wait for 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.469
 make our first bubbles 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:44.169
 vinegar let's say the actual text 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:48.400
 this shoes c as they said 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:50.319
 Sephardic Jews escape from Spain 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.090
 because only as I said before 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.569
 I had to stop everything under the text 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.150
 but that goes down 4 on my boat 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:01.120
 manzarek and zucchini and understands though 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.580
 he had been seeing Spanish for years 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.270
 Greek who brought Jews who 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.009
 they came here to Livorno 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.099
 let us inculcate their traditions 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.740
 culinary we have taken all the more 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.810
 good and not just after I said it from 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.180
 compal the minutes that the vinegar boils 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.120
 all this to trips we will go to 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.599
 take our on bettino of the 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.760
 we will think over our aubergines 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:33.190
 these will now have a minimum minimum 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.699
 wait two or three hours to good 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:39.969
 saih would be the next day though too 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:41.740
 frankly three hours the feeling hand 15 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.500
 you can which point you can use it as 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.089
 side dish as an appetizer you can do 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.979
 for mannini I said that 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:50.469
 ham but you know that one day that 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:51.909
 teach it does that ox want it 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:53.680
 so leave outdoors without 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:57.219
 personality knows then you speak of course 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.320
 when a tissue is frozen that 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:02.370
 put in the fridge they go on for one 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.409
 week and files that you know from do 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.210
 fog clamps with this recipe from the 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:11.110
 particular intoxicating taste 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.110
 I'll see you
