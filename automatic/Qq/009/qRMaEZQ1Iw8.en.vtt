Technica<00:01:49.290> even<00:01:49.979> has<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> method<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.579> going

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
Technica even has a method for going

Technica even has a method for going
into<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> guts<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> machine<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.409> fixing

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
into the guts of the machine and fixing

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.219 
into the guts of the machine and fixing
it<00:01:52.890> yourself<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:53.909> time<00:01:54.119> consuming

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
it yourself but it's time consuming

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.230 
it yourself but it's time consuming
really<00:01:55.229> complicated<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.040> warranty<00:01:56.670> voiding

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
really complicated and warranty voiding

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.999 
really complicated and warranty voiding
at<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.780> point<00:01:58.079> probably<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.680> better<00:01:58.829> off

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
at that point probably just better off

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.950 
at that point probably just better off
sending<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> pros<00:01:59.820> now<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> want

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
sending it to the pros now if you want

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.359 
sending it to the pros now if you want
to<00:02:01.049> prevent<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.469> red<00:02:01.680> ring<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> death<00:02:02.040> from
