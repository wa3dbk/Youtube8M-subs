00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.039
 good evening good morning or good 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.650
 noon depending on when you this mw2 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.210
 called for gates shot in this 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.510
 video I will show you how you the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.999
 aka from call of duty 4 also in mw2 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.740
 calls cock can get under my 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.810
 next video in which I asked 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.240
 what do you want to see brought a great 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.699
 discussion from someone had claimed it 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.380
 is the ak from call of duty 4 in mw2 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.820
 some could not do that 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.280
 I think I used to 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.829
 considering making video because it 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.079
 this mod already about about one 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.640
 I give half a year and I believe 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.309
 thought that most know that anyway 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.899
 Alright and ok as you are under 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.399
 wrote my video where I am 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.530
 I asked what should I do 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.690
 make your way over these fields call of 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.070
 I've been doing duty 4 in mw2 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.750
 I am also quite happy with it 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.460
 then get video ideas from you then know 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.489
 I show you what you want to see 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.989
 today as you get in mw2 who 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.840
 Not sure yet 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.970
 if he is the call of duty 4 hk in mw2 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.189
 really wants to have the time can 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.380
 drop in on the 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.180
 I also have the link to the channel 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.159
 video packed in the description there 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.350
 is there a gameplay with this weapon in 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.240
 mw2 and there you can see if yes 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.579
 the weapon is something through or not 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.979
 First of all there is a lot to consider 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:28.720
 while there is the ak comes out 4 in 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.579
 mw2 as a normal weapon with no attachments 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.280
 extended mix with full coat bullet 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.780
 and with silence all links to it then 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.969
 again in the description because 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.560
 each one has its own weapon each one has 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.960
 a separate file for example the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.060
 normal ak has a file the ak with 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.399
 silence has its own file a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.369
 silence must not be 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.990
 so in game you will not 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.030
 the lines that the front of it 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.329
 but screwed is the weapon has 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.770
 Nevertheless, the effect of silence is good 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.960
 I said there is something to note 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 That's when you create the class you 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.030
 he must be in front of the goal then a class 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.210
 create with an ak smb2 course 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.580
 and there but no camouflage on it 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.220
 that it's very important that you do not have any there 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.530
 division and then depending on that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.050
 which essay had you if the ak 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.030
 normal then plays us 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.210
 also do not tower on it if you the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.070
 ak with extended magazine then plays 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.560
 even the extended magazine on it 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.480
 but do not camouflage if you ak 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.680
 playful with the lines or full 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.140
 then coat fully or coat 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.090
 finance on it but no camouflage 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.670
 I have now demanded you have the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.470
 class without everything then open 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.160
 First of all we have our in front of the tower 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.320
 and folder 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.420
 that is the mw2 folder in which you too 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.450
 Newtown has just installed the blue one 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.720
 and especially there is one 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.460
 folder m 2 demo in some it could 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.920
 be that at percent local appdata 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.230
 percent is then you have to look 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.600
 but as said that it is the folder where 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.730
 you also have the blue installed 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.960
 if you have the link 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.140
 this is normal in the video 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.970
 see description in the folder m 2 demo 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.680
 By the way, we have some files here 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.970
 has blue and then I take here 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.000
 just copy this zwd the here 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.210
 in and now i have if i am in game 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.489
 take and ak without upward without 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.160
 camouflage I have the call of duty 4 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.500
 sound from the ak and of course the 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.540
 call of duty 4 look from the ak like that 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.790
 as it is in the gameplay of old little 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.950
 German looks like if I do 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.080
 say nee i want the ak 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.080
 dear employees magazine then has to 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.209
 you first change your grade and the ak 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.090
 with extended magazine but take without 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:48.310
 camouflage nothing else delete troops all 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.560
 delete this zaw de and take the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.360
 z-max ewd and copied a whole here 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.340
 important is that you have to 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.040
 your kaka also the extended ones 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.470
 magazine on it if you only 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.600
 have this normal akw de in it and then 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.870
 advanced magazine on it does then 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.090
 Will not you call out the ak from call of duty 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.920
 4 have a few small bugs this one has 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.380
 weapon also he unfortunately there is one 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.540
 sound like I've seen my somewhere too 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.800
 have that there is a fix but me 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.690
 just do not think so 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.580
 I only imagined if 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.980
 someone fix for the sound back end 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.210
 then you can like to me as the pn 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.200
 send or just in the comments 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.810
 write 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.970
 In addition, there is sometimes a battering ram 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.400
 then there is very fat on the 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.169
 screen noah mo but you have 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.520
 the normal ammo and shoot 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.860
 only that the half field on the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.050
 screen is a bit annoying the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.570
 you can not really fix it but on 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.000
 server the names before the name asterisk 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.979
 This bug should occur more often 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.350
 than on normal servers then stop 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.120
 As a little tip, I hope I have 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.550
 do not forget anything and have this video 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.590
 like if so then subscribe me 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.150
