00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.830
 very good to all x 89 and finally if 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.140
 comes nba 2k 15 to my channel finally since 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.789
 it was time but different ways that I have 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.040
 had that have caused a delay to be 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.250
 little more than getting to the east channel 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.700
 great game you already know I start going to 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.410
 have this 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:32.190
 in 2015 on the 7th of this month of October 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.100
 but for that reason I do not know what 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.410
 Of course I bought the game in the USA 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 digital version then it is assumed that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.670
 the same day 7 at 6 in the morning here 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.440
 in Spain I could play the game already but 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.090
 for errors that motivated that I do not know 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.360
 there are people who can play and another 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.360
 people who do not in my case 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.710
 so I think we have to delete from 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.900
 new the game 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.580
 I mean to delete it and download it again with 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.580
 what that entails I realize that 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.080
 I have a pretty poor connection 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.440
 because fiber optic does not reach here 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.479
 this area to accompany that I have 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.370
 so then again the torture 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.290
 I have to leave even with the night of 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.930
 the console lots of hours working 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.820
 so that they are based that almost 50 gigas that 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.229
 occupies the game so for that reason 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.540
 Well, it was a little more 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.580
 arrival of the game what I'm seeing is 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.110
 so to speak the demo that worked with 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.610
 while unloading the rest of the 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.560
 content 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.510
 and well let's highlight a little bit by 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.320
 over but the sensations are 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.050
 very good defense I liked it very much 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.500
 how it is to have 215 reminds me a lot 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.979
 nba 2k 8 that the truth is that at the level of 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.140
 tension was very, very good 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.510
 by the movement of feet moments 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.180
 side and more else you notice that when 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.680
 you press a lot of rival fails something that does not 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.380
 We spent a lot of pressure that put 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.619
 the hand to the face and even put it 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.110
 this was a bit unreal the issue of 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.410
 plays of blackboard because it 's very good 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.110
 recreated, it's nice to play with them in 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.479
 many variety also the machine in the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.450
 CPU or act very well and the plays 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.850
 continue if they do not come out then other 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.860
 possibilities that I liked very much 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.190
 in that sense what we've been 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.510
 watching and this well we will give on screen 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.580
 it's like a play that good on 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.830
 the horn 33 play is 27 and if you put on 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.500
 be defending with yes many things 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.140
 we can see the physical engine of 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.209
 contact on the subject of contracts is 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.239
 very well recreated I really like the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.310
 good subject of the visual effects of 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.160
 the logos of the teams both below 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.019
 as you can see the right under both 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.660
 like when there are reps I liked it 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.330
 very much very stylish and it is fine to see 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.160
 how it defends the cpu de l'aljub very well 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.250
 I like very much 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.920
 there we go to basket and it shows 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.620
 very much the 5000 new animations 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.500
 that supposedly 2 cÃ¡diz is that there are in 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:09.260
 this new 15 that could taste for 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.440
 internet so it seems that there 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.240
 many, many animations that are 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.580
 thank you because it makes the game be 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.840
 much more natural look a lot more 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.780
 fluent so nothing kids how 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.060
 said that I apologize for the inconvenience between 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.410
 quotes because good I have in mind 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.060
 that the game really in Spain is the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.560
 day 10 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.239
 what is trying is an exception 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.520
 of doing to get a game before 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.160
 time but it has not gone very well for me 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.290
 let's say the play so good 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.420
 I will try to have for tomorrow 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.180
 content already of my career thus I get 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.330
 as soon as you download the game and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.170
 I have to even have connection so 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.810
 bad i have 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.760
 good to take the playstation to the house 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.410
 of my girlfriend who has a fiber connection 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.180
 optics so that for a few 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.620
 hours will download a lot of content from 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.750
 I play a lot faster than in my 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.300
 house because it is that if not today it is going to have 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.150
 to be at least three days even 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.520
 wait for the 10th day of departure 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.130
 in Spain to be able to try the game and 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.519
 that the connection is so bad 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.459
 that I have so if it felt like 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.770
 I appreciate very much that you could 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.169
 download much of the game there and the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:31.229
 rest of what remains that practically 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.370
 I have already 32 gigs of 47 and 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.130
 I have in mind that this video is 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.680

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.280
 Twenty of the night because having to 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.870
 have console all night downloading 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.710

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.719
 on 9 th Thursday then you have a video because 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.259
 that will be a very good sign of my career 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:10.020
 he imagined that you will have the images of 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.210
 my face or something similar because he has seen 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.060
 who is very afraid 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.130
 there are a lot of good many opinions we see 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.410
 Controversy with the subject of scanning 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.120
 facial there are many people who do well 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.340
 people that good that after a lot 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.160
 of occasions in many attempts 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.229
 they come from a more similar and good face 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.009
 not yet seen many photos online 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:35.280
 of people who have managed to do anything to me 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:39.599
 similar to a person because when 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.800

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.990
 I do not eat much the second of all 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.380
 ways all the attempts that do what 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.349
 you'll see on the fly so they can 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.320
