was really booming in the 2006-2007
period<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.970> 2011<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.780> very<00:01:45.960> exciting

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
period I think 2011 was very exciting

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.639 
period I think 2011 was very exciting
because<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.020> agriculture<00:01:49.020> nutrition<00:01:49.170> and
