00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
more creatures back out there my venture

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.680 
more creatures back out there my venture
has<00:05:33.500> come<00:05:33.650> back<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.010> match<00:05:34.340> them<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:35.420> so

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
has come back and match them and so

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.780 
has come back and match them and so
definitely<00:05:36.080> there<00:05:36.290> was<00:05:36.350> a<00:05:36.440> control<00:05:36.740> x<00:05:36.920> ib<00:05:37.130> I've

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
definitely there was a control x ib I've

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.010 
definitely there was a control x ib I've
been<00:05:37.940> all<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.300> control<00:05:38.540> that's<00:05:38.660> exciting<00:05:38.930> and

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
been all the control that's exciting and

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.170 
been all the control that's exciting and
so<00:05:39.200> then<00:05:40.100> would<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:40.490> say<00:05:40.670> the<00:05:40.790> aggro<00:05:41.030> decks

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
so then would you say the aggro decks

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.570 
so then would you say the aggro decks
are<00:05:41.330> bad<00:05:41.450> matchups<00:05:41.900> or<00:05:42.050> red<00:05:43.040> red<00:05:43.280> is<00:05:43.310> a<00:05:43.430> pretty

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
are bad matchups or red red is a pretty

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.370 
are bad matchups or red red is a pretty
weak<00:05:43.730> matchup<00:05:44.060> that's<00:05:44.900> where<00:05:44.990> we<00:05:45.080> have<00:05:45.200> core

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.960 
to me from fairly strange sometimes you
need<00:05:57.470> to<00:05:57.530> match<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.920> fence<00:05:58.100> runs<00:05:58.340> but<00:05:58.760> a<00:05:58.820> lot

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
need to match the fence runs but a lot

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.950 
need to match the fence runs but a lot
of<00:05:59.000> times<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.300> ground<00:05:59.510> just<00:05:59.630> get<00:05:59.780> sort<00:05:59.930> of

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
of times the ground just get sort of

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.960 
of times the ground just get sort of
bumped<00:06:00.260> up<00:06:00.380> with<00:06:00.590> prodding<00:06:01.160> for<00:06:01.280> next<00:06:01.520> so

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
bumped up with prodding for next so

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.490 
bumped up with prodding for next so
being<00:06:02.330> able<00:06:02.420> to<00:06:02.540> sort<00:06:02.690> of<00:06:02.720> stay<00:06:02.930> alive<00:06:03.200> with

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
being able to sort of stay alive with

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.940 
being able to sort of stay alive with
your<00:06:03.680> with<00:06:03.860> your<00:06:03.890> of<00:06:04.130> your<00:06:04.250> walls<00:06:04.460> pretty<00:06:04.790> good

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
your with your of your walls pretty good

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.070 
your with your of your walls pretty good
but<00:06:06.950> i<00:06:06.980> think<00:06:07.460> that<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:07.790> lego<00:06:08.600> say<00:06:08.780> before

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
but i think that the lego say before

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.840 
but i think that the lego say before
then<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.410> spark<00:06:09.650> mage<00:06:09.830> is<00:06:10.010> pretty<00:06:10.190> pretty

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
then the spark mage is pretty pretty

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.490 
then the spark mage is pretty pretty
serious<00:06:11.210> issue<00:06:11.390> if<00:06:11.600> they<00:06:11.840> have<00:06:11.960> a<00:06:11.990> caller<00:06:12.260> and

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
serious issue if they have a caller and

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.230 
serious issue if they have a caller and
if<00:06:12.620> that<00:06:12.740> early<00:06:13.220> it's<00:06:13.700> a<00:06:13.760> pretty<00:06:13.910> big<00:06:14.060> deal<00:06:14.120> to

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
if that early it's a pretty big deal to

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.240 
if that early it's a pretty big deal to
the<00:06:14.450> computer<00:06:14.750> of<00:06:14.840> manic<00:06:15.050> rich<00:06:15.170> is<00:06:15.260> as<00:06:15.350> well<00:06:15.530> so

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
the computer of manic rich is as well so

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.370 
the computer of manic rich is as well so
if<00:06:16.340> you<00:06:16.430> want<00:06:16.580> to<00:06:16.610> be<00:06:16.730> control<00:06:17.240> and<00:06:17.570> some<00:06:18.320> of

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
if you want to be control and some of

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.070 
if you want to be control and some of
the<00:06:18.440> bigger<00:06:18.620> threat<00:06:19.280> decks<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:20.630> have<00:06:20.840> a<00:06:20.870> weak

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
the bigger threat decks and have a weak

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.140 
the bigger threat decks and have a weak
matchup<00:06:21.380> against<00:06:21.590> red<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.130> a<00:06:22.370> 50-50<00:06:22.880> matchup

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
matchup against red and a 50-50 matchup

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.580 
matchup against red and a 50-50 matchup
against<00:06:23.330> John<00:06:23.600> you<00:06:23.720> say<00:06:23.990> this<00:06:24.170> is<00:06:24.350> the<00:06:24.380> deck

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
against John you say this is the deck

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.560

for<00:06:24.770> you<00:06:24.860> well<00:06:25.460> I<00:06:25.520> think<00:06:25.580> in<00:06:25.850> a<00:06:25.940> sec<00:06:26.120> if<00:06:26.450> it

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
for you well I think in a sec if it

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.090 
for you well I think in a sec if it
wants<00:06:26.930> to<00:06:26.960> play<00:06:27.110> this<00:06:27.230> deck<00:06:27.440> they<00:06:27.710> really<00:06:28.010> need

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
wants to play this deck they really need

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.130 
wants to play this deck they really need
to<00:06:28.160> play<00:06:28.340> it<00:06:28.460> shrine<00:06:29.090> out<00:06:29.240> along<00:06:29.510> because<00:06:29.840> it's

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
to play it shrine out along because it's

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.040 
to play it shrine out along because it's
a<00:06:30.410> very<00:06:30.980> difficult

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
a very difficult
