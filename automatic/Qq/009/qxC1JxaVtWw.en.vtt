00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.349
 o david's restaurant breaks our 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.540
 world are in the street of the priest of 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.770
 Saint-Etienne who is this little thing that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.710
 leads us to the Esquermoise street 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.880
 and we get there we must know that there is 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.090
 a theme that changes 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 we'll see the map this month it's on 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.070
 the theme of the Indian summer 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.410
 so apparently every month we discover 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.610
 a new seasonal color map and 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.790
 to the flavors of a visit a lot of countries 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.629
 forever a two-country theme on the month 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.539
 but it's a cuisine of inspiration 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.620
 cultural and exotic these are my exotic 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.390
 in the true sense of the word 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.860
 there is something for everyone you see 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.860
 sweet salty there is more traditional 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.800
 so we are going to make today a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.020
 clafoutis camembert with raw milk and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.980
 trumpets of death so we learn a 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.580
 raw milk camembert 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.500
 6th half liter of liquid cream danone 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.900
 grated nutmeg and trumpets from the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.820
 hand for 4 people will require 120 g 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.950
 so put back a little oil 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.330
 olive and you can quickly 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.820
 we cheat the lady in two minutes to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 worth 30 seconds luckily I'm going 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.549
 just salt and pepper a little bit 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.430
 so we will put some little trunks 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.710
 death in the bottom of the ramekin on 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.750
 take the lambert case we will scratch 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.340
 especially take a raw milk camembert 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.710
 in fact I will camembert 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.470
 melt much more easily and so 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.799
 we will use a quarter of pie chart 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.600
 person 3 cut in thin slices is 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.729
 she's taking you half of a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 camembert slice the little taste of 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.560
 trumpets 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.570
 with the camembert yes it gets married very 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.180
 well actually for with the pie chart it 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.640
 must a mushroom go over paki 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.689
 which goes over but if we had put 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.979
 good oyster mushrooms is more interesting 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:09.649
 so here I'm just going to do my job 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:16.400
 and clafoutis so we add the cream 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:23.900
 with salt waters pepper and walnuts 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:25.610
 nutmeg not hesitate to taste your 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.100
 device with the flotilla to see if 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:40.700
 brain of group 1 we will give small 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:43.340
 little nutmeg we will come to his 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.459
 watches devices to cover 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.989
 we see put in the oven at 180 Â° 5 to 10 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.350
 minutes after that depends on there are 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.400
 people who will love clafoutis 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.350
 more liquid inside 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.390
 he who will prefer when it's good 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.030
 a price so that's really a 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.109
 issue also ends meet me at last 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.580
 I say that cooking is done 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.240
 pleasure too 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:21.410
 we will put balsamic vinegar 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:28.520
 we made reduce it is very 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:30.950
 simple but it's bringing back you 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.350
 presented a clafoutis of camembert at 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.820
 raw milk and trumpets of death so 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.200
 with this entry we can 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:43.150
 advise a touraine or a beaujolais 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.150
