so I've already started a scan with the
software<00:01:43.549> just<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.969> just<00:01:44.149> want<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.389> want<00:01:44.780> you

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
software just I just want to want you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.389 
software just I just want to want you
guys<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.200> see<00:01:45.380> what<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.679> does<00:01:45.829> when<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.130> when<00:01:46.369> it

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
guys to see what it does when it when it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.699 
guys to see what it does when it when it
runs<00:01:46.609> the<00:01:46.789> scan<00:01:48.609> okay<00:01:49.609> the<00:01:49.670> scan<00:01:49.939> took<00:01:50.179> about

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
runs the scan okay the scan took about

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.730 
runs the scan okay the scan took about
probably<00:01:51.709> two<00:01:51.859> or<00:01:51.889> three<00:01:52.039> minutes<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:53.319> it<00:01:54.319> ran

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
probably two or three minutes and it ran

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.859 
probably two or three minutes and it ran
into<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.639> bunch<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.389> different<00:01:56.630> types<00:01:56.780> of

the final thing that it did a scan for
with<00:02:52.520> junk<00:02:52.790> files<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.870> can<00:02:53.990> see<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.260> in

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
with junk files and you can see it's in

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.800 
with junk files and you can see it's in
my<00:02:54.590> case<00:02:54.830> it's<00:02:55.040> 1.39<00:02:55.700> gigabyte<00:02:56.210> which<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.570> a

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
my case it's 1.39 gigabyte which is a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.380 
my case it's 1.39 gigabyte which is a
lot<00:02:59.260> 2937<00:03:00.260> files<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.950> shown<00:03:01.190> over<00:03:01.400> here<00:03:01.520> so

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
lot 2937 files that shown over here so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.240 
lot 2937 files that shown over here so
but<00:03:02.990> that's<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.350> kind<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.590> stuff<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.860> will

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
but that's the kind of stuff that will

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.340 
but that's the kind of stuff that will
will<00:03:04.790> clog<00:03:05.060> up<00:03:05.270> your<00:03:05.300> computer<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.960> cause<00:03:06.170> it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
will clog up your computer and cause it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.490 
will clog up your computer and cause it
to<00:03:06.380> run<00:03:06.590> slow<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.960> once<00:03:08.960> it<00:03:09.080> completes<00:03:09.200> the
