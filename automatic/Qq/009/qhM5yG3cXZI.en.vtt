00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 released in 2005 here today is the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.810
 porsche cayman s in his third 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.390
 generation 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.460
 this two- seater sports coupe has been redesigned 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.340
 from top to bottom to believe that sir 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.039
 more still raged lower longer 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.840
 lighter faster more efficient and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.070
 more powerful than ever I admit 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 that today I am easy prey 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.680
 for this reptile that is next to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.260
 me 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.329
 indeed here is the cayman not to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 to confuse with his big sister the 911 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 so we can differentiate them 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.059
 easily thanks to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 optics that are totally different 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.379
 on the cayman it is still a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.690
 So porsche pure pleasure 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.249
 and not to spoil my pleasure 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.960
 informs you that we are on 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:59.789
 the albi circuit as the track 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.149
 today is rather graffiti slightly 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.280
 wet 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.129
 it is a propulsion with a 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.260
 point against four to and 325 horses 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 there will be sport frankly I 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.060
 think we're going to feast on really need 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 change of clothes it's gone before 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 dominated by curvaceous wings 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.520
 typically porsche incorporates new 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.380
 lighthouses in tribute to the legacy 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.500
 victorious brand in the years 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.899
 60 and 70 the shield with large 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 Dynamic air intakes gives even more 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.590
 of power and biting at this 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 new generation on the cayman s 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 the black pint of his earthen entrances 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.130
 slice on the front skirt color 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 bodywork thus asserting the character 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.679
 sporting model in combination with the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 wide track the roof line sliced ​​its 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.060
 wires backwards the power of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.799
 wings is underlined by the wheels in 20 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.780
 inches at the back the flap 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.390
 telescopic deploys automatically 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.119
 at 120 km / hour thanks to the turn signals 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.829
 very fine who extends his line when 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.760
 the fin is folded this blade 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.340
 aerodynamic seems 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.510
 melt in the LED taillights 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.910
 of course the interior architect has 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.220
 been completely redesigned it offers a 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.230
 better panoramic view one more 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.390
 great freedom of movement and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.190
 series seats positioned very low 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.290
 the most striking element of this new 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.360
 interior is undoubtedly the new 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.580
 rising center console 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.860
 his goal shorten the distance between 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.360
 steering wheel and gear lever for 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.850
 facilitate the passage of reports 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.670
 your hands will close comfortably 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.740
 and effectively on the sports steering wheel to 3 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.300
 branches behind him three instruments 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.340
 rounds will provide you with all the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.570
 essential indications and well a 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.270
 times inside he's a lot more 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.230
 difficult to differentiate the cayman from 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.120
 the 911 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.070
 despite everything for sure it's a good 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.350
 porsche it's really very well finished 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.770
 very very beautiful it is the class in the state 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.930
 pure 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.610
 what interests me are the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.020
 sports equipment for today 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.980
 on the circuit I see him 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.070
 paddles driving 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.340
 I see sports sport buttons plus 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.850
 connections of the s &amp; p sa samba for 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.989
 today 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.989
 There's just 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.140
 driving amenity case then there 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.720
 I will not complain 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.330
 this car is able to be super 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.000
 sporty super aggressive super fun 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.390
 without arguing on the track and she knows 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.700
 also be super comfortable nice 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.000
 almost an ultra city car 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.349
 silent with moult equipment to 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.349
 inside the gps must we do not have to 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.269
 to say it's still super nice to 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.849
 drive a Porsche and every day makes 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.799
 interesting the Cayman s has the 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.190
 sharpened version of the six-cylinder flat 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.549
 of 3 liters 4 the latter develops 325 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.780
 horses 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.660
 the power is transmitted to the wheels 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.079
 back by the box porsche pdk to 7 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.750
 reports 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.120
 the 0 to 100 km / hour request only 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.030
 four seconds 7 with the sport pack 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.390
 chrono that equips this one his speed of 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.829
 peak reaches 281 km time on circuit 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.690
 according to the formula 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.629
 thus consumption in mixed cycle 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.269
 falls to just 8 liters to the hundred 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.930
 co2 emissions are 290 grams to 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.660
 kilometer 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.340
 bhl offering a relationship to the power 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.720
 for the chassis part then they had to 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.239
 to rack your brains as you need to 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.180
 my opinion at porsche to be effective 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.650
 on circuit well to dampen the vibrators 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.860
 for example as today on the 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.070
 albi circuit while remaining flexible in 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.450
 city ​​with the problems of the road the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.670
 donkey and that is when there are 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.860
 keys that moron that can modify 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.140
 the amortization laws anyway on 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.310
 the trail on the road you on 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.290
 the highway is very efficient 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.300
 we really feel the difference of these 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.310
 modes of use available on 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.770
 request is intended to strengthen the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.620
 responsiveness and the sporty driving of the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.660
 new cayman s the sport chrono pack and 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.580
 for the first time proposed with a 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.980
 dynamic suspension of the box 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.260
 speeds at the key a more behavior 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.540
 stable at high speed in clubs 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.700
 and optimal driving comfort 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.190
 then the engine is there we are on 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.140
 a 3-liter 4-cylinder and 325 horsepower 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.620
 in ten years I wanted to be a little bit 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.870
 difficult 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.890
 deschamps was doing the roma just now 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.020
 that's what all horses have 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.490
 it is true that we are suitable for pilots 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.830
 more and more powerful cars 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.480
 and there 325 horses I told myself 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.920
 press that it 's not a lot but 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.870
 it's the sound of bad habits of 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.110
 the engine and presumptuous it responds very 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.070
 well 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.020
 associated with the robotic gearbox 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.800
 there is nothing to say it's super effective 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.980
 paddles driving 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.450
 it's always a sensation of 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.560
 competition and then especially 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.230
 unavoidable 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.290
 our cameraman knows who says porsche 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.790
 also says their control and there I see it 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.840
 he starts to cling 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:49.000
 jean-philippe so we're on the street 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.750
 speed engaged left foot on the 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.710
 brake pedal 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.310
 I crush lanzarote accelerator if I 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.310
 did it 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.770
 as sporty as the porsche player 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.919
 Cayman belongs to vehicles that 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.820
 gives you power performance 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:13.300
 agility without forgetting the pleasure 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:17.070
 porsche cayman s from 65 thousand 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.070
 608 euros out of options
