00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:10.730
 now I'm balls four and a half 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:48.539
 millimeter means how do we charge 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:54.800
 first wrap three times four 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.800
 five six and twelve pieces shorter and 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:41.659
 never do that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.590
 our book 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.880
 accuracy is more accurate accuracy here 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 is it that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:02:01.819
 smashed and shorter over here I still 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:13.200
 he thought yes breed 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:15.049
 shorter than 30s 322 for the 300th to 263 hard 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.880
 in short 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:50.280
 I think the flight will be ok well in the fifth point 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:54.329
 there will be a drummer more precisely 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.120
 click and everything means swing air here 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:03.139
 the reservoir further pulls the trigger 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.139
 the drummer hits and the air goes away 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:26.040
 operator away get away okay if 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.100
 want that video once my operator 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.370
 he shot here these videos will be recording 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:04:46.280

00:03:32.370 --> 00:04:46.280
