00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
and arrow but i'll just sit just got to

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.440 
and arrow but i'll just sit just got to
stick<00:05:45.900> with<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.170> cane<00:05:46.350> mccain<00:05:46.770> gets<00:05:47.450> almost

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
stick with the cane mccain gets almost

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.180 
stick with the cane mccain gets almost
all<00:05:48.780> at<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.140> same<00:05:49.290> time<00:05:49.560> if<00:05:49.920> you<00:05:50.040> know<00:05:50.160> what

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
all at the same time if you know what

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:57.760 
all at the same time if you know what
you're<00:05:50.340> doing

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.610 

me

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.960 

it<00:06:03.620> takes<00:06:03.830> a<00:06:03.920> lot<00:06:04.100> of<00:06:04.130> hits<00:06:04.340> but<00:06:04.520> you<00:06:04.640> can<00:06:04.790> just

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
it takes a lot of hits but you can just

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:14.060 
it takes a lot of hits but you can just
use<00:06:05.030> the<00:06:05.270> cane<00:06:05.480> she's<00:06:05.960> these<00:06:06.200> guys<00:06:07.030> like<00:06:08.030> that

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:24.630 

hopefully<00:06:15.070> my<00:06:15.130> magic<00:06:15.610> power<00:06:15.820> doesn't<00:06:16.210> run<00:06:16.330> out

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:41.459 

come<00:06:25.640> on<00:06:31.840> in<00:06:32.840> and<00:06:33.020> around

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:47.140 

they're<00:06:43.449> there<00:06:44.740> wait<00:06:45.740> a<00:06:45.770> minute<00:06:46.129> why<00:06:46.939> didn't

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
they're there wait a minute why didn't

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:53.920 
they're there wait a minute why didn't
let<00:06:47.300> me<00:06:47.419> go<00:06:47.539> back<00:06:47.770> ok<00:06:49.360> ok<00:06:52.120> go<00:06:53.120> let's<00:06:53.539> go<00:06:53.659> turbo

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
let me go back ok ok go let's go turbo

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.850 
let me go back ok ok go let's go turbo
and<00:06:54.349> just<00:06:54.650> fall<00:06:54.919> out<00:06:54.949> my<00:06:55.099> magic<00:06:55.490> again<00:06:56.710> this<00:06:57.710> is

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
and just fall out my magic again this is

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:05.719 
and just fall out my magic again this is
why<00:06:57.979> I<00:06:58.009> didn't<00:06:58.310> bring<00:06:58.430> cure-all<00:06:58.819> potions

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:13.320 

ok

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.860 

this<00:07:14.330> is<00:07:14.419> the<00:07:14.539> strong<00:07:14.840> way

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.990 

with<00:07:19.470> a<00:07:20.990> weight<00:07:21.990> I<00:07:22.460> think<00:07:23.460> yeah<00:07:23.610> that's<00:07:23.850> the

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 
with a weight I think yeah that's the

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.780 
with a weight I think yeah that's the
wrong<00:07:24.120> way<00:07:24.360> nope<00:07:24.990> oh<00:07:25.790> that's<00:07:26.790> right<00:07:27.170> this<00:07:28.170> room

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:28.790 
wrong way nope oh that's right this room

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.100 
wrong way nope oh that's right this room
well<00:07:29.790> I'm<00:07:29.940> here<00:07:30.120> I<00:07:30.150> may<00:07:30.360> as<00:07:30.390> well<00:07:30.570> get<00:07:30.720> the<00:07:30.840> key

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.410 

why<00:07:34.110> does<00:07:34.380> every<00:07:35.040> room<00:07:35.400> in<00:07:35.640> the<00:07:35.970> parallel

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:36.420 
why does every room in the parallel

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.290 
why does every room in the parallel
tower<00:07:36.750> have<00:07:37.080> these<00:07:37.320> flying<00:07:38.970> floor

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 
tower have these flying floor

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.450 
tower have these flying floor
tiles

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.180 

ah

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.190 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.660 

not<00:07:49.190> now<00:07:49.460> math<00:07:49.850> not<00:07:50.810> now<00:07:51.190> i'm<00:07:52.190> almost<00:07:52.460> done

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:52.670 
not now math not now i'm almost done

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.240 
not now math not now i'm almost done
with<00:07:52.880> a<00:07:52.940> parallel<00:07:53.270> tower<00:07:53.450> I<00:07:53.890> have<00:07:54.890> what<00:07:55.130> is

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.250 
with a parallel tower I have what is

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:00.880 
with a parallel tower I have what is
this<00:07:55.780> by<00:07:56.780> that<00:07:57.020> by<00:07:57.170> think<00:07:58.960> there's<00:07:59.960> if<00:08:00.470> i

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:00.890 
this by that by think there's if i

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.580 
this by that by think there's if i
remember<00:08:01.040> correctly<00:08:01.490> there's<00:08:02.330> three<00:08:03.020> keys<00:08:03.290> in

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:03.590 
remember correctly there's three keys in

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.260 
remember correctly there's three keys in
the<00:08:03.680> light<00:08:03.800> world<00:08:03.980> three<00:08:04.550> keys<00:08:04.760> in<00:08:04.940> parallel

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.270 
the light world three keys in parallel

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:10.180 
the light world three keys in parallel
world<00:08:05.590> and<00:08:06.640> three<00:08:07.640> keys<00:08:08.650> in<00:08:09.650> the<00:08:09.920> parallel

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.190 
world and three keys in the parallel

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.700 
world and three keys in the parallel
tower<00:08:10.450> but<00:08:11.450> I<00:08:11.690> know<00:08:11.750> I<00:08:11.870> definitely<00:08:12.470> have

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:12.710 
tower but I know I definitely have

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.840 
tower but I know I definitely have
enough<00:08:12.740> keys<00:08:13.100> to<00:08:13.280> get<00:08:13.370> through<00:08:13.490> the<00:08:13.580> parallel

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:13.850 
enough keys to get through the parallel

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.270 
enough keys to get through the parallel
tower<00:08:14.030> now
