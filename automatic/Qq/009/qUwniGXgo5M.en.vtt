00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello everybody of everything I need 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.230
 today she is more of a neighbor than to 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.750
 gta5 I used to be at this time here 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.299
 in the channel but finally a lot of today with 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.379
 the us 98 of the video is basically a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.199
 nuclear bomb 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.260
 Hi, it 's quiet in the pool. 6 - That's right. 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 expensive - so this mode changes this here 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.830
 O 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.920
 the adhesive pump is not that gta5 in 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.449
 Portuguese, of course, but that's all 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.880
 so let me see if I can explain 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.130
 right type and moves it changes the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 The intensity of the explosion is very 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 the more intense the more you go 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.300
 see here I'll show you a 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.940
 video is great here on the floor one 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.809
 beauty one on the floor you just to see the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.969
 difference our priscilla of a being made 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.730
 so yellow - it does not taste like it's expensive 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.280
 as if they were emitting radiation, I finally 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.410
 because the author put nuclear bomb 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.100
 Because of her face, you will see 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.430
 It's calm, I'll put a 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 Mother in Spanish 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.900
 here to show you how 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.090
 it is okay 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.049
 I'll put a dozen grandchildren with the help 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.979
 It's good for us to carry 25 there. 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.650
 good, okay right? 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.900
 well let's see I'm going to explode here 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.869
 I was going to detonate the bombs that you're going to see. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.540
 the insane explosion level that is okay 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.470
 Our face is very crazy, anyway. Come on. 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.470
 bomb detonate 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.440
 see 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.500
 You see why this chan mode was 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.700
 accompanying support each type of course 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.290
 that it is not composed to say as if it were 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.510
 really a real- life nuclear bomb 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.690
 I can not do it because I do not like it. 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.660
 There is radiation and everything else, but finally, man. 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.390
 It's a phenomenal way to date a guy. 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.610
 I blast very hard so I'll try 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.470
 show you here with various vehicles 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.490
 I'll try to make a puppy here. 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.209
 Beauty, I'm going to rain, get a cart. 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.340
 here and I'll put a lot of bomb on him 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.040
 much much even for us to see how 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.290
 what's up beauty is just for the type people 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.050
 you feel the difference of the explosion 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.590
 it's ours in the kind the blast was so 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.590
 intense that arrives here and fps knows in the hour 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.110
 we are also tense, anyway, let's go 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.310
 Putting it in the car puts me in the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.290
 morro do bumba 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.640
 mold pump because I think it is so 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.680
 easier for you to see in the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.540
 to visualize a woman speaking to af 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.140
 Come on, man, let's try to detonate this. 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.420
 here we go baby or we have it here 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.780
 you blast aft 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.780
 come on 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.110
 You see how intense it was and I 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.320
 I put some more right guy is 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.000

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.740
 Our old galera has no limits with 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.240
 sure it will be a problem, I'll see 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.060
 who with guns knows to be crazy guy or is he 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.410
 this idea was just priscila month and 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.640
 4 in another 25, there's this car here 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.150
 also 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.540
 I put it down but at least we'll be able to 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.270
 To go out just to see 25 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.250
 now in an explosion or it's ours. 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.250
 Ana will tremble everything, bug will catch fire 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.850
 Our band is serious, this is it. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.190
 really a nuclear bomb because 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.080
 mercy appreciates has nothing to do 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.470
 with nuclear bomb because nuclear bomb 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.680

 Anyway, it 's just that I'm going to get some others. 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.920

 crazy now, come on 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:03.120
 or it's my idea that I put it there 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.370
 and you see it's a helicopter and two 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.380
 cars side by side, right? 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.950

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.410
 beauty let's put c4 a tubinho 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.120
 in these cars everything in the helicopter to 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.760
 people see explosion that is going to be expensive 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.760
 Our manoe of madness in 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:38.010
 I think it 's good, the guy is done. 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.960
 beauty, beauty, come on, now. 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.320
 It's going to be an explosion. The woman has ours. 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.700
 Lady Ana, and let's see, let's face it. 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.700

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.660
 very soon dude our hand is gone 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.090
 Nothing, or soon after, is on fire. 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.190
 my joke never gets old me 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.060
 I love being a joke, it's human. 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.160
 Our a must in case the then it's just that 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.830
 the intensity as soon as possible. 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.270
 Leica is basically basically that's it. 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.810
 and this way also has for me of 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.550
 Proximity now that woman's test 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.200
 that test that has everything to give 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.170
 Just not right 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.080
 nuclear bombs 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.900
 how is the name of the net cast calling not 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.760
 can and will blow up in the air is not 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.170
 because I think it's going to go well, but 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.270
 finally, of course I have infinite life 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.080

 here it is at the end and from now on 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.070
 you will see several excerpts from 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.290
 Explosions I 'll do it there 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.950
 It's cool for you to see how it is. 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.860
 beauty 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.540
 several explosions in sequence are there 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.790
 with the rest of the video for anyone 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.660
 take a closer look at how 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.660
 Let's go, man. 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.960
 the crazy one and mine even exploded the bug 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.730
 caught fire then but personally that 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.800
 dangers of a state of each assessment 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.890
 who wants to see watching the video there? 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.010
 There are going to be more explosions, but it's 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.500
 This is how I cried your next video. 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.010
