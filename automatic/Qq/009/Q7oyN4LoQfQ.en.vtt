00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:44.999 
not anyways it can be also be used for a

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:46.969

knock people out with it and stuff I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.199 
knock people out with it and stuff I
wouldn't<00:00:49.199> suggest<00:00:49.319> doing<00:00:49.679> that<00:00:49.889> because<00:00:50.209> you

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:51.209 
wouldn't suggest doing that because you

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.059 
wouldn't suggest doing that because you
probably<00:00:51.569> wouldn't<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:52.530> happy<00:00:52.920> people

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:53.069 
probably wouldn't have very happy people

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:57.229 
probably wouldn't have very happy people
after<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.519> ah<00:00:54.979> so<00:00:55.979> they<00:00:56.429> can<00:00:56.609> also<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.059> used

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
after that ah so they can also be used

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.930 
after that ah so they can also be used
for<00:00:57.389> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:57.929> make<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.309> knot<00:00:59.549> out<00:00:59.729> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
which you probably don't because it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.929

fishing weight or just a lead ball or in
this<00:03:42.900> case<00:03:43.079> I'm<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:44.040> video<00:03:44.280> I'm<00:03:44.609> using<00:03:45.000> a

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
this case I'm just the video I'm using a

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.429 
this case I'm just the video I'm using a
white<00:03:45.540> marble<00:03:47.659> so<00:03:48.659> you<00:03:48.750> just<00:03:48.930> shove<00:03:49.290> that

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
white marble so you just shove that

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.789 
white marble so you just shove that
inside<00:03:49.769> of<00:03:49.799> your<00:03:50.099> knot<00:03:51.090> like<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.389> or<00:03:51.900> maybe

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
inside of your knot like that or maybe

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.449 
inside of your knot like that or maybe
not<00:03:52.979> like<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.639> but<00:03:54.569> like<00:03:55.109> this<00:03:55.349> just<00:03:56.069> push<00:03:56.340> it

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
not like that but like this just push it

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.280 
not like that but like this just push it
in<00:03:56.579> there<00:03:56.729> and<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.780> want<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:57.989> do<00:03:58.049> this<00:03:58.139> before

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
in there and you want to do this before

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.509 
in there and you want to do this before
you<00:03:58.500> tighten<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.859> knot<00:03:59.009> up<00:03:59.159> because<00:03:59.370> if<00:03:59.459> you

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
you tighten the knot up because if you

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.520 
you tighten the knot up because if you
do<00:03:59.669> it<00:03:59.759> after<00:03:59.909> it's<00:04:00.359> impossible<00:04:01.199> to<00:04:01.319> get<00:04:01.439> the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
do it after it's impossible to get the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.479 
do it after it's impossible to get the
ball<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.979> know<00:04:02.549> what<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:02.939> can<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:05.310> then

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
ball and you know what you can so then

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.839 
ball and you know what you can so then
you<00:04:05.609> just<00:04:05.819> go<00:04:05.909> ahead<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.329> you<00:04:06.449> tighten<00:04:06.629> it<00:04:06.810> up

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
you just go ahead and you tighten it up

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.749 
you just go ahead and you tighten it up
basically<00:04:08.849> just<00:04:09.079> start<00:04:10.079> pulling<00:04:10.259> it<00:04:10.500> tight

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:10.759 
basically just start pulling it tight

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.990 
basically just start pulling it tight
and<00:04:12.019> you<00:04:13.019> may<00:04:13.139> have<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.530> do<00:04:14.040> about<00:04:14.159> three<00:04:14.849> or

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
and you may have to do about three or

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.629 
and you may have to do about three or
four<00:04:15.180> rounds<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.569> tightening

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:30.680 

like<00:04:23.639> this

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:42.870 

and<00:04:31.690> then<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.960> last<00:04:32.170> three<00:04:34.740> here<00:04:41.730> like<00:04:42.730> that

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
and then the last three here like that

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.940 
and then the last three here like that
so<00:04:43.240> it's<00:04:43.840> looking<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.140> lot<00:04:44.230> better<00:04:44.470> now<00:04:44.680> you

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
so it's looking a lot better now you

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.490 
so it's looking a lot better now you
could<00:04:45.100> do<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.340> two<00:04:45.700> or<00:04:45.820> three<00:04:45.850> more<00:04:46.270> times

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
could do that two or three more times

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.900 
could do that two or three more times
and<00:04:47.500> I'll<00:04:47.620> come<00:04:47.800> back<00:04:47.950> on<00:04:48.130> it's<00:04:48.250> done<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.730> you

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
and I'll come back on it's done and you

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.140 
and I'll come back on it's done and you
can<00:04:49.030> see<00:04:49.180> how<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.390> looks<00:04:49.470> as<00:04:50.550> you<00:04:51.550> can<00:04:51.730> see<00:04:51.910> here

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
can see how it looks as you can see here

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.510 
can see how it looks as you can see here
we<00:04:52.300> have<00:04:52.480> a<00:04:52.510> nice<00:04:52.840> looking<00:04:53.140> monkey's<00:04:53.680> fist<00:04:53.890> not

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
we have a nice looking monkey's fist not

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.400 
we have a nice looking monkey's fist not
you<00:04:54.910> can<00:04:55.030> see<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.360> white<00:04:55.600> marble<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:56.170> put

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
you can see the white marble I put

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.610 
you can see the white marble I put
inside<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.890> earlier<00:04:58.170> it's<00:04:59.170> very<00:04:59.440> it's

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
inside of it earlier it's very it's

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.130 
inside of it earlier it's very it's
pretty<00:04:59.710> heavy<00:05:00.070> I'd<00:05:00.430> say<00:05:00.610> maybe<00:05:00.790> weighs

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
pretty heavy I'd say maybe weighs

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.210 
pretty heavy I'd say maybe weighs
somewhere<00:05:02.140> in<00:05:02.320> between<00:05:02.410> an<00:05:02.680> eighth<00:05:02.860> or<00:05:03.160> a

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
somewhere in between an eighth or a

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.850 
somewhere in between an eighth or a
quarter<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.730> a<00:05:03.910> pound<00:05:04.410> if<00:05:05.410> you<00:05:05.530> put<00:05:05.680> like<00:05:05.800> a

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
quarter of a pound if you put like a

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.890 
quarter of a pound if you put like a
lead<00:05:06.130> ball<00:05:06.430> or<00:05:06.670> lead<00:05:06.910> weight<00:05:07.150> or<00:05:07.600> fishing

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
lead ball or lead weight or fishing

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.840 
lead ball or lead weight or fishing
weight<00:05:08.050> inside<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.590> probably<00:05:09.310> get<00:05:09.640> it<00:05:09.760> up

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
weight inside of it probably get it up

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.910 
weight inside of it probably get it up
to<00:05:10.030> about<00:05:10.120> at<00:05:10.450> least<00:05:10.570> 3/4<00:05:11.170> of<00:05:11.200> a<00:05:11.380> pound<00:05:11.410> if<00:05:11.770> not

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
to about at least 3/4 of a pound if not

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.070 
to about at least 3/4 of a pound if not
like<00:05:12.100> a<00:05:12.130> pound<00:05:12.430> so<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.330> can<00:05:13.480> definitely<00:05:13.900> see<00:05:14.050> how

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
they could swing these singers around

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.670 
they could swing these singers around
and<00:05:15.670> knock<00:05:15.880> somebody<00:05:16.210> out<00:05:16.270> with<00:05:16.390> one<00:05:19.170> so<00:05:20.170> yeah
