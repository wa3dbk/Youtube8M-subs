00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
outline of the Shred sled this is not an

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.859 
outline of the Shred sled this is not an
abnormally<00:01:33.649> wide<00:01:33.979> board<00:01:34.429> to<00:01:34.640> me<00:01:34.819> but<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.539> is<00:01:35.719> an

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
abnormally wide board to me but it is an

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.249 
abnormally wide board to me but it is an
abnormally<00:01:36.499> wide<00:01:36.770> nose<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.090> if<00:01:38.210> we<00:01:38.420> don't<00:01:38.810> have

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
abnormally wide nose so if we don't have

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.649 
abnormally wide nose so if we don't have
an<00:01:39.499> abnormally<00:01:40.159> wide<00:01:40.429> board<00:01:40.909> from<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.420> rail

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
an abnormally wide board from this rail

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.629 
an abnormally wide board from this rail
to<00:01:41.899> this<00:01:42.049> rail<00:01:42.319> if<00:01:42.590> that's<00:01:43.189> only<00:01:43.340> slightly

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:43.639 
to this rail if that's only slightly

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:46.419 
to this rail if that's only slightly

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
wider than normal short board but we add

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.639 
wider than normal short board but we add
extra<00:01:47.030> width<00:01:47.299> up<00:01:47.539> here<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:47.990> nose<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.560> give

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
extra width up here in the nose and give

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.889 
extra width up here in the nose and give
it<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.829> nose<00:01:49.009> that's<00:01:49.249> kind<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.639> fishy<00:01:49.880> what<00:01:50.719> that

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
it a nose that's kind of fishy what that

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.690 
it a nose that's kind of fishy what that
does<00:01:51.079> is<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.350> helps<00:01:51.380> us<00:01:51.649> keep<00:01:51.799> a<00:01:51.889> parallel<00:01:52.429> rail

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
does is it helps us keep a parallel rail

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.090 
does is it helps us keep a parallel rail
line<00:01:52.969> a<00:01:53.209> more<00:01:53.810> parallel<00:01:54.350> rail<00:01:54.560> line<00:01:54.829> than

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
line a more parallel rail line than

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.859 
line a more parallel rail line than
usual<00:01:55.579> from<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:55.969> body<00:01:56.179> of<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.420> board<00:01:56.630> coming

out to the nose and coming back towards
the<00:01:59.359> tail<00:01:59.600> because<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:00.200> haven't<00:02:00.380> really

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
the tail because we haven't really

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.349 
the tail because we haven't really
increased<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.459> width<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.909> much<00:02:02.119> in<00:02:02.270> the

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
increased the width that much in the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.270 
increased the width that much in the
body<00:02:02.569> of<00:02:02.749> the<00:02:02.840> board<00:02:03.079> but<00:02:03.560> we<00:02:03.679> have<00:02:03.889> increased

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
body of the board but we have increased

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.830 
body of the board but we have increased
the<00:02:04.340> width<00:02:04.609> in<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.819> nose<00:02:05.060> what<00:02:05.450> they've<00:02:05.600> done

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
the width in the nose what they've done

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.809 
the width in the nose what they've done
here<00:02:06.049> with<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.319> Shred<00:02:06.560> sled<00:02:06.889> is<00:02:07.100> they<00:02:07.579> put

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
here with the Shred sled is they put

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.940 
here with the Shred sled is they put
this<00:02:07.999> wing<00:02:08.270> back<00:02:08.539> here<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.410> decrease<00:02:09.649> the

this wing back here to decrease the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.770 
this wing back here to decrease the
width<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.550> tail<00:02:10.789> relative<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.600> body

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
of the board because if we're going to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.010 
of the board because if we're going to
do<00:02:13.640> what<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:13.910> need<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.090> do<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.630> make<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:14.959> a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
do what we need to do to make this a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.990 
do what we need to do to make this a
parallel<00:02:15.590> rail<00:02:15.830> line<00:02:16.130> we've<00:02:16.610> got<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.909> do

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
parallel rail line we've got to do

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.699 
parallel rail line we've got to do
something<00:02:17.269> back<00:02:17.599> here<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.230> make<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.500> board

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
something back here to make the board

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.830 
something back here to make the board
easier<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.189> control<00:02:19.640> they<00:02:20.239> just<00:02:20.269> get<00:02:20.659> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
easier to control they just get the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.750 
easier to control they just get the
width<00:02:21.080> of<00:02:21.230> this<00:02:21.409> outline<00:02:21.860> continued<00:02:22.489> all<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
width of this outline continued all the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.220 
width of this outline continued all the
way<00:02:23.000> back<00:02:23.269> I<00:02:23.540> bet<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.840> know<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.049> I'm<00:02:24.140> about

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
way back I bet you know what I'm about

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.780 
way back I bet you know what I'm about
to<00:02:24.409> say<00:02:24.590> because<00:02:24.769> we've<00:02:25.040> discussed<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:25.640> on

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
to say because we've discussed this on

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.759 
to say because we've discussed this on
our<00:02:25.970> episode<00:02:26.390> about<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.629> weirdo<00:02:27.140> Ripper<00:02:27.409> that

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
our episode about the weirdo Ripper that

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.199 
our episode about the weirdo Ripper that
would<00:02:27.950> make<00:02:28.129> this<00:02:28.280> board<00:02:28.549> much<00:02:28.819> harder<00:02:29.120> to

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
would make this board much harder to

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.910 
would make this board much harder to
control<00:02:29.510> because<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.049> would<00:02:30.170> have<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.500> lot<00:02:30.769> of

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
control because it would have a lot of

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.039 
control because it would have a lot of
surface<00:02:31.400> area<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.939> the<00:02:31.970> water<00:02:32.330> trailing<00:02:32.870> back

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
surface area on the water trailing back

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.289 
surface area on the water trailing back
but<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:34.159> these<00:02:34.340> wings<00:02:34.610> right<00:02:34.879> here<00:02:35.090> this

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
but with these wings right here this

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.089 
but with these wings right here this
creates<00:02:35.629> a<00:02:35.750> release<00:02:36.049> point<00:02:36.379> for<00:02:36.590> water<00:02:36.739> it

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
creates a release point for water it

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.280 
creates a release point for water it
also<00:02:37.250> creates<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.819> pivot<00:02:38.209> point<00:02:38.450> right<00:02:38.689> here

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
also creates a pivot point right here

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.740 
also creates a pivot point right here
for<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.680> civic<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.670> way<00:02:40.790> let's<00:02:41.239> take<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.480> look

episode on the Channel Islands biscuit
you<00:02:45.170> saw<00:02:45.530> us<00:02:45.680> take<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.159> straightedge<00:02:46.730> and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
you saw us take this straightedge and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.970 
you saw us take this straightedge and
set<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.569> on<00:02:47.629> the<00:02:47.689> tail<00:02:47.989> rocker<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.709> board

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
set it on the tail rocker of that board

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.589 
set it on the tail rocker of that board
to<00:02:49.400> show<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.879> tail<00:02:50.090> rocker<00:02:50.329> was

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
to show that the tail rocker was

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.750 
to show that the tail rocker was
entirely<00:02:50.989> flat<00:02:51.439> a<00:02:51.709> straight<00:02:52.099> edge<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:52.519> this

entirely flat a straight edge like this

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.670 
entirely flat a straight edge like this
is<00:02:53.030> useful<00:02:53.239> for<00:02:53.599> showing<00:02:53.750> any<00:02:54.110> surface<00:02:54.530> as

measuring<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:57.079> rocker<00:02:57.319> or<00:02:57.680> any<00:02:57.860> type<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.099> curve

measuring a rocker or any type of curve

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.399 
measuring a rocker or any type of curve
it's<00:02:58.970> actually<00:02:59.299> a<00:02:59.329> very<00:02:59.480> crude<00:02:59.810> way<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.110> get<00:03:00.379> a

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
it's actually a very crude way to get a

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.830 
it's actually a very crude way to get a
feel<00:03:00.590> for<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.860> rocker<00:03:01.069> but<00:03:01.760> still<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:02.720> get

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
feel for the rocker but still we can get

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.539 
feel for the rocker but still we can get
a<00:03:02.870> rough<00:03:03.230> estimate<00:03:03.439> if<00:03:04.040> you're<00:03:04.189> just<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.489> a

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
a rough estimate if you're just in a

a rough estimate if you're just in a
surf<00:03:04.760> shop<00:03:04.790> by<00:03:05.629> not<00:03:05.870> just<00:03:06.079> eyeballing<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.860> but

using<00:03:07.579> a<00:03:07.640> flat<00:03:07.879> surface<00:03:08.150> if<00:03:08.569> we're<00:03:09.140> looking<00:03:09.230> at

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
using a flat surface if we're looking at

it to me the sport seems like it really
wants<00:04:03.099> to<00:04:03.220> flow<00:04:03.519> down<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:03.879> line<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.599> really

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
wants to flow down the line it really

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.960 
wants to flow down the line it really
wants<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.140> pivot<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.830> do<00:04:05.980> turns<00:04:06.310> in<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
pocket it doesn't really seem to want to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.830

surfers<00:04:11.260> do<00:04:11.379> those<00:04:11.530> kind<00:04:11.739> of<00:04:11.769> double<00:04:12.129> bottom

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
surfers do those kind of double bottom

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.400 
surfers do those kind of double bottom
turns<00:04:12.670> where<00:04:13.300> they<00:04:13.390> drop<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.110> it's<00:04:14.230> kind

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
turns where they drop in and it's kind

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.780 
turns where they drop in and it's kind
of<00:04:14.440> like<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.590> bottom<00:04:15.040> turn<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.489> then<00:04:15.580> another

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
of like a bottom turn and then another

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.909 
of like a bottom turn and then another
bottom<00:04:16.239> turn<00:04:16.419> up<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.810> lip<00:04:17.019> this<00:04:17.650> board

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
bottom turn up to the lip this board

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.979 
bottom turn up to the lip this board
seems<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.340> like<00:04:18.519> doing<00:04:18.729> those<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.269> also<00:04:19.540> think

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
seems to like doing those I also think

seems to like doing those I also think
that<00:04:20.079> you<00:04:20.260> really<00:04:20.500> feel<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.979> wing<00:04:21.220> placement

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
that you really feel the wing placement

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.090 
that you really feel the wing placement
on<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.180> board<00:04:22.479> the<00:04:23.050> placement<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.590> wings<00:04:23.860> is

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
on this board the placement of wings is

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.010 
on this board the placement of wings is
very<00:04:24.340> important<00:04:24.820> relative<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.389> fins<00:04:25.690> and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
very important relative to fins and

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.050 
very important relative to fins and
usually<00:04:26.800> on<00:04:26.919> surfboards<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.669> will<00:04:27.790> feel<00:04:28.030> a

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
usually on surfboards you will feel a

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.750 
usually on surfboards you will feel a
board<00:04:28.389> be<00:04:28.570> much<00:04:28.750> more<00:04:28.960> loose<00:04:29.320> if<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:30.430> put<00:04:30.610> the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
board be much more loose if you put the

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.550 
board be much more loose if you put the
wing<00:04:30.940> placement<00:04:31.479> in<00:04:31.660> front<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.110> fin<00:04:32.350> as

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
wing placement in front of the fin as

opposed to putting the wing placement

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.540 
opposed to putting the wing placement
behind<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.260> fin<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.740> wing<00:04:35.950> placement<00:04:36.430> on

this<00:04:36.729> board<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.210> just<00:04:37.479> in<00:04:37.750> front<00:04:38.139> of<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.560> back

base<00:04:39.070> of<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.400> fin<00:04:39.610> right<00:04:39.850> here<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.780> think

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
base of the fin right here and I think

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.900 
base of the fin right here and I think
that<00:04:41.530> that's<00:04:41.620> part<00:04:42.040> of<00:04:42.100> what<00:04:42.280> contributes<00:04:42.760> to

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
that that's part of what contributes to

that that's part of what contributes to
this<00:04:43.000> board<00:04:43.270> feeling<00:04:43.750> so<00:04:43.960> loose<00:04:44.229> let's<00:04:44.800> have<00:04:44.919> a

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
look at the concave of this board why am

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.190

looking at calm caves on a surfboard
there's<00:04:52.419> one<00:04:52.690> thing<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:52.960> is<00:04:53.169> pretty

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
there's one thing that is pretty

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.350 
there's one thing that is pretty

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
important to keep in mind when you place

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.090 
important to keep in mind when you place

the concave right here place your head
behind<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.850> space<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.270> you're<00:05:01.389> looking<00:05:01.690> at

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
behind the space that you're looking at

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.379 
behind the space that you're looking at
and<00:05:02.050> then<00:05:02.500> follow<00:05:03.010> it<00:05:03.130> along<00:05:03.460> as<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.180> move

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
and then follow it along as you move

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.230 
and then follow it along as you move
through<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:04.990> curve<00:05:05.260> of<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.889> concave<00:05:06.430> if<00:05:07.030> you

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
through the curve of the concave if you

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.640 
through the curve of the concave if you
set<00:05:07.450> your<00:05:07.539> straight<00:05:07.840> edge<00:05:07.870> down<00:05:08.169> like<00:05:08.410> this

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
set your straight edge down like this

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.620 
set your straight edge down like this
and<00:05:08.919> then<00:05:09.070> place<00:05:09.250> your<00:05:09.280> head<00:05:09.580> right<00:05:09.789> here<00:05:09.820> then

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
and then place your head right here then

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.140 
and then place your head right here then
start<00:05:10.930> moving<00:05:11.289> this<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:12.010> can<00:05:12.520> look<00:05:12.820> like<00:05:13.000> the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
start moving this it can look like the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.969 
start moving this it can look like the
concave<00:05:13.630> is<00:05:13.810> decreasing<00:05:14.470> when<00:05:14.620> it's<00:05:14.740> really

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
concave is decreasing when it's really

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.070 
concave is decreasing when it's really
not<00:05:15.190> because<00:05:15.729> your<00:05:16.060> head<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.240> back<00:05:16.479> here<00:05:16.900> and

don't see that double concave I don't

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
feel that double concave maybe it's

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.250 
feel that double concave maybe it's
there<00:05:45.789> and<00:05:45.940> I<00:05:46.000> just<00:05:46.210> can't<00:05:46.419> find<00:05:46.479> it<00:05:46.870> but

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
there and I just can't find it but

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.589 
there and I just can't find it but
according<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:47.680> my<00:05:47.889> eyes<00:05:48.130> in<00:05:48.520> my<00:05:48.550> hands<00:05:49.150> this

seems<00:05:49.900> like<00:05:49.990> a<00:05:50.080> single<00:05:50.380> concave<00:05:50.950> throughout

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
seems like a single concave throughout

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.430 
seems like a single concave throughout
coming<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:52.210> ending<00:05:52.479> in<00:05:52.570> a<00:05:52.630> flat<00:05:52.930> out<00:05:53.110> here<00:05:53.349> in

you can't push it down on the lower side

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.909 
you can't push it down on the lower side
or<00:06:00.849> up<00:06:01.090> again<00:06:01.900> watch<00:06:02.169> that<00:06:02.380> video<00:06:02.470> of<00:06:02.710> Crede

far you can push this

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.559 
far you can push this

or if you really want to rails have a

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:08.939 
or if you really want to rails have a
bit<00:06:07.689> more<00:06:07.870> volume<00:06:08.229> than<00:06:08.319> a<00:06:08.379> normal<00:06:08.710> short

board<00:06:09.219> but<00:06:09.669> definitely<00:06:10.180> shaped<00:06:10.509> it<00:06:10.689> away<00:06:10.930> that

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
board but definitely shaped it away that

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.080

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
so that you can really feel it not sit
