00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.839 
level 6 and upgrade the fewest times I
think<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:14.299> 3<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.280> these<00:02:16.280> abilities<00:02:16.519> have

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
think it's 3 and these abilities have

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.030 
think it's 3 and these abilities have
long<00:02:17.090> cooldowns<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.870> will<00:02:18.110> save<00:02:18.409> your<00:02:18.560> ass<00:02:18.709> or

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
long cooldowns and will save your ass or

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.339 
long cooldowns and will save your ass or
kill<00:02:19.340> someone<00:02:19.579> else<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:20.000> pretty<00:02:20.750> well<00:02:21.079> and

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
kill someone else is pretty well and

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.940 
kill someone else is pretty well and
that's<00:02:21.950> why<00:02:22.159> they<00:02:22.280> got<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> long<00:02:22.670> cooldown<00:02:22.909> so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that's why they got a long cooldown so

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.589 
that's why they got a long cooldown so
