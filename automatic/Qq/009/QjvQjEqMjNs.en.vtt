00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.170 
the way I built this pond though is I
put<00:02:09.179> down<00:02:09.360> plastic<00:02:09.750> first<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.520> put<00:02:11.910> on

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
put down plastic first and that I put on

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.960 
put down plastic first and that I put on
the<00:02:12.599> walls<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.530> way<00:02:13.860> around<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the walls all the way around and on the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.199 
the walls all the way around and on the
floor<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.530> did<00:02:16.530> not<00:02:16.709> put<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> plastic<00:02:17.940> wall

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
floor I did not put a plastic wall

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.119 
floor I did not put a plastic wall
against<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> rocks<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:20.370> uh<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.910> made<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.129> wall

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
against the rocks but uh I made the wall

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.670 
against the rocks but uh I made the wall
out<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> bricks<00:02:24.090> stones<00:02:24.629> all<00:02:25.319> kinds<00:02:25.620> of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
out of bricks stones all kinds of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.619 
out of bricks stones all kinds of
different<00:02:25.950> stuff<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:27.120> looks<00:02:27.270> pretty<00:02:27.450> cool

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
different stuff and it looks pretty cool

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.559 
different stuff and it looks pretty cool
I<00:02:27.690> think<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.370> pawns<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.970> an<00:02:30.120> insert

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
I think this is pawns just an insert

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.040 
I think this is pawns just an insert
that<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.890> got<00:02:32.040> from<00:02:32.220> Lowe's<00:02:32.959> then<00:02:33.959> I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
that I think I got from Lowe's then I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.839 
that I think I got from Lowe's then I
also<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.379> some<00:02:34.440> live<00:02:34.739> plants<00:02:35.220> around<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
also have some live plants around it a

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.910 
also have some live plants around it a
lot<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.660> different<00:02:36.930> live<00:02:37.019> plants<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.590> are<00:02:37.709> in

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
lot of different live plants that are in

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.660 
lot of different live plants that are in
pots<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.170> water<00:02:40.500> at<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.489> base

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
pots and then I just water at the base

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.470 
pots and then I just water at the base
of<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.910> plants<00:02:42.420> at<00:02:42.690> each<00:02:42.870> pot<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.180> doesn't

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
of the plants at each pot so it doesn't

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.170 
of the plants at each pot so it doesn't
like<00:02:45.569> leach<00:02:45.780> out<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.200> go<00:02:46.290> everywhere<00:02:47.150> then<00:02:48.150> I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
like leach out and go everywhere then I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.930 
like leach out and go everywhere then I
