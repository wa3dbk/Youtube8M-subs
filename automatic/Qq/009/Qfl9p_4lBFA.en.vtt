vegetable oil either canola even olive
oil<00:00:28.630> will<00:00:28.720> work<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.410> when<00:00:29.530> you're<00:00:29.650> searing<00:00:29.860> a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
oil will work and when you're searing a

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.459 
oil will work and when you're searing a
meat<00:00:30.130> you<00:00:30.250> want<00:00:30.400> to<00:00:30.460> start<00:00:30.670> on<00:00:30.730> a<00:00:30.820> high<00:00:31.000> heat

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:31.469 
meat you want to start on a high heat

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:34.229 
meat you want to start on a high heat
they<00:00:32.469> are<00:00:32.619> oil<00:00:32.800> nice<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:33.100> smoking<00:00:33.730> so<00:00:34.000> we<00:00:34.120> can

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
they are oil nice and smoking so we can

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.600 
they are oil nice and smoking so we can
caramelize<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:35.290> fat<00:00:35.530> cap<00:00:35.770> on<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.250> meat<00:00:36.400> here

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
caramelize the fat cap on the meat here

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.460 
caramelize the fat cap on the meat here
it's<00:00:36.880> gonna<00:00:37.000> splash<00:00:37.690> up<00:00:37.900> on<00:00:38.020> you<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.170> little<00:00:38.350> bit

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
it's gonna splash up on you a little bit

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.920 
it's gonna splash up on you a little bit
you<00:00:39.360> want<00:00:40.360> lots<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.780> smoke<00:00:41.620> sound<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.930> searing

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
you want lots of smoke sound and searing

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.310 
you want lots of smoke sound and searing
here

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
here

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.850 
here
so<00:00:45.100> when<00:00:45.250> searing<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.700> meat<00:00:46.170> take<00:00:47.170> your<00:00:47.350> time

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
so when searing the meat take your time

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.860 
so when searing the meat take your time
caramelization<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.329> meat<00:00:49.480> is<00:00:49.630> probably

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
caramelization of the meat is probably

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.810 
caramelization of the meat is probably
the<00:00:49.960> most<00:00:50.079> important<00:00:50.559> part<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:51.460> while<00:00:51.700> we're

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
the most important part so while we're

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.850 
the most important part so while we're
letting<00:00:51.880> that<00:00:52.030> Brown<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.350> move<00:00:53.530> on<00:00:53.710> to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
letting that Brown and we move on to

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.410 
letting that Brown and we move on to
getting<00:00:54.040> my<00:00:54.219> vegetables<00:00:54.820> ready<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.090> go<00:00:55.210> here
