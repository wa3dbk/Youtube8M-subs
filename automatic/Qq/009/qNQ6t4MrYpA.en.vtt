recently to get a good
slow-motion<00:00:35.960> cut<00:00:36.559> of<00:00:37.000> anything<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:38.690> do

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
slow-motion cut of anything and I do

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.560 
slow-motion cut of anything and I do
mean<00:00:38.870> anything<00:00:40.210> essentially<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.329> problem

that I'm running into is that the slow

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.709 
that I'm running into is that the slow
motion<00:00:44.420> technology<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:47.000> we<00:00:47.090> have<00:00:47.360> currently

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
motion technology that we have currently

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.020 
motion technology that we have currently
the<00:00:48.469> algorithms<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:49.309> suck<00:00:49.760> they're

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
the algorithms just suck they're

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.610 
the algorithms just suck they're
horrible<00:00:50.510> absolutely<00:00:50.719> horrible<00:00:51.050> them

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620

the smoothness is completely

overshadowed by the fact that it

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.690 
overshadowed by the fact that it
literally<00:03:44.540> looks<00:03:44.900> like<00:03:45.140> he's<00:03:45.740> stepping

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700

now<00:03:58.100> even<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.610> ball<00:03:58.850> is<00:03:59.330> going<00:03:59.750> fast<00:04:00.020> enough

now even the ball is going fast enough

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.270 
now even the ball is going fast enough

the<00:04:59.150> artifacts<00:04:59.660> just<00:05:00.230> it's<00:05:01.010> just<00:05:01.100> not<00:05:01.310> gonna

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
the artifacts just it's just not gonna

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.670 
the artifacts just it's just not gonna
be<00:05:01.790> usable<00:05:02.240> for<00:05:02.270> anything<00:05:02.690> like<00:05:03.290> high<00:05:03.620> quality

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
be usable for anything like high quality

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.070 
be usable for anything like high quality
and<00:05:04.430> that's<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.330> reason<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:05.630> do<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.810> lot<00:05:05.990> of

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
and that's the reason I do a lot of

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.600 
and that's the reason I do a lot of
these<00:05:06.169> tests<00:05:06.560> in<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.710> first<00:05:06.890> place<00:05:07.190> is<00:05:07.400> just

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
these tests in the first place is just

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.130 
these tests in the first place is just
kind<00:05:07.820> of<00:05:07.850> get<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.030> general<00:05:08.480> idea<00:05:08.540> of<00:05:08.870> what<00:05:09.050> I'm

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
kind of get a general idea of what I'm

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.840 
kind of get a general idea of what I'm
going<00:05:09.320> to<00:05:09.380> expect<00:05:09.770> when<00:05:09.919> I<00:05:09.950> actually<00:05:10.160> go<00:05:10.610> and

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
going to expect when I actually go and

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.310 
going to expect when I actually go and
try<00:05:11.419> and<00:05:11.510> do<00:05:11.600> something<00:05:11.840> that's<00:05:12.140> gonna<00:05:12.230> make

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
try and do something that's gonna make

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.120 
try and do something that's gonna make
me<00:05:12.590> some<00:05:12.770> money

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.570 

so<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:18.220> last<00:05:18.340> video<00:05:18.490> we<00:05:18.760> have<00:05:19.090> for<00:05:20.050> 10%<00:05:21.040> is<00:05:21.370> the

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
so the last video we have for 10% is the

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.540 
so the last video we have for 10% is the
optical<00:05:22.030> flow<00:05:22.270> of<00:05:22.600> my<00:05:23.380> kittycat<00:05:23.860> nightmare

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
optical flow of my kittycat nightmare

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.640 
optical flow of my kittycat nightmare
and<00:05:24.910> he's<00:05:25.330> once<00:05:25.600> again<00:05:25.720> he's<00:05:26.050> not<00:05:26.230> walking<00:05:26.380> all

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
and he's once again he's not walking all

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.010 
and he's once again he's not walking all
that<00:05:26.830> fast<00:05:27.100> but<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.880> would<00:05:28.060> literally<00:05:28.480> think

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
that fast but you would literally think

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.060 
that fast but you would literally think
that<00:05:29.260> he<00:05:29.530> was<00:05:29.680> time<00:05:30.460> warping<00:05:31.230> it's<00:05:32.230> just<00:05:32.440> it's

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
that he was time warping it's just it's

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.860 
that he was time warping it's just it's
just<00:05:33.160> horrible<00:05:33.520> this<00:05:33.730> could<00:05:33.970> never<00:05:34.300> ever<00:05:34.630> see

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
just horrible this could never ever see

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.470 
just horrible this could never ever see
the<00:05:34.990> light<00:05:35.140> of<00:05:35.170> day<00:05:35.410> for<00:05:35.620> our<00:05:36.430> client<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:37.060> guess

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
the light of day for our client I guess

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.060 
the light of day for our client I guess
unless<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:38.080> were<00:05:38.170> actually<00:05:38.320> going<00:05:38.740> for<00:05:38.980> that

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
unless you were actually going for that

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.700 
unless you were actually going for that
effect<00:05:39.430> then<00:05:39.910> Final<00:05:40.360> Cut<00:05:40.510> Pro<00:05:40.780> 10<00:05:40.990> has<00:05:41.350> this

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
effect then Final Cut Pro 10 has this

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:53.590 
effect then Final Cut Pro 10 has this
thing<00:05:41.950> on<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.280> lock

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.390 

finally<00:05:54.380> I<00:05:54.410> decided<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:55.070> try<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:55.340> do

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
finally I decided to try and do

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.560 
finally I decided to try and do
something<00:05:55.610> a<00:05:55.700> little<00:05:55.790> bit<00:05:56.000> different<00:05:56.330> I<00:05:56.360> tried

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
something a little bit different I tried

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.450 
something a little bit different I tried
to<00:05:56.690> you<00:05:56.870> go<00:05:57.230> all<00:05:57.440> the<00:05:57.590> way<00:05:57.680> down<00:05:57.860> to<00:05:58.130> two

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
to you go all the way down to two

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.300 
to you go all the way down to two
percent<00:05:58.970> using<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.990> frame<00:06:00.230> blend<00:06:00.530> to<00:06:00.890> see<00:06:01.070> if

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
percent using the frame blend to see if

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.180 
percent using the frame blend to see if
it<00:06:01.430> was<00:06:01.550> gonna<00:06:01.670> be<00:06:01.910> at<00:06:02.240> all<00:06:02.510> worth<00:06:02.780> it<00:06:03.050> a<00:06:03.650> lot<00:06:04.160> of

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
it was gonna be at all worth it a lot of

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.080 
it was gonna be at all worth it a lot of
ghosting<00:06:04.730> a<00:06:04.790> lot<00:06:05.120> of<00:06:05.240> artifacting<00:06:05.960> this<00:06:06.470> just

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
ghosting a lot of artifacting this just

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.390 
ghosting a lot of artifacting this just
it's<00:06:08.090> just<00:06:08.210> not<00:06:08.570> gonna<00:06:08.720> work<00:06:08.810> and<00:06:09.350> no<00:06:10.250> matter

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
it's just not gonna work and no matter

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.860 
it's just not gonna work and no matter
how<00:06:10.640> much<00:06:10.850> I<00:06:11.270> tried<00:06:12.070> to<00:06:13.240> play<00:06:14.240> around<00:06:14.480> with<00:06:14.630> the

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
how much I tried to play around with the

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.400 
how much I tried to play around with the
frame<00:06:15.530> blending<00:06:16.240> compressing<00:06:17.240> it<00:06:17.410> expanding

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
frame blending compressing it expanding

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.080 
frame blending compressing it expanding
whether<00:06:19.100> it<00:06:19.220> was<00:06:19.310> ten<00:06:19.520> percent<00:06:19.850> or<00:06:19.940> two

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
whether it was ten percent or two

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.480 
whether it was ten percent or two
percent<00:06:20.120> or<00:06:20.600> whatever<00:06:20.900> it<00:06:21.290> just<00:06:21.470> never<00:06:22.010> seemed

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
percent or whatever it just never seemed

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.290 
percent or whatever it just never seemed
to<00:06:22.610> really<00:06:23.060> flow<00:06:23.510> like<00:06:24.170> you<00:06:24.350> would<00:06:24.500> see<00:06:25.180> in<00:06:26.180> a

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
to really flow like you would see in a

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.140 
to really flow like you would see in a
lot<00:06:26.510> of<00:06:26.540> like<00:06:27.190> romantic<00:06:28.190> movies<00:06:28.580> or<00:06:28.880> slow

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
lot of like romantic movies or slow

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.350 
lot of like romantic movies or slow
motion<00:06:29.660> scenes<00:06:29.960> and<00:06:30.350> those<00:06:30.850> bullet<00:06:31.850> time<00:06:32.090> the

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
motion scenes and those bullet time the

motion scenes and those bullet time the
whole<00:06:32.600> thing<00:06:32.930> it<00:06:33.080> just<00:06:33.110> never<00:06:33.560> seemed<00:06:33.860> to<00:06:33.890> look

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
whole thing it just never seemed to look

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.760 
whole thing it just never seemed to look
like<00:06:34.310> any<00:06:34.490> of<00:06:34.580> that<00:06:36.790> even<00:06:37.790> here<00:06:38.330> with<00:06:38.770> miry

timing this with optical flow at two

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.730 
timing this with optical flow at two
percent<00:06:43.040> you<00:06:43.340> can<00:06:44.060> see<00:06:44.300> that<00:06:44.510> the<00:06:44.750> the<00:06:45.260> warping

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
percent you can see that the the warping

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.080 
percent you can see that the the warping
is<00:06:45.980> just<00:06:46.820> unbearable<00:06:48.490> even<00:06:49.490> a<00:06:49.550> two<00:06:49.730> percent

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
is just unbearable even a two percent

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.570 
is just unbearable even a two percent
giving<00:06:50.570> it<00:06:50.830> making<00:06:51.830> it<00:06:51.920> as<00:06:52.040> slow<00:06:52.280> as<00:06:52.460> it

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
giving it making it as slow as it

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.830 
giving it making it as slow as it
possible<00:06:53.030> giving<00:06:53.270> it<00:06:53.360> plenty<00:06:53.420> of<00:06:53.660> time<00:06:53.810> to

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
possible giving it plenty of time to

possible giving it plenty of time to
kind<00:06:54.140> of<00:06:54.170> figure<00:06:54.320> out<00:06:54.560> you<00:06:55.190> know<00:06:55.220> where<00:06:55.550> the

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
kind of figure out you know where the

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.270 
kind of figure out you know where the
foot<00:06:56.420> is<00:06:56.660> gonna<00:06:56.780> be<00:06:57.020> next<00:06:57.380> in<00:06:57.710> what<00:06:57.890> direction

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
foot is gonna be next in what direction

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.070 
foot is gonna be next in what direction
it's<00:06:58.580> gonna<00:06:58.730> land<00:06:58.970> I<00:06:59.210> just<00:06:59.660> don't<00:06:59.900> really

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
it's gonna land I just don't really

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.880 
it's gonna land I just don't really
understand<00:07:00.980> the<00:07:01.430> whole<00:07:01.580> thing<00:07:01.610> so<00:07:02.890> that's

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:03.890 
understand the whole thing so that's

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.430 
understand the whole thing so that's
what<00:07:04.190> I've<00:07:04.310> got<00:07:04.580> and<00:07:04.970> I'm<00:07:05.360> a<00:07:05.390> sound<00:07:06.200> a<00:07:06.320> little

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 
what I've got and I'm a sound a little

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.710 
what I've got and I'm a sound a little
bit<00:07:06.680> defeated<00:07:07.010> Donna<00:07:07.430> I<00:07:07.760> really<00:07:08.300> do<00:07:08.450> and
