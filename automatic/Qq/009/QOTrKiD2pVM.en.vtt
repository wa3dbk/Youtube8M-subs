 by hans biebelrieder 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.060
 let nature be nature 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.989
 that means the expiring natural ones 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.629
 processes in the national park notwithstanding 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.659
 its kind of useful or useful 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.609
 harmful is to be granted 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.810
 ultimately nature around itself 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.810
 willing to love 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.720

 Forest scientist and ecologist aldo 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.350
 leopold once got it right 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.600
 Formulated a country may only then 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.050
 as cultivated and civilized 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:09.910
 If it's his wilderness enough 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:12.730
 the manager gives importance to this 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.460
 Forest Director Karl Friedrich Sinner is 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.040
 since 1998 head of the 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.630
 national park administration 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.350
 He explains the philosophy of 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.740
 national park thought of the forest in 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.980
 National Park is something very special 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.790
 his forest in which the interests of the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.890
 people at the production of wood 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.370
 no longer play a role 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:44.050
 in the trees all the others plant all 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.630
 animals that live in this forest 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.900
 can be born to die 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.770
 can settle on their own 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.410
 Basically the freedom is taken 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.200
 all living in national park through this 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.910
 Decision here forestry 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.010
 not to work any more the forest 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.750
 taken to shape our picture 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.510
 it has been one at the same time 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.360
 invitation to the people at this 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.880
 freedom to participate in theirs 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.070
 To listen to listeners as immense 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.609
 diverse and exciting 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.760
 The forest as a natural phenomenon is because 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.910
 now suddenly contains all ages 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.860
 all the structures all colors all 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.050
 form again in his response to the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.950
 can give to visiting people 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.230
 the original forests were alone 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.360
 the idea that at the 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.010
 dead trees if they are then 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.850
 break off every broken edge so individually 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.220
 structured is like the fingerprint 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.220
 of every human and that one 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.690
 individuality this variety of forms one 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.540
 abundance of different habitats 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.440
 means that colors 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.080
 Apparently they are otherwise in 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.410
 forests do not find from the dark 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.730
 orange-red freshly broken trees 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.540
 gradual decomposition gear to one 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:12.890

 Fruit on the stems in their 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.680
 different color and shape 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.340
 Algae weave these habitats 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.920
 use 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.320
 and in between in the light and 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.060
 sunspots through those rich 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.480
 natural texture of the forest 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.360

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.950
 an adolescent young forest the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.500
 possibility for light loving plants 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.330
 for flower plants their existence too 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.080
 find and now turn 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.690
 various insect species 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.400
 habitat to offer this infinite 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.120
 Many little things actually do 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.550
 the fascination of national park forest without 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.810
 human control and shape 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.810
