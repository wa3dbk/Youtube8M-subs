00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.310
 to put sweets 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.010
 remembering that you can adapt to the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.980
 idea is to use the monde to 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.510
 any theme and party that will stay 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.460
 super cool too 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.290
 So let's go to the materials that we 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.210
 We'll need to do this. 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.690

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.030
 twitter to make the link go 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.610

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.650
 common treasure for barbecue for 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.960
 risk the mold the hot tail for 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.390
 paste we can also use glue 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.670
 and here is a definition of the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.010
 adhesive strip to take off from 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.190

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.500
 cool receive the hill does not care and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.320
 in most stationery stores nowadays 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.700
 trying is not so difficult to spend just one 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.590
 little more expensive than the event is 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.760
 traditional 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:31.060
 let's go to the mount to mount 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.010
 That's what we 're going to start yet. 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.380
 in the video description by accessing the link 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.510
 that I'll leave the application for 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.750
 access the module that these three 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.330
 matches here is this one down 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.150
 I will also leave the mold of this part 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.130
 here below you can do so or 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.229
 so two options 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.170
 this here in case we will do with 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.920
 these snowflakes below 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.090
 the blog I'm going to print will cut and go 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.320
 pass a mold to read a lot of 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.080
 barbecue 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.690
 You put a hat on the line. 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.679
 share barbecue after you come 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.620
 with the scissors and will cut and there is always 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.870
 a tip for you and remembering without 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.689
 stand up too much the scissors event 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.879
 It will be treasure you've been a year and 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.459
 not get full of burrs but this with 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.579
 time you will see the notion of 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.340
 that as the practice occurs in your web the 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:33.359
 get much better after you've already 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.120
 reported these parts and the margins of here 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.980
 the page so they are two faith 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.480
 inches wide by 30 inches 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.040
 length also leave the inscription 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.439
 which is the part of the alcine there we go 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.750
 take this part here that is below the 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.669
 basket and let's start putting together 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.939
 our esteem give us a little 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.889
 school well in're tip you make 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.939
 hot stop or betting on what 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.430
 you are using 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:03.629
 and here they were not impressed to hold a 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 little for that barry who in the 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.430
 we'll do it until the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.980
 end of stones 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.290
 let's press and hold 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.729
 to form the watch here is 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.569
 This one from here I'm leaving the most 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.840
 Shorty like this to get better just from 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.609
 aquidauana 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.579
 but if you want it will be a little bit 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.949
 You 've got to come down here and give a 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.169
 cut even further 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:32.669
 I'm not going to cut this much out of here. 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.109
 I want her to stay on the fringes of 1 and 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:40.909
 more open 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.909
 so I'll go and stick it just on the tip 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.360
 now the staff is already assembled from 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:16.570
 from the basket now we'll paste here 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:20.019
 on top of that major focus here we go 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:30.870
 pass some hot glue on the bottom 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:30.870
 the Xuxinha evans roll 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.060
 Look how simple it is now, folks, we 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.730
 Let's make from the alsim that we 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:48.870
 Let's do this, let's get this part 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:51.900
 people cut with the decorative scissors and 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.600
 we paste the means for a contrast in 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.600
 handle that's pretty cool thing if you merge 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:04.320
 so in this way and we will go to pay 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.620
 in this part here and there on the 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.620
 work 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.620
 Ó portal and zezinho here and this one from here 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.780
 I 'll paste it to the side of 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.820
 inside is that the goalkeeper not from outside the 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.630
 zone that chocolate here by the side of 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.430
 inside 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:42.270
 I think it will be soft there I will 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:45.250
 pass a little glue on the eaves 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.830
 is to realize if you think so much cause 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.540
 big and I particularly do not like 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.440
 high is too big I'm going to cut a 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.530
 piece 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:59.980
 Only I think that with the smaller handle stays 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:02.920
 more delicate passes school faster 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.610
 here o 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.670
 Now, let's choose a side. 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:19.290
 Do you think it's cooler to be the one? 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:19.290
 face to face or snow launé 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.640
 take a road I'll just lay 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.080
 here in the middle 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.970
 logically I think that's cool 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.860
 now let's not put some 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.090

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:46.700
 blue balls here it was really cool to have 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.640
 this option also for you to make the pasta 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.920
 It starts from here and you see I like 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.930
 You're going to be super cool. 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.990
