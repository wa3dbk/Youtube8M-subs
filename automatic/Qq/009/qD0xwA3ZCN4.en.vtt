00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.230
 the mito and the city of alpha 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.610
 competing clio or 208 available 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 only in 3 doors it was launched 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.320
 in 2008 and underwent a restyling in 2013 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.430
 alpha has evolved the range this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.080
 year also with developments 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.970
 engine and the arrival of the double box 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.830
 clutch tct on the sports version 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.910
 vintage this one is moreover moreover 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 available in manual gearbox 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.359
 the mito cuvée is rather discreet 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.949
 but can be recognized by his badges 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.720
 specific its red brake calipers 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 or his specific rear bumper 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.090
 our test model was entitled in addition 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.950
 to optional 18-inch wheels at 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.270
 the interior little customization by 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.620
 compared to other mitos if not a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.450
 four leaf clover in the center of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.410
 combined instruments but especially 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.760
 seats with good lateral support 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.170
 specific 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.030
 the presentation is correct without more 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.260
 and a little sad the equipment includes 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.149
 the essential but the automatic ignition 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.829
 headlights the rain sensor or the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.239
 reversing radar are optional even at this 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.680
 range level at the back 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.079
 livability is in the average of the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 category no longer the trunk him is a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.960
 slightly below average and suffers 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.780
 especially of a loading threshold too 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.189
 top 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.540
 with 170 horses under the hood in 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.979
 this city is in the presence of a 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.630
 little sportswoman 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.189
 however the mito cuvée accuses a small 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 power deficit vis-à-vis 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.450
 customers and rest 108 gti at the fiesta st 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.490
 so is a little less comfortable with the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.380
 chrono even if this version tct wins 2 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.360
 tenths to 0 to 100 relative to the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.799
 manual box the box seems a little 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
 hesitant sometimes but becomes more 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.340
 convincing when you spend the dna 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.890
 on like the dynamic accelerator 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.420
 then becomes sensitive but we get used 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.409
 note that the sp is not disconnectable 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.100
 which seems amazing considering the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.100
 sports positioning 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.050
 chassis side our car with wheels 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.580
 18 inches was firm in 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.890
 counterpart it took only a few 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.510
 roll noted significant losses of 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.100
 motricity in the wet in a straight line 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.660
 is paradoxically a better 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 wheel traction wheeled thanks to 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.350
 the intervention of the q2 system so 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.860
 self-locking but not electronic 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.979
 mechanical 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.840
 budget side to 24 1990 euros this mito 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.670
 is just below the clio rs at 208 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.680
 gti is a bit more expensive than the fiesta 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.300
 but his three rivals are more 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.520
 efficient and effective while being 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.570
 better equipped in return the mito 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.570
 is the most sober of the lot
