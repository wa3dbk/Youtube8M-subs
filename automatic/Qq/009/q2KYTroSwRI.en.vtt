I mean you've really mixed it up again I
think<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.350> time<00:02:19.680> around<00:02:19.950> with<00:02:20.190> making<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
think this time around with making the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.060 
think this time around with making the
celebrities<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.660> much<00:02:21.900> more<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.560> know<00:02:22.650> dummy

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070

around<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.550> big<00:02:23.700> group<00:02:24.000> say<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.540> has<00:02:24.720> it's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
around the big group say it has it's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.810 
around the big group say it has it's
been<00:02:25.230> tougher<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> think<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.100> theory<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.610> had

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
been tougher I think this theory it had

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.910 
been tougher I think this theory it had
and<00:02:27.120> also<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> final<00:02:27.959> we've<00:02:28.770> got
