then check engine light comes on so I
get<00:00:19.289> home<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.710> pull<00:00:19.920> up<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> code<00:00:20.250> kind<00:00:21.029> of

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
get home and I pull up the code kind of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.429 
get home and I pull up the code kind of
find<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> misfire<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.020> cylinder

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
find out it's a misfire on cylinder

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.029 
find out it's a misfire on cylinder
seven<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:24.109> go<00:00:25.109> out<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.529> spend<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> money

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
seven so I go out and I spend the money

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
seven so I go out and I spend the money
on<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> plugs<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.330> wires<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
on on the plugs on the wires on the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160 
on on the plugs on the wires on the
distributor<00:00:29.099> cap<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> rotor<00:00:30.210> all<00:00:30.869> eight

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
distributor cap on the rotor all eight

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.470 
distributor cap on the rotor all eight
new<00:00:31.320> injectors<00:00:31.830> give<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> hook<00:00:32.730> back<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:32.969> put

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
new injectors give a hook back up put

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.530 
new injectors give a hook back up put
back<00:00:33.510> together<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:35.030> start<00:00:36.030> driving<00:00:36.300> down<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
back together and start driving down the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180 
back together and start driving down the
road<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.870> immediately<00:00:37.530> starts<00:00:37.800> misfiring

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
road and immediately starts misfiring

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.110 
road and immediately starts misfiring
again<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.480> back<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> square<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:41.120> back

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
again so I was back to square one back

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.360 
again so I was back to square one back
to<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> drawing<00:00:42.420> board<00:00:42.770> it's<00:00:43.770> more<00:00:44.010> research

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
to the drawing board it's more research

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.680 
to the drawing board it's more research
and<00:00:44.579> come<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.820> find<00:00:44.879> out<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.239> could<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and come to find out it could be this a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.619 
and come to find out it could be this a
crankshaft<00:00:46.500> position<00:00:46.680> sensor<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.629> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
crankshaft position sensor and the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.299 
crankshaft position sensor and the
location<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.770> paying<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
location of it is not paying the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.209 
location of it is not paying the
ass<00:00:50.430> basically<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:52.020> everybody<00:00:52.350> saying<00:00:52.620> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
ass basically and everybody saying you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.970 
ass basically and everybody saying you
know<00:00:53.340> how<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:55.469> underneath<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
know how to get to it up underneath the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.660 
know how to get to it up underneath the
engines<00:00:56.309> best<00:00:56.699> way<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:58.280> couldn't<00:00:59.280> find<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
engines best way so I couldn't find it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
engines best way so I couldn't find it
from<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.910> underneath<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> engine<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.780> had<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
from up underneath the engine I had to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.619 
from up underneath the engine I had to
basically<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.430> best<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.239> found<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
basically the best way that I found to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.450 
basically the best way that I found to
get<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> off<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.589> should<00:01:05.010> kind<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.339> be

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
get it off and really should kind of be

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
get it off and really should kind of be
the<00:01:05.580> only<00:01:05.820> way<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> take<00:01:06.540> off<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.869> tire

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the only way is to take off your tire

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.399 
the only way is to take off your tire
and<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.530> fender<00:01:07.860> well<00:01:08.040> because<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:10.200> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and your fender well because it is it is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
and your fender well because it is it is
a<00:01:10.439> lot<00:01:10.650> easier<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.070> honestly<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.520> could<00:01:11.700> even

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
a lot easier I honestly I could even

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.609 
a lot easier I honestly I could even
find<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.360> from<00:01:12.479> underneath<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> engine<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
find it from underneath the engine so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.850 
find it from underneath the engine so
basically<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.520> at

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
basically where it's at

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.020 
basically where it's at
there<00:01:16.860> were<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> line<00:01:17.400> at<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
there were in the line at and I'm on the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.429 
there were in the line at and I'm on the
passenger<00:01:18.390> side<00:01:20.210> get<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:22.259> your

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
passenger side get up in here get your

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.310 
passenger side get up in here get your
eye<00:01:22.590> angle<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.130> right<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.670> see

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
eye angle just right so you can see

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.800 
eye angle just right so you can see
there<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.439> go<00:01:26.360> right<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.689> your

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
there we go right here is your

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.149 
there we go right here is your
transmission<00:01:28.259> your<00:01:28.799> bail<00:01:28.979> housing<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.840> then

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
where I've already taken it off because

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.630 
where I've already taken it off because
they<00:01:36.930> need<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.200> replaced<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.460> here

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
they need to be replaced and right here

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880 
they need to be replaced and right here
is<00:01:38.729> where<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.150> bolt<00:01:39.329> will<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.650> right<00:01:40.650> here's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
is where one bolt will be right here's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.109 
is where one bolt will be right here's
where<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> other<00:01:41.250> bolt<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.880> then

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
where the other bolt will be and then

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.830 
where the other bolt will be and then
it'll<00:01:42.299> fit<00:01:42.509> right<00:01:42.540> down<00:01:42.720> inside<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> hole

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
it'll fit right down inside this hole

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.770
