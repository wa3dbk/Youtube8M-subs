any<00:02:37.630> follow-up<00:02:37.930> ok<00:02:38.340> that's<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.580> alright<00:02:40.090> so

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
any follow-up ok that's it alright so

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.640 
any follow-up ok that's it alright so
the<00:02:40.720> idea<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.170> we<00:02:42.130> have<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.400> change<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the idea is that we have to change the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.470 
the idea is that we have to change the
the<00:02:44.650> defense<00:02:45.069> of<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> King<00:02:45.580> side<00:02:45.849> here<00:02:46.120> before

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
the defense of the King side here before

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.780 
the defense of the King side here before
we<00:02:46.630> have<00:02:46.870> before<00:02:47.709> we're<00:02:48.010> presented<00:02:48.459> with<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
we have before we're presented with the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.030 
we have before we're presented with the
the<00:02:49.030> checkmate<00:02:49.420> combination<00:02:50.049> these<00:02:50.349> before

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
the checkmate combination these before

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.030 
the checkmate combination these before
we<00:02:51.130> can<00:02:51.280> execute<00:02:51.549> our<00:02:51.790> idea<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:53.680> saw<00:02:53.859> it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
we can execute our idea so I just saw it

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.599 
we can execute our idea so I just saw it
and<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.310> idea<00:02:54.670> is<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:57.359> again<00:02:58.359> we<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.720> this

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
and the idea is a again we have this

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.860 
and the idea is a again we have this
confused<00:03:00.609> attraction<00:03:01.299> it<00:03:01.420> sounds<00:03:01.630> like<00:03:01.720> that

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
confused attraction it sounds like that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.680 
confused attraction it sounds like that
could<00:03:01.900> be<00:03:02.049> like<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.680> good<00:03:03.190> movie<00:03:03.640> not<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.420> kind

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
could be like a good movie not that kind

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.420 
could be like a good movie not that kind
of<00:03:04.750> movie<00:03:05.049> alright<00:03:05.620> we're<00:03:05.799> not<00:03:05.920> talking<00:03:06.310> about

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
of movie alright we're not talking about

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.370 
of movie alright we're not talking about
that<00:03:06.700> I'm<00:03:06.910> talking<00:03:06.940> about<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.870> know<00:03:07.959> a<00:03:07.989> movie

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
that I'm talking about you know a movie

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.170 
that I'm talking about you know a movie
about<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.950> know<00:03:09.069> someone<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:09.549> know<00:03:09.790> coming

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
about you know someone you know coming

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.870 
about you know someone you know coming
of<00:03:10.299> age<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.840> chess<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.799> their<00:03:11.920> struggles<00:03:12.220> to

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
of age in chess and their struggles to

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.729 
of age in chess and their struggles to
clarify<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.540> difference<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:14.230> tactics

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
clarify the difference in tactics

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.930 
clarify the difference in tactics
between<00:03:15.130> decoy<00:03:15.840> deflection<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.079> attraction

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
between decoy deflection and attraction

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.750 
between decoy deflection and attraction
so<00:03:18.940> uh<00:03:21.600> anyway<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.040> think<00:03:24.489> this<00:03:24.639> is

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
so uh anyway the I think this is

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.660 
so uh anyway the I think this is
actually<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.209> decoy<00:03:25.720> because<00:03:26.709> after<00:03:27.130> Queen<00:03:27.549> to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
actually a decoy because after Queen to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.180 
actually a decoy because after Queen to
g5<00:03:28.000> check<00:03:28.359> f<00:03:28.569> takes<00:03:28.930> g5<00:03:29.380> we're<00:03:29.650> not<00:03:29.799> getting<00:03:30.130> a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
g5 check f takes g5 we're not getting a

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.979 
g5 check f takes g5 we're not getting a
tactic<00:03:30.549> against<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.000> particular<00:03:31.269> pond<00:03:31.720> so

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
tactic against the particular pond so

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.710 
tactic against the particular pond so
it's<00:03:32.139> not<00:03:32.260> an<00:03:32.350> attraction<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.720> deflection

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
it's not an attraction and deflection

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.270 
it's not an attraction and deflection
normally<00:03:34.989> implies<00:03:35.200> you're<00:03:35.470> sort<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:35.829> removing

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
normally implies you're sort of removing

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.680 
normally implies you're sort of removing
a<00:03:36.340> defender<00:03:36.790> you're<00:03:36.940> deflecting<00:03:37.120> something

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
a defender you're deflecting something

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.440 
a defender you're deflecting something
away<00:03:37.989> in<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.650> case<00:03:38.859> but<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.180> this<00:03:40.269> case

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
away in this case but but in this case

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.309 
away in this case but but in this case
maybe<00:03:40.720> not<00:03:40.989> maybe<00:03:41.200> maybe<00:03:41.590> maybe<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.290> a

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
maybe not maybe maybe maybe it is a

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.720 
maybe not maybe maybe maybe it is a
deflection<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:44.950> don't<00:03:45.160> know<00:03:45.220> but<00:03:45.400> here's<00:03:45.579> the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
deflection I don't know but here's the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.400 
deflection I don't know but here's the
idea<00:03:45.850> we're<00:03:46.480> going<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:46.660> play<00:03:46.780> Queen<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.109> g5

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
idea we're going to play Queen to g5

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.770 
idea we're going to play Queen to g5
check<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:47.950> after<00:03:48.130> he<00:03:48.220> takes<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.700> now<00:03:48.940> nitey<00:03:49.269> h6

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
check and after he takes it now nitey h6

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.780 
check and after he takes it now nitey h6
check<00:03:50.049> puts<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.500> King<00:03:50.709> on<00:03:50.829> h8<00:03:51.160> which<00:03:51.370> opens<00:03:51.700> up

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
check puts the King on h8 which opens up

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.270 
check puts the King on h8 which opens up
the<00:03:51.910> possibility<00:03:52.660> for<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.410> knockout<00:03:53.829> blow<00:03:53.889> can

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
the possibility for a knockout blow can

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.179 
the possibility for a knockout blow can
you<00:03:54.370> see<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.670> Bishop<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.750> be<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.079> check<00:03:56.350> putting

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
you see it Bishop to be to check putting

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.619 
you see it Bishop to be to check putting
your<00:03:57.310> bishop<00:03:57.580> on<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.819> diagonal<00:03:58.120> should<00:03:58.540> be

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
your bishop on the diagonal should be

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.449 
your bishop on the diagonal should be
enough<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.590> us<00:03:59.769> there's<00:03:59.980> something<00:04:00.250> after

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
enough so of us there's something after

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.920 
enough so of us there's something after
Queen<00:04:00.580> g5<00:04:00.879> check<00:04:01.090> i'm<00:04:01.209> missing<00:04:01.540> with<00:04:01.629> king<00:04:01.810> of
