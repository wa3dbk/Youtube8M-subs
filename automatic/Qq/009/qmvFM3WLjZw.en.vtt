00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.490
 to work with a scientist 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.750
 crippled who desperately sought the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.520

 the magic formula 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.050
 extraordinary how did you come to this 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.850

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.840
 new hope of power at hand 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.770
 right here by that at the base it's 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.160
 right-handed so it's still a 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.160
 beautiful adaptation 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.200

 retouching and that's what estimated 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.020
 touched brief a not much I 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.190

 nothing extravagant is good sometimes the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.030
 life reserves good surprises or 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.030
 bad 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.160
 so the guy goes looking for 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.030
 all the guys they have meaning for 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.160
 have a copy 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.120
 he has a star tattoo on the wrist 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.620

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.120
 that the star was on the wrist I 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.230
 know it's not obvious check but 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.110
 guys a star on the penis so 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.670
 like that you do not know but here we go in 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.650
 the excessiveness his powers are cool 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.850
 very good but it is to pose everything except 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.900
 nice it's funny because I 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.910
 did not think at first you see now 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.900
 I can no longer spend 7 inches either 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.300

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.050
 it's the guy reigned we have not yet 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.280
 stuck but we'll do it if I had 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.450
 wanted this thief to drag her over into 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.709
 the street long ago that he 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.209
 would no longer drive in the street to 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.040
