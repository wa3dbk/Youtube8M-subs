00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.870
 Paulo 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.000
 This beauty is yours in that it is 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.500
 so I had to get you king is like some 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 meet at the club 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.930
 this since everything we want 200 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.450
 depression and I'm going to make a regulation 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.220
 of valves in it now and as the 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.439
 procedure a lot of people do not know 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.950
 decided to take a step by step there to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.110
 You'll see how this works. 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.149
 I will not be able to do everything again. 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.190
 taking the same time, huh? 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.590
 anyway why the little show doing this 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.929
 here but I'll post on our easy steps 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.120
 to create in the videos and I'm joining 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.579
 After you see beauty. 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.879
 let's go by next to 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.879
 arm 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.190
 Good folks then coming back 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:58.530
 continuation of the video you can now 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.260
 see here I have already eliminated by the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 components that passed 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.720
 Above, he removed the cable from the accelerator. 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 be able to remove the lid quietly 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.820
 Injector hose or shoot cold 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.920
 here I just did not take the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.590
 fuel delivery hose 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.780
 because she is stuck with what he will be 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.759
 the neighbor who guarantees them and the grandson 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.909
 I want to break him but I think he'll give 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.799
 to remove without good without novelty 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 here we will need prass 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.880
 to remove this valve cap is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:37.799
 simple to do this regulation xavier 17 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.890
 on top is the little game of blades is not a 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.420
 a little difficulty anyway 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.439
 with the various settings of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.310
 valves and how I 'm going to do this 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.799
 job 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.649
 I want to do a good job, I'm going 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.250
 let go to the old ones too for this I go 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:03.030
 use a wrench 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:06.040
 He released them to check out pm 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.399
 which will be set top dead right nÃ© 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.480
 and sometimes irregular in correct and soon 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.850
 But I'll keep hugging 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.300
 Good guys, they're seeing it now. 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.740
 is further mounted depending 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.930
 But that's it, that's just for the benefit of what 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.800
 I already did p-sun thirÃ© cap of equal with 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.350
 others 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.930
 I dropped the valve, then remove the cap 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.070
 distributor's own 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.020
 point is that I do not know if you 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.980
 they will not be able to give to the flash 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.260
 is not connected 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.810
 but here if you pick up a 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.520
 for example they can already see 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.160
 hoplon of this option already here in 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.680
 top of being the people pm is higher 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.650
 Ok, so you see he's in the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:59.470
 point here the first cylinder doing 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.550
 this engine is 1 342 so here there are 13 42 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.489
 so we 're going to have to use this 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.890
 order to adjust the valves 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.480
 only then in case it would be a start showed 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.239
 on the first backside, right? 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:16.390
 a bonus for the 3 4 and 2 to 1 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.070
 the regulation of valves to see with the jet 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.860
 with the one on the first cylinder had 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.700
 regular cigarette with 25 looks 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.700
 Say that I already have 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.900
 Look, it may not sound like much. 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:40.720
 understood but one thing that works with 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.440
 0.15 0.10mm original to make 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.670
 a whore a difference 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.970
 something else you will need too 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.849
 who could only speak forgotten the key 19 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.250
 If I thought my old mother is fine. 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.130
 I thought you were going to put on the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.890
 down a spoon of the case's command 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.549
 in this human chain and will use 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:07.030
 turn the engine for you to do this 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.310
 Valve regulation rate is reminiscent of 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.380
 to disengage a car other than the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.349
 force in the exchange there goes forcefully in 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.229
 engine it will have increased it will not come 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:21.250
 and another thing the staff always turning 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:25.120
 clockwise so much beauty field 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.060
 let's go there for little over the next year 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.400
 now this is it 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.080
 the first cylinder only for 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.479
 You understand I do not know if you 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.530
 they could see the shape they had before 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.120
 To regulate, it 's just with music, it 's just 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.770
 from here 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.419
 a blade will not have any slack, right? 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:53.229
 but this one that I also already regulate 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:54.640
 which will be the dimension, the least one is 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.550
 that's right 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.490
 now who likes eggs 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.639
 It gives a lot of work gives a tired but it is a 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.830
 business has to do and it seems that 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.560
 this motor even more by 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.889
 sector after the vibration I think he lives 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.580
 where everything is general 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.210
 it regulates very easily had valves there 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.370
 that what moved her was completely 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:24.509
 loose and had some who were one 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.069
 normal return was set by 0 25 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.400
 I believe that this is why 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:31.710
 it was half a square of slow and 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.599
 a few small halters when 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.169
 changed gears and everything right 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.370
 now all the right things to do is just ride and 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.150
 catch fire 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:48.719
 It's a little easy video of him getting there. 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:51.270
 It was not only in mines that the 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:53.310
 flight or from the first departure now 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.840
 connects the throttle cable to a belt 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.840
 league without the tail month 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:49.210
 is we got good walk because 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:52.050
 That's probably what folks said and 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.050
 hugs
