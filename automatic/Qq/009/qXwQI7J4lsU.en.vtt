00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
i think that overall in the next five

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.790 
i think that overall in the next five
years<00:06:20.099> we<00:06:20.819> will<00:06:20.969> see<00:06:21.479> that<00:06:21.690> Raphael<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.319> Fabio

hopefully will be the finished article

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.769 
hopefully will be the finished article
and<00:06:24.810> there'll<00:06:25.590> be<00:06:25.620> a<00:06:25.740> great<00:06:26.310> asset<00:06:26.580> I<00:06:27.210> think<00:06:27.659> to

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
and there'll be a great asset I think to

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.180 
and there'll be a great asset I think to
the<00:06:27.900> team<00:06:28.139> if<00:06:28.349> they're<00:06:28.560> both<00:06:28.770> playing<00:06:29.490> on<00:06:29.669> each

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
the team if they're both playing on each

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.619 
the team if they're both playing on each
flanks<00:06:32.190> of<00:06:32.310> the<00:06:32.520> defense<00:06:32.909> because<00:06:33.210> they<00:06:33.360> bring

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:33.629 
flanks of the defense because they bring
