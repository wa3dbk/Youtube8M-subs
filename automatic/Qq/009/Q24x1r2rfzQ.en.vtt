now<00:00:05.810> let's<00:00:06.080> talk<00:00:06.350> about<00:00:06.560> IgE<00:00:07.399> antibodies<00:00:08.180> IgE

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
now let's talk about IgE antibodies IgE

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.840 
now let's talk about IgE antibodies IgE
antibodies<00:00:09.709> are<00:00:09.830> important<00:00:10.370> in<00:00:10.490> the<00:00:10.549> mucosal

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
antibodies are important in the mucosal

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.419 
antibodies are important in the mucosal
system<00:00:11.360> here<00:00:12.170> again<00:00:12.500> we<00:00:12.650> have<00:00:12.679> the<00:00:12.830> mucosal

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
system here again we have the mucosal

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.999 
system here again we have the mucosal
surfaces<00:00:13.880> epithelial<00:00:14.599> cells<00:00:14.870> and<00:00:15.170> here<00:00:15.889> of

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
surfaces epithelial cells and here of

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.389 
gut or the bronchus for example I
mentioned<00:00:28.970> before<00:00:29.540> that<00:00:29.770> the<00:00:30.770> plasma<00:00:31.009> cells

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
mentioned before that the plasma cells

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.220 
mentioned before that the plasma cells
become<00:00:31.669> activated<00:00:31.820> once<00:00:32.450> they<00:00:32.750> leave<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
mucosal system the dimeric form is when

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.329 
mucosal system the dimeric form is when
the<00:00:55.850> two<00:00:56.059> IgA<00:00:56.589> monomers<00:00:57.589> are<00:00:57.800> connected<00:00:58.249> to

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
the two IgA monomers are connected to

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.410 
the two IgA monomers are connected to
each<00:00:58.370> other<00:00:58.579> by<00:00:58.699> a<00:00:58.850> J<00:00:59.179> chain<00:00:59.739> however<00:01:01.059> if<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
each other by a J chain however if the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.960 
each other by a J chain however if the
IgA<00:01:02.839> is<00:01:02.929> -<00:01:03.140> created<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.739> blood<00:01:03.949> stream<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.580> iga

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
IgA is - created a blood stream the iga

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.850 
IgA is - created a blood stream the iga
is<00:01:05.120> usually<00:01:05.479> monomeric<00:01:05.960> just<00:01:06.350> one<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:06.740> them

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
is usually monomeric just one of them

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.280 
is usually monomeric just one of them
secreted<00:01:07.610> like<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:10.750> another<00:01:11.750> important<00:01:12.080> thing

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
secreted like so another important thing

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.750 
secreted like so another important thing
is<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.680> plasma<00:01:13.040> cells<00:01:13.220> are<00:01:13.340> not<00:01:13.430> usually

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
is that plasma cells are not usually

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.090 
is that plasma cells are not usually
found<00:01:14.000> in<00:01:14.270> inductive<00:01:14.900> sites<00:01:15.170> such<00:01:15.770> as<00:01:15.800> in<00:01:16.010> the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
found in inductive sites such as in the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.610 
found in inductive sites such as in the
gut<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.610> inductive<00:01:17.450> site<00:01:17.690> being<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.200> peyer's

gut the inductive site being the peyer's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.200 
gut the inductive site being the peyer's
patches<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.190> plasma<00:01:19.520> cells<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:19.790> not<00:01:19.910> really

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
patches so plasma cells are not really

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.590 
patches so plasma cells are not really
found<00:01:20.480> in<00:01:20.600> peyer's<00:01:20.930> patches<00:01:21.200> because<00:01:22.600> plasma

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
found in peyer's patches because plasma

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.970 
found in peyer's patches because plasma
cells<00:01:23.810> are<00:01:23.960> effective<00:01:24.410> cells<00:01:24.620> so<00:01:24.770> they<00:01:24.890> are

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
cells are effective cells so they are

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.220 
cells are effective cells so they are
usually<00:01:25.310> found<00:01:25.550> in<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.910> lamina<00:01:26.360> propria<00:01:26.390> with

gets induced to ties within the cell and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.520 
gets induced to ties within the cell and
then<00:02:13.969> expelled<00:02:14.629> out<00:02:14.840> into<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.680> lumen<00:02:15.829> and<00:02:16.299> now

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
then expelled out into the lumen and now

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.850 
then expelled out into the lumen and now
as<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:18.640> does<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.420> dimeric<00:02:19.990> IG<00:02:20.350> antibody

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.760 
as it does this the dimeric IG antibody
the<00:02:21.010> Jade<00:02:21.280> chain<00:02:21.550> takes<00:02:21.910> part<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:23.020> pigo

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
the Jade chain takes part of the pigo

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.500 
the Jade chain takes part of the pigo
receptor<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.200> forms<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.470> IgA<00:02:27.190> plus<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
receptor and forms I the IgA plus the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.190 
receptor and forms I the IgA plus the
secretory<00:02:29.140> component<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.390> now<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:31.630> have<00:02:31.930> many

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
secretory component so now we have many

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.070 
secretory component so now we have many
IgE<00:02:32.620> antibodies<00:02:33.310> within<00:02:33.550> lumen<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.660> what<00:02:34.930> do

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
IgE antibodies within lumen so what do

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.850 
IgE antibodies within lumen so what do
they<00:02:35.230> do<00:02:35.290> now<00:02:35.680> what<00:02:36.459> how<00:02:36.820> do<00:02:36.880> they<00:02:37.120> prevent

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
they do now what how do they prevent

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.040 
they do now what how do they prevent
antibodies<00:02:38.860> from<00:02:39.130> invading<00:02:39.490> or<00:02:39.990> causing<00:02:40.990> an

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.850 
infection within the mucosal surfaces
well<00:02:44.130> for<00:02:45.130> example<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:47.260> do<00:02:47.350> three<00:02:47.650> things

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
well for example you can do three things

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.490 
well for example you can do three things
if<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:49.000> have<00:02:49.090> antigen<00:02:49.540> pathogens<00:02:50.110> within<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
if we have antigen pathogens within the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.290 
if we have antigen pathogens within the

on these pathogens and antigens and

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.520 
on these pathogens and antigens and
neutralize<00:02:58.150> them<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:58.750> prevent<00:02:59.140> them<00:02:59.350> from

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
neutralize them so prevent them from

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.800 
neutralize them so prevent them from
invading<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:00.700> infiltrating<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.420> cell

bind to these antigens present here and

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.690 
bind to these antigens present here and
then<00:03:19.630> following<00:03:20.050> this<00:03:20.290> binding<00:03:20.770> on<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.070> P<00:03:21.280> IG

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
then following this binding on the P IG

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.870 
then following this binding on the P IG
are<00:03:21.910> our<00:03:22.739> receptor<00:03:23.739> on<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.920> basal<00:03:24.310> aspect<00:03:24.730> of

are our receptor on the basal aspect of

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.479 
are our receptor on the basal aspect of
the<00:03:25.090> cell<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.750> then<00:03:26.290> with<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.890> antigen<00:03:27.340> be

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
the cell and then with the antigen be

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.390 
the cell and then with the antigen be
transported<00:03:28.239> out<00:03:28.330> into<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.170> lumen<00:03:29.380> taking<00:03:30.280> up

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
transported out into the lumen taking up

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.449 
transported out into the lumen taking up
part<00:03:30.670> of<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.880> pigo<00:03:31.330> receptor<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.680> now<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.220> have

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
part of the pigo receptor so now we have

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.090 
part of the pigo receptor so now we have
the<00:03:36.580> IgA<00:03:37.049> plus<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.200> antigen<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.739> the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
the IgA plus the antigen and the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.390 
the IgA plus the antigen and the
security<00:03:39.610> component<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:41.230> what<00:03:41.890> happened<00:03:42.250> here

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
security component so what happened here

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.090 
security component so what happened here
so<00:03:42.549> IgA<00:03:43.060> can<00:03:43.570> export<00:03:44.049> passages<00:03:44.530> and<00:03:44.650> antigens

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
so IgA can export passages and antigens

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.979 
so IgA can export passages and antigens
out<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.700> lamina<00:03:46.030> propria<00:03:46.060> into<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> lumen

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
out of the lamina propria into the lumen

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.449 
out of the lamina propria into the lumen
and<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.940> final<00:03:49.360> thing<00:03:49.510> or<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:50.320> of<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.590> one<00:03:51.370> of

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
and the final thing or one of the one of

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.440 
and the final thing or one of the one of
the<00:03:51.549> other<00:03:51.790> main<00:03:52.060> things<00:03:52.329> i<00:03:52.660> j<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.260> j<00:03:53.400> g8

the other main things i j and j g8

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.660 
the other main things i j and j g8
antibodies<00:03:55.450> can<00:03:55.630> do<00:03:55.810> is<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:56.860> an<00:03:57.100> antigen

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
antibodies can do is that if an antigen

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.830 
antibodies can do is that if an antigen
has<00:03:58.120> infiltrated<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.440> cell<00:03:59.820> the<00:04:00.820> iga<00:04:01.180> antibody

cell that is that has been infiltrated

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.360 
cell that is that has been infiltrated
and<00:04:06.730> essentially<00:04:07.540> bind<00:04:08.350> with<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.799> antigen

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
and essentially bind with the antigen

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.039 
and essentially bind with the antigen
within<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.820> cell<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.180> then<00:04:10.390> transport<00:04:10.989> it

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
within the cell and then transport it

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.159 
within the cell and then transport it
out<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:13.510> number<00:04:13.780> three<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:15.190> iga<00:04:15.640> combined<00:04:16.299> and

out so number three the iga combined and

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.620 
out so number three the iga combined and
neutralize<00:04:17.709> an<00:04:18.010> antigen<00:04:18.970> in<00:04:19.120> within<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.780> cell

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
neutralize an antigen in within the cell

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.320 
neutralize an antigen in within the cell
so<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.780> concludes<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.729> these<00:04:24.729> videos<00:04:25.120> on

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
response in other areas such as if an

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.190 
response in other areas such as if an
immune<00:04:48.130> response<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.670> generated<00:04:49.300> within<00:04:49.510> the

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
immune response is generated within the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.890 
immune response is generated within the
nasal<00:04:50.410> cavity<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.670> nasal<00:04:51.910> mucosa<00:04:52.330> tract<00:04:52.750> it

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
nasal cavity the nasal mucosa tract it

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.570 
nasal cavity the nasal mucosa tract it
can<00:04:53.020> generate<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.560> same<00:04:53.740> immune<00:04:54.040> response<00:04:54.430> in

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
can generate the same immune response in

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.860 
can generate the same immune response in
the<00:04:54.670> vaginal<00:04:55.000> tract<00:04:55.300> of<00:04:55.420> the<00:04:55.480> gut

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
the vaginal tract of the gut

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.010 
the vaginal tract of the gut
so<00:04:56.410> therefore<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:57.160> can<00:04:57.400> create<00:04:57.970> both<00:04:58.720> any

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
so therefore it can create both any

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.540 
so therefore it can create both any
coastal<00:04:59.530> immune<00:04:59.800> response<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.250> also<00:05:00.430> a

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
coastal immune response and also a

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.100 
coastal immune response and also a
systemic<00:05:01.120> immune<00:05:01.270> response<00:05:01.630> which<00:05:01.780> is<00:05:01.870> very

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
systemic immune response which is very

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.410 
systemic immune response which is very
important<00:05:02.620> for<00:05:03.280> example<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.850> development<00:05:04.090> of

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
important for example the development of

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.570 
important for example the development of
vaccines
