00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
this is one of the best displays I have

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.210 
this is one of the best displays I have
seen<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.180> qhd<00:01:24.659> display<00:01:24.770> it's<00:01:25.770> five<00:01:25.979> point<00:01:26.189> two

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
seen for qhd display it's five point two

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.710 
seen for qhd display it's five point two
inches<00:01:26.689> PPS<00:01:27.689> about<00:01:27.990> 565<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.310> higher<00:01:29.640> than<00:01:29.720> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
inches PPS about 565 it's higher than I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.230 
inches PPS about 565 it's higher than I
believe<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.680> LG<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.189> Samsung<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.939> looks

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
believe the LG and Samsung it looks

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.330 
believe the LG and Samsung it looks
better<00:01:33.600> than<00:01:33.810> both<00:01:34.020> LG<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.650> Samsung<00:01:35.100> Note

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
better than both LG and Samsung Note

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.940 
better than both LG and Samsung Note
force<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> best

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
force some so I think is one of the best

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.050 
force some so I think is one of the best
display<00:01:38.310> you've<00:01:38.520> got<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> 2-megapixel

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
display you've got a 2-megapixel

think in that fashion so what version of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
think in that fashion so what version of
Android<00:02:02.969> does<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> run<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.869> runs<00:02:04.079> android<00:02:04.619> 4.4

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
