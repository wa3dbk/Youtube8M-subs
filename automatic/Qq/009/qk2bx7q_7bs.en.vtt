00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.570
 when a bird has a cold first 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.350
 you have to try to grab it if you let it 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:15.090
 true 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:17.590
 it's not something that is done to anyone 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.930
 it reassures you 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.700
 Let yourself have a little open piquito because 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.970
 you do not have you can not breathe well and 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.600
 also bites to start good what 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.849
 we grab without crushing, they are very 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.770
 sensitive and can drown you do not have to 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.390
 apechugar you have to measure the strength of 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:42.540
 the hands are very very delicate it 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.540
 he opens the little piquito and thus with this 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:51.510
 and you have to try endlessly there is way 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 well then it 's like that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.989
 I already grabbed it and is already taking it 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.989
 he closed the peak but he is already taking it 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.079
 I already gave him a drop 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.000
 I think tomorrow would be good another drop 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.909
 Now let's grab the other and what 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.350
 we saw that he already took it he has that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.030
 little bit red but he already took it 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.030
 now we go with the bold 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700
 topic 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.820
 Well, they have so many things about 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.630
 little girl 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.750
 berman 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.250
 with all delicacy because they have to 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.610
 measure the strength of the hands because 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.920
 they are very sensitive usually 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.950
 when they see something close to them they squeeze 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.990
 the peak and then what really I 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.990
 I do is put 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 a drop 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.280
 and if you are taking it 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.220
 how do i stay doubt 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.049
 I'm going to put the piquito again with 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.049
 Be careful already the vellum step 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.940
 he is already taking it 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.940
 there we are 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.260
 and it's going to be put in the water 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.000
 he says he gets it for two days 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.360
 six drops in the water where they are going to 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.950
 put three times 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.930
 a week 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.280
 ok then we are going to put 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:08.250
 six drops 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.250
 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.069
 we are going to cover it 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.069
 the water logically gets this dirty
