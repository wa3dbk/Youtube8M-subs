00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.980
 Y 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.990
 very good to all the kids 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.670
 welcome to a new video and today you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 I come to talk about a game that is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.410
 playing these days and what are you watching 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.169
 there in the background and it's the remastering of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 god of war 3 that many of you are thinking 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.439
 because it is at 3 because they have taken 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.149
 the 2000 to me do not ask me that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.529
 question is every sound but good for 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.210
 at least they have details of putting a 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.270
 kind of new intro that were not 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.040
 something that I remember and that you 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.210
 explains a little bit what happened in the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
 previous godos walker 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.039
 Well look well it comes to know a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.510
 little what happened if I did not waste them 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.430
 that for example in my case I just played 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.290
 to 3 in play 3 and now so I'm 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.300
 playing between 4 and now comes here the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.850
 atp the typical dilemma of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.130
 remastering is worth it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 Well, let's talk about the main one 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.060
 Novelty that has games that goes in 1080p 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.220
 natives in the 720p difference 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.899
 climates in fish and that instead of going to 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.480
 30 or 40 frames per second which is what 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 maximum that caught ampli 3 because this one goes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.520
 at 60 quite stable 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 and that's a big change yes because 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.960
 If it was another kind of game, it gives me a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.260
 little games like it but that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.620
 kind 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.390
 Cinnamon is super super important or at 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.740
 less for me to go as fluid 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.700
 possible for example I have tried the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.790
 mayón is 1 in play 3 and he can 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.530
 also 360 equipment and the difference 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 abysmal between 3 and you will have a photographer 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.180
 second and between 60 and 60 and the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.790
 difference was we proved overwhelming the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.080
 speed of the combos and everything I do not know no 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.220
 it's the same they do not have the same time of 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.320
 reaction for example to stretch a 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.630
 blow or things like that and it looks so 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.340
 so shocking so fast because they are all 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.890
 fast and the more fluid the faster 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.350
 it looks better then more news 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.660
 has therefore improvements in the textures some 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 lighting effect and a little more and a 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.990
 photo mode that the truth that is very 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.340
 cool if you like to throw pics and 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.080
 other than the truth is that one of the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.910
 things that I like the most to put in 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.830
 remastered because I love the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.720
 theme is to make photos do videos like this 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.680
 although this case I only know that taking pictures 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.810
 ok I can say is that it does not look very 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.569
 very very well actually goes through a game 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.249
 of play 4 perfectly 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.290
 is that we did not have it complicated because 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.819
 this one of peter would already be very very well of 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.230
 fact 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.689
 and there is that of piqué if you have not 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.950
 played the six videos of the game happens 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.299
 perfectly also for a game of 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.709
 play 4 because many play games 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.870
 four that are far below 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.660
 graphically than for example this mode 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.060
 bar gesta and vietnam 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.520
 and now comes the theme remastering yes 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.460
 or not so to see here I always say three 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.230
 mastering stuff not if you already 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.390
 you passed the game and you are not especially 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.310
 fan and you have still top lettres clear 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.570
 to play it so you have your play 3 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.240
 to play the game again 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.360
 Well, good splitter, you do not get 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.770
 it's worth it but if it says 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.810
 play you to buy the movie 4 what is it 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.360
 that you generally do many 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.670
 obviously you can not play it so 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.470
 it's good for you to have it in play 4 that 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.330
 it also looks better and moves better and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.040
 has all the rights included that 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.470
 I also forgot to say that all the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.700
 rights included and of course that has already 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.260
 been a strong point especially if 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.270
 we have in mind that the game is worth 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.070
 come on I've seen it by shop 35 euros no 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.320
 I mean stores these rare one 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.980
 moods like that but things like on average 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.500
 sea ​​and things like that I found it at 32 35 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.270
 euros that today is god of war is a price 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.100
 of the cibon we go and also that the game is 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.810
 very good and I say it involves what 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.040
 I enjoyed a lot and now between 4 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.840
 also enjoying a lot of fun though 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.990
 we have also finished but but the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.840
 waitress since it would always end 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.700
 the third thing that I always say is no 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.900
 we all had play 3 yo for example what 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.720
 I played because all of you that I 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.910
 they left for a year and a few 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.670
 games where the games that were 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.120
 knowing that more than that year because I was 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.040
 testing it but clear for example yes yes 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.960
 they take me out now because they're going to take us out 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.090
 lantzarte in quite the collection that 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.360
 are 1 on 2 and 3 of mastering and 4 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.250
 that I, 1 and 3, do not know, we play like that 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.330
 that I open luxury or is there a lot 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.490
 People who have many themes 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.110
 remasters and it's true that there 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.610
 companies that are accepting only one 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.320
 beer is traditions and we are going a new 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.030
 and that's really bad the company does 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.070
 new games and remasters of 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.200
 cojonudo old ccoo seems that 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.989
 There are many people who did not have the same 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.360
 had play 3 or play 2 or the console of the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.620
 that is the remastering and now 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.270
 they have the opportunity to play it and 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.790
 We said a lower price then 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.740
 and what problem is there I think I do not know 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.170
 it seems very good to me a good way of 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.330
 hook people to a saga that equal 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.850
 did not get it and that after trying it 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.170
 love it so for me to take out all 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.090
 the nuances whenever they are well 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.170
 made that they want in addition to actions 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.170
 they take them out and they go persie 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.450
 well everyone I have nothing more to tell 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.680
 because the truth that there are as accountants 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.970
 of god of war everything you can 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.440
 tell of gando war surely already what 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.690
 you know why sure to know the game 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.270
 and nothing I hope you liked the video 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.980
 you will tell me if you are interested in the game if 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.900
 you have 4 and he spends what I 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.120
 I advise you to get it especially for 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.370
 what I have said is reduced price and 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.620
 that's because it's very good and it's ultra 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.030
 epic is epic and if you can not 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.650
 things are always happening in plan 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.470
 you go down a corridor it breaks all come out 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.840
 huge bugs and as a base super crazy and 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.700
 also cool because you have puzzles that are 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.320
 I like the few here where 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.430
 they have some sections of 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.960
 You come back and stop hitting them too 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.400
 because it changes the rhythm a bit 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.040
 bobby pillas is for the combats with more 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.540
 you feel like hitting you get bored 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.490
 I hope you liked it very much 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.700
 a lot and see you in the presidio until 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.700
 other
