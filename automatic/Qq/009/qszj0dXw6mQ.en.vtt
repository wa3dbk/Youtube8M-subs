00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.139
 today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.950
 really very good we do the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.920
 risotto with aces there are two lobsters 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.230
 rather small because they are in year 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.119
 about 500 600 grams each, the first thing 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.550
 what we do and we are going to defraud them 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.029
 simple water in boiling water 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.029
 boiling 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.050
 we see a saucepan we put 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.660
 we cut the celery oil into 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.370
 gross way 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:47.190
 let's go straight to the pan 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 we also put some parsley and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.219
 we put a clove of garlic there 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.660
 whole clove of garlic fire it 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.660
 let's keep to a minimum 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:09.540
 remarkable here on the cutting board but now let's go 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.540
 to remove the ones we consider by part 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.390
 one little thing, we both take them off 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.670
 which are particularly scene in 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.189
 moment in which it will impact 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.520
 we hope the queues and we open our heads like this 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.030
 and let's put them in ours 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.030
 fried 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.810
 the queues we are going to open by dividing them 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.990
 He loved and putting even what 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.760
 see above the pulp is so small 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.470
 which in reality is a sin to take away 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.890
 better than valence power directly 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.510
 his dentinho let's brown one 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.040
 a little 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.520
 at this point let's add the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.680
 tomato 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.190
 this is simple peeled tomato is 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.190
 so nothing strange 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:10.090
 we are a bit of juice so this point 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.790
 let's add a little bit of salt 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.220
 not a lot of very simple broth of 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.910
 meadow fish that we did with the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.200
 weave fish bones so I reach 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:28.180
 about a ladle of broth and leave 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.280
 cook this our sauce for about 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.980
 about ten minutes a quarter of an hour the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.440
 maximum this point we can go to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.930
 crushing everything there are so many ways 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.590
 to do this, he could use it 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.330
 so mash masters so make pull 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.290
 out all the pulp directly so 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.330
 one crushes potatoes that role 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.510
 use after you can put it all in 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.190
 a mixer and then pass into a fine colander 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.200
 you can choose this one 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.060
 the thing I advise you to do is 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.680
 that of going to remove the lo 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.030
 clove of garlic that otherwise becomes 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.420
 too strong now I'm going to get it 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.420
 masher 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.900
 we also take his leftover 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.320
 in the pot another operation from 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.580
 to do is to go and filter the 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.160
 our way because it wouldn't be then 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.410
 particularly good to find us 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.410
 small pieces of carapace or other 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:04.510
 let's light the flame this will be a rice 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.010
 that we do neither with chasm 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.299
 mate friend nothing so only 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.180
 simple oil this is that carnaroli 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.430
 you can also use in the dwarf vialone 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.810
 so I will do a couple of servings 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.470
 then I will put about 120 grams 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.419
 in the meantime rekindle the flame below 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.389
 our fish broth 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.770
 when you see that the rice began to 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.010
 changing settlers just began to 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.780
 becoming translucent means that it is 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.280
 cost the right way so we can 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.840
 starting with our story 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.840
 now let's go and put fish stock 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.430
 I recommend you always look for them 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.449
 a quantity of liquid in such a way that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.530
 the face is always covered this point 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:57.419
 let's add the first part of the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.419
 our lobster extract 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.720
 and then let's add the broth 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.610
 at this point we carry on the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.010
 then quietly cooking 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.160
 always add some of the extract of 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:23.380
 lobster and some broth and here is the 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:26.050
 rice is ready I put it out of the fire 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.550
 and I take a drop of oil because it 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.300
 we are going to whisk with a drop of 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:36.520
 oil now let's rest for a couple 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.130
 of minutes the time I will need for 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.520
 skip the creams and tails a little 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.520
 oil 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.730
 no time for cheating just a bit 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:16.510
 parsley I will need as a 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:21.510
 and a decoration allow mechelen 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.510
 the bit of parsley 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.760
 for me this is the cat really 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.760
 tied a pedita
