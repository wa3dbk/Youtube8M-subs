00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.700
I'm a lyrical psycho where failure's not an option

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.400
Like Batemen playin the beat before you know he get to choppin

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.120
Off with your head with the weapon as my pen

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.620
With Mr Brown's harmonics placing me into my zen

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.540
Again, so give it up for the ones they call SWIGFU

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.000
Who?!? The ones on the mics those funny looking dudes

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.980
the track they had about dem boobs
the sick and vicious lyrics they use

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.520
Not ask forgiveness to whatever they would say or do

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.140
We speak freely I mean really let's get busy

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.600
Sparkin up that philly
Come on pass it back to Jimmy

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.220
We got plenty of rhymes to go ahead and feed the city

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.860
Enough raps to psyche you out, leaving u sitting pretty

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.160
Now it's time, it's time for me to clarify and justify my mission

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.160
as an Emcee attending competitions

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.860
It's a win or lose battle status in vertical position

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.540
Cause Hip Hop is not a obligation, yo its a religion 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.460
This is holy matrimoni even though you do not know me yet

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.040
Glory to the gory areolas from the Orient

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.660
with fast raps scratch that yo I'm slowin it

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.400
no need to be rushin when i ain't livin in the Soviet

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.760
all by lonesome ya'll don't owe me shit

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.840
just pay me back with a couple of hoes gropin my Moby Dick

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.080
an ego boost and they be strokin it

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.000
cuz I'm more potent than a poet laureate soakin in opiates

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.880
now hit the deck let's interject with my intellect

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.700
come along and battle i'll overshadow your silhouette

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.080
step up to the throne you'll get overthrown slowly
microphone controller persona consoling phonies

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.740
they really want me to belittle all my mini-mes

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.380
you're not forgiven for spittin silly soliloquies

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.060
they steady writing that balogney quick

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.400
just for A Fistful Of Dollars Like a Sergio Leone flick

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.200
don't try to figure out the psudonym and moniker

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.820
movin to the music and groovin they took a shot at ya

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.740
blowin the harmonica we're listenin to sad blues

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.240
Ay yo Brown why don't you hit em with the Bad News....
