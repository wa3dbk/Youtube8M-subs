that is GIS and remote sensing in into
production<00:00:59.000> agriculture<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.930> then<00:01:00.860> have<00:01:01.039> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
production agriculture and then have the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.090 
production agriculture and then have the

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
and and continued trying to figure out

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.239 
and and continued trying to figure out
how<00:01:08.060> we<00:01:08.119> can<00:01:08.420> take<00:01:08.659> these<00:01:08.929> these<00:01:09.619> tools<00:01:09.950> that

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
how we can take these these tools that

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
work in the real world and then this

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.359

able to represent SST in Brazil yes yes
I'm<00:02:50.189> helping<00:02:50.579> them<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.969> analyze<00:02:51.449> the<00:02:51.780> market

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
I'm helping them to analyze the market

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.679 
I'm helping them to analyze the market
in<00:02:52.230> Brazil<00:02:52.379> and<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.889> understand<00:02:53.310> better<00:02:53.689> what

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
in Brazil and to understand better what

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.080 
in Brazil and to understand better what
are<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.409> needs<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.889> we<00:02:56.129> need<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.430> do

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
are all the needs that we need to do

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.059 
are all the needs that we need to do
have<00:02:57.299> before<00:02:57.750> we<00:02:58.079> approach<00:02:58.379> that<00:02:58.620> market<00:02:58.980> see

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
have before we approach that market see

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.729 
have before we approach that market see
I<00:02:59.250> guess<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.730> years<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.540> farmer<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.469> would

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
I guess for years a farmer just would

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.390 
I guess for years a farmer just would
apply<00:03:02.730> an<00:03:03.569> even<00:03:03.689> amount<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.379> seed<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.980> an<00:03:05.099> even

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
apply an even amount of seed and an even

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.399 
apply an even amount of seed and an even
amount<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.819> nutrients<00:03:06.359> drives<00:03:07.109> the

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
amount of nutrients drives the

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.229 
amount of nutrients drives the
traditional<00:03:07.980> approach<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.669> to<00:03:08.819> take<00:03:08.969> two<00:03:09.209> or

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
traditional approach is to take two or

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.509 
traditional approach is to take two or
three<00:03:09.359> soil<00:03:09.750> samples<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.439> field<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.129> mix<00:03:11.400> it

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
three soil samples in a field and mix it

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.449 
three soil samples in a field and mix it
all<00:03:11.639> together<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:13.079> then<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.159> apply

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
all together and and then and then apply

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.879 
all together and and then and then apply
the<00:03:14.519> average<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.659> field<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.620> take<00:03:16.859> it

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
the average to that field and I take it

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.129 
the average to that field and I take it
that's<00:03:17.159> almost<00:03:17.609> never<00:03:17.939> the<00:03:18.299> best<00:03:18.629> way<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.930> do

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
that's almost never the best way to do

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.140 
that's almost never the best way to do
well<00:03:19.379> at<00:03:19.650> what<00:03:19.889> it<00:03:20.009> does<00:03:20.189> is<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.489> ends<00:03:20.879> up<00:03:21.000> in

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
well at what it does is it ends up in

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.089 
well at what it does is it ends up in
over<00:03:21.389> application<00:03:22.109> in<00:03:22.259> areas<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.829> under
