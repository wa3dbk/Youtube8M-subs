have your 54 inch fabric laid out face

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.990 
have your 54 inch fabric laid out face
down<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.900> table<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.949> we've<00:00:23.699> got<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
down on the table and we've got the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.910 
down on the table and we've got the
selvedge<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.320> if<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:25.800> know

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
selvedge here which is if you don't know

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
selvedge here which is if you don't know
this<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> edge<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.539> attached

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
this this is the edge that is attached

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.310 
this this is the edge that is attached
to<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> loom<00:00:28.590> when<00:00:28.890> they're<00:00:29.010> weaving<00:00:29.220> fabric

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
to the loom when they're weaving fabric

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.020 
to the loom when they're weaving fabric
so<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.439> wet<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> fabric<00:00:31.949> becoming<00:00:32.550> straight

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
so we wet the fabric becoming straight

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.080 
so we wet the fabric becoming straight
down<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.500> what<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.730> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
down like this and what we want to do is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720 
down like this and what we want to do is
to<00:00:36.329> cut<00:00:36.600> these<00:00:36.989> strips<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.710> fabric<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to cut these strips of fabric on the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.910 
to cut these strips of fabric on the
bias<00:00:39.030> which<00:00:39.510> means<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> diagonal<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
bias which means the diagonal of the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160 
bias which means the diagonal of the
fabric<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.360> students<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.050> time

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
fabric and I have students all the time

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170 
fabric and I have students all the time
asking<00:00:43.829> me<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> reason<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
asking me what the reason for that is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.740 
asking me what the reason for that is
and<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.309> cut<00:00:47.640> fabric<00:00:48.360> strips

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and it is if you cut fabric strips

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
and it is if you cut fabric strips
straight<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> grain<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> fabric

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
straight on the grain of the fabric

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.819 
straight on the grain of the fabric
there's<00:00:50.969> no<00:00:51.149> stretch<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.320> when<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:52.590> trying

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
there's no stretch so when you're trying

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.850 
there's no stretch so when you're trying
to<00:00:52.949> move<00:00:53.539> porting<00:00:54.539> around<00:00:54.840> curves<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.680> don't

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to move porting around curves you don't

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
to move porting around curves you don't
get<00:00:56.039> any<00:00:56.190> stretch<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.480> of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
get any stretch in there and it kind of

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
get any stretch in there and it kind of
just<00:00:57.719> buckles<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.350> wrinkles<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.460> it's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
just buckles and wrinkles but if it's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
just buckles and wrinkles but if it's
cut<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> bias<00:01:00.270> there's<00:01:00.719> some<00:01:00.870> stretch<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
cut on the bias there's some stretch and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.219 
cut on the bias there's some stretch and
it<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.920> around<00:01:02.010> curbs<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.640> lot<00:01:02.820> easier<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it can go around curbs a lot easier so

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
it can go around curbs a lot easier so
the<00:01:04.350> first<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.729> take

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the first thing I'm going to do is take

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.240 
the first thing I'm going to do is take
a<00:01:06.360> section<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> fabric<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.740> fold<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.159> up

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
a section of the fabric and fold it up

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.590 
a section of the fabric and fold it up
here<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> 45<00:01:09.900> degree<00:01:09.930> angle

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.050 

and<00:01:15.170> then<00:01:15.590> all<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.920> do<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.340> take<00:01:16.550> scissors<00:01:16.880> and

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
and then all you do is take scissors and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.420 
and then all you do is take scissors and
cut<00:01:17.330> along<00:01:17.870> this<00:01:18.140> fold<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.950> this<00:01:19.159> will<00:01:19.310> be

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
cut along this fold and this will be

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.310 
cut along this fold and this will be
your<00:01:19.580> first<00:01:19.760> piece<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.360> start<00:01:20.630> cutting<00:01:20.870> strips

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
your first piece to start cutting strips

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.150 
your first piece to start cutting strips
from<00:01:21.820> we<00:01:22.820> have<00:01:23.030> cut<00:01:23.450> this<00:01:23.660> edge<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.620> fabric<00:01:25.040> at

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
from we have cut this edge of fabric at

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.250 
from we have cut this edge of fabric at
a<00:01:25.220> 45<00:01:25.670> degree<00:01:25.820> angle<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.630> if<00:01:26.870> you<00:01:26.990> have<00:01:27.110> any

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
a 45 degree angle and if you have any

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.530 
a 45 degree angle and if you have any
question<00:01:27.830> these<00:01:28.040> cutting<00:01:28.460> mats<00:01:28.670> have<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.119> 45

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
question these cutting mats have the 45

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.350 
question these cutting mats have the 45
degree<00:01:29.900> angle<00:01:30.260> marked<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:31.700> is<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.150> line

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
degree angle marked so this is the line

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.570 
degree angle marked so this is the line
that<00:01:32.390> we're<00:01:32.660> going<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.810> start<00:01:33.110> with<00:01:33.320> and<00:01:33.580> just

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
that we're going to start with and just

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.100 
that we're going to start with and just
to<00:01:34.700> make<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.000> simpler<00:01:35.360> I'm<00:01:35.660> going<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.869> fold

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
to make it simpler I'm going to fold

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.590 
to make it simpler I'm going to fold
this<00:01:36.259> over<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.460> I<00:01:37.670> don't<00:01:37.820> have<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.420> make

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
this over so that I don't have to make

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.290 
this over so that I don't have to make
quite<00:01:38.869> as<00:01:39.080> many<00:01:39.550> run<00:01:40.550> throughs<00:01:40.850> with<00:01:41.150> the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
quite as many run throughs with the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.170 
quite as many run throughs with the
rotary<00:01:41.600> cutter<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.920> my<00:01:43.160> quilters<00:01:43.700> ruler

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
rotary cutter and on my quilters ruler

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.080 
rotary cutter and on my quilters ruler
I'm<00:01:44.390> going<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.229> measure<00:01:45.440> it<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:46.160> line<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.400> up<00:01:46.640> at

to make a lot of welt poured this goes a
lot<00:02:02.990> faster<00:02:03.530> than<00:02:03.560> cutting<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.190> with<00:02:04.280> scissors

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
lot faster than cutting it with scissors

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.550 
lot faster than cutting it with scissors
marking<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.360> cutting<00:02:05.539> it<00:02:05.720> with<00:02:06.470> the

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
for one of my machines is like this and

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.550 
for one of my machines is like this and
you<00:03:37.580> have<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:37.850> just<00:03:38.060> put<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.390> cord<00:03:39.230> right<00:03:39.410> up

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
you have to just put the cord right up

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.010 
you have to just put the cord right up
next<00:03:39.770> to<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.130> edge<00:03:40.489> there<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.150> get<00:03:41.690> as<00:03:41.810> close

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
next to the edge there and get as close

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.199 
next to the edge there and get as close
as<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.459> should<00:03:43.730> work<00:03:43.760> for<00:03:44.150> you

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
but I'm going to show you on my

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.190 
but I'm going to show you on my
industrial<00:03:46.010> machine<00:03:46.640> because<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.810> makes<00:03:48.050> it

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
industrial machine because it makes it

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.240 
industrial machine because it makes it
so<00:03:48.440> easy<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.790> first<00:03:50.060> thing<00:03:50.330> we<00:03:50.480> need<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.660> do<00:03:50.930> is

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
so easy the first thing we need to do is

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.660 
so easy the first thing we need to do is
take<00:03:52.250> our<00:03:52.519> strips<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.120> fabric<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.590> I'm<00:03:55.519> going

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
take our strips of fabric and I'm going

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.020 
take our strips of fabric and I'm going
to<00:03:55.700> take<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.239> right<00:03:57.019> side<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.680> one<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.340> put<00:03:58.910> it

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
to take the right side of one and put it

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.520 
to take the right side of one and put it
right<00:03:59.180> side<00:03:59.630> up<00:03:59.860> going<00:04:00.860> out<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.220> my<00:04:01.340> left<00:04:02.530> then

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
right side up going out to my left then

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.830 
right side up going out to my left then
I<00:04:03.560> take<00:04:04.069> another<00:04:04.100> strip<00:04:04.819> at<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.120> fabric<00:04:05.660> and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
I take another strip at the fabric and

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.750 
I take another strip at the fabric and
I'm<00:04:06.019> going<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.260> put<00:04:06.440> this<00:04:06.590> right<00:04:06.830> side<00:04:07.160> down<00:04:07.459> on

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
I'm going to put this right side down on

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.170 
I'm going to put this right side down on
here<00:04:08.060> perpendicular<00:04:09.430> so<00:04:10.430> this<00:04:10.730> is<00:04:10.910> how<00:04:11.030> we're

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
here perpendicular so this is how we're

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.759 
here perpendicular so this is how we're
gonna<00:04:11.239> stitch<00:04:11.810> these<00:04:12.050> together<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
gonna stitch these together the

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:13.930 
gonna stitch these together the
stitching<00:04:13.160> is<00:04:13.220> going<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.430> go<00:04:13.550> straight<00:04:13.850> across

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
stitching is going to go straight across

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.120 
stitching is going to go straight across
there<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.660> then<00:04:15.260> I'm<00:04:15.380> going<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.560> trim<00:04:15.830> up<00:04:16.010> the

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
there and then I'm going to trim up the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.129 
there and then I'm going to trim up the
edges<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.790> we<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:17.269> sew<00:04:17.479> one<00:04:17.690> after<00:04:18.019> the

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
edges and we just sew one after the

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.520 
edges and we just sew one after the
other<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.620> make<00:04:18.890> our<00:04:19.070> long<00:04:19.579> strip<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:20.030> fabric

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
other and make our long strip of fabric

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.659 
other and make our long strip of fabric
the<00:04:21.530> first<00:04:21.769> thing<00:04:21.919> I'm<00:04:22.010> going<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.190> do<00:04:22.400> is

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
the first thing I'm going to do is

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.880 
the first thing I'm going to do is
stitch<00:04:23.120> on<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.870> diagonal<00:04:24.410> right<00:04:24.650> across

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
stitch on the diagonal right across

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:38.210 
stitch on the diagonal right across
these<00:04:25.280> two<00:04:25.460> pieces<00:04:25.669> to<00:04:26.060> get<00:04:26.180> these<00:04:26.360> connected

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.250 

and<00:04:39.150> then<00:04:39.300> I'll<00:04:39.420> clip<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.930> threads

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.960 

so<00:04:44.070> here's<00:04:44.250> what<00:04:44.430> it's<00:04:44.550> going<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.760> look<00:04:44.910> like

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
so here's what it's going to look like

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.360 
so here's what it's going to look like
to<00:04:45.480> start<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.590> then<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.800> come<00:04:47.010> in<00:04:47.040> with<00:04:47.160> the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
to start and then you come in with the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.790 
to start and then you come in with the
scissors<00:04:47.790> and<00:04:48.120> just<00:04:48.150> make<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.780> little<00:04:48.900> trim

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
scissors and just make a little trim

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.280 
scissors and just make a little trim
right<00:04:50.100> here<00:04:51.560> and<00:04:53.150> then<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.480> flip<00:04:54.720> it<00:04:54.810> over<00:04:54.990> and

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
right here and then you flip it over and

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.080 
right here and then you flip it over and
that's<00:04:55.980> how<00:04:56.160> your<00:04:56.310> cording<00:04:56.670> is<00:04:56.730> gonna<00:04:56.880> be

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
that's how your cording is gonna be

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.420 
that's how your cording is gonna be
joined<00:04:57.960> together<00:04:58.110> all<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.710> way<00:04:58.830> along<00:04:59.100> and

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
joined together all the way along and

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.790 
joined together all the way along and
it's<00:04:59.550> always<00:04:59.790> on<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.150> diagonal<00:05:00.690> so<00:05:01.440> I'll<00:05:01.650> go

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
it's always on the diagonal so I'll go

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.310 
it's always on the diagonal so I'll go
ahead<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.280> get<00:05:02.400> these<00:05:02.550> strips<00:05:02.910> made<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.540> then

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.650 
I'll show you how to run the cording
through<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.330> machine<00:05:07.730> okay<00:05:08.730> so<00:05:08.790> I'm<00:05:09.210> going<00:05:09.540> to
