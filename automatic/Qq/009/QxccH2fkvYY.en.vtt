00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.029
 that has no problem of sea ​​nothing 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:42.630

 to the adjustments we'll see how it moves 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:37.180

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.950
 projects and various applications and that gives 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.460
 a mental sense and then back in the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.030
 130 levels more or less the consumption of 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.610

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.799
 [Music] 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:31.569

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.590
 music 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.420
 it is good for those who do not get complicated and 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.360
 they want the official version the version 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.770
 stable there are 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.160
 although I take advantage to show them the 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.610
 keyboard 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.610
 Y 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.290
 one gear 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.290
 but this seems 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.750
 and it's very good because it's all in itself 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:31.400
 works works pretty well 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.400

 if everyone can apply their things 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.730
