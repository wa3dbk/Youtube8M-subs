00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
that there's a part of the path to get

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.170 
that there's a part of the path to get
there<00:03:39.860> it's<00:03:40.860> part<00:03:41.069> of<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> route<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.880> order<00:03:41.910> to

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
there it's part of the route in order to

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.610 
there it's part of the route in order to
get<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> top<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.140> have<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.500> go

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
get to the top that you have to go

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.830 
get to the top that you have to go
through<00:03:43.920> there's<00:03:44.760> not<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> real<00:03:45.209> ray<00:03:45.360> around<00:03:45.690> it

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
through there's not a real ray around it

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.309 
through there's not a real ray around it
but<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:46.769> one<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.040> most<00:03:47.099> dangerous<00:03:48.319> parts

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
but it's one of the most dangerous parts

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.949 
but it's one of the most dangerous parts
of<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> journey<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.180> so<00:03:51.180> many<00:03:51.390> people<00:03:51.750> died

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
of the journey and so many people died

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.930 
of the journey and so many people died
in<00:03:52.320> that<00:03:52.620> stretch<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:55.440> when<00:03:55.709> they<00:03:55.890> die<00:03:56.100> you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
in that stretch and when they die you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.960 
in that stretch and when they die you
can't<00:03:57.299> retrieve<00:03:57.930> their<00:03:58.140> bodies<00:03:58.519> so<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.549> can

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
can't retrieve their bodies so you can

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.960
