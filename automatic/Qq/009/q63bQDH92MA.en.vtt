00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.720 
one end of our board here are our
platter<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.410> they<00:03:52.410> should<00:03:52.680> be<00:03:52.709> very<00:03:53.130> soft<00:03:53.520> so

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
riboflavin whatever the heck that is I

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.490 
riboflavin whatever the heck that is I
don't<00:05:06.790> know<00:05:06.880> what<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.120> really<00:05:07.300> is<00:05:07.420> but<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.170> know

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
don't know what it really is but I know

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.650 
don't know what it really is but I know
it's<00:05:08.710> good<00:05:08.860> yeah<00:05:09.270> so<00:05:10.270> there<00:05:10.390> we<00:05:10.510> have<00:05:10.540> our

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
it's good yeah so there we have our

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.540 
it's good yeah so there we have our
avocado<00:05:11.230> we<00:05:11.470> could<00:05:11.620> do<00:05:11.710> another<00:05:11.830> one<00:05:12.160> but<00:05:12.370> I

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
avocado we could do another one but I

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.540 
avocado we could do another one but I
think<00:05:12.850> that'll<00:05:13.120> be<00:05:13.150> enough<00:05:13.240> for<00:05:13.600> now<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:15.430> if

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
think that'll be enough for now and if

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.170 
think that'll be enough for now and if
you'd<00:05:15.700> prefer<00:05:15.850> you<00:05:16.180> could<00:05:16.300> serve<00:05:16.510> guacamole

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
you'd prefer you could serve guacamole

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.300 
you'd prefer you could serve guacamole

a<00:05:57.490> I<00:05:57.880> know<00:05:58.090> most<00:05:58.390> people<00:05:58.750> do<00:05:58.900> like<00:05:59.110> yellow

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
a I know most people do like yellow

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.540 
a I know most people do like yellow
cheddar<00:05:59.790> but<00:06:01.710> your<00:06:02.710> white<00:06:02.920> cheddar<00:06:03.190> is<00:06:03.490> a

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
cheddar but your white cheddar is a

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.240 
cheddar but your white cheddar is a
better<00:06:03.850> choice<00:06:06.030> because<00:06:07.290> white<00:06:08.290> cheddar<00:06:08.590> is

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
better choice because white cheddar is

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.670 
better choice because white cheddar is
exactly<00:06:09.730> the<00:06:09.910> same<00:06:10.120> as<00:06:10.300> yellow<00:06:10.510> cheddar<00:06:10.810> only

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680
