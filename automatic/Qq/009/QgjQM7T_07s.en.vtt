00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
despite the fact that you've just been

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.089 
despite the fact that you've just been
reinventing<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.239> polo<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.799> use<00:04:09.949> the<00:04:09.979> term

reinventing very loosely probably since

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.339 
reinventing very loosely probably since
before<00:04:12.889> I<00:04:13.069> was<00:04:13.129> born<00:04:13.389> I<00:04:14.389> don't<00:04:14.780> really<00:04:15.079> know

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
before I was born I don't really know

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.779 
before I was born I don't really know
how<00:04:15.379> many<00:04:15.859> different<00:04:16.190> ways<00:04:16.340> you<00:04:16.759> can<00:04:17.090> present

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
how many different ways you can present

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.810 
how many different ways you can present
cutoff<00:04:19.789> shorts<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.570> plaid<00:04:21.440> shirts<00:04:22.159> but<00:04:22.789> I

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
cutoff shorts and plaid shirts but I

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.310 
cutoff shorts and plaid shirts but I
mean<00:04:23.029> you<00:04:23.120> figured<00:04:23.270> out<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.510> way<00:04:23.659> to<00:04:23.719> do<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:24.050> so<00:04:24.289> I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
mean you figured out a way to do it so I

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.390 
mean you figured out a way to do it so I
guess<00:04:24.440> I'm

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
guess I'm

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.870 
guess I'm
wrong<00:04:27.580> um<00:04:28.580> yeah<00:04:29.419> so<00:04:29.900> that's<00:04:30.520> that's<00:04:31.520> what<00:04:31.729> that

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
wrong um yeah so that's that's what that

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.110 
wrong um yeah so that's that's what that
is<00:04:32.060> um<00:04:32.419> it's<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.080> pretty<00:04:33.410> simple<00:04:34.120> revolutionary

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
is um it's a pretty simple revolutionary

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.029 
is um it's a pretty simple revolutionary
act<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.710> only<00:04:37.160> benefits<00:04:37.880> me<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.389> only

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
act that only benefits me and only

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.580 
act that only benefits me and only
