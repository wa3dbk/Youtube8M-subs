 eighth place 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.790

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.420
 as 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.049

 marked history has had a lot of success before it did not make 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.199
 and one kind of wakes up like there's something a uav 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.500
 they went the things that he said 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.250

 and to create a good life you need 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.250

 an attempt is to put information 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.599
 daily to the brain
