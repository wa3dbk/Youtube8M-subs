 marked history has had a lot of success before it did not make 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.199

 Good Life 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.249
 and to create a good life you need 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.250

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.789
 an attempt is to put information 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.599
 daily to the brain
