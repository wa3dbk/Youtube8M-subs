00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.640
 ah 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.250
 ah 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.930
 in the pendulum and the tobacco is going to 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.160
 show the exact place where the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.690
 burial so I see here this hole 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.250
 is towards the northeast 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.250
 next to where the sun rises 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.370
 is guarded by spirits 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.230
 for this an offer is made 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.050
 special let's guide us through the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.090
 tobacco on the pendulum to know the site 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.120
 of web that is marking that that already 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.780
 it's our turn to go down we're going to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.780
 tell 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.780
 [Laughs] 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.180
 let's indicate what is in this stone in 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.829
 This part of us has to clean up 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.210
 We can see 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.000
 It has too much weeds 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 in this part shows that there is money there 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.030
 something of great value not money but something 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.970
 of value is gold vessels something in the form of 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.050
 of animals 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.050
 it's exactly 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.909
 on this stone where the pendulum is 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.079
 marked 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.079
 and here we find a petroglyph 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.079
 indigenous 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.939
 this petroglyphs dates approximately 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.640
 of the year 1500 in which they lived 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.820
 the different tribes 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.900
 [Music] 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.479
 to clean them only with orange 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.330
 let's do the cleaning with orange 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:01.010
 to see the meaning well 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.030
 the orange are split in cross 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.030
 with hand 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.410
 these lands were inhabited by the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.250
 Colima tribe This hieroglyph indicates 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.090
 if there is a person is buried in a 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.620
 grave of a cacique or someone of much 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.410
 power of the tribe 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.590
 this means multiple grave help from 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.600
 jose an underground and these symbols are 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.950
 they are dividing between you have the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.170
 around earth described 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.850
 other mythical beings indicating to the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.390
 position touches us 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.580
 do then more or less than about four 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.580
 meters and a half to five on the left 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.199
 [Music] 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.599
 [Music] 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:11.440
 evidently we find ourselves 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.110
 human and there is a tunnel 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.420
 under the stone you are not seeing 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.280
 [Music] 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.280
 towards the east side 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.610
 la la la la la la la 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.610
