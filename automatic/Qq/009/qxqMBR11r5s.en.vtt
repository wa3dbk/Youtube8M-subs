00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
as a demonstration for now I can see by

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.100 
as a demonstration for now I can see by
a<00:01:04.259> Munich<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.009> second<00:01:05.549> place<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:06.630> seven

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
a Munich in second place with seven

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.010 
a Munich in second place with seven
points<00:01:07.649> behind<00:01:07.890> Monaco<00:01:08.579> nine<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.329> we<00:01:09.840> can

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
points behind Monaco nine and we can

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380 
points behind Monaco nine and we can
also<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.860> example<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.729> ax<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.299> in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
also see for example that I ax are in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.050 
also see for example that I ax are in
fourth<00:01:12.780> place<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.490> four<00:01:14.490> points<00:01:14.939> with

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
fourth place at four points with

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.749 
fourth place at four points with
Liverpool<00:01:15.360> five<00:01:15.899> but<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.039> better<00:01:17.399> goal

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
Liverpool five but with a better goal

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.959 
Liverpool five but with a better goal
difference<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.369> pop<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.850> my

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
difference so if I just pop to my

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.649 
difference so if I just pop to my
fixture<00:01:21.509> sheet<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.520> imagine<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.479> can

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
fixture sheet and imagine that if I can

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.560 
fixture sheet and imagine that if I can
enter<00:01:25.079> a<00:01:25.110> victory<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.009> Bayern<00:01:26.340> Munich<00:01:26.729> let's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
enter a victory for Bayern Munich let's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
enter a victory for Bayern Munich let's
say<00:01:27.810> they've<00:01:28.020> won<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.500> kneel<00:01:28.740> we're<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
say they've won to kneel we're going to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.240 
say they've won to kneel we're going to
Liverpool<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.960> if<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.020> put<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.289> an<00:01:31.380> IH<00:01:31.770> result

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
Liverpool and if I put in an IH result

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.050 
Liverpool and if I put in an IH result
as<00:01:32.399> well<00:01:32.609> maybe<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.450> draw<00:01:33.869> against<00:01:34.259> Barcelona

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
as well maybe a draw against Barcelona

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.969 
as well maybe a draw against Barcelona
that<00:01:36.060> should<00:01:36.359> change<00:01:36.659> our<00:01:37.109> league<00:01:37.350> tables

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that should change our league tables

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.060 
that should change our league tables
around<00:01:38.539> so<00:01:39.539> if<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.659> switch<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.320> league<00:01:40.530> table

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
around so if I switch to my league table

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.029 
around so if I switch to my league table
I<00:01:41.219> can<00:01:42.149> now<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.509> Bayer<00:01:42.780> Munich<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.500> media<00:01:43.979> on

where just like earlier in this video we

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.520 
where just like earlier in this video we
are<00:05:23.040> automatically<00:05:24.169> calculating<00:05:25.169> team

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530

example<00:05:30.120> we're<00:05:30.270> going<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.690> look<00:05:30.900> at<00:05:31.110> how<00:05:31.460> you

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
example we're going to look at how you

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.450 
example we're going to look at how you
can<00:05:32.700> calculate<00:05:33.450> the<00:05:33.900> net<00:05:34.230> run-rate<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:35.100> teams

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
can calculate the net run-rate of teams

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.480 
can calculate the net run-rate of teams
like<00:05:35.850> displayed<00:05:36.390> here<00:05:36.720> how<00:05:37.320> he<00:05:37.380> can<00:05:37.890> calculate

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
like displayed here how he can calculate

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.350 
like displayed here how he can calculate
bowling<00:05:39.090> strike<00:05:39.360> rate<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.790> also<00:05:41.790> from<00:05:42.090> these

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
bowling strike rate and also from these
