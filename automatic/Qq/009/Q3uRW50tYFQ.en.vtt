00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.290 
our recipe from this cupcake book but
we're<00:00:40.680> converting<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.850> halogen

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
we're converting it into the halogen

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.569 
we're converting it into the halogen
oven<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.079> saying<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> book<00:00:43.739> 190

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
oven so it's saying in the book 190

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.310 
oven so it's saying in the book 190
degrees<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.420> we're<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> heat<00:00:46.079> our

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
degrees so we're going to heat our

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.490 
degrees so we're going to heat our
halogen<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.039> 190<00:00:47.760> degrees<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:49.320> already

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
little bit more like this double case

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.640 
little bit more like this double case
then<00:02:54.390> okay<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.450> now<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:55.989> leaves<00:02:56.319> us<00:02:56.470> to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
