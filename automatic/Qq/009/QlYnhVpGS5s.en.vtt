00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 two 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.530
 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.759
 as already what in the title of the video 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.259
 Well, I'm going to show you some 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.910
 repetitions in which he achieves 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.530
 make two star villages that are at 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.450
 maximum good to the maximum of defenses 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.130
 because because the walls are not going to 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.170
 interesting good is going to be with bloodhounds 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.060
 as we are seeing the first step is going to 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.700
 drop we have to drop the bloodhounds 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.930
 behind the balloons and then the 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.270
 bloodhounds we know that they will go 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.039
 directly to the air defenses as well 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.739
 that the bloodhounds are going to be like a golem 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.629
 always said are like one 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.730
 flyers and now we have to drop the 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.440
 minions because because the bloodhounds 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.449
 while they are extracting the wolves 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.480
 they destroy the defenses and the minions 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.190
 the constructions that do not defend here 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.170
 they are already beginning to kill the bloodhounds 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.420
 Here comes the castle of the enemy train 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.789
 she froze is sick twice I'm 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.559
 freezing because if it's not going to start me 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.239
 to kill the new ones and I want that 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.449
 these balloons reach this area 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.219
 where are the tees the good and the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.619
 archers killed them with lightning here another 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.960
 freezing so that for the balloons 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.170
 with that rage they can 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 almost the town hall just leaving 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.200
 drop their pumps because it has a 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.900
 splash impact and you can see here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.820
 they go for the next tesla and goodbye 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.700
 councils are simply with the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.110
 splash of the balloons no but that's not 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.690
 is the important thing the important thing is that you 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.190
 there are enough troops to do 50 for 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.830
 hundred here see how the bones are 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.810
 they carry all the aerial traps see me 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.270
 they kill the bloodhound but those are 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.210
 little bones or puppies Ã¡lava no 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.640
 well here we go in a fabulous 44 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.070
 percent the town hall is no longer and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.619
 because with the remaining troops is to look 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.410
 that 50% to make two stars see 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.030
 easy and simple bloodhounds balloons and 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.070
 minions the combination there I leave 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.720
 here below they can appear and as 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.000
 we are in a war the most important thing 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.130
 is to leave the enemy bad and then to let go 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.690
 here the kings but I what I want that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.750
 see is what 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.300
 without the kings and the two stars with 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.010
 wolves bloodhounds tell you here the kings 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.290
 they're just going to be to clean all 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.840
 this area to leave a little more 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.350
 the output humiliated almost 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.090
 They can make 70 percent and as 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.100
 here the king we have to use it quite 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.530
 well as a golem because then the queen 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.300
 will be destroying and the king has more 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.770
 life that queen constructions 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.740
 they do not have much life here 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.810
 canyons dam builders 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.310
 what are warehouse archer towers 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.780
 of dark liquids and you will have more 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.760
 life and it's going to stop here a little bit 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.290
 queen and then we are going to use here the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.510
 King's skill we will not accelerate 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.350
 this so that they see that it did to him 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.510
 percentage of 70 there that are 75 per 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.660
 a hundred which is not bad at all 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.970
 kings 40 as did 25% alone one 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.130
 24 percent alone and then the most 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.290
 important two stars if you give us 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.540
 the kings is possible if it is possible to do 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.100
 two stars without using the kings for 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.520
 that they are taking it into account here 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.500
 also something that takes a lot into account in 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.720
 the reactions that the beam saved him 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.060
 a lot because they go over all 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.670
 bloodhounds not queen archer was distracted 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.070
 a little with them the balloons were going 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.680
 behind in the castle and carrying balloons 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.420
 level all maximum level that does end 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.010
 clarify everything is at its best here 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.350
 freeze the infernal tower so that it does not 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.330
 I kill those balloons the radio spell 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.220
 to kill all those archers a 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.470
 freeze to entertain enough 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.940
 you what they were going to do almost all the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.710
 I work because they made the balloons 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.480
 come too close to the town hall myself 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.650
 that's why I would not have a village like that because 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.930
 I saw how they can do 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.610
 two stars so easy and so if 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.860
 they want to apply a little the kings say 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.629
 I have the lowest styles, 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.030
 can they do their kings I think it would be 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.879
 a good option but I leave this 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.890
 so they can observe it and take it in 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.689
 account in his war attacks so that 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.420
 they can make two stars and that is 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.549
 touches a very difficult war and with this 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.260
 we find a very good function to 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.480
 bloodhound that everyone said it would not be 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.950
 for a lot that for the best because then 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.450
 they saw that if it's important here anymore 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.790
 let's see the destruction of the kings 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.010
 because it's something that does not have much that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.739
 see we 're leaving now I'm going to go to 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.750
 make an equal attack with an attack here 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.269
 you can see the village like everything is 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.799
 to the maximum and see these many outputs 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.019
 recommend entering from the front but 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.209
 he is dressed feels from the front but 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.250
 I saw that if I was going to complicate a bit of 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.220
 50% so I searched a bit with the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.620
 henchmen see the aerial bombs I 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.560
 they start killing some minions and then 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.300
 I here stay with a few not 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.430
 I have so many shots so I have to 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.900
 take advantage of it is pretty good I'm going to 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.970
 enter on this front because they are two 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.770
 air defenses pretty close together and the 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.430
 destroyed the following bani and go 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.620
 to enjoy 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.720
 all those archer towers that are 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.900
 that's why what I said to them, do not put 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.890
 so many defenses so close to the 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.140
 municipalities because the splash of 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.170
 the balloons as it affects a lot do not look 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.420
 here already freeze the air defenses I put 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.880
 a rage only subjects minions that 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.890
 entertain everything here save me a 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.840
 lava hound in the castle declared 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.970
 enemy now they do not bring a 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.810
 lightning spell I brought three 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.400
 freezing is better in case the doubts do not 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.930
 now freeze is hell because the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.240
 new ones that are on the left side are 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.220
 they go and then to the crossbow and then to 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.170
 the archer towers we need that 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.460
 all those balloons survive for me 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.620
 destroy this whole thing thing 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.660
 applicator here your do this dies and 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.760
 entertain served which is 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.470
 perfect because now the sighs are 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.020
 They will get closer to the town hall because 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.360
 there was a little puppy of lava and 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.040
 ready take the enemy town hall and 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.440
 then they continue to hurt the 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.970
 defenses see here percentage more than 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.070
 make the eggs some are left by 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.360
 I'm already two stars above 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.400
 equal to a henchman on the left 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.680
 that had helped me a lot to be the 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.060
 percentage the queen I do not have it the cup 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.389
 king I'm improving it and 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.340
 and I can win villages and decided on my 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.380
 kings if you have low kings as well 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.080
 you can lean on them and achieve 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.150
 two stars not in the end I hope that 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.800
 have liked and see you until the 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.800
 next video bay
