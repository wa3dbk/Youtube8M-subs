so<00:03:53.330> as<00:03:54.140> I'd<00:03:54.440> like<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.830> meet<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.640> soon<00:03:55.940> you'll

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
so as I'd like to meet and soon you'll

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.420 
so as I'd like to meet and soon you'll
see<00:03:56.600> our<00:03:57.410> cells<00:03:57.740> are<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.100> part<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.840> me

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
see our cells are a part of you and me

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.890

know<00:04:28.880> about<00:04:29.200> immobility<00:04:31.090> keeping<00:04:32.090> oh<00:04:32.300> so

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
know about immobility keeping oh so

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
listening if we did our best hope you do

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
listening if we did our best hope you do
well<00:04:39.410> on<00:04:39.890> your<00:04:39.950> science<00:04:40.730> test
