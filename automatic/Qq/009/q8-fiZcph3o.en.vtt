you'll have a hard time doing what I'm
doing<00:03:56.489> now<00:03:56.760> because<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.239> makes<00:03:57.420> some<00:03:57.569> really

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
doing now because it makes some really

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.720 
doing now because it makes some really
bad<00:03:57.959> sounds<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:59.010> look<00:03:59.160> at<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.550> coming

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
bad sounds but look at that it's coming

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.070 
bad sounds but look at that it's coming
off<00:03:59.910> pretty<00:04:00.300> easily

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.290 

sometimes<00:04:04.080> your<00:04:04.739> pinstriping<00:04:05.370> will<00:04:05.550> be

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
sometimes your pinstriping will be

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.150 
sometimes your pinstriping will be
really<00:04:06.630> old<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.140> nasty<00:04:07.319> and<00:04:07.739> it'll<00:04:07.980> slowly

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
really old and nasty and it'll slowly

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.830 
really old and nasty and it'll slowly
get<00:04:09.060> crusty<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:10.550> stuff<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:12.150> look<00:04:12.600> at<00:04:12.720> that

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
get crusty and stuff but look at that

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.000 
get crusty and stuff but look at that
it's<00:04:13.049> coming<00:04:13.230> off<00:04:13.410> real<00:04:13.680> easy

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
it's coming off real easy

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.099 
it's coming off real easy
doesn't<00:04:14.910> have<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.060> be<00:04:15.150> perfect<00:04:15.630> just<00:04:15.810> make<00:04:15.959> it

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
doesn't have to be perfect just make it

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.469 
doesn't have to be perfect just make it
good<00:04:16.829> enough<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.640> when<00:04:17.940> we<00:04:18.060> go<00:04:18.150> back<00:04:18.329> to

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
good enough so that when we go back to

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.810 
good enough so that when we go back to
the<00:04:18.570> sandpaper<00:04:18.959> it'll<00:04:19.890> all<00:04:20.040> lay<00:04:20.250> down<00:04:20.459> sort<00:04:20.790> of

the big guns if it won't come off and
drop<00:05:20.289> it<00:05:20.469> in<00:05:20.589> two<00:05:20.740> or<00:05:20.770> 100<00:05:22.020> sandpaper<00:05:23.020> but

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
drop it in two or 100 sandpaper but

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:26.820 
drop it in two or 100 sandpaper but
might<00:05:24.189> notice<00:05:24.520> ash<00:05:24.759> is<00:05:24.939> going<00:05:25.319> get<00:05:26.319> these<00:05:26.499> big

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:33.059 
rips and shreds and and cuts in more
pain<00:05:30.459> so<00:05:30.909> that's<00:05:31.119> why<00:05:31.300> we<00:05:31.449> need<00:05:31.599> bondo<00:05:32.529> glazing

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
pain so that's why we need bondo glazing

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.790 
pain so that's why we need bondo glazing
and<00:05:33.219> spot<00:05:33.550> putty<00:05:33.849> this<00:05:34.659> is<00:05:34.779> great<00:05:35.050> stuff<00:05:35.379> it's

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
and spot putty this is great stuff it's

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.159 
and spot putty this is great stuff it's
pretty<00:05:36.009> much<00:05:36.189> like<00:05:36.490> she<00:05:37.209> faced<00:05:37.539> except<00:05:38.020> it

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
pretty much like she faced except it

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.589 
pretty much like she faced except it
turns<00:05:38.409> rock-hard<00:05:39.099> so<00:05:39.909> what<00:05:40.149> you<00:05:40.270> do<00:05:40.419> is

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:45.899 
something you want to cover it up just

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:49.709 
something you want to cover it up just
smush<00:05:46.899> this<00:05:47.169> stuff<00:05:47.439> on<00:05:47.679> and<00:05:48.369> then<00:05:49.059> now<00:05:49.269> what

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
smush this stuff on and then now what

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.049 
smush this stuff on and then now what
we'll<00:05:49.899> do<00:05:50.050> after<00:05:50.229> it<00:05:50.529> dries<00:05:50.769> as<00:05:51.369> well<00:05:51.639> sand<00:05:51.939> it

00:05:52.049 --> 00:05:52.059 
we'll do after it dries as well sand it

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.139 
we'll do after it dries as well sand it
down<00:05:52.119> and<00:05:52.599> it<00:05:53.349> should<00:05:53.559> give<00:05:53.740> us<00:05:53.860> a<00:05:53.979> good

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:54.149 
down and it should give us a good

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:56.669 
down and it should give us a good
surface<00:05:55.149> that<00:05:55.330> we<00:05:55.449> can<00:05:55.599> paint<00:05:55.839> on<00:05:56.019> without

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:56.679 
surface that we can paint on without

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:59.249 
surface that we can paint on without
seeing<00:05:57.159> any<00:05:57.309> of<00:05:57.490> this<00:05:57.610> stuff<00:05:57.909> that<00:05:57.939> we<00:05:58.240> did<00:05:58.449> to

the surfaces and it's got to be all
clean<00:06:18.459> at<00:06:18.579> this<00:06:18.729> point<00:06:18.999> we're<00:06:19.300> done<00:06:19.419> sanding

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
clean at this point we're done sanding

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.739 
clean at this point we're done sanding
so<00:06:20.649> now<00:06:21.369> we<00:06:21.430> have<00:06:21.579> to<00:06:21.699> mask<00:06:21.939> off<00:06:22.209> the<00:06:22.240> parts<00:06:22.659> of

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:22.749 
so now we have to mask off the parts of

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.359 
so now we have to mask off the parts of
the<00:06:22.809> car<00:06:22.959> that<00:06:23.110> we're<00:06:23.229> not<00:06:23.349> going<00:06:23.529> to<00:06:23.589> tape<00:06:23.800> so

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:24.369 
the car that we're not going to tape so

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:26.369 
the car that we're not going to tape so
that<00:06:24.490> when<00:06:24.579> we<00:06:24.669> start<00:06:24.909> using<00:06:24.969> spray<00:06:25.569> paint<00:06:25.869> it

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:26.379 
that when we start using spray paint it

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.990 
that when we start using spray paint it
doesn't<00:06:26.680> get<00:06:26.800> everywhere<00:06:27.219> so<00:06:27.579> let's<00:06:27.610> do<00:06:27.909> that

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
doesn't get everywhere so let's do that

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.060 
doesn't get everywhere so let's do that
