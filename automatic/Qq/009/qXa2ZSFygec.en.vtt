00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.250
 I know from the wave that they already missed the 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.380
 cards so if you want to learn to 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.110
 make this pretty card that has 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.910
 effects in 3d because it is clear this 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.350
 video to sell taught you how to do this 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.980
 pop card 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.670
 the material that we are going to need is a 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.880
 cardboard an acetate sheet true a 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.220
 pencil cutter or scissors glue and what 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.410
 what you want to decorate the first thing 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.989
 let's do is let's put the rule 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.989
 in this part here we are going to mark the 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.750
 10 to 20 and 30 centimeters 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.390
 then we put our rule in those 30 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.239
 centimeters and we score again at 10 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.839
 at 20 and 30 centimeters wide 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.070
 It will have 12 centimeters and the same 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.949
 the 10 centimeters 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.409
 let's do it at the bottom and 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.839
 we unite all the points now you 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.449
 will be 6 rectangles and we will 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.970
 cut that strip that we had left since 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.030
 do not have that now with a punch or a 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 pen without tip you will mark each one 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.159
 of the folds in this way 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.830
 you are going to fold the first bend towards 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.560
 inside in the second out and so on 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.990
 successively until you finish all the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.710
 card we will have an accordion 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.710
 this form 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.760
 Now let's work on this 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.040
 rectangle that is the first of our 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.520
 card but we're going to stretch it and it's going to 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.520
 be the last 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.430
 let's put our rule this 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.360
 way and we're going to mark a centimeter by 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.360
 up and down 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.780
 and the same thing we do on the other side now 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.240
 we put our candle horizontally and 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.480
 we align the points and on this side 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.880
 we mark 2.5 centimeters and here at 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.880
 centimeter and the same thing we do below 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.450
 this will form a rectangle that we're going 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.450
 to unite with our rule 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.230
 since it has stayed you this way 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.230
 Now let's open our card 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.190
 and let's work here let's put 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.440
 our rule this way and we're going to 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.879
 dial at 6 centimeters and the same 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.879
 we do in these two lines 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.230
 let's put our rule on the line 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.709
 in the middle and we will dial to 4.5 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.940
 centimeters and 7.5 centimeters and we 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.940
 3 points will remain 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.129
 now we are going to align our rule of 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.579
 this way and we're going to mark the last 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:55.519
 point at 1.5 centimeters towards the 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:59.030
 right and the same thing we do in the 3 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.739
 points and we're also going to do it towards 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.500
 the left side 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.329
 this will form us a picture that also 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.329
 let's mark with our pencil 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.709
 and since we have it that way with the help of 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.049
 our rule and our twitter are going to 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.049
 cut only the horizontal lines 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.860
 since you have it like this now you are going to close 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.380
 the card and it's going to push in 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.290
 the picture we made and you're going to close your 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.050
 card and fold it to mark well the 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.350
 fold and we already have our pop effect 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.080
 pop 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.230
 now this same procedure we are going to 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.300
 do in these two points and since not 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.300
 have you been left this way 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.569
 Now with the help of our cutter and 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.950
 our rule we are going to remove the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.530
 rectangle that we had marked 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.750
 previously in the front part of 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.080
 our card and we will have to stay 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.080
 A) Yes 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.910
 now let's cut a rectangle of 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:10.200
 8.3 by 12 centimeters cardboard 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.930
 a piece of colored sheet of 7.3 by 11 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.840
 centimeters and an acetate rectangle 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.810
 of the same measure 7.3 by 11 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.090
 centimeters in the color rectangle 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.580
 that we mark we are going to make a frame of 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.650
 half a centimeter on all four sides 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.530
 so that we have a frame of this 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.140
 shape and inside let's draw or to 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.140
 write something nice because this is the 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.600
 cover of our card since the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.510
 you have decorated you're going to cut a 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.970
 pulls 2.5 centimeters by 12 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.920
 centimeters and you will also decorate it 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.530
 Now what we are going to do is take 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.990
 our card will open it and in the 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.680
 back we're going to paste the acetate 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.199
 that we had previously cut 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.380
 then let's put the card 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.150
 decorated making sure that is 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.180
 aligned with the frame 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.480
 and finally we are going to paste the strip of 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.570
 2.5 x 12 centimeters in this part for 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.210
 cover this gap now we will have 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.490
 this way and so that it does not look like this 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.590
 that ugly we are going to stick the rectangle of 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.950
 cardboard that we had also made 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.890
 previously in this part now in a 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.890
 9 x 9 centimeters frame draw a 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.590
 heart and in rectangles of 7 x 9 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.930
 centimeters draw some letters that 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.720
 form the word ay he saw it and then 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.700
 I passed them to decorative paper now we go 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.190
 to open our card and in effect 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.740
 poop that we had done we are going to stick 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.130
 our letters and there you should go to 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.130
 beginning the heart in the middle and the 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.130
 last 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.290
 remember that you just have to put 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.840
 resistol in this part of here in this 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.300
 not only in facing her that the 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.030
 You have stuck you will stay like this 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.550
 your lyrics with a very pop top effect 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.650
 pretty and now only and now 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.750
 you only have to decorate you have 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.150
 many spaces to decorate so 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.730
 take flight your imagination and well then 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.430
 I kept my little card in this way 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.100
 I really liked how I stay 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.440
 It has a very nice effect with the 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.620
 letters here I put a circle with 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.710
 words I put details with markers 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:29.400
 with colored sheets I put bits of 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.260
 songs in this part and well then I 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.090
 He liked how was the little card 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.670
 I hope you have also 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.430
 liked do not forget that if they make it 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.350
 can you show me on my facebook and good 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.600
 I see them in the next video 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.600
 think very much goodbye
