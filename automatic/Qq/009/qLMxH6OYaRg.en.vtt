it's a horse caravan and weed we didn't

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.560 
it's a horse caravan and weed we didn't
have<00:01:13.160> any<00:01:13.280> horse<00:01:13.550> caravan<00:01:13.970> like<00:01:14.120> that<00:01:14.300> in

have any horse caravan like that in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.980 
have any horse caravan like that in
Canada<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:15.110> don't<00:01:15.350> think<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:17.450> use<00:01:17.600> Kenya

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
Canada I don't think so we use Kenya

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.590 
Canada I don't think so we use Kenya
canoes<00:01:19.870> and<00:01:20.870> yeah<00:01:21.200> anyway<00:01:21.440> what<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.010> does<00:01:22.600> is

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
canoes and yeah anyway what it does is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.690 
canoes and yeah anyway what it does is
that<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:24.020> doesn't<00:01:24.620> kill<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.100> worker<00:01:25.340> and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
that it doesn't kill the worker and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.730 
that it doesn't kill the worker and
because<00:01:26.510> if<00:01:26.630> you<00:01:26.720> kill<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.050> worker<00:01:27.230> in<00:01:27.470> you

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
because if you kill the worker in you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.500 
because if you kill the worker in you
know<00:01:27.860> nothing<00:01:28.490> happens<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.090> Queen<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.480> still

surely the old nest dies and yeah it's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.650 
surely the old nest dies and yeah it's
armed<00:02:08.269> that<00:02:08.479> up<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.820> you're<00:02:10.820> a<00:02:10.970> big<00:02:11.210> problem

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
armed that up that you're a big problem

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.720 
armed that up that you're a big problem
in<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
in the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.059 
in the
house<00:02:13.300> or<00:02:14.069> yards<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.270> mine<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.840> get<00:02:17.500> overrun

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
house or yards but in mine I get overrun

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.449 
house or yards but in mine I get overrun
with<00:02:18.250> them<00:02:18.519> like<00:02:19.300> there's<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:20.250> don't<00:02:21.250> know

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
with them like there's like I don't know

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.670 
with them like there's like I don't know
I<00:02:21.489> guess<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:22.269> perfect<00:02:22.780> breeding

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
I guess that it's perfect breeding

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.300 
I guess that it's perfect breeding
ground<00:02:24.129> for<00:02:24.250> them<00:02:24.550> over<00:02:24.700> here<00:02:25.980> since<00:02:26.980> it's<00:02:27.190> a

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
ground for them over here since it's a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.540 
ground for them over here since it's a
grass<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:29.560> dirt<00:02:29.800> has<00:02:29.980> really<00:02:30.430> good

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
grass and the dirt has really good

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.750 
grass and the dirt has really good
drainage

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
drainage

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.910 
drainage
yeah<00:02:35.730> all<00:02:36.730> right<00:02:36.940> there<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.180> go<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.860> is

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
yeah all right there you go and this is

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.860 
yeah all right there you go and this is
probably<00:02:39.549> like<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.910> have<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.239> all<00:02:40.510> year<00:02:40.660> long

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
probably like I have this all year long

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
where nothing grows and of course you're

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.650 
where nothing grows and of course you're
poisoning<00:05:13.540> your<00:05:13.720> your<00:05:13.990> your<00:05:14.410> yard<00:05:14.650> I<00:05:15.660> mean

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
poisoning your your your yard I mean

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.740 
poisoning your your your yard I mean
it's<00:05:16.870> just<00:05:16.960> crazy<00:05:17.980> when<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.820> boiling<00:05:19.510> pot<00:05:19.720> of

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
it's just crazy when the boiling pot of

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.920 
it's just crazy when the boiling pot of
water<00:05:19.870> does<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.530> same<00:05:21.210> so<00:05:22.210> yeah<00:05:22.419> I<00:05:22.690> guess

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
water does the same so yeah I guess

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.030 
water does the same so yeah I guess
that's<00:05:23.070> my<00:05:24.070> take<00:05:24.310> on<00:05:24.520> their<00:05:25.740> war<00:05:26.740> again

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040
