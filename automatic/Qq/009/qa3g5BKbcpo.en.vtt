00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
clothing is really great quality and the
first<00:01:31.260> thing<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.740> were<00:01:32.220> these<00:01:32.280> scalloped

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
first thing I got were these scalloped

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.990 
first thing I got were these scalloped
shorts

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.400 

now<00:01:43.000> I<00:01:43.030> was<00:01:43.330> super<00:01:43.659> interested<00:01:44.200> in<00:01:44.290> these

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
now I was super interested in these

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.080 
now I was super interested in these
because<00:01:44.800> I<00:01:44.950> was<00:01:45.100> already<00:01:45.340> gonna<00:01:45.520> buy<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.820> pair

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
because I was already gonna buy a pair

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.420 
because I was already gonna buy a pair
from<00:01:46.270> forever<00:01:46.630> 21<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.410> figured<00:01:47.740> why<00:01:48.400> not

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
from forever 21 so I figured why not

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.760 
from forever 21 so I figured why not
review<00:01:48.910> these<00:01:49.090> ones<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.690> I'm<00:01:50.110> not<00:01:50.320> going<00:01:50.650> to

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770
