00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.949
 hello to all shit like it goes 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.489
 I hope all is well after having died of 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.009
 new I came back to life then I have to 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.980
 say a few things before you start 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.610
 a shitty face under the last video 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.420
 concerning black hawk two wrote to me 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.930
 piston noose 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.210
 but what do you say which new modality la 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.480
 mode by rais came out five months 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.270
 ago and my makeup in astana you don't understand 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.210
 nothing is not new and old my my 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.880
 me but your parents also have children 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.820
 normal ugly stoned head of 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.040
 Fucking dick and sucking balls at least it 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.200
 you saw the video or the shit that 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.989
 has on the eyes it has dried up and has 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.689
 formed a protective crust you are 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.090
 ears in the morning in the video 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.780
 I said clearly over and over again that 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.040
 this was a new way for me 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.119
 simply because I didn't buy the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.820
 package of maps 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.490
 did you understand or did you not understand a 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.799
 fuck as usual since you're a 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.350
 half demented world I also make you a 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.329
 practical example if I buy a game 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.030
 which has been released for a year and a half 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.469
 the gap is gently placed in the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.979
 xbox 360 is new to me just not 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:39.350
 never seen or played so it's new is the 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.369
 same thing happened with this 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.130
 package of maps 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.999
 I had the chance to try it for the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.359
 first time 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:50.029
 the other day so it's new to me and 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:53.270
 for me you're just a fucking head 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:55.880
 then the other thing I wanted to tell you is that 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.209
 I recorded a mess of noda on black 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.520
 hawk two then prepare the cocks for that 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.749
 in a while a lot of videos will rain 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.609
 on multiplayer 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.909
 in the face of all those cancers that 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.840
 they hate the game just for the name 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.880
 burst into hell 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.010
 damn the doll as I already have 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.030
 said many times to have some 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.760
 valid matches 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.049
 it takes time and above all 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.470
 1 the randomness of adversaries worthy of such 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.019
 first name 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.689
 to be able to pay off a good game 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.750
 sorry for the interruption but I am 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:32.030
 its things and it is quite well shaken 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.819
 I think I said everything then 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.459
 we can begin to tell what 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.110
 an emeritus will succeed in this episode 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.120
 fucking nothing 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.670
 not because I'm in an area that doesn't 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.069
 I know I do n't know where the others are 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.560
 put one foot on the workbench for 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.019
 complete a weapon I don't know 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.420
 not even the name and above all I don't have 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.790
 idea of ​​where to go 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.959
 the only positive note is that I am armed 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.540
 of rifle 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.849
 at least I avoid using that little gun 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.549
 ugly that discourages and does none 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.980
 kind of damage I'm giving now 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.680
 look around for something 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.379
 I can come in handy during the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.019
 fights I won't go very far 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.980
 with a rifle like that even if it is 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.109
 beautiful and powerful 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.659
 the low rate of fire and the 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.220
 slow loading won't take me from 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.340
 Nowhere 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.949
 but I wonder what this weapon is for 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.349
 we will find out only by living and as me 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:33.109
 I never die sooner or later 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:36.230
 I will find out where the others are 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.870
 but it is possible that I ended up in the part 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.019
 more useless and less created than the map 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.139
 where no one ever goes there is also the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.540
 workbench is not possible 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.760
 my friends where you are 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.459
 come that I feel lonely like a 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.940
 real woman flower and I heard footsteps 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.069
 but who will ever be older than massei 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.859
 shitty fart you left me 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.209
 dying a little bit ugly child of the crisis 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.000
 economic 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.750
 then you have something to say or I can 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.449
 shoot you in the face directly puppy 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.000
 or is there something you don't tear off at 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:16.669
 ass feet and transplant towels in place 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.359
 mustache I was half dead and you are not me 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.849
 come to save fuck anyway not there 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.400
 I have you with you you're just a shitty old man 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:28.340
 finally respect older and clearer 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.230
 then I found this rifle on the floor 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.840
 below 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.420
 and how you are made in terms of weapons 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.940
 are you using that expired brewster of 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.540
 your pistolino to water the deaths 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.080
 when it shoots it seems to curl to her but 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:48.360
 what the fuck are you pea coughing 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.640
 what do you do pc at regular arabic intervals 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.370
 what the fuck we are trapped by 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.620
 in this shitty palace that could 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.810
 collapse at any moment those 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.060
 balls of programmers do not have 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.030
 not even developed an escape route e 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.550
 we are without powerful ugly weapons 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.250
 Fucking pensions I will not die for 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.880
 first but on the contrary share or on types 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.760
 grave where to die first and or smeared 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.950
 like mayonnaise you have shit in your brain 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.400
 that gushes out like the fountain of 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.190
 trevi 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.390
 glu glu glu glu glu glu glu glu sent 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.090
 how it flows out 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.430
 glu glu glu glu glu glu but tranquil 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.250
 you're not the only one who has shit in the 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.230
 brain there are many like you 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.780
 for example, like that asshole 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.560
 he writes but who makes you do it to buy 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.470
 a game with more than 100 euros that loser 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.660
 then I would like to say something you have 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.790
 wasted your life time for 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.580
 comment on my video and weapons 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.650
 unlucky just because I bought 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.900
 a game that will keep me glued to the 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.230
 screen for at least five or six years 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.410
 price of 139 euros also contributing 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:02.320
 to finance other future projects 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.810

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.190
 I'll even let you choose, you tell yourself from 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.920
 alone or I'll tell you 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.180

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.700

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.720
 private message and before shooting 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.940
 bullshit 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.430

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.010
 written at least a dozen times 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.360
 otherwise you risk making figures of 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.150
