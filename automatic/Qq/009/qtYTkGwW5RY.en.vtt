00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
system thinking so well and and I could

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.070 
system thinking so well and and I could
really<00:01:31.640> relate<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:32.750> if<00:01:32.810> it's<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.990> very

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
really relate to it so if it's a very

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.560 
really relate to it so if it's a very
powerful<00:01:33.590> experience<00:01:33.950> though<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.640> think<00:01:35.000> today

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
powerful experience though I think today

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.930 
powerful experience though I think today
it<00:01:36.289> drove<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:37.009> point<00:01:37.250> home<00:01:37.369> again

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
it drove that point home again

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.270 
it drove that point home again
