00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
quicker and do it to half a second so

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.789 
quicker and do it to half a second so
we're<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> make<00:01:51.659> all<00:01:51.899> these<00:01:52.140> go<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.590> half

we're going to make all these go at half

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.850 
we're going to make all these go at half
a<00:01:52.950> second<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:54.630> will<00:01:54.869> make<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.229> tablet

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
a second and this will make the tablet

a second and this will make the tablet
overall<00:01:56.460> run<00:01:56.820> quicker<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:58.350> other<00:01:58.470> thing
