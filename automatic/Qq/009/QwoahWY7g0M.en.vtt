00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
like the fold and unfold command and how

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.890 
like the fold and unfold command and how
they<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.639> help<00:00:14.759> us<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.150> some<00:00:15.450> cuts<00:00:15.750> that

going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> always<00:00:23.760> make<00:00:24.330> sure<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:24.869> can

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
going to always make sure that we can

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.730 
going to always make sure that we can
use<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.800> origin<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:27.380> come<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.529> draw

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
use the origin if we can come and draw

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.669 
use the origin if we can come and draw

let's go one inch there Finch
really<00:00:58.739> now<00:00:59.129> all<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.609> need<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.090> more

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
really now all we need is this one more

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.860 
really now all we need is this one more
dimension<00:01:01.340> we've<00:01:02.340> got<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> nice<00:01:02.760> fully<00:01:03.149> defined

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
sketch she metal tool bar come over and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.399 
sketch she metal tool bar come over and
use<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.520> base<00:01:08.729> flange<00:01:09.090> command<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
use the base flange command and this is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
use the base flange command and this is
gonna<00:01:10.530> work<00:01:10.710> very<00:01:11.010> similar<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.909> regular

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
gonna work very similar to the regular

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.300 
gonna work very similar to the regular
extrude<00:01:12.659> tools<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:13.979> come<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
extrude tools we actually come in and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.910 
extrude tools we actually come in and
snap<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> ruler<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.570> want<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.920> or

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
snap it to the ruler if we want to or

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.719 
snap it to the ruler if we want to or
type<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.430> length<00:01:18.799> come<00:01:19.799> over<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.310> we've<00:01:20.460> got

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
type in a length come over and we've got

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.050 
type in a length come over and we've got
a<00:01:20.909> sixteenth<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.780> an<00:01:21.869> inch<00:01:21.930> thickness<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.130> 1/8

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
a sixteenth of an inch thickness and 1/8

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
a sixteenth of an inch thickness and 1/8
inch<00:01:24.330> Bend<00:01:24.750> radius<00:01:24.960> but<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.220> want

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
inch Bend radius but what we really want

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.469 
inch Bend radius but what we really want
to<00:01:26.430> look<00:01:26.640> at<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.320> being<00:01:28.619> created

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
to look at is how this is being created

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
to look at is how this is being created
notice<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> flange<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:32.100> above<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
notice that the flange is up above the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.609 
notice that the flange is up above the
sketch<00:01:32.850> line<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.049> reverse<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
sketch line you know we can reverse the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.380 
sketch line you know we can reverse the
direction<00:01:34.770> should<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.640> pay<00:01:35.850> attention<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
direction should I pay attention to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.789 
direction should I pay attention to
which<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.930> going<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.500> how<00:01:37.740> we

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
which way this is going and how we

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.429 
which way this is going and how we
dimension<00:01:38.549> things<00:01:38.960> over<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> right

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
dimension things over here on the right

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.480 
dimension things over here on the right
side<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> little<00:01:41.280> bit<00:01:41.460> easier

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
side is going to be a little bit easier

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.810 
side is going to be a little bit easier
because<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.180> 1<00:01:42.390> inch<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> outside<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.439> outside

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
because the 1 inch is outside to outside

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
because the 1 inch is outside to outside
about<00:01:44.820> three<00:01:45.119> inches<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.869> bottom

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
about three inches is to that bottom

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.289 
about three inches is to that bottom
face<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.950> make<00:01:47.369> sure<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.579> pay<00:01:47.759> attention<00:01:47.970> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
face so make sure to pay attention to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.050 
face so make sure to pay attention to
that<00:01:48.560> go<00:01:49.560> ahead<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.009> create<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> base<00:01:50.729> flange

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that go ahead and create the base flange

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
that go ahead and create the base flange
no<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.540> got<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.170> fairly<00:01:52.380> simple<00:01:52.770> little

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
no I got a you know fairly simple little

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.969 
no I got a you know fairly simple little
sheet<00:01:53.640> metal<00:01:53.939> part<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.470> come<00:01:55.619> over<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
sheet metal part if we come over the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130 
sheet metal part if we come over the
sheet<00:01:56.250> metal<00:01:56.570> toolbar<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:57.719> we're<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
sheet metal toolbar now we're going to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.410 
sheet metal toolbar now we're going to
maybe<00:01:58.380> use<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.890> fold<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.399> unfold<00:01:59.460> command<00:02:00.180> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
maybe use the fold and unfold command so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.910 
maybe use the fold and unfold command so
a<00:02:00.509> lot<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.719> times<00:02:00.899> people<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.619> work<00:02:01.770> on

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
a lot of times people like to work on

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.429 
a lot of times people like to work on
these<00:02:02.070> parts<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.240> flat<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.140> we'll<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
these parts in the flat and we'll see a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.160 
these parts in the flat and we'll see a
couple<00:02:04.770> reasons<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.369> here<00:02:05.909> in

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
couple reasons for that here in

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.469 
couple reasons for that here in
a little<00:02:06.320> bit<00:02:06.729> when<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:07.759> come<00:02:07.970> in<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.209> use<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
a little bit when we come in and use the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.540 
a little bit when we come in and use the
unfold<00:02:09.020> tool<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.560> lot<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.950> times<00:02:10.130> what<00:02:10.369> people

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
unfold tool a lot of times what people

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.970 
unfold tool a lot of times what people
will<00:02:10.789> do<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.330> they<00:02:11.750> will<00:02:11.780> accidentally<00:02:12.470> pick<00:02:12.739> a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
will do is they will accidentally pick a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.860 
will do is they will accidentally pick a
different<00:02:13.340> face<00:02:13.790> when<00:02:14.120> they<00:02:14.209> come<00:02:14.239> back<00:02:14.569> in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
different face when they come back in

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.510 
different face when they come back in
and<00:02:15.050> fold<00:02:15.380> things<00:02:15.560> up<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.010> we<00:02:16.099> want<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.340> make

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
and fold things up so we want to make

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.720 
and fold things up so we want to make
sure<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.510> be<00:02:17.690> consistent<00:02:18.349> so<00:02:19.010> for<00:02:19.310> our<00:02:19.400> fixed

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
sure to be consistent so for our fixed

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.250 
sure to be consistent so for our fixed
face<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.150> usually<00:02:20.510> like<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.750> use<00:02:20.900> one<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
face I usually like to use one of the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
face I usually like to use one of the
main<00:02:21.470> faces<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.099> part<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.940> then<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.209> bins

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
main faces of the part and then the bins

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.660 
main faces of the part and then the bins
to<00:02:23.690> unfold<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:24.830> pick<00:02:24.980> multiple<00:02:25.400> bins

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
to unfold and I can pick multiple bins

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.000 
to unfold and I can pick multiple bins
but<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.120> case<00:02:26.330> I'm<00:02:26.510> just<00:02:26.660> gonna<00:02:26.750> pick<00:02:27.020> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
but in this case I'm just gonna pick the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.670 
but in this case I'm just gonna pick the
one<00:02:28.480> now<00:02:29.480> what<00:02:29.660> we<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.050> come<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.470> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
one now what we can do is come in and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.340 
one now what we can do is come in and
start<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.069> sketch<00:02:31.370> on<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.700> face<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.420> if<00:02:33.260> we

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
start a sketch on this face and if we

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.410 
start a sketch on this face and if we
come<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.750> maybe<00:02:35.950> draw<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.420> little

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
come in and maybe draw a little

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.449 
come in and maybe draw a little
rectangular<00:02:38.840> box<00:02:39.319> here<00:02:40.239> come<00:02:41.239> in<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.459> there

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
rectangular box here come in and there

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.360 
rectangular box here come in and there
are<00:02:43.550> some<00:02:43.700> dimensions<00:02:44.269> on<00:02:44.450> here<00:02:48.250> slide<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
are some dimensions on here slide to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.620 
are some dimensions on here slide to
find<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:49.850> guy<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.150> well

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
find this guy as well

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.030 
find this guy as well
and<00:02:51.170> come<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.519> an<00:02:52.910> extrude<00:02:53.540> cut<00:02:54.040> in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
and come in and do an extrude cut in

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.750 
and come in and do an extrude cut in
this<00:02:55.340> case<00:02:55.580> we<00:02:55.790> can<00:02:55.940> do<00:02:56.090> through<00:02:56.930> all<00:02:57.140> cut<00:02:57.440> or

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
this case we can do through all cut or

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.120 
this case we can do through all cut or
another<00:02:58.760> thing<00:02:59.030> we<00:02:59.150> can<00:02:59.269> do<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.720> a<00:03:03.069> up<00:03:04.069> to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
another thing we can do is just a up to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.479 
another thing we can do is just a up to
next<00:03:04.519> would<00:03:04.730> work<00:03:04.910> pretty<00:03:05.209> good<00:03:05.390> as<00:03:05.510> well<00:03:06.489> say

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
next would work pretty good as well say

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.840 
next would work pretty good as well say
okay<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:08.709> now<00:03:09.709> what<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:09.980> can<00:03:10.160> do<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.609> come

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
okay to that now what we can do is come

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.140 
okay to that now what we can do is come
in<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.329> use<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.170> sheet<00:03:12.440> metal<00:03:12.590> tools<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.760> fold

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
in and use the sheet metal tools to fold

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.150 
in and use the sheet metal tools to fold
this<00:03:14.269> guy<00:03:14.480> up<00:03:14.630> now<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.380> this<00:03:15.470> case<00:03:15.709> notice<00:03:15.980> it

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
this guy up now in this case notice it

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.060 
this guy up now in this case notice it
automatically<00:03:16.700> picks<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.180> same<00:03:17.510> face<00:03:18.070> for

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
automatically picks that same face for

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.250 
automatically picks that same face for
the<00:03:19.160> bottom<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.579> part<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:19.910> stay<00:03:20.120> fixed<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:21.140> we

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
the bottom the part to stay fixed and we

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.720 
the bottom the part to stay fixed and we
can<00:03:21.410> come<00:03:21.530> in<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.769> pick<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.070> bins<00:03:22.280> we<00:03:22.489> want<00:03:22.670> to

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
can come in and pick the bins we want to

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.030 
can come in and pick the bins we want to
fold<00:03:22.940> back<00:03:23.120> up<00:03:23.359> or<00:03:23.900> collect<00:03:24.380> all<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.829> bins

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
fold back up or collect all the bins

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.090 
fold back up or collect all the bins
that<00:03:25.340> have<00:03:25.459> been<00:03:25.670> unfolded<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:27.530> fold<00:03:27.859> them

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
that have been unfolded to fold them

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.330 
that have been unfolded to fold them
back<00:03:28.130> up<00:03:28.930> now<00:03:29.930> we've<00:03:30.079> got<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.260> cut<00:03:30.560> here<00:03:30.890> we

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
back up now we've got a cut here we

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.380 
back up now we've got a cut here we
could<00:03:31.459> have<00:03:31.519> done<00:03:31.730> this<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:31.880> little<00:03:32.120> bit

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
could have done this a little bit

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.330 
could have done this a little bit
differently<00:03:32.870> we<00:03:33.170> could<00:03:33.290> come<00:03:33.500> in<00:03:33.739> maybe<00:03:34.070> on

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
differently we could come in maybe on

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.330 
differently we could come in maybe on
this<00:03:34.609> face<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.180> start<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.930> sketch<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:37.130> here

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
this face and start a sketch and here

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.449 
this face and start a sketch and here
we're<00:03:37.459> gonna<00:03:37.579> come<00:03:37.820> in<00:03:38.060> draw<00:03:38.329> a<00:03:38.359> rectangle

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
we're gonna come in draw a rectangle

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.680 
we're gonna come in draw a rectangle
maybe<00:03:40.459> snap<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.239> edge<00:03:41.420> right<00:03:41.630> there

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
maybe snap it to that edge right there

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.420 
maybe snap it to that edge right there
we're<00:03:42.620> gonna<00:03:42.769> leave<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.220> know<00:03:43.280> under

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
we're gonna leave it you know under

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.030 
we're gonna leave it you know under
defined<00:03:43.880> for<00:03:44.209> now<00:03:44.359> but<00:03:45.230> we<00:03:45.530> can<00:03:45.650> come<00:03:45.859> in<00:03:46.010> and

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
defined for now but we can come in and

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.680 
defined for now but we can come in and
create<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.489> little<00:03:46.640> bit<00:03:46.760> different<00:03:47.150> type<00:03:47.540> of

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
create a little bit different type of

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.190 
create a little bit different type of
cut<00:03:47.989> now<00:03:48.859> how<00:03:49.040> far<00:03:49.340> do<00:03:49.519> we<00:03:49.549> cut<00:03:49.940> this<00:03:50.180> may<00:03:51.049> we

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
cut now how far do we cut this may we

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.550 
cut now how far do we cut this may we
come<00:03:51.500> in<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.040> say<00:03:52.609> up<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:52.880> vertex<00:03:53.450> up<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:54.140> say

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
come in and say up to vertex up to say

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920 
come in and say up to vertex up to say
at<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.549> point<00:03:55.819> right<00:03:55.940> there<00:03:56.000> it's<00:03:56.810> gonna

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
at that point right there it's gonna

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.870 
at that point right there it's gonna
give<00:03:57.109> us<00:03:57.140> a<00:03:57.350> very<00:03:57.590> similar<00:03:58.810> cut

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
give us a very similar cut

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.950 
give us a very similar cut
but<00:04:01.540> how<00:04:01.750> are<00:04:02.410> they<00:04:03.160> different<00:04:03.460> in<00:04:04.210> our<00:04:04.690> first

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
but how are they different in our first

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.930 
but how are they different in our first
cut<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.590> length<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.430> width

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
cut the length and width

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.860 
cut the length and width
maybe<00:04:07.270> that<00:04:07.480> has<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.990> do<00:04:08.170> with<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.800> size<00:04:09.070> of<00:04:09.370> a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
maybe that has to do with the size of a

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.710 
maybe that has to do with the size of a
punch<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:11.170> we<00:04:11.260> have<00:04:11.530> its<00:04:12.280> exact<00:04:12.760> shape<00:04:13.150> now

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
punch that we have its exact shape now

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.350 
punch that we have its exact shape now
in<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.990> formed<00:04:14.380> on<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.010> second<00:04:15.400> cut<00:04:15.610> there's

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
in the formed on the second cut there's

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.930 
in the formed on the second cut there's
no<00:04:16.600> easy<00:04:17.290> way<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.680> come<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.610> take<00:04:18.790> a<00:04:18.820> look

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
no easy way to come in and take a look

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.140 
no easy way to come in and take a look
at<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.450> know<00:04:19.540> how<00:04:19.810> long<00:04:20.800> that<00:04:21.130> punch<00:04:21.700> needs<00:04:22.000> to

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
at you know how long that punch needs to

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.720 
at you know how long that punch needs to
be<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.570> define<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.170> we<00:04:24.040> can<00:04:24.160> definitely<00:04:24.340> take

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
be to define that we can definitely take

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.880 
be to define that we can definitely take
a<00:04:24.790> look<00:04:25.000> at<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.300> in<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.720> in<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.260> flat<00:04:26.500> pattern

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
a look at it in the in the flat pattern

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.300 
a look at it in the in the flat pattern
and<00:04:27.160> measure<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.640> there<00:04:29.010> but<00:04:30.010> there<00:04:30.160> we've<00:04:30.280> got

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
and measure it there but there we've got

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.910 
and measure it there but there we've got
two<00:04:30.610> different<00:04:31.000> size<00:04:31.540> cutouts<00:04:32.440> so<00:04:34.770> that's<00:04:35.770> a

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
two different size cutouts so that's a

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.710 
two different size cutouts so that's a
couple<00:04:36.460> little<00:04:36.580> things<00:04:36.880> with<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.510> base

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
couple little things with the the base

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.080 
couple little things with the the base
flange<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.500> fold<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.950> unfold<00:04:39.040> just<00:04:39.970> be

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
flange and the fold and unfold just be

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.920 
flange and the fold and unfold just be
careful<00:04:40.480> with<00:04:40.770> where<00:04:41.770> we<00:04:41.950> dimension<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.580> and

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
careful with where we dimension to and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.140 
careful with where we dimension to and
which<00:04:43.930> faces<00:04:44.410> we<00:04:44.590> keep<00:04:45.070> as<00:04:45.280> our<00:04:45.580> fixed<00:04:45.970> face

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
which faces we keep as our fixed face

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.810 
which faces we keep as our fixed face
when<00:04:46.450> we<00:04:46.510> unfold<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.260> fold<00:04:47.320> again<00:04:47.740> so<00:04:48.700> this

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
when we unfold and fold again so this

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.520 
when we unfold and fold again so this

was Tony Riggs with go engineer and I

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.760 
was Tony Riggs with go engineer and I
hope<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.770> found<00:04:50.920> this<00:04:51.100> video<00:04:51.280> helpful
