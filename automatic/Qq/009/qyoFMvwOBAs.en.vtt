strong<00:04:31.720> adhesion<00:04:32.290> strength<00:04:33.000> tearing<00:04:34.000> is

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
strong adhesion strength tearing is

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.450 
strong adhesion strength tearing is
super<00:04:34.450> easy<00:04:34.480> it<00:04:35.440> doesn't<00:04:35.740> string<00:04:36.010> out<00:04:36.130> along

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
super easy it doesn't string out along

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.980 
super easy it doesn't string out along
the<00:04:36.580> edges<00:04:36.730> like<00:04:37.060> see<00:04:37.180> cheaper<00:04:37.480> tapes<00:04:37.660> will<00:04:37.840> do

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
the edges like see cheaper tapes will do

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.780 
the edges like see cheaper tapes will do
probably<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.800> most<00:04:38.890> important<00:04:39.400> feature<00:04:39.550> is

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
probably the most important feature is

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.700 
probably the most important feature is
that<00:04:39.880> it's<00:04:40.360> actually<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.660> cotton-poly<00:04:41.260> blend

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
that it's actually a cotton-poly blend

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.650 
that it's actually a cotton-poly blend
what<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.130> means<00:04:42.310> is<00:04:42.400> zero<00:04:42.700> stretch<00:04:43.030> this<00:04:43.540> is

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
what that means is zero stretch this is

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.000 
what that means is zero stretch this is
actually<00:04:43.960> going<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.169> support<00:04:44.470> your<00:04:44.620> tendons
