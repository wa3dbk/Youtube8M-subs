just a stream at life but you know under
them<00:03:02.560> circumstances<00:03:03.250> will<00:03:03.460> work<00:03:03.580> really<00:03:03.760> well

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
them circumstances will work really well

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.040 
them circumstances will work really well
and<00:03:04.270> it's<00:03:04.690> very<00:03:05.050> handy<00:03:05.380> okay
