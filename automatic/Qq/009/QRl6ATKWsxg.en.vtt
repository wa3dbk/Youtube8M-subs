lacombe corn maze looks quite familiar

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.829 
lacombe corn maze looks quite familiar
we're<00:00:05.279> always<00:00:05.400> looking<00:00:05.549> for<00:00:05.730> something<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.450> do

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
we're always looking for something to do

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.179 
we're always looking for something to do
and<00:00:07.109> we<00:00:07.379> were<00:00:07.620> looking<00:00:07.770> through<00:00:08.010> some

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
and we were looking through some

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.980 
and we were looking through some
magazines<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.940> stuff<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.269> saw<00:00:09.450> these<00:00:09.719> QR

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
magazines and stuff and saw these QR

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.450 
magazines and stuff and saw these QR
codes<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.530> thought<00:00:10.710> those<00:00:11.040> kind<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.309> look

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
codes and thought those kind of look

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.709 
codes and thought those kind of look
like<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.610> maze<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.090> wonder<00:00:12.300> if<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.420> could<00:00:12.540> make

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
like a maze I wonder if we could make

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.810 
like a maze I wonder if we could make
one<00:00:12.900> making<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.320> maze<00:00:13.530> in<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.830> form<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.400> QR

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
one making a maze in the form of a QR

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.490 
one making a maze in the form of a QR
code<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.509> thing<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> Kray<00:00:16.470> family

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
code is one thing but the Kray family

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.010 
code is one thing but the Kray family
took<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.340> step<00:00:17.369> further<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> whim<00:00:18.750> we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
took it a step further just on a whim we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.210 
took it a step further just on a whim we
thought<00:00:19.199> hey<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.470> wonder<00:00:19.650> if<00:00:19.770> we<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:19.980> make<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
thought hey I wonder if we can make the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.279 
thought hey I wonder if we can make the
world's<00:00:20.609> largest<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.930> did<00:00:22.080> some

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
world's largest so we kind of did some

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.189 
world's largest so we kind of did some
research<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.640> found<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.539> if<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.960> did<00:00:25.170> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
research and found out that if we did it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
research and found out that if we did it
would<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.470> substantially<00:00:26.310> larger<00:00:26.699> than<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
would be substantially larger than the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.990 
would be substantially larger than the
previous<00:00:27.990> record<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:29.340> are<00:00:29.519> submitting

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
previous record so we are submitting

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
previous record so we are submitting
evidence<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.750> Guinness<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.260> now<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> try<00:00:31.740> to

is<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.469> QR<00:00:34.860> code<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.579> not<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.360> show

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
is a QR code and it's not just for show

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440

there<00:00:55.230> are<00:00:55.410> four<00:00:55.800> courses<00:00:56.250> starting<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.149> the

there are four courses starting with the
kids<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.230> pretty<00:00:58.440> short<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.399> is

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
kids it's pretty short so the look is

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.729 
kids it's pretty short so the look is
just<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:00.090> fun<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> run<00:01:00.660> around<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:01.500> we

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
just have fun and run around then we

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.750 
just have fun and run around then we
have<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.670> easier<00:01:03.030> course<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.760> not

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
have the easier course which is not

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.300 
have the easier course which is not
quite<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.270> long<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.990> harder<00:01:07.890> than<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
quite as long but it's harder than the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670 
quite as long but it's harder than the
mini<00:01:08.939> ones<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> have<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> medium<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.300 
mini ones then you have the medium and
then<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:12.530> longest<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.280> is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
then we have the longest one which is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.039 
then we have the longest one which is
