 however the attacker at the 20th protest 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.009
 still the Sestrese for an alleged

 raiola beraldo is served in the area on 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 to the thirtieth third protest for a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.530

 of the hosts who protest to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.820

 the second half is removed yes 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.660
 opens immediately with the lorieri who tries the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.949
 banging from outside his shot comes out a little

 lorieri the fezzanese doubles the defense 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.520
 della sestrese is surprising the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.689
 cross ends in the network thanks to the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.640
 detour of a defender of the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.229
 verdestellati at the 22nd still a 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.760
 counter-attack for the fezzanese this 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.560
 time and bold to become dangerous with 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.850
 a blow from outside deflected for a corner from 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.710
 spoils given to the thirtieth 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.700
 thirty-second assistance the occasion 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.770
 to reopen the game 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.939
 first try mosetti on punishment but 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.409
 his shot is removed from the mirror 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.150
 from bertagna two minutes later 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.990
 tancredi devours the occasion for 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.640
 reopen the match 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 his shot is in fact deflected for a corner 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.150
 at the 36th still tangredi ha 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.740
 the opportunity for 2 to 1 but is found of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.990
 yet another counter-attack closed 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.060
 masterfully by baldi who puts on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.229
 first post and leads his on the 3 0 for the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.790
 joy of the companions 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.829
 so ends a lot 3 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 fun conditioned perhaps by some 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.340
 the choice of the revisable triad is the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.220
 second internal defeat for the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.570
 sestrese thanks also to the counter-attacks 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.570
 masterful by the fezzanese
