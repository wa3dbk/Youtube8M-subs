00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
slide down one fret to the G triplet

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.390 
slide down one fret to the G triplet
pull<00:01:13.439> off<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:14.850> same<00:01:15.210> pattern<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:16.400> we're

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
pull off that same pattern here we're

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
pull off that same pattern here we're
going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:19.850> triplet<00:01:20.850> pull<00:01:21.000> offs<00:01:21.150> on

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
when he's not going at that blistering

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.380 
when he's not going at that blistering
spree<00:01:56.590> speed<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:57.280> he<00:01:57.729> would<00:01:57.880> play<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.119> look

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390

spree speed and he would play to look
like<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:05.759> he<00:02:06.759> was<00:02:06.909> also<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:08.259> know<00:02:08.289> about

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
like but he was also you know about

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:21.780 
like but he was also you know about
speed<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:19.269> if<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.750> want<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.260> good<00:02:21.069> exercise

about<00:02:23.340> emulating<00:02:24.340> his<00:02:24.700> style<00:02:25.090> with<00:02:25.450> triplets

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
about emulating his style with triplets

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.470 
about emulating his style with triplets
I<00:02:26.370> would<00:02:27.370> do<00:02:27.519> that<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.730> would<00:02:28.030> practice<00:02:28.180> this

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
I would do that I would practice this

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:41.610 
I would do that I would practice this
slow<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:38.099> then<00:02:39.099> with<00:02:39.340> double<00:02:39.670> picking<00:02:40.620> which

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
slow and then with double picking which

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.330 
slow and then with double picking which
is<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.859> say<00:02:42.040> up<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.430> down<00:02:42.609> very<00:02:42.850> quickly

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
is to say up and down very quickly

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.630 
is to say up and down very quickly
and<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.420> would<00:02:45.810> play<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.020> pattern<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:47.550> a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and I would play that pattern at a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.930 
and I would play that pattern at a
higher<00:02:48.270> speed<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:50.750> but<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.520> this<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.580> I

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
higher speed the but this is this is I

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.520 
higher speed the but this is this is I
think<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.330> good<00:02:54.480> exercise<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:55.050> what<00:02:55.620> he<00:02:55.739> did

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.410 

remember<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.160> this<00:03:02.670> first<00:03:02.970> pull<00:03:03.300> off

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
remember this this this first pull off

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.839 
remember this this this first pull off
that<00:03:03.450> we're<00:03:03.690> doing<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.950> repeat<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.370> here<00:03:08.700> on

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
that we're doing you repeat it here on

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.860 
that we're doing you repeat it here on
the<00:03:09.599> G<00:03:09.840> or<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.290> D<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.709> G<00:03:11.720> you'll<00:03:12.720> pick

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
the G or the D and the G you'll pick

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:25.020 
the G or the D and the G you'll pick
again<00:03:13.140> here<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> low<00:03:13.800> E<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.280> they

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.869 

anyway<00:03:26.050> that's<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.170> cool<00:03:27.440> it's<00:03:28.280> not<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:28.700> much<00:03:28.819> a

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
anyway that's a cool it's not so much a

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:35.380 
anyway that's a cool it's not so much a
lick<00:03:29.860> as<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:31.190> is<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.550> exercise<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.970> where<00:03:35.180> we're

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
lick as it is a exercise and where we're

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.990 
lick as it is a exercise and where we're
playing<00:03:35.810> here<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:37.459> box<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.819> we<00:03:37.940> were

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
playing here the box that we were

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.820 
playing here the box that we were
playing<00:03:38.299> here<00:03:38.569> would<00:03:38.780> be<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.379> key<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
playing here would be in the key of a

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.140 
playing here would be in the key of a
