here<00:02:02.100> everyone<00:02:02.880> feels<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.689> their

here everyone feels that this is their
school<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.070> that's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
school and I think that's what that's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.069 
school and I think that's what that's
the<00:02:05.610> sense<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.210> get<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:06.990> you

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the sense that you get when you when you

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.900 
the sense that you get when you when you
walk<00:02:07.259> into<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.500> classroom<00:02:07.770> when<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.459> talk<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.879> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
walk into a classroom when you talk to a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.120 
walk into a classroom when you talk to a
teacher<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.479> talk<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.780> any<00:02:09.929> member

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.330 

I<00:02:15.570> think<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.720> really<00:02:16.960> was<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.380> secret<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
I think that really was the secret to

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.030 
I think that really was the secret to
our<00:02:18.370> success<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.870> we<00:02:20.170> just<00:02:20.800> kept

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
our success is that we just kept

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.850 
our success is that we just kept
plugging<00:02:21.490> along<00:02:21.790> we<00:02:22.540> knew<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.200> if<00:02:23.380> we<00:02:23.410> kept

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
plugging along we knew that if we kept

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.710 
plugging along we knew that if we kept
working<00:02:24.040> hard<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.880> would<00:02:25.090> happen<00:02:25.450> over<00:02:25.570> time

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
working hard it would happen over time

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.200 
working hard it would happen over time
