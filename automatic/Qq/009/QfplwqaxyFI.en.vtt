with a DSLR or large tipped camcorder

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.990 
with a DSLR or large tipped camcorder
you<00:00:15.259> know<00:00:15.559> that<00:00:15.769> one<00:00:15.950> of<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.160> key<00:00:16.369> things<00:00:16.730> is

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
you know that one of the key things is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.300 
you know that one of the key things is
shallow<00:00:17.390> depth<00:00:17.750> of<00:00:17.900> field<00:00:18.230> which<00:00:18.530> is<00:00:18.710> achieved

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
shallow depth of field which is achieved

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.730 
shallow depth of field which is achieved
with<00:00:19.580> a<00:00:19.610> wide<00:00:19.910> aperture<00:00:20.270> then<00:00:20.900> then<00:00:21.170> requires

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
with a wide aperture then then requires

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.730 
with a wide aperture then then requires
an<00:00:22.070> ND<00:00:22.520> filter<00:00:22.870> as<00:00:23.870> you<00:00:24.020> then<00:00:24.200> know<00:00:24.440> what<00:00:24.470> an

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
an ND filter as you then know what an

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.860 
an ND filter as you then know what an
absolute<00:00:25.310> painting<00:00:25.970> is<00:00:26.120> to<00:00:26.360> keep<00:00:26.540> switching

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:26.870 
absolute painting is to keep switching

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.200 
absolute painting is to keep switching
filters<00:00:27.650> so<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.010> most<00:00:28.340> likely<00:00:28.850> got<00:00:29.150> a

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
filters so you most likely got a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.650 
filters so you most likely got a
variable<00:00:29.750> nd<00:00:30.440> fader<00:00:31.119> they<00:00:32.119> are<00:00:32.300> of<00:00:32.419> course

variable nd fader they are of course

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.750 
variable nd fader they are of course
extremely<00:00:33.110> expensive<00:00:33.770> if<00:00:34.160> you<00:00:34.310> want<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.610> really

the absolute agony of unscrewing Andry
screwing<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.660> stupid<00:00:51.230> fader<00:00:51.970> when<00:00:52.970> all<00:00:53.120> that

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
screwing that stupid fader when all that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.330 
screwing that stupid fader when all that
is<00:00:53.510> about<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.960> get<00:00:54.140> at<00:00:54.350> least<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.800> little<00:00:55.010> bit

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
is about to get at least a little bit

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.540 
is about to get at least a little bit
less<00:00:55.730> painful<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:57.140> zoom<00:00:57.380> system<00:00:57.860> consists<00:00:58.460> of

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
less painful the zoom system consists of

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.639 
less painful the zoom system consists of
a<00:00:58.640> little<00:00:58.880> filter<00:00:59.210> ring<00:00:59.510> with<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.809> magnet<00:01:00.440> that

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
a little filter ring with a magnet that

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.149 
a little filter ring with a magnet that
you<00:01:00.770> screw<00:01:01.010> into<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.550> step-up<00:01:01.940> ring<00:01:02.270> or<00:01:02.450> lens

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
you screw into the step-up ring or lens

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.840 
you screw into the step-up ring or lens
and<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:06.229> also<00:01:06.380> get<00:01:06.710> a<00:01:06.740> little<00:01:07.040> adapter<00:01:07.370> which

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
and you also get a little adapter which

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:19.569 
and you also get a little adapter which
you<00:01:08.030> screw<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.479> to<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.810> fader<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.409> then

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:26.990 

okay<00:01:20.579> let's<00:01:20.759> take<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.329> more<00:01:21.360> time<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:26.939> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
okay let's take it one more time this is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.950 
okay let's take it one more time this is
by<00:01:27.299> fs100<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.619> cost<00:01:28.890> me<00:01:29.009> more<00:01:29.369> than<00:01:29.960> $3,000

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
by fs100 and it cost me more than $3,000

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.580 
by fs100 and it cost me more than $3,000
less<00:01:31.500> than<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.369> c100<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.600> still<00:01:33.899> wanted<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
less than the c100 and I still wanted a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.370 
less than the c100 and I still wanted a
c100<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.819> for<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.149> built-in<00:01:36.509> Indies<00:01:36.990> even

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
c100 just for the built-in Indies even

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.870 
c100 just for the built-in Indies even
though<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.649> Sonia<00:01:38.039> has<00:01:38.159> much<00:01:38.429> more<00:01:38.670> other

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
though the Sonia has much more other

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.499 
though the Sonia has much more other
features<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.929> want<00:01:40.280> but<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.789> don't

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
features that I want but now I don't

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.929 
features that I want but now I don't
really<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> problem<00:01:43.649> anymore<00:01:43.939> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
really see the problem anymore the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.330 
really see the problem anymore the
question<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.630> does<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.079> vignette<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.099> does

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
question now is does it vignette it does

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.469 
question now is does it vignette it does
not<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.819> my<00:01:48.090> fs100<00:01:48.899> nor<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.799> my<00:01:49.979> sony<00:01:50.369> an<00:01:50.640> x5<00:01:51.179> t

millimeter<00:01:55.020> lens<00:01:55.319> all<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.950> fine<00:01:56.220> but<00:01:56.459> if<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.670> go

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
millimeter lens all is fine but if I go

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.179 
millimeter lens all is fine but if I go
wild<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.329> 24<00:01:57.990> millimeters<00:01:58.500> there<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.979> some

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wild with 24 millimeters there is some

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.249 
wild with 24 millimeters there is some
vignetting<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.939> tested<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> zoom<00:02:01.049> lens

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
vignetting I tested with the zoom lens

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.080 
vignetting I tested with the zoom lens
and<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> seems<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.069> start<00:02:02.369> somewhere<00:02:02.700> around

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and it seems to start somewhere around

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.559 
and it seems to start somewhere around
35<00:02:03.720> millimeters<00:02:04.849> but<00:02:05.849> for<00:02:06.060> all<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.539> out
