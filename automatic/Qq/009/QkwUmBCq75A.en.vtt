00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.090
 as everyone knows him and boxer ys 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.860
 died has not yet left the 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:16.759
 update all this by exposing the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:18.939
 julián update since it appears is 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:22.630
 but I'm going to teach them to 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:26.869
 update it and put it in a program 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.349
 this book ignored with the 61-60 chip and 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.710
 something not the 3001 crescent that was also 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.480
 that I have a program that put the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.700
 partner 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.450
 who are using all as for 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.450
 transform your 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.360
 we had 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.560
 in that 3100 true that I do not have 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.610
 compressed 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.610
 we will not like 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.140
 I'm going to open it 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.390
 and once I 'm going to open it now 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.390
 full 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.360
 and what am I going to do I'm going to occupy is I'm going to 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 open the three true 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.760
 and the only thing I'm going to do now is going to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.460
 be change the policy 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.460
 then in this case they were being very much 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.240
 I'll put 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.510
 choose 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.490
 Y 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.490
 with my card that I have here 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 I'm going to put ebooks 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.310
 I have a vulva not easy in team 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.370
 stern and books with five in established 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.460
 and we are going to press 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.390
 choose and once we have that what 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.390
 we connect the current 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.400
 in this case 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.400
 To sign 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.730
 I am 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.240
 and we connect the current this and 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.069
 let's see what is going to start going 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.000
 to erase 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.830
 already 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.170
 then we disconnect from the current like this 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:40.160
 we change the 'airis' 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.170
 download we search the files in this 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.590
 If the file does not appear, the file does not appear 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.720
 zoom 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.950
 but we're going to give and we change it for the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.450
 art 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.450
 and so now this once 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.879
 like today 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.959
 it seems to me a program I took it from here 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.050
 do not take what I asked for here then we go 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.650
 put the where to try 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:16.020
 in this case the bus brings this chip or the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.970
 new that x 61 02 already but there is a nexus 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.770
 old that brings in this case the other 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:26.160
 chip the gx 3001 in this case as not me 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.220
 and let him go and go and I have the one 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.850
 put and I'm going to load it and now 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.620
 new I put my current there 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.620
 let's hope it's going to be loading 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.470
 remember that this new book with the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.490
 new chip 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.490
 let's load 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.000
 then I thought I had been working 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.890
 following 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.890
 to go down is the water and it's not me 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.660
 once you load all this 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.010
 you have to wait it takes a little bit but 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.300
 I'm doing it without cutting so that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.660
 you realize that there is not one 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.360
 pillería or anything that can be 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.040
 and as you can prove you can 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.019
 transform apc 40 bs 30 are and view 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.970
 the 2 that you want can put them 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.530
 so alive he has not died 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.330
 so that we all have something 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.970
 apparently they say there was a new 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.669
 updates alarms and what can 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.740
 do so they go down in everything on the internet 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.950
 google and look for solution 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.770
 and you 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.770
 and it seems that the solution is to change the 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.910
 laws among a thousand always 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.590
 anything you have to see that if I do not 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.069
 they leave it on the little note and I put them in 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.069
 the update 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.210
 we see that it is already lengthening the down 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.460
 already charged the tone now we close it 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.520
 Miller closes that which now happened to be 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.259
 a program here I have the gift in 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.659
 serious to try 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:12.259
 let's open select the file the 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.760
 last of the 26 of the 7 of the 2013 and the 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.060
 we open again 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.460
 and we press load and now we do 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.550
 unplug and plugged 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.880
 again and we see that it's going to start 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.880
 load 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.790
 now we expect you to carry nothing else there 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.010
 ah 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.790
 and 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.230
 the 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.390
 same 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.370
 and 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.320
 we present our true 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.820
 and we plug it back in 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.820
 we verify that to turn on the light 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:07:00.179
 and the light will remain fixed now as it 

00:06:56.609 --> 00:07:03.349
 see the pro van all fixed and now what 

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:03.349
 let's go 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:08.709
 the antenna of the past 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:09.610
 we are going to need it to double goodbye to 

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:14.439
 Salt 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:18.520
 of wifi with the drive and now let's see 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:21.150
 how the track is working and we have 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.020
 another vance 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.020
 in the 13th 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:32.610
 millions 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.610
 something is not right not once 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.960
 You've never had 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:47.300
 most of the return channels of 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.300
 new there are channels and there will be none 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:04.870
 I hope you liked the study 

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:09.240
 Of course we are already with a computer 

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.240
 I live working as pro one 

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.370
 I hope you like your comments. 

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.370
 things thanks
