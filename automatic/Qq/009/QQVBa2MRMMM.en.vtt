that this it's a little harder to go

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.130 
that this it's a little harder to go
through<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:42.960> move

through and this like you can move

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.080 
through and this like you can move
faster<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.460> once<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:44.969> in

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090
