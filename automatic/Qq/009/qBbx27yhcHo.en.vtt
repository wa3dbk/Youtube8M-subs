00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
primary things to use in winemaking of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
primary things to use in winemaking of
which<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.080> home<00:01:13.229> wine<00:01:13.439> maker<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.220> well

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
which a home wine maker can have as well

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.950 
which a home wine maker can have as well
and<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.760> total<00:01:15.090> investments<00:01:15.630> only<00:01:15.720> about

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and the total investments only about

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.260 
and the total investments only about
five<00:01:16.200> hundred<00:01:16.560> dollars<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.670> basically<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
five hundred dollars that is basically a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.390 
five hundred dollars that is basically a
refractometer<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:19.680> measures<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.369> sugar

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
refractometer which measures the sugar

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280 
refractometer which measures the sugar
content<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.390> grape<00:01:21.659> juice<00:01:21.689> before

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.070 
content of grape juice before
fermentation<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:23.520> also<00:01:23.700> need<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> pH<00:01:24.420> meter<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
fermentation we also need a pH meter the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.200 
fermentation we also need a pH meter the
pH<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.650> measure<00:01:25.830> an<00:01:26.159> acid<00:01:27.030> type

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
pH will measure an acid type

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
pH will measure an acid type
relationship<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> wine<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.430> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
relationship of the wine you want a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
relationship of the wine you want a
thermometer<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.869> measure<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> temperature

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
thermometer to measure the temperature

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
thermometer to measure the temperature
the<00:01:31.890> wine<00:01:32.070> during<00:01:32.369> storage<00:01:32.759> during

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the wine during storage during

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.480 
the wine during storage during
fermentation<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.470> most<00:01:34.619> important<00:01:35.280> most

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
fermentation and the most important most

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
fermentation and the most important most
crucial<00:01:35.970> element<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.720> wine<00:01:36.900> laboratory

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
crucial element in the wine laboratory

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.560 
crucial element in the wine laboratory
is<00:01:37.680> your<00:01:37.950> palate<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.970> taste<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> wine

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
is your palate so you can taste the wine

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
is your palate so you can taste the wine
you<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.439> evolving<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.310> can

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you know where it's evolving and you can

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280 
you know where it's evolving and you can
taste<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.939> there's<00:01:42.119> any<00:01:42.270> direction<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
taste if there's any direction that you

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560 
taste if there's any direction that you
don't<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> wine<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.310> into<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.390> nice

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
don't want the wine to go into the nice

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300 
don't want the wine to go into the nice
thing<00:01:45.840> about<00:01:45.869> wine<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.159> no

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
thing about wine is there are no

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.249 
thing about wine is there are no
