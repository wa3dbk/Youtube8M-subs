00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:15.360
 he mentions the location of the ball I can 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.039
 use with the spring you can 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.039
 copulate with death usually 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.740
 much hugs the nose 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.020
 I'm trying to reach a form 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.410
 final of the plot already with the forging 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.780
 because for me it is a speech by 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:52.600
 time re-enactment though 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.090
 tried to use at least as possible 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.670
 stones with ribbons to avoid 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.530
 the consumption of the stone itself of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.440
 mola we remember a moment the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.970
 tradition of the hunchback bruzzese production 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.759
 of the type knife precisely ours 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:15.119
 region that in the opinion the first specimens 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.759
 around the first half of the eighteenth century 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.580
 in the field aims of those who do not 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.490
 they also recognize some specimens like 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.880
 first like this they have retention 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.070
 of the blade the block which is however a 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.270
 heritage of the state of the church why 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.470
 the state church knives 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.289
 they had presented this 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:41.619
 feature that is aimed at the ad 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.310
 a different use of one's own 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.500
 defense purposes the attack however in some 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.130
 ancient Abruzzo specimens from here a 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.130
 work 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.979
 and it is to this picture that it is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.829
 this is a group from 1850 that I 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.829
 I realize precisely after having it 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.160
 after viewing this image that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:16.850
 I found on an internet address book 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:18.500
 so as you can see almost got now is 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.480
 small stain I made for facts 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.480
 explain to you how to engrave the initials 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.270
 I try as much as possible to reach the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.980
 original form and if an ancient horn 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.900
 with green and white streaks that 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.459
 currently quite difficult to 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.180
 to find 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.360
 I prefer to do all blacks than even 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.040
 the colors we move we change a 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.920
 yes we say that it goes through a burn on the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.570
 new also some different nuances 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.800
 each shade slightly more more 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.800
 marched on the clear 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:16.190
 I proceed to the cutting of the state which 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.190
 can do I make an incision 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.370
 the opposite 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.370
 almost terminal plants the more it is made 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.410
 principal has experience closed yes 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.810
 took on the forging will not suffice 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.209
 etc. my opinion this work of 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.120
 cut it so do it just before 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.700
 from the amateur camp you want khatri there 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.010
 goes to win in the home manuals because 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.290
 writes leads even to support the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.590
 almost final almost final form of the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.620
 wool with even grooves 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:09.290
 of the Bible only lasts one 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.290
 metal piece up in pink 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.880
 I had never seen
