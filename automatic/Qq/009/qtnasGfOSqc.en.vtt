welcome to Road race motor sports today
we're<00:00:02.460> going<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.610> show<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.939> do<00:00:03.120> an<00:00:03.270> install

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
we're going to show how to do an install

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.599 
we're going to show how to do an install
on<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.929> road<00:00:04.170> race<00:00:04.380> motor<00:00:04.589> sport<00:00:04.890> smart<00:00:05.279> power

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
on a road race motor sport smart power

on a road race motor sport smart power
intake<00:00:06.450> system<00:00:06.870> for<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> Jeep<00:00:09.679> this<00:00:10.679> system

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
intake system for a Jeep this system

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.759 
intake system for a Jeep this system
comes<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.090> short<00:00:12.570> ram<00:00:12.750> intake<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:13.349> well<00:00:13.620> as

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
comes with a short ram intake as well as

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.919 
comes with a short ram intake as well as
a<00:00:13.889> piggyback<00:00:14.190> reason<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.269> beam<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.870> a

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
a piggyback reason for that beam is a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.510 
a piggyback reason for that beam is a
lot<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.440> times<00:00:16.590> when<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.770> put<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.070> intake<00:00:17.369> on

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
lot of times when you put an intake on

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.970 
lot of times when you put an intake on
your<00:00:17.699> car<00:00:18.020> tends<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> lean<00:00:19.350> out<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> air<00:00:19.770> fuel

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
your car tends to lean out the air fuel

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.929 
your car tends to lean out the air fuel
ratio<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.510> piggyback<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.230> actually

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
ratio so the piggyback is actually

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.710 
ratio so the piggyback is actually
working<00:00:24.410> modifying<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.920> map<00:00:26.369> sensor<00:00:26.820> reading

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
working modifying the map sensor reading

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.140 
working modifying the map sensor reading
to<00:00:28.230> optimized<00:00:28.680> air/fuel<00:00:28.890> ratios<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.880> give<00:00:30.029> you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to optimized air/fuel ratios to give you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.370 
to optimized air/fuel ratios to give you
the<00:00:30.269> maximum<00:00:30.449> amount<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.960> power<00:00:31.109> throughout

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the maximum amount of power throughout

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590 
the maximum amount of power throughout
your<00:00:31.590> entire<00:00:31.679> entire<00:00:32.399> power<00:00:32.700> band<00:00:32.940> pretty

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
your entire entire power band pretty

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.190 
your entire entire power band pretty
much<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:33.930> idle<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.280> way<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> red<00:00:35.760> line

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
much from idle all the way to red line

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
much from idle all the way to red line
so<00:00:37.200> works<00:00:38.100> good<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.730> guys<00:00:38.879> who<00:00:39.030> are<00:00:39.059> going

to be rock crawling gives you a little

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.990 
to be rock crawling gives you a little
bit<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.680> extra<00:00:40.890> torque<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> bottom<00:00:41.670> end<00:00:41.820> as

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
bit of extra torque in the bottom end as

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.660

and put that on get that nice on and
tight<00:02:37.440> once<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:38.650> your<00:02:38.739> intake<00:02:39.070> where

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
tight once you have your intake where

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.560 
tight once you have your intake where
you<00:02:39.340> want<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.970> can<00:02:40.120> start<00:02:40.330> on<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
you want it you can start on the

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.699 
you want it you can start on the
piggyback<00:02:43.680> which<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.989> look<00:02:47.020> at<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.470> back

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
piggyback which if you look at the back

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.890 
piggyback which if you look at the back
of<00:02:47.920> your<00:02:48.040> intake<00:02:48.340> manifold<00:02:48.880> up<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:49.840> is

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
of your intake manifold up here this is

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.410 
of your intake manifold up here this is
your<00:02:50.200> map<00:02:50.410> sensor<00:02:50.890> we<00:02:51.730> already<00:02:51.850> went<00:02:52.270> ahead

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
your map sensor we already went ahead

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.100 
your map sensor we already went ahead
and<00:02:53.550> remove<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.989> stock<00:02:56.320> clip<00:02:57.810> from<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.870> map

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
and remove the stock clip from the map

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.290 
and remove the stock clip from the map
sensor<00:02:59.320> so<00:02:59.650> once<00:02:59.830> you<00:02:59.890> take<00:03:00.070> that<00:03:00.220> off<00:03:00.370> simply

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
sensor so once you take that off simply

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.810 
sensor so once you take that off simply
plug<00:03:01.870> in<00:03:02.730> male<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:04.000> female<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:05.800> both<00:03:06.130> ends<00:03:06.430> of

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
plug in male to female on both ends of

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.300 
plug in male to female on both ends of
the<00:03:06.880> sensor<00:03:09.480> piggyback<00:03:10.480> looks<00:03:10.959> like<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.380> as

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the sensor piggyback looks like this as

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.910 
the sensor piggyback looks like this as
you<00:03:12.640> can<00:03:12.730> see<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.090> comes<00:03:13.270> with<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.690> lot<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.500> extra

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
you can see it comes with a lot of extra

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.300 
you can see it comes with a lot of extra
wire<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.930> can<00:03:17.170> just<00:03:17.380> tie<00:03:17.770> this<00:03:17.830> out<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
wire so you can just tie this out of the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.600 
wire so you can just tie this out of the
way<00:03:18.370> nice<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.970> neat<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:20.040> put<00:03:21.040> your<00:03:21.220> piggy

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
way nice and neat and put your piggy

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.410 
way nice and neat and put your piggy
back<00:03:21.790> in<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.150> safe<00:03:22.780> location<00:03:24.000> away<00:03:25.000> from<00:03:25.030> heat

away from moisture we usually like to

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.509 
away from moisture we usually like to
put<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.209> right<00:03:28.390> behind<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.870> battery<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.519> you

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
put it right behind the battery and you

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.729 
put it right behind the battery and you
can<00:03:30.700> either<00:03:30.790> double<00:03:31.540> double<00:03:32.079> sided<00:03:32.290> tape<00:03:32.410> this
