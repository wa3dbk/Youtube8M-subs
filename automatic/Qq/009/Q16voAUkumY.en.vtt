00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.990
 well I am a sea I come from observer 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.760
 I am working here in Honduras for 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.960
 honduras choluteca for workforce 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.650
 wolfart and trying to take care of more 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.230
 horses in this area 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.860
 at this moment I'm going to make a 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.740
 gamarra with a polypropylene rope 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.079
 similar to silk of a size 5 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.860
 yards and a half well we proceed to measure 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.850
 in a very practical way either a 2 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.879
 we have 2 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.400
 in two rods we have to elaborate 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.640
 our first correct knot 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.730
 It has to be in two exact rods 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.590
 to give the correct measurement then 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.240
 we proceed with 9 inches more or 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.310
 less is this 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.310
 with a second knot the second part 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.430
 well now we proceed with another new 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.210
 measure yes 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.640
 more or less we have 13 inches to this 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.620
 distance we make a knot that 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.350
 button flame like this quickly and 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.280
 practice yes 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.280
 thus 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.420
 we do this first part and then we give 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.940
 a turn to continue with the same knot 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.430
 if I repeat it is 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:47.770
 in a very practical way 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:53.130
 elaborate this range well 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.130
 we continue like knitting a knot 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.670
 here 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.189
 we continue with the same strings here 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.290
 you have to have a lot of practice to do 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.230
 this gamarra takes hours of practice 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.709
 learn it 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.640
 having this new one we proceed to touch it 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.640
 duly 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.640
 to have part of him 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.000
 of the muzzle if we press it here 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.000
 shape 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.610
 it takes a little strength to be able 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:49.600
 tighten it if having what is the muzzle 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.140
 we proceed to the hip part 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.140
 yes 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.490
 always making knots in it 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.490
 rope 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.480
 very well 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.360
 we proceed with this new double 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.360
 square and then we apply 9 inches 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.579
 this correct distance 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.849
 we proceed by always making turns with the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.849
 rope 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.500
 this is a somewhat complicated knot that 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.260
 he wants many times quite practical 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.969
 because there are knots that go for the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.510
 left side of other knots that go 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.510
 for the right side 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.420
 we proceed with the same measures 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.420
 previous we continue working 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.150
 to make this camera the only thing 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.080
 what to learn are these two new two 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.710
 new squares and the button knot 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.250
 we verify the measure 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.480
 that is at the same distance 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.480
 of this previous node 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.070
 we squeeze 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.639
 we go to for our our 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.990
 next avalanche or if it is this in this 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.990
 moment on this occasion 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 we match the new ones for the parts of the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.830
 muzzle 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.840
 verify that the knots are at 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.620
 same distance 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.639
 so that it has a little aesthetics 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.639
 we work with the following string 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.510
 here 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.560
 it was similar almost all 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.880
 the knots 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.880
 they come to be the same 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.240
 we give the same distance we proceed 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.300
 again with another knot equal to the 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.300
 previous 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:33.770
 we verify that all the knots 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.360
 have the same distance yes 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.360
 they are the same 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:46.500
 that it is verifying 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.990
 the correct symmetry we proceed to 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.620
 make the knot of the side part gadera 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.620
 of the head 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.530
 and at this moment we ran out of rope 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.270
 and we present a practical gamarra yes 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.990
 for the horse 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:12.950
 we are teaching the street in whw for 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:16.900
 here in Honduras to dominate 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.900
 everyone who goes from here in the area 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:24.820
 in this way the barge is manufactured 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.660
 a very resistant gamarra for a 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.730
 work horse 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.550
 a gamarra for the weather for the 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.050
 water for the sun to withstand any 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.520
 adversity 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.620
 all right 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.539
 at this moment we proceed to test it 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.490
 gamarra at this point that stands out in 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:45.880
 this horse and let's see how he has left 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:50.569
 so that this horse looks wonderful 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:53.960
 with this gamarra it looks nice to see 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:59.349
 in this way that the big bar is 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.349
 finished and we installed it on a horse 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.100
 it's like that
