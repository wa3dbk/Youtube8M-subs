00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.580
 let's put 50 percent and see 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.800
 we can put it in the same way 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.920
 without transparency or transparency that 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.990

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.020
 is ahead of us in the same way we are going 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.060
 to do with these from here we can 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.300
 change what transparency is 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.970
 here we are here we demarcate this first 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.620
 option to be able to put it behind 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.019
 the Windows 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.860

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.380
 we said that if we move them in 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.570
