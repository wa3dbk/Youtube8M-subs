 in thick clouds and to explain the picture around the inner thigh 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.149
 of the rider bend 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.569
 Riding instructors often speak of an even look through the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 Mobility of the spine is not the same everywhere 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 been a perfectly balanced wanted to ride is one of the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.720
 hardest lessons for the missing 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.840
 the sideways movement arises mainly in the neck and especially at the neck 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.250
 Approach to excessive shutdown of the neck gives the hindquarters

 Outside 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.840
 the thoracic spine allows very little bending 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.230
 and the lumbar spine even less

 that all lateral movement allowing the thoracic spine

 Local time the lips also carry about every single value 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.790
 but their position does not affect their position very much, but that of their neighbor Rittner

 the outer ones are moving away from each other 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.660
