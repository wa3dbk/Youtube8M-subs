00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
let's make history there we go now these

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.650 
let's make history there we go now these
are<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.250> 316<00:01:27.250> swix<00:01:27.700> they're<00:01:28.000> actually<00:01:28.420> about

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
are the 316 swix they're actually about

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.760 
are the 316 swix they're actually about
a<00:01:29.310> more<00:01:30.310> like<00:01:30.460> 38<00:01:30.970> because<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:32.080> way<00:01:32.230> they<00:01:32.410> puff

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
a more like 38 because the way they puff

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.730 
a more like 38 because the way they puff
up<00:01:32.980> but<00:01:33.490> they're<00:01:34.480> full<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.870> impurity<00:01:35.410> said<00:01:35.650> oh

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
up but they're full of impurity said oh

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.340 
up but they're full of impurity said oh
burn<00:01:35.950> yellow<00:01:36.280> fur<00:01:36.700> now<00:01:37.360> quite<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.810> while<00:01:38.050> until

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
burn yellow fur now quite a while until

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.670 
burn yellow fur now quite a while until
the<00:01:39.810> telly<00:01:40.810> impurities<00:01:41.410> bearing<00:01:41.740> off<00:01:41.950> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the telly impurities bearing off and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.590 
the telly impurities bearing off and
then<00:01:44.680> they'll<00:01:45.130> burn<00:01:45.400> more<00:01:45.910> bullish<00:01:46.360> I<00:01:46.540> know

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
then they'll burn more bullish I know

00:01:46.600 --> 00:02:05.330 
then they'll burn more bullish I know
that<00:01:46.930> look<00:01:47.050> you<00:01:47.680> blow<00:01:47.950> oh<00:01:48.690> here<00:01:49.690> we<00:01:49.720> go

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:19.430 

sheshe<00:02:06.210> seconds<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.899> fuel

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.900 

doesn't<00:02:20.440> really<00:02:20.590> need<00:02:20.830> legs<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.460> base<00:02:21.670> is

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
doesn't really need legs the base is

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.700 
doesn't really need legs the base is
wide<00:02:22.090> now<00:02:22.360> saw<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:22.780> heavy<00:02:22.960> now<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.410> it's<00:02:23.530> pretty

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
wide now saw in heavy now so it's pretty

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.510 
wide now saw in heavy now so it's pretty
stable<00:02:24.070> without<00:02:24.460> legs<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.530> could<00:02:27.190> add<00:02:27.370> them

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
stable without legs but I could add them

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.220 
stable without legs but I could add them
I<00:02:27.580> have<00:02:27.730> plenty<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.090> Rome<00:02:28.330> farm<00:02:28.950> literally<00:02:29.950> oh

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:46.180 

I<00:02:35.230> got<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.650> tell<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:38.700> didn't<00:02:39.700> take<00:02:39.850> long

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.490 

I<00:02:46.280> didn't<00:02:47.060> time<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.360> but<00:02:47.780> that's<00:02:47.990> about<00:02:48.320> the

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
I didn't time it but that's about the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.630 
I didn't time it but that's about the
fastest<00:02:49.010> boil<00:02:49.280> I've<00:02:49.520> ever<00:02:49.700> seen<00:02:51.430> next<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.580> a

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
fastest boil I've ever seen next to a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:09.960 
fastest boil I've ever seen next to a
gem<00:02:52.970> well

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.180 

this<00:03:10.600> way<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.900> get<00:03:11.080> these<00:03:11.260> wicks<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.650> burn<00:03:11.860> blue

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
this way to get these wicks to burn blue

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.220 
this way to get these wicks to burn blue
is<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.700> run<00:03:12.910> them<00:03:13.030> out<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.180> alcohol<00:03:13.750> once<00:03:14.080> or

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
is to run them out of alcohol once or

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.220 
is to run them out of alcohol once or
twice<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:15.190> kind<00:03:15.550> of<00:03:15.810> cauterizes<00:03:16.810> them<00:03:16.930> burns

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
twice it kind of cauterizes them burns

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.810 
twice it kind of cauterizes them burns
