00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
I'm going to play the verse line to

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.990 
I'm going to play the verse line to
cat-scratch<00:00:08.920> fever<00:00:09.130> which<00:00:09.610> basically

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
cat-scratch fever which basically

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.799 
cat-scratch fever which basically
toggles<00:00:10.570> between<00:00:10.690> a<00:00:11.290> and<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.639> C<00:00:12.940> it's<00:00:13.630> got<00:00:13.780> a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
toggles between a and and C it's got a

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.629 
toggles between a and and C it's got a
little<00:00:13.930> slide<00:00:14.260> in<00:00:14.470> there<00:00:14.650> I<00:00:14.740> use<00:00:14.980> my<00:00:15.130> pinky<00:00:15.460> on

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
little slide in there I use my pinky on

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.910 
little slide in there I use my pinky on
the<00:00:15.760> slide<00:00:16.029> because<00:00:16.990> a<00:00:17.140> little<00:00:17.380> bit<00:00:17.470> closer<00:00:17.710> to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
the slide because a little bit closer to

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.910 
the slide because a little bit closer to
the<00:00:18.010> position<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.810> is<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.050> way<00:00:20.140> I<00:00:20.170> hear<00:00:20.590> it<00:00:20.650> I

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
the position this is the way I hear it I

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.769 
the position this is the way I hear it I
haven't<00:00:21.490> sat<00:00:21.640> down<00:00:21.670> with<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.090> album<00:00:22.449> in<00:00:22.570> years

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
haven't sat down with the album in years

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.200 
haven't sat down with the album in years
I'm<00:00:23.110> 100%<00:00:23.830> certain<00:00:24.340> that<00:00:24.520> this<00:00:24.789> is<00:00:24.970> not

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
I'm 100% certain that this is not

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.269 
I'm 100% certain that this is not
exactly<00:00:25.630> what<00:00:25.810> Ted<00:00:26.020> does<00:00:26.260> but<00:00:26.560> I<00:00:26.770> think<00:00:27.190> he

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
exactly what Ted does but I think he

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.700 
exactly what Ted does but I think he
changes<00:00:27.699> it<00:00:27.820> up<00:00:27.940> a<00:00:28.060> bit<00:00:28.090> from<00:00:28.570> time<00:00:29.020> to<00:00:29.680> time

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
changes it up a bit from time to time

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:51.540 
changes it up a bit from time to time
too<00:00:30.130> so<00:00:30.189> here<00:00:30.460> goes

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.760 

so<00:00:52.870> that's<00:00:53.870> pretty<00:00:54.050> much<00:00:54.140> how<00:00:54.380> it<00:00:54.410> goes<00:00:54.620> I'm

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
so that's pretty much how it goes I'm

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.020 
so that's pretty much how it goes I'm
gonna<00:00:54.890> do<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.070> slow<00:00:55.309> we'll<00:00:55.550> see<00:00:55.730> how<00:00:55.880> it<00:00:56.000> goes

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
gonna do it slow we'll see how it goes

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.569 
gonna do it slow we'll see how it goes
here<00:00:56.270> I<00:00:56.690> find<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:57.559> more<00:00:57.770> difficult<00:00:57.980> to<00:00:58.370> do

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
here I find it more difficult to do

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.330 
here I find it more difficult to do
slowly<00:00:59.140> got<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.770> keeps<00:01:00.949> chunking

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
slowly got that a and it keeps chunking

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.100 
slowly got that a and it keeps chunking
on<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.879> whole<00:01:02.030> times<00:01:02.329> most<00:01:02.660> important

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
on that a the whole times most important

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:37.550 
on that a the whole times most important
thing

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:02:17.210 

we've<00:01:38.560> got<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:38.980> slide<00:01:39.250> action<00:01:39.520> going<00:01:39.970> again

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:34.289 

Oh

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.880 

now<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.359> one<00:02:35.870> thing<00:02:36.019> I<00:02:36.079> haven't<00:02:36.230> gone<00:02:36.409> over<00:02:36.680> so
