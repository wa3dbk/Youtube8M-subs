00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and found that the depth that we needed

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.639 
and found that the depth that we needed
to<00:01:11.369> make<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.820> was<00:01:12.149> 7/8<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.990> an<00:01:13.050> inch<00:01:13.259> so<00:01:13.619> we

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
to make this was 7/8 of an inch so we

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.029 
to make this was 7/8 of an inch so we
cut<00:01:14.009> off<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.160> piece<00:01:14.459> 7/8<00:01:15.060> inch<00:01:15.300> long<00:01:15.920> put<00:01:16.920> it

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
cut off a piece 7/8 inch long put it

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.790 
cut off a piece 7/8 inch long put it
down<00:01:17.250> into<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> hole<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.050> knob<00:01:19.350> will

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
down into the hole and now the knob will

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.279 
down into the hole and now the knob will
go<00:01:20.009> right<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.459> in<00:01:20.640> fits<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.149> works<00:01:21.630> perfectly

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
go right on in fits and works perfectly

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.669 
go right on in fits and works perfectly
