BigNate84 here for anyone who may not know

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.940
here's a little overview about what DVD ripping
actually is

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.690
After that I'll discuss 3 reasons why
people typically rip DVDs, why it can be difficult

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.820
and I'll recommend some ripping solutions
the act of ripping a DVD is when you use

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.500
software to convert the data stored on a DVD
into a video file

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.230
once created or "ripped" from the DVD
this video file can be stored and played

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.730
back from a computer, network drive, smart
phone, tablet or other electronic device

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.600
when ripping a video from a DVD there are
typically

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.340
5 or 6 popular video file formats
that you will be able to choose from

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.140
depending on the software you're using
and your playback needs

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.670
sometimes these video file formats are called
containers

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.870
containers
some of the popular ones are

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:13.209
MOV, QT, MP4, FLV, AVI, MPEG
now there's not one that's particularly better

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.130
than the others
it just all depends on what your trying to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.119
do
and what your needs are

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.409
and what your playback system can handle
the physical DVD is the source of video data

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.899
and the ripped video file is an alternate
container

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:37.770
so that the physical disc is no longer required
there are 3 main reasons why people rip DVDs

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.429
to back-up the DVD in case the disc breaks
for convenient playback, and for piracy

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:51.399
I am a recovering pirate
the third reason is the cause for copy protection

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.039
and the reason it can be a challenge for normal
people

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:04.279
that aren't tech enthusiasts to rip a DVD
so why is it difficult to rip DVDs?

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.819
the film companies that own the distribution
rights

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.649
to the DVDs really don't want you to be able
to rip DVDs

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.409
because of a few bad apples, digital pirates
there are some pirates out there who buy the

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.400
DVD
rip it and then give it away to other people

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.810
so even though backing up your DVD collection
for personal use is perfectly legal

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.430
the film companies have made it a challenge
to rip DVDs in an attempt to stop the piracy

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:41.390
note: iTunes can rip CDs no problem but cannot
rip DVDs

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.150
the process of ripping removes the copy protection
that is built in to the DVD technology

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.750
so here are some ripping solutions
this is why you need to buy a special software

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.340
that can break through the DVD encryption
and pull the video information off the disc

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.950
an example of such software would be
MacX DVD Ripper Pro or

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.980
WinX DVD Ripper Pro
there are also some free software downloads

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.340
for ripping DVDs such as Mac The Ripper and
HandBrake but if you've only just discovered

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.090
what it means to rip a DVD the free software
options

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.959
might be too complicated for you
check out my review of MacX DVD Ripper Pro

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:32.990
to see it's advantages

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.990
[music]

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.540
ok so first we'll talk about what like about
the software

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.769
then we'll talk about why it's better than
HandBrake

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:50.349
and Mac The Ripper, we'll discuss some issues
I had with MacX and get into the specifics
