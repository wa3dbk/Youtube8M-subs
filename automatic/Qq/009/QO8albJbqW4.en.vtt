00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
thing we're going to talk about as far

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.640 
thing we're going to talk about as far
as<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> install<00:01:20.729> goes<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.750> word<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.409> cut

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
as the install goes is the word of cut

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.700 
as the install goes is the word of cut
basically<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.450> rule<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.900> thumb<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.350> always

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
basically as a rule of thumb I always

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670 
basically as a rule of thumb I always
cut<00:01:25.979> too<00:01:26.220> long<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.900> any<00:01:28.110> doubt<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.560> all

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
cut too long if I have any doubt at all

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.520 
cut too long if I have any doubt at all
about<00:01:28.740> where<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> cut<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.900> cut<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> off<00:01:31.170> long

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
about where to cut I cut it off long

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
about where to cut I cut it off long
because<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.970> easy<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.570> either<00:01:33.780> make

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
because it's so easy to either make

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.649 
because it's so easy to either make
another<00:01:34.380> cut<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.610> grind<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.060> down<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.540> it's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
another cut or to grind it down if it's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.300 
another cut or to grind it down if it's
just<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:36.930> too<00:01:37.259> long<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.890> whatever

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
just a little too long or do whatever

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.640 
just a little too long or do whatever
it's<00:01:38.700> way<00:01:39.090> harder<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> cut<00:01:40.049> off<00:01:40.200> too<00:01:40.470> much

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it's way harder if you cut off too much

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.929 
it's way harder if you cut off too much
and<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:43.079> go<00:01:43.200> back<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.740> fab<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.399> stuff

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and you have to go back and fab up stuff

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.980 
and you have to go back and fab up stuff
to<00:01:45.180> fill<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.570> gaps

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
to fill in the gaps

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.139 
to fill in the gaps
ok<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.700> first<00:01:48.680> for<00:01:49.680> sure<00:01:49.950> we've<00:01:50.369> got<00:01:50.399> four<00:01:50.880> cuts

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
ok so first for sure we've got four cuts

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.190 
ok so first for sure we've got four cuts
we<00:01:51.329> got<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.570> make<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:52.500> got<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> cut<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:54.200> some

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
we got to make we got a cut here some

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
we got to make we got a cut here some
point<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.829> I'll<00:01:56.009> probably<00:01:56.189> cut<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
point in here I'll probably cut it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
point in here I'll probably cut it
probably<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.380> probably<00:01:58.649> about

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
probably what I think is probably about

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.819 
probably what I think is probably about
an<00:01:58.950> inch<00:01:59.159> long<00:01:59.659> right<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.350> then

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
an inch long right in here and then

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.950 
an inch long right in here and then
we're<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> cut<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.610> two<00:02:02.969> massive

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
we're going to cut these two massive

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.709 
we're going to cut these two massive
tubes<00:02:04.490> basically<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.700> does<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.450> it

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
tubes basically what that does is it

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.479 
tubes basically what that does is it
takes<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.110> whole<00:02:08.239> shock<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.599> seat<00:02:10.489> support

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
takes this whole shock and seat support

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.809 
takes this whole shock and seat support
section<00:02:12.239> takes<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.319> whole<00:02:13.530> thing

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
section takes that whole thing

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.300 
section takes that whole thing
puts<00:02:14.150> out<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.450> dumpster<00:02:14.959> okay<00:02:15.530> if<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.099> look

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
puts out the dumpster okay if you look

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.729 
puts out the dumpster okay if you look
over<00:02:16.609> here<00:02:16.640> at<00:02:16.999> the<00:02:17.120> heart<00:02:17.359> tail<00:02:17.629> you<00:02:18.290> can<00:02:18.469> see

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
over here at the heart tail you can see

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.489 
over here at the heart tail you can see
where<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:19.700> was<00:02:20.180> going<00:02:20.359> to<00:02:20.420> join<00:02:20.719> up<00:02:20.989> in<00:02:21.109> here

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:21.499 
where this was going to join up in here

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:27.009 
where this was going to join up in here
and<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:23.120> will<00:02:23.420> join<00:02:24.349> down<00:02:24.769> here<00:02:25.810> we'll<00:02:26.810> cover

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
and this will join down here we'll cover

00:02:27.019 --> 00:03:02.530 
and this will join down here we'll cover
that<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.409> set

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.839 

okay<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.840> don't<00:03:04.410> know<00:03:04.590> how<00:03:05.220> many<00:03:05.430> guys<00:03:05.610> are

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
going to be you to use them for two

going to be you to use them for two
bands<00:03:07.319> it's<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.400> slickest<00:03:09.390> easiest<00:03:10.080> way<00:03:10.230> to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
bands it's the slickest easiest way to

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.839 
bands it's the slickest easiest way to
do<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> lot<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.799> stuff<00:03:12.530> if<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.890> notice<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.610> I

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
do a lot of stuff if you notice that I I

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.089 
do a lot of stuff if you notice that I I
purposely<00:03:15.510> slowed<00:03:15.900> down<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> lot<00:03:16.530> right<00:03:16.890> when<00:03:17.040> I

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
purposely slowed down a lot right when I

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.850 
purposely slowed down a lot right when I
was<00:03:17.160> about<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.580> get<00:03:17.670> through<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.000> wall<00:03:18.709> it's<00:03:19.709> a

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
was about to get through the wall it's a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.940 
was about to get through the wall it's a
trick<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.160> learned<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.489> hard<00:03:20.700> way<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:22.099> if<00:03:23.629> if

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
trick I learned the hard way is if if

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.530 
trick I learned the hard way is if if
you<00:03:25.950> get<00:03:26.130> your<00:03:26.250> blade<00:03:26.489> trap<00:03:26.910> while<00:03:27.360> there's

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
you get your blade trap while there's

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.059 
you get your blade trap while there's
still<00:03:27.599> Tinch<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.290> there's<00:03:28.410> usually<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.769> lot<00:03:28.920> of

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
still Tinch and there's usually a lot of

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.800 
still Tinch and there's usually a lot of
tension<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.519> those<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.480> get<00:03:30.630> your

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
tension on those and if you get your

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.750 
tension on those and if you get your
blade<00:03:31.019> clear<00:03:31.410> through<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.099> gets<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.579> gets

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
blade clear through and it gets it gets

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.979 
blade clear through and it gets it gets
trapped<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.239> there<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.660> pain<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
trapped in there it's just a pain in the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.259 
trapped in there it's just a pain in the
ass<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:34.920> it's<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.130> lot<00:03:35.310> easier<00:03:35.549> won't<00:03:35.970> as<00:03:36.090> soon

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
ass so it's a lot easier won't as soon

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.600 
ass so it's a lot easier won't as soon
as<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.480> get<00:03:36.599> clear<00:03:36.870> through<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.739> run<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.430> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
as you get clear through to run it and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.759 
as you get clear through to run it and
back<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.450> without<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.260> blade<00:03:40.500> getting

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
back it out without that blade getting

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.440 
back it out without that blade getting
trapped<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.190> there<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.849> small<00:03:42.299> little

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450
