ninety<00:00:38.620> one<00:00:38.890> they<00:00:39.219> added<00:00:39.579> an<00:00:39.699> additional<00:00:39.909> two

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
ninety one they added an additional two

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.180 
ninety one they added an additional two

part numbers to the microfilm that

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.739 
part numbers to the microfilm that
correspond<00:00:42.699> to<00:00:42.789> the<00:00:42.909> stainless<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.629> that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
correspond to the stainless and that

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.069 
correspond to the stainless and that
continued<00:00:44.620> on<00:00:44.739> until<00:00:44.920> nineteen<00:00:45.429> ninety-four

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
continued on until nineteen ninety-four

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.939 
continued on until nineteen ninety-four
going<00:00:47.079> to<00:00:47.139> try<00:00:47.319> and<00:00:47.440> illustrate<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
going to try and illustrate the

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.500 
going to try and illustrate the
difference<00:00:48.280> between<00:00:48.429> the<00:00:48.729> two<00:00:48.909> by<00:00:49.149> placing

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
difference between the two by placing

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.360 
difference between the two by placing
them<00:00:49.690> on<00:00:49.719> this<00:00:49.870> black<00:00:50.139> mat<00:00:50.409> here<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.859> then

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
them on this black mat here and then

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.069 
them on this black mat here and then
after<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:51.940> show<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.299> the<00:00:52.420> differences<00:00:52.839> we're

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
after I show you the differences we're

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.779 
after I show you the differences we're
going<00:00:53.199> to<00:00:53.260> go<00:00:53.469> through<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.920> installation<00:00:54.219> of

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
going to go through the installation of

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.789 
going to go through the installation of
the<00:00:55.030> gasket<00:00:55.569> on<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:55.780> back<00:00:56.079> of<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.350> head<00:00:56.620> light

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
the gasket on the back of the head light

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:59.549 
the gasket on the back of the head light
ring<00:00:57.039> so<00:00:57.370> let's<00:00:58.030> get<00:00:58.149> this<00:00:58.299> set<00:00:58.510> up<00:00:58.539> once<00:00:59.440> again

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
ring so let's get this set up once again

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.319 
ring so let's get this set up once again
on<00:00:59.709> my<00:00:59.829> right<00:01:00.010> is<00:01:00.249> the<00:01:00.399> stainless<00:01:00.819> on<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.149> left

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
on my right is the stainless on the left

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.529 
on my right is the stainless on the left
is<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.600> chrome<00:01:02.069> you<00:01:03.069> can<00:01:03.249> notice<00:01:03.760> some<00:01:04.299> small

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
is the chrome you can notice some small

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.539 
is the chrome you can notice some small
differences<00:01:04.750> in<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.229> finish<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.950> chrome<00:01:06.280> is

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
differences in the finish the chrome is

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.580 
differences in the finish the chrome is
much<00:01:06.759> more<00:01:07.000> mirror<00:01:07.630> like<00:01:07.960> in<00:01:08.140> its<00:01:08.289> finish

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
much more mirror like in its finish

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.490 
much more mirror like in its finish
whereas<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.390> stainless<00:01:10.390> steel<00:01:10.630> has<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> more

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
whereas the stainless steel has a more

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.319 
whereas the stainless steel has a more
satin<00:01:11.950> finish<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.460> still<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.850> slightly

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
satin finish it still is slightly

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.899 
satin finish it still is slightly
reflective<00:01:14.049> but<00:01:14.619> it's<00:01:14.799> not<00:01:14.979> quite<00:01:15.250> as<00:01:15.520> clear

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
reflective but it's not quite as clear

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.080 
reflective but it's not quite as clear
of<00:01:16.030> a<00:01:16.090> reflection<00:01:16.630> as<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.909> chrome<00:01:18.909> one

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
of a reflection as on the chrome one

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.810 
of a reflection as on the chrome one
here<00:01:19.299> this<00:01:20.109> is<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.439> only<00:01:20.590> distinction<00:01:21.130> on<00:01:21.460> the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
here this is the only distinction on the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.819 
here this is the only distinction on the
two<00:01:22.000> trim<00:01:22.299> rings<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:22.990> you'll<00:01:23.350> have<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.649> check

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
two trim rings so you'll have to check

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.830 
two trim rings so you'll have to check
your<00:01:23.979> car<00:01:24.219> very<00:01:24.399> closely<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:25.240> get<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.509> proper

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
your car very closely to get the proper

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.649 
your car very closely to get the proper
type<00:01:26.079> if<00:01:26.979> there's<00:01:27.280> any<00:01:27.460> question<00:01:28.149> you<00:01:28.630> can

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
type if there's any question you can

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.209 
type if there's any question you can
always<00:01:28.990> get<00:01:29.170> both<00:01:29.409> sides<00:01:29.679> and<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:30.009> course

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
always get both sides and of course

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.349 
always get both sides and of course
they'll<00:01:30.369> match<00:01:30.490> at<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.789> point<00:01:31.030> but<00:01:31.240> if

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
they'll match at that point but if

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.609 
they'll match at that point but if
you're<00:01:31.450> just<00:01:31.539> replacing<00:01:31.780> one<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.320> is<00:01:32.439> very

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
you're just replacing one it is very

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.719 
you're just replacing one it is very
important<00:01:32.920> that<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.130> get<00:01:33.219> the<00:01:33.340> two<00:01:33.490> matched

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
important that you get the two matched

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.719 
important that you get the two matched
to<00:01:34.539> get<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.780> color<00:01:34.960> right<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:35.950> moving<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.520> to

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
to get the color right so moving on to

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.800 
to get the color right so moving on to
the<00:01:36.759> installation<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.689> gasket

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.840 

gasket<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> straight<00:01:44.430> piece<00:01:44.610> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
gasket is just a straight piece of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969 
gasket is just a straight piece of
molding<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.509> has<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.990> channel<00:01:46.259> section<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.860> it

the gasket a small amount of adhesive is
usually<00:02:12.540> good<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:13.380> once<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:14.340> it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
usually good to do this once you get it

vibration while the car is going down
the<00:02:27.060> road<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.620> difference
