00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello, today we will discuss 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.960
 fighters in battlefield 4 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.400
 as you have already noticed this view 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.530
 the aircraft is significantly different 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.099
 from what we saw in the battlefield game 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.340
 3 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.279
 if there f-18 and su-35 were on top 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.960
 food chain then in battlefield 4 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 fighters balancing in the middle 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.550
 it is not clear what, in principle, let them driven 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.600
 mostly within the narrow confines of battle 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.939
 air-to-air 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.890
 but none the less against air targets 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.199
 fighters are weak enough even 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 able to fully pump against 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.930
 ground targets virtually worthless 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.450
 if not to pump a certain type of missiles 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.790
 plus the whole j20i f-35 is enough 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.190
 clumsy and confidently merge battle 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.079
 anyone and attack aircraft 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.660
 150 turn received the title of king 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.199
 air in terms of maneuverability for example 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.510
 if for the same amount of time 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.430
 j20i af-35 makes a 360 turn 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.410
 degrees 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.289
 150 for the same interval does all 400 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.359
 and even more so my advice to you if 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.180
 there is a desire to pump fighter 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.280
 do it without fail for us at 50 and not 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 forget to use experience boosters 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.860
 since the stealth invisible enough 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.659
 uncommon pursuits as for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.320
 ideal turn speed without 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 changes are still the same 315 kilometers per hour 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.590
 radius also significantly reduced 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.180
 turning that allows in some 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.450
 degrees to make the difference skill 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 control of the aircraft between the players 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.780
 fixed camera position when 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.159
 turning one of the major changes in 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.380
 compared with battlefield 3 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.310
 it is this nuance that requires the most 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.780
 lengthy adaptation in battlefield 4 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.119
 so let's proceed to the analysis of weapons 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.710
 fighters tab main weapon 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.610
 allows us to choose one of three 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.130
 The main guns of different calibers are 20 25 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.530
 and 30 millimeters besides caliber they 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.020
 different rate of fire and how are you 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.210
 already understood the maximum rate of fire 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.759
 u20 mm cannon a minimum 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.460
 respectively at 30 millimeter that 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.860
 concerns efficiency 20 and 25 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.570
 millimeters do not kill namely scratch 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.000
 enemy air technology 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.700
 about applying against ground targets even 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.470
 speech can not go 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.730
 30 millimeter cannon let you at least 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.820
 somehow feel confident 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.040
 air battles if you fly 150 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.920
 will even allow someone to kill or at least 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.560
 to finish up so all sad all 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.130
 I recommend using it 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.810
 30mm cannon 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.780
 even despite its not high 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.730
 secondary rate of fire 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.910
 armament consists of four options 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.130
 rockets first thermal guidance 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.650
 we are all well known and hit kira 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.070
 class rocket released forgot easily 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.360
 taken away by the enemy using countermeasures 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.770
 second passive radar 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.200
 substantial leap in terms of 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.750
 efficiency after hit Kirov require 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.640
 target retention in the guidance radar plus 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.160
 data missiles is that after 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.730
 shooting countermeasures by an enemy rocket 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.560
 you can have time to re-idealize 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.450
 application against fast flying 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.910
 helicopters when the enemy is enough 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.490
 quickly out of range of their own 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.730
 traps and allows you to look again 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.590
 the third option is laser guidance if 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.530
 still want to use fighter 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.810
 against ground targets is your choice two 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.239
 rockets that require holding a target to 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.120
 moment of successful hit inflict 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.250
 quite serious damage of about 60 hp 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.380
 have a tank and are perfect for 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.450
 finishing heavy armored vehicles 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.500
 adversary may be rejected 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.480
 countermeasures 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.040
 but also like previous rockets 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.440
 allow you to go back 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.850
 if the enemy left the zone of action 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.799
 countermeasures and you have room to maneuver 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.110
 fourth option active radar best 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.880
 choice for air combat first 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.310
 This type of missile does not require guidance. 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.200
 all you have to do is shoot the side 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.420
 adversary second system 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.580
 missile attack warning 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.150
 trigger directly in front of you 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.709
 hit literally one second before 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.230
 most cases of countermeasures of the enemy 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.150
 useless by like in the case of the first two 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.910
 options are relatively low 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.860
 damage 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.110
 countermeasures are nothing new to us well 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.570
 famous rap traps and fire extinguisher 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.880
 a matter of personal preference and advise 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.280
 that any choice of countermeasures did not see the point 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.310
 but notice that traps and 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.860
 rap have a 25 second cool down 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.880
 recharge personally my opinion gave cool 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.040
 need sakkra 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.330
 5 at least up to 20 seconds improvement 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.130
 gyrostabilizer is quite useful 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.130
 device helping to stabilize 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.780
 aircraft after critical hit 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.370
 words are considered critical hit 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.980
 any air-to-air missiles 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.580
 or ground-to-air even if before exiting 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.840
 building enough hp 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.820
 masking cover is the perfect choice 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.160
 for use in pairs with traps 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.180
 will give extra time for successful 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.830
 out of the chuck lacquer zone here in general 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.710
 useless perk given weakness 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.050
 fighter main gun 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.690
 the scanner don't know who wants to 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.800
 radar aircraft quickly flashed ground 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.050
 equipment and infantry 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.750
 but nevertheless there is such an opportunity 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.800
 I remind you that aviation technology 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.310
 displayed on the aircraft radar 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.760
 battlefield 4 default and last 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.020
 the color tab is purely a matter of taste 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.850
 any visual difficulty 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.010
 definition of the enemy on different maps 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.280
 depending on the camouflage I choose 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.020
 did not notice it all write to 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.690
 comments whether a guide is required by 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.210
 storm troopers if yes be sure to do in 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.360
 soon thank you for your attention everyone 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.360
 until
