00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
for around eighty dollars depending on

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.470 
for around eighty dollars depending on
how<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.019> customize<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.860> all<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.909> details<00:02:20.269> on

choose<00:02:27.799> for<00:02:28.099> this<00:02:28.250> case<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.239> do<00:02:29.450> have<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
choose for this case so you do have the

flexibility<00:02:30.260> now<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.830> did<00:02:31.040> mention<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
flexibility now I did mention that the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.930 
flexibility now I did mention that the
belt<00:02:32.120> clip<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.810> little<00:02:33.200> bit<00:02:33.290> different<00:02:33.620> from

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
belt clip is a little bit different from

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.699 
belt clip is a little bit different from
your<00:02:34.940> normal<00:02:35.209> belt<00:02:35.480> clip<00:02:35.690> system<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.590> one

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
your normal belt clip system the one

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.500 
your normal belt clip system the one
that<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.430> was<00:02:37.670> given<00:02:38.000> was<00:02:38.239> this

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
that the that I was given was this

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.080 
that the that I was given was this
little<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:39.140> cheap<00:02:39.349> plastic<00:02:39.560> one<00:02:39.970> even<00:02:40.970> though

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
little the cheap plastic one even though

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.580 
little the cheap plastic one even though
it's<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.420> cheap<00:02:41.629> plastic<00:02:41.870> one<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.440> was

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
it's the cheap plastic one it was

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.619 
it's the cheap plastic one it was
actually<00:02:42.739> way<00:02:43.579> stronger<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.239> sturdier<00:02:44.569> than

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
actually way stronger and sturdier than

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.539 
actually way stronger and sturdier than
I<00:02:44.810> had<00:02:44.930> imagined<00:02:45.379> this<00:02:45.799> is<00:02:45.980> actually<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> very

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
I had imagined this is actually a very

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.190 
I had imagined this is actually a very
hard<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.060> open<00:02:47.180> up<00:02:47.799> so<00:02:48.799> that's<00:02:48.950> pretty<00:02:49.190> nice

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
hard to open up so that's pretty nice

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.440 
hard to open up so that's pretty nice
now<00:02:51.200> when<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.560> put<00:02:51.709> this<00:02:51.829> on<00:02:52.040> typically<00:02:52.879> you

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
now when you put this on typically you

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.140 
now when you put this on typically you
just<00:02:53.750> put<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.230> belt<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:55.099> case<00:02:55.670> just<00:02:56.090> like

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
just put on the belt the case just like

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.140 
just put on the belt the case just like
that<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:57.290> would<00:02:57.379> fit<00:02:57.620> just<00:02:57.799> fine<00:02:58.150> what

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
that and it would fit just fine what

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.869 
that and it would fit just fine what
actually<00:02:59.329> is<00:02:59.840> going<00:02:59.959> on<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:01.459> belt

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
actually is going on here is the belt

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.460 
actually is going on here is the belt
clip<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.329> bottom<00:03:02.690> only<00:03:03.079> if<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.319> see

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
clip on the bottom only if you can see

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.589 
clip on the bottom only if you can see
that<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.680> little<00:03:04.010> button<00:03:04.390> it's<00:03:05.390> actually<00:03:07.540> not<00:03:08.540> a

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
that a little button it's actually not a

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.670 
that a little button it's actually not a
complete<00:03:09.019> circle<00:03:09.489> rather<00:03:10.489> it's<00:03:10.879> kind<00:03:11.599> of<00:03:11.720> flat

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
complete circle rather it's kind of flat

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.650 
complete circle rather it's kind of flat
on<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.950> bottom<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.459> top<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.879> rounded<00:03:14.569> on

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
on the bottom and the top and rounded on

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.539 
on the bottom and the top and rounded on
the<00:03:14.780> edges<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.680> it's<00:03:15.829> only<00:03:15.950> going<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.220> fit<00:03:16.430> on

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
the edges so it's only going to fit on

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.400 
the edges so it's only going to fit on
here<00:03:16.700> in<00:03:16.819> one<00:03:17.030> way<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:17.930> if<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.109> were<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.230> just

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
here in one way so if I were to just

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.379 
here in one way so if I were to just
leave<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.709> there<00:03:18.739> it's<00:03:19.040> not<00:03:19.250> going<00:03:19.549> in<00:03:19.730> but<00:03:20.299> as

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
leave it there it's not going in but as

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.620 
leave it there it's not going in but as
soon<00:03:20.510> as<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.780> turn<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.700> now<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:23.030> snap<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.329> in

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
soon as I turn it now I can snap it in

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.819 
soon as I turn it now I can snap it in
and<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:24.380> will<00:03:24.500> now<00:03:24.819> rotate<00:03:25.819> freely<00:03:26.590> in<00:03:27.590> order

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
and it will now rotate freely in order

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.039 
and it will now rotate freely in order
to<00:03:27.919> remove<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.340> same<00:03:29.060> situation<00:03:29.209> even<00:03:29.900> if<00:03:29.959> i

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
to remove it same situation even if i

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.080 
to remove it same situation even if i
push<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.530> button<00:03:30.799> at<00:03:30.889> the<00:03:30.919> top<00:03:31.190> it's<00:03:31.849> not

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
push the button at the top it's not

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.470 
push the button at the top it's not
going<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.329> come<00:03:32.450> up<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.870> need<00:03:33.349> to<00:03:33.500> turn<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:34.480> add

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
going to come up I need to turn it add

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.690 
going to come up I need to turn it add
to<00:03:35.959> an<00:03:36.049> end<00:03:36.169> a<00:03:36.200> degree<00:03:36.440> angle<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:36.919> then<00:03:37.190> lift

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
to an end a degree angle and then lift

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.759 
to an end a degree angle and then lift
it<00:03:37.819> right<00:03:37.880> out<00:03:38.209> so<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:39.380> nice<00:03:39.530> thing<00:03:39.560> about

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
it right out so the nice thing about

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.819 
it right out so the nice thing about
that<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.099> your<00:03:40.930> there's<00:03:41.930> no<00:03:42.139> way<00:03:42.319> that<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.650> is

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
that is your there's no way that this is

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.409 
that is your there's no way that this is
ever<00:03:43.010> going<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.220> come<00:03:43.430> out<00:03:43.489> unless<00:03:44.209> you

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
ever going to come out unless you

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.330 
ever going to come out unless you
actually<00:03:44.569> push<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.200> off<00:03:45.260> or<00:03:45.739> if<00:03:45.859> this<00:03:46.069> breaks

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
actually push that off or if this breaks

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.759 
actually push that off or if this breaks
off<00:03:46.609> your<00:03:46.880> belt<00:03:47.090> clip<00:03:47.389> that's<00:03:47.989> more<00:03:48.290> likely<00:03:48.530> to

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
off your belt clip that's more likely to

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.740 
off your belt clip that's more likely to
happen<00:03:48.919> than<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:49.819> actually<00:03:50.239> separating

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
happen than this actually separating

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.500 
happen than this actually separating
from<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.440> notch<00:03:51.769> in<00:03:52.099> there<00:03:52.340> so<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.389> the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
from that notch in there so this is the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.699 
from that notch in there so this is the
like<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.690> said<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:54.019> is<00:03:54.079> a<00:03:54.200> wonderful<00:03:54.379> case

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
like I said this is a wonderful case

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.229 
like I said this is a wonderful case
this<00:03:54.980> is<00:03:55.160> one<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.430> better<00:03:55.579> iphone<00:03:56.000> cases

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
this is one of the better iphone cases

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.440 
this is one of the better iphone cases
that<00:03:56.510> I've<00:03:56.629> used<00:03:57.910> when<00:03:58.910> I<00:03:58.940> received<00:03:59.359> this

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
that I've used when I received this

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.900 
that I've used when I received this
product<00:03:59.870> sample<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.349> thought<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.700> wasn't

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
product sample I thought that I wasn't

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
definitely give this a 7 out of 10

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.520 
definitely give this a 7 out of 10
rating<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.849> would<00:04:20.269> give<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:20.539> a<00:04:20.659> eight<00:04:21.049> or<00:04:21.320> nine

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
rating I would give it a eight or nine

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.620 
rating I would give it a eight or nine
out<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.739> 10<00:04:21.979> rating<00:04:22.280> if<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.969> had<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.300> better<00:04:23.810> clip

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
out of 10 rating if I had a better clip

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.180 
out of 10 rating if I had a better clip
this<00:04:24.720> clip<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.020> not<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.650> best<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:26.040> my<00:04:26.160> opinion

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
this clip is not the best in my opinion

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.690 
this clip is not the best in my opinion
just<00:04:26.700> because<00:04:27.000> this<00:04:27.240> plastic<00:04:27.630> does<00:04:27.840> break<00:04:28.140> and

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
just because this plastic does break and

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.310 
just because this plastic does break and
even<00:04:29.700> worse<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:30.150> think<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.840> would<00:04:30.930> be<00:04:31.020> harder<00:04:31.290> to

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
even worse I think it would be harder to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.290 
even worse I think it would be harder to
find<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.710> clip<00:04:31.950> like<00:04:31.980> this<00:04:32.160> that's<00:04:32.730> specific<00:04:33.270> to

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
find a clip like this that's specific to

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.530 
find a clip like this that's specific to
that<00:04:33.930> little<00:04:34.620> rivet<00:04:35.010> on<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.220> back<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:36.150> that's

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
that little rivet on the back so that's

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.990 
that little rivet on the back so that's
why<00:04:36.750> I'm<00:04:36.870> giving<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.470> seven<00:04:38.430> out<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.550> ten<00:04:38.670> as
