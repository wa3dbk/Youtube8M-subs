construction on the back it doesn't get

construction on the back it doesn't get
dirty<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.160> also<00:00:44.309> not<00:00:44.700> quite<00:00:45.210> as

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
dirty but it's also not quite as

dirty but it's also not quite as
stunning<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.020> design<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:46.649> opinion<00:00:46.680> although

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
stunning a design in my opinion although

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.010 
stunning a design in my opinion although
it's<00:00:47.789> less<00:00:47.850> prone<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.149> cracking<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:48.989> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it's less prone to cracking and like I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.100 
it's less prone to cracking and like I
said<00:00:49.170> fingerprints<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.129> dirt<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> oils<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
camera hump on the back is minimal and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.340 
camera hump on the back is minimal and
it's<00:00:53.879> never<00:00:54.030> bothered<00:00:54.239> me<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.780> has<00:00:54.989> rounded

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it's never bothered me it has rounded

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's never bothered me it has rounded
and<00:00:55.559> curved<00:00:55.770> edges<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.280> feel<00:00:56.520> really

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and curved edges that feel really

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.160 
and curved edges that feel really
awesome<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.239> were<00:00:57.360> sliding<00:00:57.570> your<00:00:57.780> hand<00:00:57.809> across

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
awesome we were sliding your hand across

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.650 
awesome we were sliding your hand across
the<00:00:58.260> screen<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> edge<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.570> only

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the screen on the edge and the only

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.240 
the screen on the edge and the only
problem<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.050> might<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.590> design<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
problem I might have with the design is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.680 
problem I might have with the design is
just<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.640> antenna<00:01:03.059> lines<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> back

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
just the antenna lines on the back

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
just the antenna lines on the back
aren't<00:01:03.989> super<00:01:04.470> attractive<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.030> not

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
aren't super attractive but it's not

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.480 
aren't super attractive but it's not
terrible<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> same<00:01:07.110> time<00:01:07.350> also<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
terrible at the same time also with the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
terrible at the same time also with the
iPhone<00:01:08.790> 6<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> slightly<00:01:09.810> smaller

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
iPhone 6 you get a slightly smaller

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.469 
iPhone 6 you get a slightly smaller
footprint<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.180> keep<00:01:12.330> in

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
footprint so that's something to keep in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.450 
footprint so that's something to keep in
mind<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.590> small<00:01:13.830> hands

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
mind if you do have small hands

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
mind if you do have small hands
but<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.119> moral<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.509> story<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:16.200> can't<00:01:16.439> go

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
but the moral of the story you can't go

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.399 
but the moral of the story you can't go
wrong<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:17.159> either<00:01:17.369> design<00:01:18.020> now<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.290> down

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
wrong with either design now even down

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
wrong with either design now even down
to<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.650> buttons<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.070> ports<00:01:20.130> these<00:01:20.729> devices

to the buttons and ports these devices

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
to the buttons and ports these devices
are<00:01:21.540> incredibly<00:01:22.110> similar<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.710> yes<00:01:23.250> Samsung

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
are incredibly similar and yes Samsung

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.310 
are incredibly similar and yes Samsung
definitely<00:01:24.330> took<00:01:24.570> some<00:01:24.780> cues<00:01:25.080> from<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
definitely took some cues from the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260 
definitely took some cues from the
iPhone<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.700> complaining<00:01:27.180> it

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
iPhone but I'm not complaining it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.550 
iPhone but I'm not complaining it
doesn't<00:01:27.509> make<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> difference<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.200> me<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
doesn't make a difference to me the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
doesn't make a difference to me the
iPhone<00:01:28.829> does<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> physical<00:01:30.000> vibrate

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
iPhone does have a physical vibrate

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.940 
iPhone does have a physical vibrate
switch<00:01:30.630> which<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> definitely<00:01:31.259> an<00:01:31.590> underrated

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
switch which is definitely an underrated

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.859 
switch which is definitely an underrated
feature<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.579> opinion<00:01:33.000> both<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.810> these

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
feature in my opinion both of these

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.170 
feature in my opinion both of these
phones<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.320> physical<00:01:34.920> home<00:01:35.159> buttons<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
phones have physical home buttons and to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.969 
phones have physical home buttons and to
put<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.390> simply<00:01:36.720> they're<00:01:36.869> both<00:01:37.020> awesome<00:01:37.530> their

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
put it simply they're both awesome their

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
put it simply they're both awesome their
fingerprint<00:01:38.460> scanners<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.240> used

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
fingerprint scanners that can be used

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
fingerprint scanners that can be used
both<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.720> unlock<00:01:40.259> your<00:01:40.409> phone<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.920> also<00:01:41.159> in

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
both to unlock your phone and also in

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
both to unlock your phone and also in
different<00:01:41.520> apps<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> pay<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.450> things<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
different apps and to pay for things and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
different apps and to pay for things and
there<00:01:43.799> they're<00:01:44.189> really<00:01:44.430> awesome<00:01:44.579> they're

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
there they're really awesome they're

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
there they're really awesome they're
both<00:01:45.119> accurate<00:01:45.720> they're<00:01:45.899> reliable<00:01:46.409> they're

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
both accurate they're reliable they're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.770 
both accurate they're reliable they're
quick<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.040> thought<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.640> iPhone<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.299> better<00:01:48.509> at

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
quick I thought the iPhone was better at

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
quick I thought the iPhone was better at
weird<00:01:49.140> angles<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> Galaxy<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.820> just

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
weird angles but the Galaxy was just

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
weird angles but the Galaxy was just
more<00:01:51.450> consistent<00:01:51.930> overall<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.680> can't<00:01:52.860> go

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
more consistent overall but you can't go

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.350 
more consistent overall but you can't go
wrong<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.189> either<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.820> fingerprint

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
wrong with either of these fingerprint

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.179 
wrong with either of these fingerprint
sensors<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.899> they<00:01:55.229> both<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.680> help<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> both

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
sensors and they both do help to both

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
sensors and they both do help to both
speed<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.729> your<00:01:57.030> unlocking<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> phone<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
speed up your unlocking of the phone and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.069 
speed up your unlocking of the phone and
also<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.159> more<00:01:59.369> secure<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.360> plus<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.049> both

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
also be more secure so a plus for both

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.690 
also be more secure so a plus for both
of<00:02:01.320> these<00:02:01.409> companies<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.100> terms<00:02:02.460> of

the screen and let's keep this simple
both<00:02:19.609> screens<00:02:19.909> are<00:02:20.090> excellent<00:02:20.659> but<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.989> s6

excellent viewing angles the still gets
pretty<00:02:31.430> bright<00:02:31.670> doesn't<00:02:32.090> quite<00:02:32.239> get<00:02:32.480> as<00:02:32.599> dim

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
but they're both excellent screens of

but they're both excellent screens of
course<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.599> s6<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.079> bigger<00:02:36.290> which<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.709> a

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
course the s6 is bigger which is a

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.039 
course the s6 is bigger which is a
definite<00:02:37.459> plus<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.629> extra<00:02:38.959> resolution

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
definite plus and the extra resolution

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.229 
definite plus and the extra resolution
is<00:02:39.469> nice<00:02:39.680> although<00:02:40.159> not<00:02:40.310> always<00:02:40.519> necessary

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
is nice although not always necessary

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.809 
is nice although not always necessary
but<00:02:41.590> essentially<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.069> can't<00:02:43.430> go<00:02:43.579> wrong<00:02:43.760> with

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
but essentially you can't go wrong with

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.970 
but essentially you can't go wrong with
either<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.389> these<00:02:44.569> screens<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.859> my

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
either of these screens but in my

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.009 
either of these screens but in my
opinion<00:02:46.069> I<00:02:46.430> would<00:02:46.609> prefer<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.000> s6<00:02:47.419> due<00:02:47.689> to<00:02:47.870> its

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
opinion I would prefer the s6 due to its

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.679 
opinion I would prefer the s6 due to its
sheer<00:02:48.260> size<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.650> resolution<00:02:49.329> now<00:02:50.329> one<00:02:50.480> area

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
sheer size and resolution now one area

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.720 
sheer size and resolution now one area
that<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.139> iPhone<00:02:51.470> surprisingly<00:02:52.129> wins<00:02:52.519> in

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
that the iPhone surprisingly wins in

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.759 
that the iPhone surprisingly wins in
would<00:02:53.090> be<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.239> battery<00:02:53.689> life<00:02:53.840> now<00:02:54.349> neither<00:02:54.590> of

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
would be a battery life now neither of

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.440 
would be a battery life now neither of
these<00:02:54.859> films<00:02:55.220> have<00:02:55.370> great<00:02:55.549> battery<00:02:55.819> life<00:02:56.000> but

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
these films have great battery life but

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.209 
these films have great battery life but
due<00:02:56.629> to<00:02:56.689> the<00:02:56.959> massive<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:57.799> high<00:02:58.040> resolution

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
due to the massive and high resolution

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.089 
due to the massive and high resolution
display<00:02:58.849> on<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.329> s6<00:02:59.569> it<00:03:00.079> struggles<00:03:00.889> to<00:03:01.010> get

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
display on the s6 it struggles to get

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.920 
display on the s6 it struggles to get
through<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.340> full<00:03:01.519> day<00:03:01.579> where<00:03:02.060> my<00:03:02.180> iPhone<00:03:02.599> 6

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
through a full day where my iPhone 6

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.679 
through a full day where my iPhone 6
generally<00:03:03.620> does<00:03:03.919> get<00:03:04.159> through<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.519> full<00:03:04.819> day<00:03:05.090> so

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
generally does get through a full day so

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.569 
generally does get through a full day so
neither<00:03:05.930> perfect<00:03:06.290> both<00:03:06.799> will<00:03:07.069> probably<00:03:07.459> have

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
neither perfect both will probably have

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.309 
neither perfect both will probably have
to<00:03:07.639> be<00:03:07.760> charged<00:03:08.090> sometime<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.599> day<00:03:08.750> but<00:03:09.169> my

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
to be charged sometime in the day but my

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.709 
to be charged sometime in the day but my
iPhone<00:03:09.650> 6<00:03:09.919> definitely<00:03:10.519> did<00:03:10.879> get<00:03:11.120> longer<00:03:11.389> than

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
iPhone 6 definitely did get longer than

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.170 
iPhone 6 definitely did get longer than
my<00:03:11.870> s6<00:03:12.349> although<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.099> s6<00:03:13.489> does<00:03:13.760> feature<00:03:14.030> a

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
my s6 although the s6 does feature a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.330 
my s6 although the s6 does feature a
wireless<00:03:14.659> charging<00:03:14.930> built-in<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:16.129> it<00:03:16.250> also

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
wireless charging built-in and it also

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.189 
wireless charging built-in and it also
has<00:03:16.609> fast<00:03:16.909> charging<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.659> can<00:03:17.810> charge<00:03:18.049> your

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.199 
has fast charging so you can charge your

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.170 
has fast charging so you can charge your
phone<00:03:18.260> from<00:03:18.560> 0<00:03:18.859> to<00:03:18.949> 100<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.340> roughly<00:03:19.970> an<00:03:20.090> hour

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
phone from 0 to 100 and roughly an hour

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.390 
phone from 0 to 100 and roughly an hour
and<00:03:20.419> a<00:03:20.449> half<00:03:20.599> where<00:03:20.959> it's<00:03:21.139> maybe<00:03:21.530> 2<00:03:21.859> to<00:03:22.159> 3<00:03:22.370> hours

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
and a half where it's maybe 2 to 3 hours

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.939 
and a half where it's maybe 2 to 3 hours
on<00:03:22.699> the<00:03:22.879> iPhone<00:03:23.150> 6<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:23.930> overall<00:03:24.229> the<00:03:24.470> iPhone<00:03:24.709> 6

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
on the iPhone 6 so overall the iPhone 6

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.800 
on the iPhone 6 so overall the iPhone 6
does<00:03:25.129> have<00:03:25.310> better<00:03:25.489> battery<00:03:25.849> life<00:03:25.909> but<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.449> s6

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
does have better battery life but the s6

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.469 
does have better battery life but the s6
does<00:03:27.049> have<00:03:27.229> some<00:03:27.409> cool<00:03:27.620> battery<00:03:28.010> features<00:03:28.479> so

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:29.479 
does have some cool battery features so

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.969 
does have some cool battery features so
you<00:03:29.569> had<00:03:29.659> to<00:03:29.750> get<00:03:29.840> another<00:03:29.989> aspect<00:03:30.590> where<00:03:30.829> both

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:30.979 
you had to get another aspect where both

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.099 
you had to get another aspect where both
of<00:03:31.159> these<00:03:31.250> phones<00:03:31.489> are<00:03:31.879> spectacular<00:03:32.629> would<00:03:33.079> be

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
of these phones are spectacular would be

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.050 
of these phones are spectacular would be
speed<00:03:33.829> they're<00:03:34.129> both<00:03:34.280> excellent<00:03:34.760> they're

both quick and responsive and aside from

both quick and responsive and aside from
the<00:03:37.669> occasional<00:03:37.760> hiccups<00:03:38.449> I<00:03:38.569> did<00:03:38.780> get<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.019> the

the occasional hiccups I did get in the

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.009 
the occasional hiccups I did get in the

s6 because of Android they both were

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.319 
s6 because of Android they both were
really<00:03:42.319> nice<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.829> day-to-day<00:03:43.069> usage<00:03:43.579> now<00:03:44.269> the

really both excellent camera stood with

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.120 
really both excellent camera stood with
a<00:04:24.409> great<00:04:24.740> video

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
a great video

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.770 
a great video
the<00:04:25.610> s6<00:04:25.909> does<00:04:26.120> have<00:04:26.300> 4k

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
the s6 does have 4k

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.660

the iPhone 6 has a much better slow-mo
so<00:04:29.150> there's<00:04:29.300> pros<00:04:29.450> and<00:04:29.660> cons<00:04:29.840> of<00:04:30.020> both<00:04:30.200> but<00:04:30.560> in

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
so there's pros and cons of both but in

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.650 
so there's pros and cons of both but in
day<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.889> day<00:04:30.950> use<00:04:31.340> they're<00:04:32.030> both<00:04:32.180> quick

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
day to day use they're both quick

day to day use they're both quick
they're<00:04:32.810> both<00:04:32.930> responsive<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.770> they<00:04:33.860> both

they're both responsive and they both

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.129 
they're both responsive and they both
give<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.370> great<00:04:34.820> shots

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
give you great shots

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.050 
give you great shots
and<00:04:37.229> finally<00:04:37.889> there's<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.490> topic<00:04:38.909> of

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
and finally there's the topic of

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.700 
and finally there's the topic of
software<00:04:39.689> and<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.199> really<00:04:40.349> what's<00:04:40.590> gonna

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
software and this is really what's gonna

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.469 
software and this is really what's gonna
be<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.949> differentiating<00:04:41.699> factor<00:04:41.729> for<00:04:42.389> many

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
be the differentiating factor for many
