1 point 9 p released three and in this

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.099 
1 point 9 p released three and in this
video<00:00:05.730> we<00:00:06.089> are<00:00:06.120> going<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.509> take<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> look<00:00:06.870> at<00:00:07.020> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
video we are going to take a look at the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.770 
video we are going to take a look at the
enchantment<00:00:07.890> table<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.760> let's<00:00:09.179> just<00:00:09.389> see<00:00:09.540> what

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
enchantment table so let's just see what

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.209 
enchantment table so let's just see what
this<00:00:09.900> thing<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.170> do<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.469> know<00:00:10.590> if<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.800> toss<00:00:11.010> some

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
this thing can do I know if we toss some

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.350 
this thing can do I know if we toss some
diamond<00:00:11.490> swords<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.849> here<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.090> get<00:00:12.210> some

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
diamond swords in here we get some

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.509 
diamond swords in here we get some
random<00:00:12.690> numbers<00:00:12.990> I'm<00:00:13.230> not<00:00:13.590> sure<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:14.250> these

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
random numbers I'm not sure what these

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.660 
random numbers I'm not sure what these
mean<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:15.780> if<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.020> change<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.920> changes<00:00:17.400> every

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
mean but if we change it changes every

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.810 
mean but if we change it changes every
time<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.210> I'm<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:19.080> sure<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:20.250> doing<00:00:20.670> but

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
time so I'm not sure what it's doing but

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.429 
time so I'm not sure what it's doing but
it<00:00:20.910> seems<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.119> be<00:00:21.210> random<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.020> let's<00:00:22.260> leave<00:00:22.380> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
it seems to be random so let's leave it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.450 
it seems to be random so let's leave it
at<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:22.920> those<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.430> pretty

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
at that because those are some pretty

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.759 
at that because those are some pretty
high<00:00:23.760> numbers<00:00:24.150> will<00:00:24.720> put<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.930> down<00:00:25.230> here<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
high numbers will put that down here and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.419 
high numbers will put that down here and
it<00:00:26.279> works<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.730> looks<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.300> tools<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.779> well<00:00:28.429> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
it works on looks like tools as well and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.959 
it works on looks like tools as well and
we'll<00:00:29.789> try<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.150> pickaxe<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.759> it<00:00:32.759> seems

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
we'll try it on a pickaxe and it seems

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.370 
we'll try it on a pickaxe and it seems
to<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.210> working<00:00:33.390> pretty<00:00:33.719> good<00:00:33.840> i<00:00:33.989> don't<00:00:34.110> know

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
to be working pretty good i don't know

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500 
to be working pretty good i don't know
what<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.890> doing<00:00:35.250> though<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.390> works

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
what it's doing though see if it works

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.580 
what it's doing though see if it works
on<00:00:36.660> armor<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.140> does<00:00:37.350> work<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.739> armor<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:39.590> let's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
on armor it does work on armor and let's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.459 
on armor it does work on armor and let's
try<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> rest<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> armor<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> i'm

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
try it with the rest of the armor so i'm

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.779 
try it with the rest of the armor so i'm
just<00:00:43.530> doing<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:43.950> until<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.460> some<00:00:44.610> higher

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
just doing this until I get some higher

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.900 
just doing this until I get some higher
numbers<00:00:45.239> because<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:46.289> probably<00:00:47.160> higher

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
numbers because I think probably higher

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.250 
numbers because I think probably higher
numbers<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:48.539> better<00:00:49.399> but<00:00:50.399> I'm<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.700> sure<00:00:50.730> what

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
numbers are better but I'm not sure what

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.689 
numbers are better but I'm not sure what
these<00:00:52.260> even<00:00:52.649> ours<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:53.430> weird

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
these even ours it's in some weird

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.790 
these even ours it's in some weird
language<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.980> looks<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:57.410> mean<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.530> don't<00:00:58.710> know

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
language that looks I mean I don't know

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.389 
language that looks I mean I don't know
what<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> languages<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.910> guess<00:01:00.590> it's<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.949> test

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
what that languages I guess it's a test

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.480 
what that languages I guess it's a test
afek<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> knees<00:01:03.030> maybe<00:01:06.020> no<00:01:07.020> idea<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:08.250> we'll

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
afek it knees maybe no idea but we'll

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.760 
afek it knees maybe no idea but we'll
just<00:01:08.640> play<00:01:08.820> around<00:01:09.080> get<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.260> high<00:01:10.409> numbers

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
just play around get some high numbers

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.440 
just play around get some high numbers
on<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:11.040> whatever<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> numbers<00:01:12.060> mean<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
on these whatever the numbers mean I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000 
on these whatever the numbers mean I
noticed<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> text<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.290> changing<00:01:13.710> along<00:01:13.860> with

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
noticed the text is changing along with

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.200 
noticed the text is changing along with
the<00:01:14.070> numbers<00:01:14.369> too<00:01:14.520> we'll<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.970> works<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the numbers too we'll see if it works in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.469 
the numbers too we'll see if it works in
a<00:01:15.270> bow<00:01:15.450> does<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.740> work<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> boat<00:01:17.369> ok<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.390> is

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
a bow does not work on a boat ok this is

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.380 
a bow does not work on a boat ok this is
work<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> potion<00:01:19.189> no<00:01:20.189> work<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> thing

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
work on a potion no work on this thing

work on a potion no work on this thing
nope<00:01:22.250> ok<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> I'm<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.659> sure<00:01:24.720> what<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> did<00:01:25.970> if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
nope ok so I'm not sure what that did if

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.340 
nope ok so I'm not sure what that did if
it<00:01:27.600> changed<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> stats<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.310> any<00:01:30.210> way<00:01:30.450> made

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it changed the stats in any way made

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.630 
it changed the stats in any way made
them<00:01:31.470> stronger<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:33.229> just<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.680> know<00:01:35.009> haha

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
them stronger I just I don't know haha

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
them stronger I just I don't know haha
so<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.570> ahead<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.750> switch<00:01:40.049> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so I'm going to go ahead and switch this

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.880 
so I'm going to go ahead and switch this
world<00:01:40.439> over<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.780> survival<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.960> we'll<00:01:43.680> take<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
world over to survival and we'll take a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
world over to survival and we'll take a
look<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.159> some<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.490> stuff<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.390> a

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.730 
though hmm I don't know I'd like to test
out<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.430> fire<00:04:06.700> resistance<00:04:07.390> but<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:07.990> need<00:04:08.320> fire

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740
