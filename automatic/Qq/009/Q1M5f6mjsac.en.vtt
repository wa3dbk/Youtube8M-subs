00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.050 
you're gonna make it fairly light this
is<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.790> bit<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
is going to have a little bit of a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910 
is going to have a little bit of a
stiffer<00:01:30.330> camber<00:01:30.869> than<00:01:31.140> some<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> other

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
stiffer camber than some of the other

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
stiffer camber than some of the other
backcountry<00:01:32.310> skis<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.180> track

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
backcountry skis so when you track

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.640 
backcountry skis so when you track
skiing<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:33.930> still<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.500> good

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
skiing you're still going to get good

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
skiing you're still going to get good
glide<00:01:34.950> you're<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> match<00:01:36.450> us

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
glide you're going to want to match us

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
glide you're going to want to match us
up<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> boot<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> give<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
up with a boot that's going to give you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
up with a boot that's going to give you
a<00:01:38.460> good<00:01:38.640> better<00:01:38.820> ankle<00:01:39.210> support<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:39.780> something

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
a good better ankle support so something

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
a good better ankle support so something
like<00:01:40.470> say<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.130> example<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.580> Salomon<00:01:42.000> X

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
like say for example a Salomon X

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.600 
like say for example a Salomon X
adventure<00:01:42.630> 5<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.650> looks<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:44.400> similar

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
adventure 5 so this looks very similar

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
adventure 5 so this looks very similar
to<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.060> hiking<00:01:45.390> boot<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> toe

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
to a hiking boot but it's got the toe

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
to a hiking boot but it's got the toe
mount<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.640> that's<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.479> your

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
mount on it that's going to be for your

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
mount on it that's going to be for your

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
of those but if you look at the bottom

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.820 
of those but if you look at the bottom
of<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.810> got<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> very<00:01:55.229> good<00:01:55.380> tread<00:01:55.680> on

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.380 
of it it's it's got a very good tread on
it<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.340> put<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.640> boot<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.240> home

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
then you're not going to be slipping

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
then you're not going to be slipping
around<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.350> snap<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.710> onto<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.189> skis

and you can start skiing so I'll grab
one<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> bindings<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.540> there's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
one of the bindings for that there's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.289 
one of the bindings for that there's
basically<00:02:06.930> two<00:02:07.259> bindings<00:02:07.740> from<00:02:08.579> Salomon<00:02:09.179> that

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
basically two bindings from Salomon that

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.240 
basically two bindings from Salomon that
are<00:02:09.420> gonna<00:02:09.509> work<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:10.049> that<00:02:10.200> system

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
are gonna work with that system

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.830 
are gonna work with that system
so<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.910> probably<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.300> binding<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:12.690> would

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so this is probably the binding I would

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.470 
so this is probably the binding I would
suggest<00:02:13.130> which<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> Solomon<00:02:14.970> access

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
suggest which is the Solomon access

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.900 
suggest which is the Solomon access
binding<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> works<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.590> your<00:02:16.770> automatic<00:02:17.130> SNS

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
binding it works like your automatic SNS

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.220 
binding it works like your automatic SNS
profile<00:02:18.300> binding<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.780> basically<00:02:18.990> just

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
profile binding and you basically just

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.710 
profile binding and you basically just
step<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:19.980> like<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.760> away<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.180> go<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
step in like that and away you go and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.380 
step in like that and away you go and
you<00:02:21.990> can<00:02:22.140> see<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:22.500> ridge<00:02:22.800> here<00:02:23.240> on<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
you can see this ridge here on the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.720 
you can see this ridge here on the
binding<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.230> profile<00:02:25.950> Ridge<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.520> goes

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
binding the profile Ridge and that goes

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.370 
binding the profile Ridge and that goes
right<00:02:26.940> down<00:02:27.000> into<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.600> channel<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> boot

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
right down into this channel on the boot

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.230 
right down into this channel on the boot
and<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.280> does<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.730> when<00:02:29.850> you're<00:02:30.060> snow

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
and what that does is when you're snow

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.930 
and what that does is when you're snow
plowing<00:02:30.510> down<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.020> hill<00:02:31.200> that's<00:02:31.650> gonna<00:02:31.950> help

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
plowing down the hill that's gonna help

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.550 
plowing down the hill that's gonna help
that<00:02:33.120> boot<00:02:33.330> stay<00:02:33.600> aligned<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.050> ski<00:02:34.350> so

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that boot stay aligned on the ski so

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.310 
that boot stay aligned on the ski so
your<00:02:34.680> heels<00:02:34.860> aren't<00:02:35.010> slipping<00:02:35.400> off<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.480 
trails this is going to be sort of for
skiing<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.970> back<00:03:00.150> forty<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.160> doesn't

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
skiing the back forty but it doesn't

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.920 
skiing the back forty but it doesn't
have<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> lot<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:02.910> side<00:03:03.210> cut<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:03.780> you're

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
have a lot of side cut so if you're

skiing a trail that you're going to ski

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.530 
skiing a trail that you're going to ski
consistently<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.030> want<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.270> get<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> little

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
consistently you want to get a little

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.450 
consistently you want to get a little
bit<00:03:06.690> more<00:03:06.810> glide<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.100> is<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> little

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
bit more glide because it is a little

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.920 
bit more glide because it is a little
bit<00:03:08.640> narrower<00:03:08.970> than<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.270> neck<00:03:09.450> scheming<00:03:09.840> to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
bit narrower than the neck scheming to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.240 
bit narrower than the neck scheming to
talk<00:03:10.110> about<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.530> going<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.800> give<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.070> a

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
talk about it's going to give you a

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.500 
talk about it's going to give you a
little<00:03:11.490> bit<00:03:11.640> more<00:03:11.760> glide<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.240> going<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.420> be<00:03:12.480> a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
little bit more glide it's going to be a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.720 
little bit more glide it's going to be a
little<00:03:12.630> bit<00:03:12.750> more<00:03:12.870> efficient<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:14.250> again<00:03:14.550> this

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
little bit more efficient so again this

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.970 
little bit more efficient so again this
ski<00:03:15.030> does<00:03:15.360> have<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.810> non<00:03:16.440> wax

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
ski does have the non wax

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.240 
ski does have the non wax
base<00:03:17.489> on<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.510> fish-scale<00:03:18.750> type<00:03:19.260> base<00:03:19.500> it

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
base on it the fish-scale type base it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.920 
base on it the fish-scale type base it
has<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.459> further<00:03:20.790> long<00:03:21.120> grip<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:21.600> if<00:03:21.810> you

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
has a further long grip so if you

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.979 
has a further long grip so if you
compare<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.530> grips<00:03:22.770> on<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> last<00:03:23.459> ski

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
compare the grips on to the last ski

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.510 
compare the grips on to the last ski
this<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.230> little<00:03:25.650> bit<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.890> shorter<00:03:26.250> even

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
this is a little bit of a shorter even

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.400 
this is a little bit of a shorter even
the<00:03:26.730> shorter<00:03:27.090> ski<00:03:27.300> has<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.510> longer<00:03:27.810> grip<00:03:28.170> zone

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
the shorter ski has a longer grip zone

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.580 
the shorter ski has a longer grip zone

you're<00:03:36.660> gonna<00:03:36.780> be<00:03:36.959> skiing<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.470> terrain<00:03:38.060> that's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
you're gonna be skiing in terrain that's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.750 
you're gonna be skiing in terrain that's
gonna<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.390> softer<00:03:39.840> snow<00:03:39.900> not<00:03:40.440> set<00:03:40.770> track<00:03:41.130> one

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
gonna be softer snow not set track one

so you want this ski to be softer and
they're<00:03:47.160> designed<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.640> be<00:03:47.730> softer<00:03:48.270> anyways<00:03:49.260> so

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
they're designed to be softer anyways so

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.340 
they're designed to be softer anyways so
this<00:03:50.100> skis<00:03:50.400> can<00:03:50.640> have<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.820> full<00:03:51.209> steel<00:03:51.870> edge<00:03:52.110> on

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
you're gonna be in deeper snow then

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.910 
you're gonna be in deeper snow then
you're<00:04:30.750> gonna<00:04:30.870> not<00:04:31.110> get<00:04:31.230> snow<00:04:31.470> inside<00:04:31.770> the

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
you're gonna not get snow inside the

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.060 
you're gonna not get snow inside the
boots<00:04:32.130> okay

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
boots okay

boots okay
the<00:04:35.070> next<00:04:35.370> ski<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:35.850> we're<00:04:36.510> gonna<00:04:36.570> talk<00:04:36.870> about

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
the next ski this we're gonna talk about

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.930 
the next ski this we're gonna talk about
here<00:04:37.350> is<00:04:37.500> called<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.920> Salomon<00:04:38.370> X<00:04:38.490> Adventure

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
here is called the Salomon X Adventure

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.050 
here is called the Salomon X Adventure
89<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:39.960> is<00:04:40.110> basically<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:41.610> ski<00:04:41.880> that

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
89 so this is basically the ski that

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.520 
89 so this is basically the ski that
you're<00:04:42.240> gonna<00:04:42.360> what<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:42.960> would<00:04:43.170> call<00:04:43.320> your

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
you're gonna what I would call your

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.260 
you're gonna what I would call your
bushwhacking<00:04:44.160> ski<00:04:44.400> or<00:04:44.670> if<00:04:44.790> you're<00:04:44.910> gonna<00:04:45.030> go

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
bushwhacking ski or if you're gonna go

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.090 
bushwhacking ski or if you're gonna go
up<00:04:45.510> into<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.110> Alpine<00:04:46.440> you're<00:04:46.770> not<00:04:46.890> really

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
up into the Alpine you're not really

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.680 
up into the Alpine you're not really
going<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.370> go<00:04:47.460> up<00:04:47.640> there<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.970> ski<00:04:48.210> up<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.540> down

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
going to go up there to ski up and down

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.450 
going to go up there to ski up and down
like<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:49.020> would<00:04:49.170> with<00:04:49.350> all<00:04:49.860> terrain<00:04:50.130> melting

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
like you would with all terrain melting

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.510 
like you would with all terrain melting
gear<00:04:50.700> but<00:04:51.120> you're<00:04:51.270> basically<00:04:52.220> going<00:04:53.220> up

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
gear but you're basically going up

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.450 
gear but you're basically going up
somewhere<00:04:54.410> skiing<00:04:55.410> through<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> trees<00:04:56.040> or

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
somewhere skiing through the trees or

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.950 
somewhere skiing through the trees or
skiing<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.880> deeper<00:04:57.180> snow<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.810> whole

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
skiing the deeper snow and the whole

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.250 
skiing the deeper snow and the whole
purpose<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.680> of<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.630> adventure<00:05:00.630> is<00:05:00.810> not

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
purpose of the of the adventure is not

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.810 
purpose of the of the adventure is not
so<00:05:01.500> much<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.890> going<00:05:02.220> up<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.520> down<00:05:02.640> but

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
so much of going up and down but

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.460 
so much of going up and down but
actually<00:05:03.150> getting<00:05:03.390> to<00:05:03.540> a<00:05:03.570> place<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.080> covering

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
actually getting to a place and covering

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.320 
actually getting to a place and covering
some<00:05:04.680> ground<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.070> being<00:05:05.250> quite<00:05:05.820> efficient

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
some ground and being quite efficient

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.690 
some ground and being quite efficient
but<00:05:06.840> because<00:05:07.170> this<00:05:07.350> ski<00:05:07.620> if<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.550> look

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
but because this ski if you have a look

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.070 
but because this ski if you have a look
at<00:05:08.850> it<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.090> does<00:05:09.240> have<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.450> fair<00:05:09.690> bit<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:09.870> side

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
at it it does have a fair bit of side

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.280 
at it it does have a fair bit of side
cut<00:05:10.380> it's<00:05:10.650> wider<00:05:10.920> on<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.190> tip<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.900> on<00:05:13.140> the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
cut it's wider on the tip and and on the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.140 
cut it's wider on the tip and and on the
tails<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.860> narrower<00:05:14.550> in<00:05:14.670> the<00:05:14.790> midsection

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
tails and narrower in the midsection

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.540 
tails and narrower in the midsection
this<00:05:15.900> ski<00:05:16.140> on<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.530> way<00:05:16.620> down<00:05:16.860> will<00:05:17.130> definitely

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
this ski on the way down will definitely

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.160 
this ski on the way down will definitely
turn<00:05:17.700> better<00:05:17.970> than<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.300> other<00:05:18.420> two<00:05:18.630> skis<00:05:18.930> will

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
turn better than the other two skis will

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.110 
turn better than the other two skis will
give<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.830> little<00:05:20.010> more<00:05:20.190> flotation<00:05:20.850> in<00:05:21.000> that

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
give you a little more flotation in that

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.930 
give you a little more flotation in that
deeper<00:05:21.420> powder<00:05:21.660> snow<00:05:22.610> so<00:05:23.610> that<00:05:23.760> you're<00:05:23.850> not

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
deeper powder snow so that you're not

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.280 
deeper powder snow so that you're not
going<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.210> sink<00:05:24.450> in<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:24.840> if<00:05:25.170> you're

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
going to sink in and if you're

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.930 
going to sink in and if you're
meandering<00:05:25.830> through<00:05:25.860> trees<00:05:26.310> because<00:05:26.700> it<00:05:26.820> is

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
meandering through trees because it is

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.010 
meandering through trees because it is
shorter<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.360> wider<00:05:27.510> you're<00:05:27.750> going<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:27.930> get

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
shorter and wider you're going to get

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.840 
shorter and wider you're going to get
better<00:05:28.200> floatation<00:05:28.830> but<00:05:29.310> you're<00:05:29.430> also<00:05:29.580> going

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
better floatation but you're also going

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.120 
better floatation but you're also going
to<00:05:29.910> have<00:05:30.120> more<00:05:31.020> control<00:05:31.440> you're<00:05:31.800> going<00:05:31.860> to<00:05:32.010> be

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
to have more control you're going to be

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.010 
to have more control you're going to be
able<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.340> turn<00:05:32.580> around<00:05:32.690> switchback<00:05:33.690> a<00:05:33.720> lot

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
able to turn around switchback a lot

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.270 
able to turn around switchback a lot
better<00:05:34.230> than<00:05:34.440> you<00:05:34.500> will<00:05:34.650> with<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.860> other<00:05:34.980> skis

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
better than you will with the other skis

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.400 
better than you will with the other skis
because<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.760> is<00:05:35.880> shorter<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.420> wider<00:05:36.960> as<00:05:37.230> well

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
because it is shorter and wider as well

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.980 
because it is shorter and wider as well
too<00:05:37.680> so<00:05:38.100> this<00:05:38.310> ski<00:05:38.550> here<00:05:38.910> does<00:05:39.420> have<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.750> grips

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
too so this ski here does have the grips

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.990 
too so this ski here does have the grips
on<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.230> longer<00:05:40.800> grip<00:05:41.010> sewn<00:05:41.220> on<00:05:41.370> again<00:05:41.670> it<00:05:41.880> is

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
on the longer grip sewn on again it is

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.070 
on the longer grip sewn on again it is
fairly<00:05:42.360> soft<00:05:43.910> has<00:05:44.910> a<00:05:44.940> full<00:05:45.270> steel<00:05:45.540> edge<00:05:45.750> on<00:05:45.960> it

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
fairly soft has a full steel edge on it

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.610 
fairly soft has a full steel edge on it
as<00:05:46.170> well<00:05:46.320> too<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:47.660> with<00:05:48.660> all<00:05:48.840> these<00:05:49.050> skis<00:05:49.410> if

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
as well too and with all these skis if

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.840 
as well too and with all these skis if
you're<00:05:49.770> going<00:05:49.860> to<00:05:49.950> be<00:05:50.010> skiing<00:05:50.280> terrain<00:05:50.670> that's

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
you're going to be skiing terrain that's

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.910 
you're going to be skiing terrain that's
for<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.120> steep<00:05:51.330> you<00:05:51.720> can<00:05:51.900> still<00:05:52.170> put<00:05:52.410> skins<00:05:52.710> on

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
for the steep you can still put skins on

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.890 
for the steep you can still put skins on
them<00:05:53.100> but<00:05:53.490> the<00:05:53.670> benefit<00:05:54.090> of<00:05:54.120> this<00:05:54.270> type<00:05:54.480> of<00:05:54.540> ski

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
them but the benefit of this type of ski

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.180 
them but the benefit of this type of ski
if<00:05:55.080> you're<00:05:55.110> skiing<00:05:55.440> with<00:05:55.680> somebody<00:05:56.010> that
