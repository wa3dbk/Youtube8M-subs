00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello guys with you tomi vazquez and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.300
 this video will be part of my new 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.830
 rubrics developer responses I'll 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.599
 collect the most interesting and most 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.250
 current issues on those that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.240
 developers are officially responding to 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.279
 forum on stream 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.980
 but all the various exhibitions and so on 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.960
 all these questions and answers are not public 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.180
 nothing forbidden all information is open 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.699
 for all I decided to take up this business 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.199
 record a video with my comments 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.880
 because not all of us want, and yet again 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 somewhere to climb somewhere to look for something 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.020
 I want the most interesting all the most 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.270
 important all in one video to watch and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.700
 learn so i hope you 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.590
 will like it and we start this release as 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.110
 you already understood will be dedicated to tank 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.700
 subject and the first question is how much 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.920
 planned sets for zbt 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.989
 we will have another third set 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.780
 which is scheduled for February of this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.340
 years so that soon those who missed 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.219
 in the second wave it remains to wait at all 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.920
 little next question will be visible 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.050
 damage to the tanks before its destruction 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.629
 punch it and dents falling off on 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.430
 spring fixture damage from 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.500
 enemy shells will certainly be 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.780
 display as a breakthrough and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 explosive damage for example from flying from 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.250
 hitting attachments 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.590
 present now and it pleases 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.720
 because such small details add 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.610
 our game more brilliance more 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 realism and just playing becomes 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.860
 more pleasant the next question is whether 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 expand tank cards on this 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.820
 moment tanks lead the battle on a separate 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.340
 plot of standard war thunder maps 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.320
 available for air battles to do 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.880
 these plots are larger than 16 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.079
 square kilometers four by four 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.049
 we are not planning 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.070
 tests show that it is not interesting 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.470
 the player may not be enough 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.119
 fast in the right place and battle 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.850
 broken down into unrelated 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.770
 skirmishes and I generally agree with that 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.619
 The answer is because if for airplanes 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.479
 it is very important to gain altitude and for this 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.880
 need big cards then for tanks it 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.399
 there is no need to enter 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.049
 huge tank cards make no sense to 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.880
 after the start of the battle as soon as possible 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.820
 reach the enemy start shooting and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.729
 fight the next question the player asks 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.560
 I hope you can not destroy the tank rams 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.440
 why do you hope tank 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.180
 ram is a rather dangerous weapon 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.890
 the collision of two 30 tons of their cars can 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.959
 entail very serious 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.629
 implications for the technical part not 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.489
 to mention the crew and here I am more than 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.220
 I agree with the developers because 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.440
 besides being a ram weapon so is this 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.150
 and fan on fast tanks will be very 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.940
 cool taranets and turn over each 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.230
 friend it will bring the disastrous from the personal 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.319
 a touch of fun and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.780
 and fun stream vyacheslav told us that 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.540
 crew in open tanks will be the question 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.819
 will it be disconnected ? 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.160
 not solved the news itself that the crew 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.900
 will have excellent news well, 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.299
 Of course, disconnecting will also not 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.079
 superfluous if someone is not very interesting 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.340
 or may interfere or distract from the fight 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.220
 the next question is whether the opportunity 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.750
 repair internal modules 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.670
 probability of doing repairs at the base of everything 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.620
 still discussing this opportunity 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.989
 it seems to me repair on base is quite 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.040
 acceptable in the game to not fully 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.260
 complicate life 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.720
 players and save all the same some 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.180
 game conventions if lead will 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.790
 very good whether it will be possible to change 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.980
 projectile barrel without it from the arrow until 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.959
 made the need from the arrow of the projectile 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.750
 as it was in real life at this 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.880
 I do not plan to change the next moment 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.160
 the question is whether the zenith semi-tracked 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.230
 armored vehicles such anti-aircraft guns were much 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.579
 more common than anti-aircraft guns on 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.549
 tank highway 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.849
 of course they will be able to very soon 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.799
 see the first Soviet copies and 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.959
 it's very cool at zenith how pretty 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.959
 interesting to play and if there is a lot and 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.510
 will choose from which is even better 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.790
 will the number of players be 16 by 16 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.400
 including tanks anti-aircraft guns and in 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.849
 future ships or increase to 32 and 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.959
 the pains 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.209
 while there will be 16 to 16 technically 32 to 32 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.310
 it doesn't matter and even makes it easier 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.040
 server load but meaningful 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.049
 what is happening falls in general i agree 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.030
 too many players on the battlefield too 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.150
 everything can turn bad 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.900
 happening in porridge and while 16 by 16 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.150
 well played norma 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.650
 whether the weather will affect not only 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.959
 visual component but also on 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.180
 the behavior of the machine in the plans such 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.520
 there is a dependency but we cannot 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.080
 say whether the tank armor will be 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.910
 collisions change properties 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.639
 i.e. become less strong 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.949
 wrinkle and chip off strain 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.259
 armor plans no armor can be destroyed 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.000
 multiple hits after which 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.400
 it stops being taken into account in the model 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.500
 damage though you rather destroy and 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.259
 tank than completely destroy and his battle 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.449
 slab and here I generally agree not 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.789
 a lot of sense to complicate the gameplay with 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.280
 changes in armor properties after collisions 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.800
 whether plans will be destructible buildings 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.320
 Olya drive through the house or tear down 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.080
 that shed shot let it be 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.120
 certainly why the tanks are rusty 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.760
 I doubt that they are from the factory 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.130
 they mostly went out and the tanks were covered 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.080
 not rust and dirt themselves fighting 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.099
 cars logically rust in process 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.080
 operation 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.090
 and premium account owners will be able to 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.910
 customize the look of your battle 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.130
 cars and that's cool because we 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.620
 all the same on the tanks they play sports 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.930
 wheelbarrows licked to shine and dirt 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.539
 only gives more such a formidable look 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.910
 combat vehicle damage by separation 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.639
 rinks or fully caterpillar 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.070
 can be implemented with the separation of the rollers 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.220
 rather, yes, the caterpillars 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.770
 No, in the near future, have you decided 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.380
 trunk materiality modes will be 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.740
 clear after experiments and checks in 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.139
 battles 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.330
 This is a very topical question. 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.820
 because the materiality of the trunk can 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.110
 quite widely change the gameplay to me 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.020
 it seems in realistic fights 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.940
 materiality will be superfluous and 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.949
 confirm the status of realistic combat in 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.409
 arcade opposite rather disturb because there 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.289
 mostly directed battles 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.669
 simplicity and transience and 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.960
 trunk materiality most often 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.599
 probably will be superfluous 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.740
 well and the last question will be either and in 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.979
 urban setting 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.020
 where do without them in the plans I myself am really looking forward 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.240
 city ​​cards because I love relatives 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.940
 skirmishes and it will surely add 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.919
 diversity in the game in general it's on 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.810
 Today, all I hope you were interested 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.360
 see questions and answers 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.920
 and my opinion if you want to continue 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.060
 headings put huskies 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.270
 subscribe to the channel write 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.190
 comments under the video and all for today 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.670
 Good luck to everyone and see you next time and 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.670
 package
