00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.639
 Hello everyone and thanks for being here 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.170
 new in this tutorial will explain how 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.820
 classify polynomials according to 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.250
 certain characteristics of them 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.169
 we started first we will make a 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.520
 classification according to the number of the 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.510
 number of algebraic terms 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.280
 the polynomial 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.990
 which consists of a single term 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.700
 algebraic is called my monkey if 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
 you want to learn how to perform operations 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.210
 math with bonus mine there is a series 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.030
 of tutorials already posted on youtube 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.550
 made by sapiens video 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 we continue if we have two terms 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.480
 algebraic or two mono mine united by 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 signs of adding or subtracting we call it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.100
 binomial as long as each of the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.989
 monkey mine have the literal part 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.320
 different from each other 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.989
 see how we have x raised to 2 in one 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 of the terms and x raised one in the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.949
 another are two algebraic terms 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.920
 different that's why it's called binomial 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.440
 in the event that the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.380
 literal parts of the two monkeys 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.360
 then we would have to perform the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.560
 corresponding mathematical operation and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.790
 we would get a monkey mine not a binomial 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 we continue 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.050
 if we have three algebraic terms it is 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.670
 say three monkey mine united by signs 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.250
 to add or subtract what we call 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 trinomial as long as each of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.370
 the monos mios have the literal part 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.010
 different from the other two 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.610
 look like the previous binomial we have 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.370
 added a monkey mine of grade 3 that is 4x 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.980
 raised to 3 we continue 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.650
 so any algebraic expression 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.690
 with four or more algebraic terms 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.430
 that have the literal part different 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.680
 with respect to the other monomers that 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.920
 form the polynomial we will call it 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.310
 simply polynomial we continue with 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.500
 more classifications of polynomials and in 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.920
 this case we will learn to perform 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.080
 classification according to the absolute degree 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.550
 well, mathematicians perform a 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.380
 classification of polynomials in 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.030
 function of the maximum absolute degree that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 has the polynomial that is to say in function 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.000
 of the absolute degree of the term 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.000
 algebraic with higher degree 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.810
 if we do not have variables we will say that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.880
 we have a polynomial of degree 0 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.300
 normally this will be what we call 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.790
 independent term 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.650
 if we have a single variable with 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.310
 exponent 1 we will say that we have a 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.800
 degree 1 polynomial 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.720
 if we have a polynomial with maximum degree 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.370
 2 we will say that it is a polynomial of degree 2 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.130
 in the image we see that we have two 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.010
 terms in polynomial 1 with degree 2 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.550
 which is 3 xx raised to 2 and another term 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.319
 which is forgiveness that is minus x that will be the 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.660
 second algebraic term that has 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.459
 degree 1 but we'll say that the polynomial is 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.440
 of grade 2 and at the same time we can 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.150
 say that it is a binomial if we want 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.610
 classify them according to the number of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.900
 algebraic terms that is according to the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.569
 first classification performed 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.910
 previously but now look at the 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.660
 next equation we have a polynomial 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.600
 with a grade 2 term that is 6 per and 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.489
 raised to 2 minus 2 which is the term 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.450
 independent it seems that the 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.730
 term and raised to 1 this polynomial 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.230
 it's still a polynomial of degree 2 already 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.930
 that it is not necessary to have all the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.580
 terms with the different grades for 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.700
 say that this polynomial is grade 2 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.920
 we continue 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.480
 now we see a polynomial of degree 3 already 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.769
 that the first monkey has 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.599
 3rd grade 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.810
 next we see another polynomial but 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:40.160
 this time the first term is 4 for x 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.840
 by and raised to 2 notice that if we add 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.080
 the exponents of the variables of the 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.690
 first term we get grade 3 in addition 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.660
 there is no grade 2 term and only 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.870
 there is the term of degree 1 which is 3 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.610
 by and but as the first term is from 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.549
 degree 3 we can say that the polynomial 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.950
 Grade 3 is that is does not matter 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.230
 number of variables that we have or that 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.319
 have the polynomial in its literal part 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.769
 what matters is finding the part 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.650
 literally with the highest degree that degree 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.260
 will be the one that determines the classification or 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.570
 the degree of the polynomial look at the 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.459
 last example we see that we have a 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.680
 polynomial with multiple multiples 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.139
 variables and also the variables are 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.510
 different in some of the monos mine and 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.030
 they also have different exponents if 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.440
 we calculate the absolute degree of each one 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.750
 of the monomers or algebraic terms 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.330
 today we see we observe that the degree 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.420
 absolute is determined by my monkey who is 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.480
 5 for high zeta 7 since it's the monkey 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.550
 mine with greater absolute degree therefore 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.140
 if the absolute degree of the polynomial 7 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.390
 we can say that it is a polynomial of 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.100
 7th grade well now we know how to 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.990
 name or call the different 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.880
 polynomials according to the number of terms 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.460
 algebraic and according to the absolute degree 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.140
 of the polynomial in the following tutorial 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.510
 you will learn the classification of 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.820
 polynomials according to other characteristics 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.810
 so see you in the next tutorial 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.810
 see you soon
