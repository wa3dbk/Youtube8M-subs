00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.680
 yes 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.140
 but everyone speaks gamer fox and 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.440
 welcome to the second episode of 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:31.530
 our halo weapon guide 4 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.530
 this time we will cover the battle rifle 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.470
 a legendary weapon in the universe of 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.010
 halo is rumored to be the most 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.290
 used in the multiplayer but if 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.890
 we want to extract all its power we must from 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.890
 know how 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.610
 at stake the burst damage is high 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.610
 you need at least 7 bursts to 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.040
 kill your enemy or 5 at the head the 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.190
 Most players compare the tmr 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.920
 with the br and how can we see the great 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.470
 power with which account the br is 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.420
 essential in the battlefield and the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 main element that distinguishes it from 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.150
 the one with m &amp; r 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.390
 although it also has its disadvantages 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.640
 br is very poor at fighting a great 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.530
 distance so we must be at 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.390
 a medium range of distance between 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.390
 our enemy and us 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.140
 the rate of fire is one of the most 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.510
 high throughout the game with 336 bullets per 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.300
 minute so a sequence of 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.040
 well placed shots eliminate your 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.530
 enemy quickly 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.170
 there is a very small but mandatory 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.810
 delay between bursts however it is so 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.610
 small in lowercase this delay that no 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.520
 they will be a problem in the battle 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.650
 as we know the battle rifle is a 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.070
 weapon that its firing mode is based on 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.350
 the bursts of three shots each is 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.800
 for this reason why the recall or 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.600
 rifle butt of this weapon is very low so 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.050
 that will not be something that hurts you in 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.050
 battle 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.709
 the capacity per loader is very high 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.230
 with 36 bullets per charger which are 12 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.450
 bursts is thanks to this ability in 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.330
 the chargers so the br is 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.860
 considered the most powerful weapon in everything 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.920
 the game 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.950
 In addition, the recharge speed is very 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.960
 fast with only 1.8 seconds as well 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.960
 that your competition the tmr 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.909
 now to get the best 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.280
 use of power and the great 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.530
 power that counts the battle rifle 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.560
 We must know how to create our 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.030
 equipment something essential in the field 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.819
 of battle is to know our 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.980
 limitations and our abilities and 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.650
 as we know the battle rifle is very 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.420
 powerful to medium and short distance but 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.760
 what to do when an enemy of ours 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.030
 attack from afar is at this moment when 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.160
 our magna secondary weapon enters 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.470
 even though the magnum is not very 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.840
 popular with the community and it is said that 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.630
 it's better the bag also has its 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.730
 advantages the magnum will give us a greater and 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.330
 best chance in long matches 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.610
 medium and short distance and maybe the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.690
 magnum look very small and innocent 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.770
 but it's really a bestiality if the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.450
 we know how to use at the right time 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.580
 now that we have very clear that the br 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.560
 it's only for close matches and our 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.200
 Magnum will serve us in long battles 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.730
 There are also situations in the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.570
 that we must fall by surprise at 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.700
 enemy how do we do this very simple with 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.030
 the help of our partner the backpack 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.030
 rocket 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.769
 it's true maybe it reveals your position 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.709
 but it will also give you a great advantage 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.140
 before the enemy fall over the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.450
 enemy and not realize or even 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.980
 where the shots come from will give you a 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.200
 great advantage on the battlefield 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.120
 so far we can say that the rifle 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.209
 of battle is the most powerful among 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.640
 all primary weapons and it's true is 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.799
 the most powerful although the weapon will not do the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.620
 difference or if we do not know how or what to 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.199
 use in situations of risk ie 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.910
 if a group of enemies get close to 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.410
 our position we must think 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.510
 quick to kill them 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.700
 it is in this kind of situations in the 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.430
 that we will have to resort to our 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.870
 fragmentation grenades next to them 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.600
 the battle rifle will simply be 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.740
 incredibly powerful and you will be the 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.949
 who commands in the field 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.259
 like his rival the tmr we must of 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.360
 be well loaded with grenades at all 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.610
 moment we never know when 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.169
 we will need for this we will use 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.520
 as a tactical resupply package 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.800
 again we will have to stock up on 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.139
 grenades at all times to surprise 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.650
 to our enemies and eliminate them very 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.889
 it is easily thanks to the tactical package 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.229
 replenishment with which we can 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.509
 replenish us the redundancy of 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.280
 the grenades of our colleagues or 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.560
 fallen enemies 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.360
 unlike his rival the one of m &amp; r the 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.540
 battle rifle has a great 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.340
 capacity of the loaders plus that 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.770
 in battle it is very unlikely to be 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.380
 you finish your ammunition so this does not 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.630
 it is no problem it is for this reason 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.240
 the one that we will use dexterity as 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.310
 our support improvement with this little 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.980
 Advantage to our steps will be much more 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.710
 agile in battle by changing weapons and 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.740
 recharging 33% faster than 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:50.200
 normal thanks to this advantage our 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.200
 spartan will dominate in the field 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.600
 in short, the battle rifle is 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.729
 simply the most powerful rifle and 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.820
 mighty that humanity has created 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.800
 although we must know how to use it if it is 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.379
 we want to be the best 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.810
 the best advice I can give you in the 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:14.900
 battlefield is to maintain the 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:18.099
 distance and calmly prepare a 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.750
 trap attracts your enemies to your sight 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:24.159
 wait for a better time to attack and 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.159
 watch as your enemies 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.430
 they fall like flies
