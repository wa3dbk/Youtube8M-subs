00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 let's try the simulation mode 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.790
 - should start 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.790
 right 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 so here we are seeing hard disk mode 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.180
 in various customs then you are highlighted on the map 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.770

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.329
 we will then have to test it on the road 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.789
 When possible 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.789
 being there we can more on the sea as you see 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.709

 the path is also very fast 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.340
 we reserve the right to find it on the road 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.389
 at first glance seeing it like this 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.349

 that fasting rate is very large

 we take away information as it is missing and then I think that appears 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.879
 speed when 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.879
