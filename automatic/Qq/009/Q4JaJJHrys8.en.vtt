00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.340
 Hello friends 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.460
 today we are going to fire colors that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.369
 it's a very eye-catching experiment for it 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.740
 we will need 4 glass containers or 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 Metal that holds heat very well and 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.760
 nothing then in the first two fire 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 green in the third blue fire and in the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.310
 orange fire room 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 let's use alcohol 96 degrees in the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.670
 first three we are filling we put a 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.350
 little bit and that's enough to remember that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.149
 when we are manipulating the fire 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.870
 use all protective measures 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.040
 adequate good in the room let's 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.710
 use 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.930
 good acetone is nail polish remover with 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.110
 acetone that this one will give us the fire 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.990
 orange so we also put the one 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.200
 little in the container 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.980
 and nothing now in the first we put a 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.040
 little copper copper when it burns or good 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.500
 when applying flames it comes out green 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.180
 green as to boric acid that the one that does not 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.790
 I know him they sell it in pharmacies and 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.340
 They come in handy for when they hurt you 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.700
 the feet is like this you put on a bit like 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.080
 out talc and you'll see as well 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.690
 you smell more during a good season 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.830
 I recommend it to you 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.180
 and nothing we remove everything since it is 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.270
 flammable and there may be a misfortune 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.280
 so we started with our 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.500
 experiment when applying the flame of 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.150
 lighter will ignite fire and we will see 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.420
 each container then one color 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.300
 and the copper that comes out green but it's not the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.550
 green green that we will see later with the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.270
 boric acid the rest then of the right 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.189
 orange 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.369
 the third starting from the left 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:58.140
 blue and nothing is a very experiment 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.720
 attractive and curious at the same time 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.510
 so nothing here I leave you with the image 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.870
 of the four vessels I hope that you 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.430

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.430
