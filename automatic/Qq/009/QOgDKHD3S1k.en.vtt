00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
actually levitate and could quickly

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
actually levitate and could quickly
teleport<00:00:57.719> forwards<00:00:58.199> boosting<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> specific

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
teleport forwards boosting in a specific

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090 
teleport forwards boosting in a specific
direction<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> tricky

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
direction this can get out of tricky

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.860 
direction this can get out of tricky
situations<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> hunters<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.629> allow

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
the supernova Billy is a really good

the supernova Billy is a really good
option<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:37.980> use<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:38.549> should<00:03:38.700> use<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
option to use and you should use the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.970 
option to use and you should use the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
hunters really quick with this one go

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.080 
hunters really quick with this one go

and it's quicker stealthy alight nature
it's<00:03:47.579> better<00:03:47.849> suited<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.239> sneaking<00:03:48.720> up<00:03:48.810> on

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
it's better suited to sneaking up on

The<00:03:56.010> Raven<00:03:56.130> attacks<00:03:56.489> can<00:03:56.669> be<00:03:56.700> really<00:03:57.030> brutal

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
The Raven attacks can be really brutal

The Raven attacks can be really brutal
when<00:03:57.660> combined<00:03:58.139> and<00:03:58.410> use<00:03:58.799> one<00:03:59.010> after<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
when combined and use one after the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.460 
when combined and use one after the
other<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.760> cool<00:04:00.359> thing<00:04:00.510> about<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.810> super<00:04:01.109> nova

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
other a cool thing about the super nova

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.589 
other a cool thing about the super nova
belief<00:04:01.769> is<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.370> supernova<00:04:02.910> effect<00:04:03.269> also

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
belief is that the supernova effect also

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.259 
belief is that the supernova effect also
given<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.260> raif's<00:04:04.500> decoy<00:04:05.069> so<00:04:06.030> when

given to the raif's decoy so when

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.909 
given to the raif's decoy so when
combined<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:07.019> two<00:04:07.169> abilities<00:04:07.380> can<00:04:07.709> work

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
combined the two abilities can work

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.920 
combined the two abilities can work
really<00:04:08.220> well<00:04:08.430> together<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.660> will<00:04:09.750> also

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
really well together and it will also

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.750 
really well together and it will also
let<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.709> your<00:04:10.859> decoy<00:04:11.190> attack<00:04:11.549> at<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
let you and your decoy attack at the
