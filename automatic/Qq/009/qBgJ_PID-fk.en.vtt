using traps and the new trapped angel
portal<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.090> reach<00:01:18.630> through<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.530> portal

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
portal you can reach through the portal

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.760 
portal you can reach through the portal
into<00:01:20.640> silence<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> reversing<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> magic

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
into silence and reversing the magic

into silence and reversing the magic
we've<00:01:22.950> had<00:01:23.100> before<00:01:23.310> instead<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.030> putting<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
we've had before instead of putting a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.210 
we've had before instead of putting a
character<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.930> desk<00:01:25.140> island<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.710> grab<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
character in desk island you can grab a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
character in desk island you can grab a
defeated<00:01:26.729> enemy<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> pull<00:01:27.479> them<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
defeated enemy and pull them out and

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.140 
defeated enemy and pull them out and
store<00:01:28.740> them<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> these<00:01:29.579> toy<00:01:29.850> traps

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
store them in one of these toy traps

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.640 
store them in one of these toy traps
like<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> genie<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.049> bottle<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
like a genie in a bottle I think the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.990 
like a genie in a bottle I think the
easiest<00:01:31.829> thing<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.280> us<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.729> would<00:01:32.909> have

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
easiest thing for us to do would have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.789 
easiest thing for us to do would have
been<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.240> keep<00:01:33.840> making<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.259> same<00:01:34.290> game<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
been to keep making the same game and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.260 
been to keep making the same game and
just<00:01:34.860> adding<00:01:35.250> new<00:01:35.520> levels<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> new<00:01:36.030> characters

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
just adding new levels of new characters

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.520 
just adding new levels of new characters
um<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.770> ultimately<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.930> make

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
um but ultimately I think that we make

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.310 
um but ultimately I think that we make
kids<00:01:40.890> say<00:01:41.340> wow<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.509> limit<00:01:42.780> that's<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.200> we

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
kids say wow for a limit that's what we

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.170 
kids say wow for a limit that's what we
did<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> first<00:01:44.369> Skylanders<00:01:44.939> game<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
did with the first Skylanders game it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
did with the first Skylanders game it
was<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> WoW<00:01:45.600> moment<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.290> kids<00:01:46.500> have

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
was a WoW moment you know kids have

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.870 
was a WoW moment you know kids have
never<00:01:46.740> seen<00:01:47.549> anything<00:01:48.299> quite<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
never seen anything quite like that and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
never seen anything quite like that and
that's<00:01:50.880> become<00:01:51.240> our<00:01:51.360> strategy<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:52.110> want<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.409> do

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
that's become our strategy we want to do

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.990 
that's become our strategy we want to do
that<00:01:52.680> each<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.100> every<00:01:53.280> time<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.729> enough

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that each and every time it's not enough

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.120 
that each and every time it's not enough
to<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.149> add<00:01:54.450> new<00:01:54.600> characters<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.409> go<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.829> new

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
to just add new characters and go to new

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.620 
to just add new characters and go to new
levels

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
levels

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.770

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
this year we're kind of reversing and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.690 
this year we're kind of reversing and
we're<00:02:15.450> bringing<00:02:15.810> life<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.110> your<00:02:16.650> toys<00:02:17.069> these

crystal<00:02:18.180> traps<00:02:18.480> they<00:02:18.780> appear<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.349> sort<00:02:20.099> of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
crystal traps they appear to be sort of

in<00:02:22.470> their<00:02:22.620> own<00:02:22.739> right<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.940> know<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.239> put

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
in their own right but you know we put

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.300 
in their own right but you know we put
it<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.810> portal<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.380> once<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.800> trap<00:02:26.069> them

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
it in the portal and once you trap them

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.449 
it in the portal and once you trap them
inside<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.420> start<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.959> hear<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.860> talking

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
inside and you start to hear and talking

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.039 
inside and you start to hear and talking
to<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.060> lights<00:02:30.299> flash<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
to you and the lights flash and the

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.350 
to you and the lights flash and the
sound<00:02:31.650> moves<00:02:31.920> from<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.310> from<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.940> TV<00:02:33.269> screen

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
sound moves from the from the TV screen

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.509 
sound moves from the from the TV screen
to<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.290> portal<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.040> really

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
to the to the portal and it really

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.640 
to the to the portal and it really
starts<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.000> blur<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.420> lines<00:02:36.630> between<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
starts to blur the lines between the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.770 
starts to blur the lines between the
digital<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.130> physical<00:02:38.400> worlds<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.540> think

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
digital and physical worlds and I think

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.710 
digital and physical worlds and I think
that<00:02:40.549> reversing<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.640> magic<00:02:42.030> as<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.269> say<00:02:42.450> is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that reversing the magic as we say is

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:59.030 
that reversing the magic as we say is
kind<00:02:43.349> of<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.530> big<00:02:43.890> idea

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.099
