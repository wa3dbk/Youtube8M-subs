00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
revelation that what I needed was a

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.840 
revelation that what I needed was a

basic cream with some nutrition in it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.959 
basic cream with some nutrition in it
and<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.719> would<00:00:51.840> come<00:00:52.140> from<00:00:52.520> not<00:00:53.520> reactive

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
and that would come from not reactive

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.549 
and that would come from not reactive
baptized<00:00:54.510> which<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.199> us<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> make

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
baptized which is for us to make

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.650 
baptized which is for us to make
collagen<00:00:56.780> coconut<00:00:57.780> endosperm<00:00:58.530> which<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.660> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
collagen coconut endosperm which is the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
collagen coconut endosperm which is the
water<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.350> decide<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> coconut<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.640> has

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
water they decide the coconut and has

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.070 
water they decide the coconut and has
everything<00:01:03.650> they<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:06.030> coconut<00:01:06.540> embryo<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
everything they the coconut embryo is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
everything they the coconut embryo is
going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.470> need<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.890> grow<00:01:08.130> before<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
going to need to grow before you can

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.620 
going to need to grow before you can
make<00:01:09.380> photosynthesis<00:01:10.490> then<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.820> need<00:01:12.270> some

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
make photosynthesis then I need some

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
make photosynthesis then I need some
serum<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.740> our<00:01:13.950> skin<00:01:14.280> needs

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
serum is because our skin needs

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.660 
serum is because our skin needs
ceramides<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.070> then<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.159> thought<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.520> need

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
ceramides and then I thought we need

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
ceramides and then I thought we need
some<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.119> oxidants<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
some of the oxidants and the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.330 
some of the oxidants and the
antioxidants<00:01:20.100> are<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.759> our

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
antioxidants are going to be our

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.170 
antioxidants are going to be our
SuperDuper<00:01:24.470> antiox<00:01:25.470> booster<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:26.939> in
