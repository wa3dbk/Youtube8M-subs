00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
question is best packaging I have all of

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.439 
question is best packaging I have all of
my<00:00:56.050> palettes<00:00:57.430> like<00:00:58.430> that<00:00:58.850> that<00:00:59.120> I<00:00:59.150> want<00:00:59.360> to

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
my palettes like that that I want to

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.509 
my palettes like that that I want to
talk<00:00:59.629> about<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:01.120> so<00:01:02.120> for<00:01:02.659> best<00:01:03.530> packaging<00:01:04.250> I

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
think it's really a kind of like a

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.749 
think it's really a kind of like a
three-way<00:01:08.149> tie<00:01:08.180> between<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.920> three<00:01:10.369> urban

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
like probably start using this so number

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.440

eight<00:06:08.500> is<00:06:08.710> most<00:06:09.040> useful<00:06:09.250> tool<00:06:09.910> of<00:06:10.030> desert

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
eight is most useful tool of desert

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.659 
eight is most useful tool of desert
island<00:06:10.960> I<00:06:11.290> don't<00:06:11.740> that's<00:06:11.919> supposed<00:06:12.550> to<00:06:12.640> be

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
island I don't that's supposed to be

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:13.920 
island I don't that's supposed to be
three<00:06:12.940> things<00:06:13.150> or<00:06:13.330> one<00:06:13.480> thing<00:06:13.690> but<00:06:13.810> I'm

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
three things or one thing but I'm

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.180 
three things or one thing but I'm
guessing<00:06:14.140> that's<00:06:14.410> like<00:06:14.590> your<00:06:14.740> ultimate

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
guessing that's like your ultimate

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.890 
guessing that's like your ultimate
palette<00:06:15.700> that<00:06:16.210> you<00:06:16.360> would<00:06:16.510> take<00:06:16.630> on<00:06:16.780> the

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
palette that you would take on the

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.600 
palette that you would take on the
deserted<00:06:17.260> island<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:17.830> that<00:06:18.010> definitely<00:06:18.220> has

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
deserted island and that definitely has

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.490 
deserted island and that definitely has
to<00:06:18.820> be<00:06:18.940> a<00:06:19.150> naked<00:06:19.690> palette<00:06:20.080> so<00:06:20.200> this<00:06:20.320> is<00:06:20.470> a

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
to be a naked palette so this is a

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.830 
to be a naked palette so this is a
repeat<00:06:20.919> but<00:06:20.980> I<00:06:21.370> know<00:06:22.030> everyone<00:06:22.570> is<00:06:22.690> putting

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
repeat but I know everyone is putting

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.540 
repeat but I know everyone is putting
this<00:06:23.050> in<00:06:23.260> their<00:06:23.530> video<00:06:23.770> but<00:06:24.010> honestly<00:06:24.370> it's
