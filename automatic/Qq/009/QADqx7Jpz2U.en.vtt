 Horse power 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.300
 open the bags and see how 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.670
 manufacturer completes this model 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.940
 the big bag will be on its own

 the shop captain completes all the boats 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.890
 necessary documents for registration 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.860
 to build the boat we need 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.970
 relatively flat ground 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.680
 we deploy the boat and produce 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.020
 pre-pumping up to about 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.570
 half the desired pressure in this 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.500
 case we use electric 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.930
 two stage high pressure pump 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.280
 jenova 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.080
 when the boat is half pumped 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.880
 proceed to install the bottom Vova 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.140
 flooring 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.180
 we lay out the plates so that the plates 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.180
 the bow did not close the valve Cyrus 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.810
 we install stringers and we pump 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.429
 boat to the required pressure after 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.429
 this you can pump keel 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.560
 the next step is to install the seats 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.120
 and the seeds themselves are merry as already accepted 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.390
 many manufacturers can 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.530
 move along cap hit 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.720
 We offer a close look at 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.920
 build quality and fittings which 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.200
 uses manufacturer 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.360
 fences protect cylinders from 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.100
 damages during mooring as well 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.180
 will perform the role of spray chipper on 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.550
 high speed 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.850
 convenient carry handles allow 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.320
 move the boat from the place of assembly to the water 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.120
 rope lifeline adding security 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.060
 when driving for both passengers and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.700
 for the captain the paddles are inserted in the usual 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.459
 oarlocks the shape of the paddle itself is not straight 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.220
 spherical valve in the storm i 100k 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.200
 used bayonet type also 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.290
 the boat is equipped with a valve to drain the water 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.959
 cockpit transom reinforced aluminum 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.030
 plates in general nothing superfluous all that 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.030
 need and should be installed in the boat 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.830
 boat trials on the water we trusted 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.640
 hold our charming captain 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.680
 Vladislav 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.300
 several appeared in our warehouse 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.000
 brand new engine 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.000
 phisher and we decided to use them 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.430
 for a test drive, let's start with the younger model 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.930
 two-stroke engine phisher 2 and 5 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.180
 2.5 horsepower 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.579
 Vladislav just adore accelerates 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.739
 boats to the maximum possible limit 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.870
 the result that we saw us really 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.030
 hit low-powered engine under 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.250
 which cap is hidden only 2 s 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.500
 half horse broke up our boat 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.500
 almost 13 kilometers per hour 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.440
 Wow, how many devices is the one on the left? 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.909
 sound meter on the center of our corporate tachometer 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.830
 with hour meter 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.930
 and on the left is the navigator that shows 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.940
 speed in this case in the boat 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.590
 there are two human operator and 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.500
 captain at maximum speed 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.170
 engine boat accelerates to almost 9 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.220
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.650
 the next test engine we 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.510
 We have also a new push-pull but Fisher 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.760
 3.5 horsepower 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.510
 the boat just came alive managed 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.870
 Vladislav 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.940
 storm stk 330 jumps out onto the glider and 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.290
 shows as much as a whole 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.290
 twenty kilometers per hour 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.950
 and two people boats fish 35 broke up 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.950
 up to 11 kilometers per hour 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.530
 the next engine is also phisher but with 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.530
 five horsepower 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.819
 Beads weekend even more rapid and 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.620
 speed of almost 27 kilometers per hour but here 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.569
 passengers speed dropped to twenty 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.639
 kilometers per hour though for 5 horse 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.639
 forces this is a very good result 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.700
 and now the most interesting thing on trance 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.340
 storm stk 330 maximum possible for 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.880
 power engine parsun 9 push pull 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.530
 and 8 we were very worried about Vladislav 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.060
 and therefore decided to test on 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.450
 maximum speeds hold 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.460
 yourself what can I say on 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.010
 full speed feel like in 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.630
 the plane that is going to take off speed 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.580
 33 kilometers per hour 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.470
 points at this speed is extremely 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.630
 necessary thing so like eyes a 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.360
 headwind numb with visas 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.820
 the boat is very obedient no unpleasant 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.390
 no surprises holds water 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.390
 fine 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.159
 having seen this attraction of Vladislav 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.679
 could not resist and asked for a boat 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:10.309
 together under almost 10 strong motor stk 

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:13.789
 330 overclocked to 27 kilometers per hour 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:16.009
 which is also very much one more person 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:19.239
 in the boat did not affect her running 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.679
 quality with quite complex maneuvers 

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:25.039
 summing up we can safely talk about 

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:27.110
 that storm stk 330 is one of the best 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.819
 options that can be considered

 excellent performance when 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:37.909
 using different engines and excellent 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.539
