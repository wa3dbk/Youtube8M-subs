00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 good everything came 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.160
 a project that was put together with the guys 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.280
 of the skin to make a flag of 180 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.570
 meters for the rostrum of the willington 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.190
 and while talking to the guys in the 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.500
 good skin at the same time as the 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.750
 flag we were going to do for the so that 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.039
 cover the headboard nothing else and the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.620
 project of trying to make the flag 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.180
 largest in the world 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.060
 that is to turn the whole field in 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.590
 actually the flag actually covers 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.670
 all willington and all the audience 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.160
 discovered 380 meters times of 680 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.350
 meters long by 46 meters wide 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.090
 one thing of what for them is 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.280
 awesome this is one of the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.080
 flags at the moment one of the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.400
 largest flag in the world as a 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.309
 little does it occur to him to do this for 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.170
 workshops what happens that I was hired 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.059
 I work from these this is the curtain 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.280
 number 38 that I do in football 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.019
 Argentine and world widest the tenor 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.449
 of the world that we did previously was 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.130
 the one of club peñarol of 310 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.550
 meters by 50 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.350
 and sorry for 46 meters wide and good 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.160
 we are breaking those records when 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.200
 this curtain that has 380 meters then 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.050
 we made the curtains for uruguay we say 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.430
 curtains for chile we made the everton of 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.500
 chile to santiago when the chile 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.210
 we did some things for colo colo 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.130
 we have proposals from many countries for 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.010
 go to work projects and write the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.930
 guinness record still not yet not 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.850
 not yet because we are waiting 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.670
 until it's not actually painted 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.070
 theme of the flags of the curtains that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.030
 we were one of the creators in 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.430
 do with my partner manny alonso 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.830
 was one of the creators do 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.810
 airbrushing in giant size not only the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.670
 first curtains that we came up with 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.580
 here in Argentine football they painted in 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.170
 the script we did, we told them 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.790
 transport in a truck and similar 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.350
 we see that it transports the flag 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.119
 in a truck of this magnitude because 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.220
 that in another change the idea of ​​entering 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.350
 by train or in a slightly smaller truck 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.670
 but to have the comfort more than 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.290
 nothing to be able to move it and all that 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.479
 they have to be a more or less 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.979
 this magnitude the theme of the flag 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.940
 it was also highlighted by Augustine 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.470
 rodríguez 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.080
 of the peñas that Cordoba workshops 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.830
 they possess and if after so much wait 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.780
 it came here so close that it is a 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.070
 I dream a dream come true apart from 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.080
 very big emotion that one of the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.030
 journeys in which part precisely 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.880
 he agreed to manage that you 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.000
 They did yes for negotiations and because good 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.040
 the bar the skin they decided that 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.710
 us because we were always 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.480
 because we always go the flag to 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.980
 purely and exclusively to our city 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.280
 will go through other cities but in 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.810
 bell ville of the flag for was going to 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.570
 enter also follows so we have that 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.950
 privilege not only people workshop 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.380
 but the whole city to be able to enjoy 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.890
 of this and that the city receives a 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.890
 guinness record 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.270
 like who says so close and at the same time is 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.010
 so far and good but we know that it is 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.170
 the flag that is our some already 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.760
 we have been looking but Alvarez that a 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.290
 pride for all of us and a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.810
 great satisfaction that the people of the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.870
 bar has put his eyes on us his 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.870
 trust
