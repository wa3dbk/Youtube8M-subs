00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
people if the to check out if the tank

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.180 
people if the to check out if the tank
does<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:44.090> perform<00:00:45.200> see<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.649> similar<00:00:47.160> way

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
does a perform see it in a similar way

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.720 
does a perform see it in a similar way
as<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.760> did<00:00:48.120> perform<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.829> test<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
as a did perform on the test so and it

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.450 
as a did perform on the test so and it
actually<00:00:50.940> does<00:00:52.160> began<00:00:53.160> assault<00:00:53.550> standings

there's the panther for he will shoot at
me<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.829> couple<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.280> times<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.180> survive<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
me a couple of times and I survive you

little<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:10.049> survival<00:01:10.710> survive

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
little more survival survive

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
little more survival survive
survivability<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.890> would<00:01:14.070> expect<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:15.060> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
survivability as you would expect from a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.950 
survivability as you would expect from a
tank<00:01:16.049> destroyer<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.430> good<00:01:17.960> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
tank destroyer so that's that's good the

downside<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.259> assay<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.909> bit<00:01:33.030> more

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
downside to this assay a little bit more

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.270

a little bit like was they come with the
be<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> ten<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> gun<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.000> puts

be a ten you know with a gun that puts
all<00:01:42.899> these<00:01:43.110> numbers<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.950> don't<00:01:44.159> complain<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
all these numbers you don't complain and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.569 
all these numbers you don't complain and
I<00:01:45.329> show<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
I show you in a little bit what I'm you

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.310 
I show you in a little bit what I'm you
are<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.689> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
are you would see in a little bit what I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.429 
are you would see in a little bit what I
mean<00:01:49.590> by<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.979> by<00:01:50.549> putting<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.149> numbers<00:01:54.439> yeah

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
mean by that by putting on numbers yeah

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.709 
mean by that by putting on numbers yeah
I<00:01:55.500> don't<00:01:55.799> want<00:01:56.009> wanted<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.090> wanted<00:01:57.689> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
I don't want wanted I just wanted to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.630 
I don't want wanted I just wanted to
make<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.229> short<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> Chris<00:01:59.159> video

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
make that a short and Chris video

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.770 
make that a short and Chris video
because<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.719> pretty<00:02:01.530> much<00:02:01.649> said<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.070> all<00:02:02.780> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because I pretty much said it all the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.109 
because I pretty much said it all the
only<00:02:04.079> difference<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.219> test<00:02:05.460> servers<00:02:05.880> that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
only difference to the test servers that

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.260 
only difference to the test servers that
I<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.659> modules<00:02:06.960> mounted<00:02:07.950> here<00:02:08.330> which<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
I have all modules mounted here which is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:21.470 
I have all modules mounted here which is
the<00:02:12.270> rammer<00:02:16.129> what<00:02:17.129> was<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:20.209> cam<00:02:21.209> laying

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the rammer what was that the cam laying

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.680 
the rammer what was that the cam laying
drive<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.790> binoculars<00:02:24.410> um<00:02:28.459> yeah<00:02:29.660> was<00:02:30.660> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
drive and binoculars um yeah was that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.650 
drive and binoculars um yeah was that
they<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.830> tank<00:02:32.099> even<00:02:32.400> performs<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.300> honest

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
they the tank even performs to be honest

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.720 
they the tank even performs to be honest
even<00:02:33.930> performs<00:02:34.500> better<00:02:34.739> than<00:02:35.099> on<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.340> test

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
even performs better than on the test

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.580 
even performs better than on the test
server<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:38.540> was<00:02:39.540> just<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.959> good<00:02:40.110> investment

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
server and I was just a good investment

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.640 
server and I was just a good investment
that<00:02:40.860> was<00:02:41.099> not<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:42.810> know<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.959> don't<00:02:43.080> feel<00:02:43.500> I

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that was not a you know I don't feel I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.880 
that was not a you know I don't feel I
have<00:02:43.800> spent<00:02:44.510> money<00:02:45.510> for<00:02:45.810> nothing<00:02:46.170> as<00:02:46.379> actually

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
have spent money for nothing as actually

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.449 
have spent money for nothing as actually
quite<00:02:47.160> well<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:49.650> way<00:02:49.800> I<00:02:49.830> play<00:02:50.220> at<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
quite well and the way I play at the
