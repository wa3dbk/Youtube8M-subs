00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.180
 an American aerospace company 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.979
 northon is developing a plane not 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.799
 manned inflatable capable of flying over 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.360
 the clouds of bens to venus the planet with 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.400
 name goddess of love will be 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.740
 considered the sister of the earth by 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.720
 its composition size and be in the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.400
 limit of the habitable area of the sun is 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.380
 say the strip where theoretically 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.630
 a planet could receive the energy 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.970
 just from your star neither more nor less 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.640
 like to have liquid water in your 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.039
 surface it is even believed that venus in 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.410
 the beginning of the solar system could have 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.810
 seas like those on earth however 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.910
 something terrible happened in the sister of the 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.830
 earth was transformed into hell with 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.140
 a disastrous greenhouse effect that 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.990
 originates temperatures of more than 460 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.790
 degrees centigrade more than enough 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.400
 as to melt the lead and some 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.260
 landscapes devastated and crushed by a 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.240
 cloud atmosphere of sulfuric acid 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.820
 with a pressure similar to that 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.860
 we would suffer in an ocean at 900 meters from 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.070
 depth that's what happens in the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.080
 surface but at a height between 55 and 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.420
 70 kilometers the conditions are more 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.730
 kind the pressure is similar to that of the 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 land 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.750
 and the temperature is about 15 degrees 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.550
 centigrade is where he would move 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.740
 this Venusian plane that receives the 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.860
 bread name according to its developers 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.260
 to get to venus the bread would unfold to 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.510
 its 55 meters in wingspan filling up 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.250
 of gas surely hydrogen this plane 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.440
 I would order with about 50 kilos of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 instruments and I would fly and I would plan 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.640
 for about a year 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.530
 collecting data from venus is still a 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.540
 project and many must be developed 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.030
 details but their managers are very 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.400
 optimists and aspire to be selected 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.260
 by NASA next fall in the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.820
 new mission borders program 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.580
 planetary futurists with a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.470
 financing of up to 880 million 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.950
 euros and that are prepared to be 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.690
 executed in the year 2021 with this plane 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.760
 venus we could no longer respond to 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.260
 mystery of what happened to the 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.270
 sister of the earth so she 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.340
 transform into hell and maybe 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.340
 avoid that the same happens to us
