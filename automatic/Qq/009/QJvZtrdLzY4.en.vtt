00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 hello today i will show you the makeup 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.630
 which is especially suitable for 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.850
 photo as flash eats 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.279
 intensity of makeup it should be 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.800
 brighter than usual also because 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 flashes should avoid shining textures 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.940
 as they can give a highlight on the photo 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.790
 that's why I already put it on my face 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.710
 resistant foundation and information to itself 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.230
 imagine the cream is well matted but for someone 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.030
 we need more dense coverage so 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.030
 on top of it I will powder 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.320
 so that the face in the photo does not look flat 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.320
 I will apply bronzing powder on my cheekbones 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.700
 she will put their highlighter on top 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.710
 I'll add it under the eyebrow 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.410
 the natural freshness of the face I will deliver at 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.410
 care gently pink blush 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.540
 eye makeup is best to use 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.640
 natural shades 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.440
 that's why I first stressed 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.100
 the upper contour of the eye is brown 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.240
 a pencil 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.300
 I start from the outside corner of my eye and 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.040
 moved to the inside 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.040
 inner corner of my eye, I do not mean a decision 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.770
 the arrow should not be very clear a 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.770
 cook and therefore blend 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.319
 and for shading the pencil I use 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.739
 applicator located on the reverse of it 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.739
 country 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.670
 and on all mobile eyelids I will put shadows 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.670
 beige lightweight 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.409
 in the inner corner of the eye I will put the shadow 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.439
 lighter shade it will help me 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:36.969
 open your eyes and well spread 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.969
 light shade with beige 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.629
 the crease of the century I will add a shadow and a bronze 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.629
 colors 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:33.620
 on eyelashes I will put bulk mascara 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.340
 she is very intense and perfect 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.340
 for photography 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.240
 You can also select a little lower 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.240
 eyelashes 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.379
 as I said extra shine in the photo 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.060
 not desirable 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:12.060
 so I will use lipstick 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:28.039
 I turned natural and with 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.930
 order expressive makeup 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.559
 which is very well suited for 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.559
 Photo
