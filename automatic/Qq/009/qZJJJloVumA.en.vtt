00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:11.769
 current auto show in Geneva internationally 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.250
 the fact that there is probably one of the most 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.680
 boring last time needs 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.690
 examples shown before the dealership housing during 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.279
 second many manufacturers more 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.200
 landmarks that sales markets 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.089
 that is, for example 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.139
 props scooter which is planned that 

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:26.429
 missed showed 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.259
 auto show in america 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.659
 and also other examples of the premiere 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.699
 many premieres will be shown on 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.850
 Auto Show in China may show 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.880
 in Moscow 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.350
 this one of the trends 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.460
 path to the end 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.150
 but 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.670
 many interesting 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.920
 ipad model represented by lacie 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.580
 compact cars this is reno 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.260
 twingo rear wheel drive then 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.630
 but I'm not selling 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.050
 and there is a special moment 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.360
 and many different 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.100
 they are here so individually that 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.850
 everyone can pick their own 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.890
 such a variant of such mail 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.900
 he will be unique 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
 on the example of adamkus copies then another 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.820
 one moment many courses that used to be 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.280
 were peculiar to the premium segment they 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.969
 pumps out very quickly 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.200
 compact class 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.150
 the premiere 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150
 here the series is in this model 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.500
 and in the ceiling like a night sky with stars 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.570
 stand like 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.570
 as it was done on the car rolls royce 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.630
 certainly not from Swarovski crystals 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.600
 We think from work especially 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.910
 evening time 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.630
 very few examples are concept 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.360
 I wonder what is that a bit like 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.480
 always a lot there 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480
 and sportcar options are shown 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.630
 maserati sent a very interesting concert 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.539
 transmission was ferrari california aros terasawa 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.030
 turbocharged engine 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.030
 and in mclaren showed option mclaren court 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.290
 pesyakov not served in the back 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.480
 bursa stuck sports model 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.270
 and so on among the concerns of course 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.910
 I would like to mention Syria 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.180
 so burned maserati and also to the concert 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.920
 who presented in his report 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.169
 how do you know petrosovet 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.329
 and only work on genova meken works yes and 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.559
 I see 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.729
 what is the concern concern suproon beautiful 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.969
 hike terez how far there 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.180
 percentage of unusual decisions made 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.689
 implemented in this concert 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.219
 the theme continues 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.319
 electric cars and hybrids here 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.640
 but the benefit of the version 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.049
 purely electric 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.430
 as well as hybrid hybrid sports cars 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.269
 for example mail eighteenth spider 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.339
 who are 30 years old 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:36.619
 one of the first 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.369
 and sports car on 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.839
 yourself with a hybrid powertrain 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.659
 retro mobile Putin than continues to live and 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.609
 Elizovo again I will certainly in Europe 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:46.230
 because 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.519
 If you take for example Aktio 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.330
 concessions and and there the range is 200 kilometers 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.029
 and a lot of interesting things for example 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.379
 to warm up the cabin, you can connect 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.439
 option only warming up the driver's seat there 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.989
 condemn spending on elbe long ago 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.649
 beating up the passengers who are in front but 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.969
 Nevertheless, the reserve is 10 kilometers of a car 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.239
 do not let go far 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.299
 here the same Belarus and therefore in mining 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.149
 distance accustomed to ride eco-homes 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.200
 stock for example 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.440
 passageway puts about 100 kilometers and contributing 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.290
 if we talk about victory but only because 51 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.049
 no refills 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.559
 that is, those retro mobiles more 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:21.699
 focused on 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.599
 European market on the street 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.399
 there are air emissions and so on 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.249
 regarding berets, air emissions and 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.199
 indicative was the performance 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.689
 the head of the concern Volkswagen 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.659
 roads clearly showed that they 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.019
 did about percentages up to 50 from 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.040
 modifications 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.559
 which we are just two 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:40.229
 within 120 ikramov one kilometer 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.219
 principle 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:43.779
 good result 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.499
 In addition, the Volkswagen Group 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:47.439
 invests about ten billion 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.429
 euro in the development of new technologies 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:51.469
 represent such cars will be in 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.929
 the future they will change often 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:55.519
 it will be interesting solutions that is 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.059
 the relationship between drivers and 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.629
 the car is changing very quickly 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:00.550
 However 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.950
 in spite of the fact that it turned out barefoot 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.240
 pretty boring 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.150
 and as fun as it used to be 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.180
 remember how n usually stand holy please and 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.310
 there will be no such interesting blow 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.890
 even just a gland auto show 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.549
 there was then a disco to round 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.539

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:24.650
 have not seen everything and maybe filmed 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.650
 interesting examples that despite 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.389
 bored here they are 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.060
 as well as cognitive 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.159
 kinda interview the creators of these 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.870
