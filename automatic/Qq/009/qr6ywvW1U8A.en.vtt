this<00:00:55.890> barley<00:00:56.190> thing<00:00:56.340> cut<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:56.699> since<00:00:57.829> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this barley thing cut now since the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.670 
this barley thing cut now since the
first<00:00:59.070> week<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.520> July<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.239> has<00:01:00.510> been<00:01:00.660> cut<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
first week of July this has been cut and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
first week of July this has been cut and
we've<00:01:01.800> had<00:01:01.920> rain<00:01:02.190> we've<00:01:02.370> had<00:01:02.399> hot<00:01:02.640> weather<00:01:02.850> and

we've had rain we've had hot weather and
it's<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.719> germinated<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.489> why

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's just not germinated so that's why

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.450 
it's just not germinated so that's why
the<00:01:05.700> pigeons<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:07.070> winter<00:01:08.070> barley

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
stubbles of spring balance that was

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410 
stubbles of spring balance that was
keeping<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.680> because<00:01:11.520> they<00:01:11.610> tend<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
keeping on them because they tend to to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.429 
keeping on them because they tend to to
leave<00:01:12.630> him<00:01:12.840> that's<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:13.140> they've<00:01:13.260> done<00:01:13.380> here

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
leave him that's what they've done here

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.340 
leave him that's what they've done here
they've<00:01:13.740> left<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.100> stubble<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:16.049> gone<00:01:16.229> up

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
they've left this stubble and gone up

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.800 
they've left this stubble and gone up
onto<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.070> drilling<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.490> another<00:01:18.060> stuff<00:01:18.360> but

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
onto the drilling and another stuff but

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
onto the drilling and another stuff but
they<00:01:18.900> made<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.439> prefer<00:01:19.619> other<00:01:20.280> stuff

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
they made because I prefer other stuff

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.590 
they made because I prefer other stuff
to<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> barley<00:01:21.119> because<00:01:21.299> you've<00:01:21.420> got<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
to the barley because you've got the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.999 
to the barley because you've got the
whiskers<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> barley<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
whiskers on the barley I like that so

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
whiskers on the barley I like that so
much<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.210> got<00:01:24.509> wet<00:01:24.720> they've<00:01:24.960> all<00:01:25.110> gone

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
much now they got wet they've all gone

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.230 
much now they got wet they've all gone
brittle<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.520> they're<00:01:27.210> not

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
brittle and it's this they're not

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
brittle and it's this they're not
spiking<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.080> stuck<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.409> their<00:01:28.560> throat<00:01:28.590> side

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
spiking I get stuck in their throat side

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.249 
spiking I get stuck in their throat side
unlike<00:01:29.280> all<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.750> come<00:01:30.990> back<00:01:31.110> on

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
unlike all that so they come back on

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.480 
unlike all that so they come back on
this<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> last<00:01:32.070> resort

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this as a last resort

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.700 
this as a last resort
you've<00:01:32.790> got<00:01:32.909> oneness<00:01:33.240> germinated<00:01:33.900> there<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you've got oneness germinated there and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.890 
you've got oneness germinated there and
then<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.159> others<00:01:35.369> haven't<00:01:36.030> germinated<00:01:36.600> just

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
then the others haven't germinated just

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.510 
then the others haven't germinated just
also<00:01:37.110> fishing<00:01:37.290> suggests<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.340> clear

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
also fishing suggests they just clear

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.179 
also fishing suggests they just clear
that<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> few<00:01:43.020> weeks<00:01:43.140> ago<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.649> was<00:01:43.829> beans

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that up so a few weeks ago it was beans

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.520 
that up so a few weeks ago it was beans
now<00:01:44.759> barley<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.689> added<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> list<00:01:46.290> of
