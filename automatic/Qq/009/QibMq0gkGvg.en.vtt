00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.730
 and many of you still have not 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.500
 understood that playstation redesign 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.110
 vita the truth is that I do not either 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.539
 I finish understanding except that I suppose 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 they are and aims to reduce costs in 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.619
 this console but its responsible the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.179
 responsible for the playstation redesign 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.789
 vita have explained the characteristics 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.449
 have explained what is what has been 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.980
 wanted to think for that playstation vita 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.349
 revised basically try to justify 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.240
 the revision of this new playstation 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 vita have definitely thought about the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 accessibility the colors so far 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.790
 they had been very basic as they say but 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.070
 the new playstation vita has 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.690
 intention to change it this is only 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.700
 part of what my khan agha has told 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.920
 the main responsible for designing the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.750
 project in sony computer entertaiment 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.850
 He has spoken with the Japanese magazine 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.950
 famitsu about the new designs of 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.200
 vital playstation that were announced very 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.840
 recently at that sony conference 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.550
 prior to the tokyo game show attentive to their 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 words we wanted the new 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.720
 playstation vita was accessible to 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.330
 anyone regardless of age or gender 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.949
 so we started talking things with the 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.229
 designers trying to attract the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.800
 casual public with fresh colors and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.230
 unique 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.240
 that we could use the colors had 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.460
 come being very basic from 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.980
 now but the new playstation vita 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.020
 intends to change it by taking 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.800
 different approaches to their 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.810
 tonalities 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.910
 also the speaker holes have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.130
 been redesigned for this kind of way 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.900
 of flower that at least I think it's more 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.910
 mono the design of the buttons has 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.890
 changed also the buttons come out now 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.320
 a little more to be easier to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.230
 tighten and control of course the weight 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.090
 and the shape of the system is still 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.100
 adapted to promote playability and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.260
 still looks the same as before in 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.360
 how much control is something that I hope that 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.920
 people can try for themselves and 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.560
 these were the words of the responsible 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.540
 of the redesign of playstation vita and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.610
 what do you think you really follow 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.010
 thinking that this console was not 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.560
 necessary do you think that if it is necessary to 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.270
 Despite everything from here I advise you to go 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.340
 running to the playstation vita that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.680
 is currently being sold as the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.810
 finished is very superior and even the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.369
 screen is quite superior and despite 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 they are now and do not want 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.570
 market your playstation vita 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.800
 reviewed in other continents I that 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.540
 you would go with 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.290
 to the store if you want a 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.290
 play Station Vita
