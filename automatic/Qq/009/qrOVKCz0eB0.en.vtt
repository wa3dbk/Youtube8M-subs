hello<00:00:00.659> and<00:00:00.930> what<00:00:01.170> calendars<00:00:01.650> new<00:00:01.829> video<00:00:02.280> and

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hello and what calendars new video and

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.930 
hello and what calendars new video and
today<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:04.080> will<00:00:04.770> show<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.569> how<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.629> make<00:00:07.080> an

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
today I will show you how to make an

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.530 
today I will show you how to make an
equal<00:00:08.940> rectangle<00:00:09.540> image<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.559> render<00:00:11.450> so<00:00:12.450> you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
equal rectangle image in render so you

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.360 
equal rectangle image in render so you
can<00:00:12.719> make<00:00:12.900> your<00:00:13.080> own<00:00:13.110> lighting<00:00:13.559> setup<00:00:14.099> and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
can make your own lighting setup and

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.480 
can make your own lighting setup and
band<00:00:14.969> out<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.389> some<00:00:15.690> lights<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.970> maybe<00:00:17.970> some

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
band out with some lights and maybe some

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.490 
band out with some lights and maybe some
backgrounds<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.840> use<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.199> your<00:00:22.320> other

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
backgrounds and use that in your other

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.099 
backgrounds and use that in your other
scenes<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> lighting<00:00:23.720> you<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
scenes for the lighting you see I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.359 
scenes for the lighting you see I
prepared<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.250> little<00:00:27.119> scene<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:28.099> fear<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
prepared a little scene here fear with a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.819 
prepared a little scene here fear with a
glossy<00:00:29.910> shader<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:33.920> HDR<00:00:34.920> eye<00:00:35.430> image<00:00:36.829> HDR

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829

glossy shader and HDR eye image HDR
image<00:00:38.510> in<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> background<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:41.040> rotate

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
image in the background and I can rotate

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
image in the background and I can rotate
and<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:43.050> looks<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.219> seen<00:00:45.020> but

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and it looks like this actually seen but

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
and it looks like this actually seen but
when<00:00:46.230> we<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.530> into<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> wire<00:00:47.100> under<00:00:47.730> just

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
when we go into the wire under just

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.950 
when we go into the wire under just
normal<00:00:48.719> solid<00:00:49.410> view<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:50.960> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
normal solid view you see it's just the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.610 
normal solid view you see it's just the
sphere<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.390> how<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> made<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.079> show<00:00:55.590> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
sphere and how I made that I show you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.150 
sphere and how I made that I show you
now

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
now

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.000 
now
I<00:00:57.649> prefer<00:00:58.649> our<00:00:59.090> scene<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.379> plane<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
I prefer our scene here with a plane and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.940 
I prefer our scene here with a plane and
a<00:01:02.809> particle<00:01:03.809> system<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.670> cones<00:01:05.900> spheres

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
a particle system with cones spheres

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.590 
a particle system with cones spheres
traverses<00:01:08.210> Susanne's<00:01:09.890> on<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:12.090> also<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
traverses Susanne's on it and also a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.999 
traverses Susanne's on it and also a
camera<00:01:13.790> so<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.240> simple<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:16.049> easy<00:01:16.530> setup

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
camera so a really simple and easy setup

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.039 
camera so a really simple and easy setup
and<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:20.640> would<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.060> setup<00:01:21.750> where<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and this would be your setup where I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.340 
and this would be your setup where I
have<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.470> light<00:01:22.680> sensor<00:01:26.840> if<00:01:27.840> we<00:01:28.020> would<00:01:28.170> run

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
have your light sensor if we would run

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.580 
have your light sensor if we would run
with<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.490> would<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.420> normal<00:01:31.140> image

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
with that now it would be a normal image

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.350 
with that now it would be a normal image
address<00:01:32.240> resolution<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:35.930> 1280<00:01:36.930> by<00:01:37.350> 720<00:01:38.360> so

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
address resolution of 1280 by 720 so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.319 
address resolution of 1280 by 720 so
nothing<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.140> could<00:01:40.320> use<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.590> our<00:01:41.369> lighting

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
nothing we could use for our lighting

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.109 
nothing we could use for our lighting
setup<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.409> change<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:47.640> or

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
setup but it just have to change one or

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.389 
setup but it just have to change one or
two<00:01:48.390> things<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.890> go<00:01:50.070> into<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
two things and this is to go into the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.380 
two things and this is to go into the
camera<00:01:51.470> tap<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.799> by<00:01:53.369> selecting<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.210> camera

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
camera tap here by selecting the camera

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.160 
camera tap here by selecting the camera
and<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.880> property<00:01:56.880> window<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and and property window go here to the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.730 
and and property window go here to the
camera<00:01:58.530> settings<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.960> change<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.170> camera<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
camera settings and change the camera to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.520 
camera settings and change the camera to
panoramic<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.170> correct

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
panoramic and then here to a correct

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.869 
panoramic and then here to a correct
angle<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> trust<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.340> also<00:02:08.520> test

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
angle so trust this you can also test

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.020 
angle so trust this you can also test
fish<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.569> answer<00:02:10.069> but<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.400> case<00:02:11.640> we<00:02:11.879> need

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
fish I answer but in this case we need

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.200 
fish I answer but in this case we need
equal

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
equal

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.810 
equal
rectangular<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:17.680> could<00:02:17.860> render<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.370> now

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
rectangular and we could render that now

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.410 
rectangular and we could render that now
already<00:02:19.570> but<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.710> want<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.980> set<00:02:21.130> up<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:22.000> bigger

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
already but I want to set up a bigger

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.820 
already but I want to set up a bigger
resolution<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:24.430> get<00:02:24.670> more<00:02:25.030> details<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.510 

most<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:31.410> equal<00:02:32.410> rectangular<00:02:33.070> images

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
most of the equal rectangular images

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.330 
most of the equal rectangular images
have<00:02:34.270> a<00:02:34.330> resolution<00:02:34.930> from<00:02:35.710> or<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:37.060> PI<00:02:37.300> 1<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.380> in

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
have a resolution from or to PI 1 so in

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.540 
have a resolution from or to PI 1 so in
this<00:02:39.490> case<00:02:39.790> 4,000<00:02:40.600> by<00:02:40.750> 2,000<00:02:41.350> but<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.370> could

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
this case 4,000 by 2,000 but you could

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.310 
this case 4,000 by 2,000 but you could
also<00:02:42.730> use<00:02:42.880> eight<00:02:43.270> thousand<00:02:43.750> five<00:02:43.990> one

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
also use eight thousand five one

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.430 
also use eight thousand five one
thousand<00:02:44.830> or<00:02:45.130> just<00:02:45.460> eight<00:02:45.910> hundred<00:02:46.440> four

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
thousand or just eight hundred four

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.300 
thousand or just eight hundred four
hundred<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:49.090> tried<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.810> keep<00:02:50.110> her<00:02:50.290> try<00:02:51.280> to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
hundred but tried to keep her try to

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.310 
hundred but tried to keep her try to
keep<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.850> resolution<00:02:52.360> at<00:02:52.510> about<00:02:52.780> two<00:02:53.140> by<00:02:53.290> one

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
keep the resolution at about two by one

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.460 
keep the resolution at about two by one
and<00:02:55.080> now<00:02:56.080> we<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.380> run<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.420> was<00:02:58.420> apt<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:59.440> a

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
and now we can run that I was apt that a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:07.880 
and now we can run that I was apt that a
little<00:03:00.070> bit<00:03:00.250> Tom<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.640> press<00:03:04.000> f12<00:03:06.060> and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.550 
little bit Tom and I press f12 and
actually<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.920> forgot<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.970> change<00:03:10.270> my

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
actually I forgot to change my

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.300 
actually I forgot to change my
background<00:03:12.120> because<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.980> showed<00:03:14.980> you

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.390 

HDR<00:03:18.940> light<00:03:19.420> got<00:03:19.630> up<00:03:19.750> at<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.020> beginning<00:03:20.470> then

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
HDR light got up at the beginning then

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.910 
HDR light got up at the beginning then
it's<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.990> background<00:03:22.990> for<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:23.230> image<00:03:23.560> is

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
it's the background for this image is

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.750 
it's the background for this image is
another<00:03:24.280> one<00:03:24.520> and<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.180> forgot<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.750> change<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.170> so

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
another one and I forgot to change it so

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.490 
another one and I forgot to change it so
this<00:03:27.760> one<00:03:27.970> does<00:03:28.120> not<00:03:28.150> really<00:03:28.510> quick<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.140> I'll

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
this one does not really quick and I'll

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.900 
this one does not really quick and I'll
be<00:03:29.740> back<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:32.380> now<00:03:32.680> I'm<00:03:32.830> back<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.580> see<00:03:33.760> it

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
be back so now I'm back and you see it

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.830 
be back so now I'm back and you see it
finished<00:03:34.300> rendering<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:35.070> maybe<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.160> think<00:03:36.490> now

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
finished rendering and maybe I think now

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.660 
finished rendering and maybe I think now
what<00:03:37.840> what<00:03:38.170> happened<00:03:38.530> here<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:42.310> want<00:03:42.520> to<00:03:42.550> have

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
what what happened here you want to have

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.820 
what what happened here you want to have
that<00:03:42.910> because<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.620> how<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.100> maps<00:03:46.830> equal

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
that because this is how it maps equal

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.110 
that because this is how it maps equal
rectangular<00:03:48.550> image<00:03:49.590> kind<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.820> because<00:03:51.820> this

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
rectangular image kind of because this

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.140 
rectangular image kind of because this
captures<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.810> full<00:03:53.020> 360<00:03:53.740> degrees<00:03:54.460> around<00:03:54.790> our

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
captures the full 360 degrees around our

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.090 
captures the full 360 degrees around our
camera<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:57.970> just<00:03:58.950> distorted<00:03:59.950> like

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
camera and this is just distorted like

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.270 
camera and this is just distorted like
this<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:02.820> looks<00:04:04.200> right<00:04:05.200> when<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.740> map<00:04:06.070> that

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
this so it looks right when you map that

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.470 
this so it looks right when you map that
later<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.210> sphere<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:09.550> now<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.150> want<00:04:10.390> to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
later to a sphere so now you want to

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.070 
later to a sphere so now you want to
save<00:04:10.630> that<00:04:10.660> with<00:04:11.170> f-free<00:04:12.810> simply<00:04:13.810> press<00:04:14.050> it

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
save that with f-free simply press it

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.610 
save that with f-free simply press it
and<00:04:14.970> select<00:04:16.049> radiance<00:04:18.000> HDR<00:04:19.260> here<00:04:20.260> high

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
and select radiance HDR here high

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.560 
and select radiance HDR here high
dynamic<00:04:21.010> range<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:22.980> save<00:04:23.980> that<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.550> save<00:04:25.450> it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
dynamic range and save that I save it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.790 
dynamic range and save that I save it
not

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
not

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.800 
not
because<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.520> met<00:04:27.789> it<00:04:27.940> already<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:30.419> yeah<00:04:31.419> here's

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
because I met it already and yeah here's

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.260 
because I met it already and yeah here's
your<00:04:32.879> little<00:04:33.879> scene<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:35.819> now<00:04:36.819> you<00:04:36.879> can<00:04:37.150> you

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
your little scene and now you can you

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.460 
your little scene and now you can you
now<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.900> can<00:04:38.289> go<00:04:38.470> into<00:04:38.680> a<00:04:38.830> new<00:04:39.069> fight<00:04:40.470> without

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
now you can go into a new fight without

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.240 
now you can go into a new fight without
startup<00:04:42.129> file<00:04:44.310> delete<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.460> cube<00:04:46.349> camera<00:04:47.349> you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
startup file delete the cube camera you

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.089 
startup file delete the cube camera you
don't<00:04:48.460> have<00:04:48.639> to<00:04:48.759> delete<00:04:49.000> them<00:04:49.270> but<00:04:49.599> I<00:04:49.870> do<00:04:50.860> it

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
don't have to delete them but I do it

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:58.520 
don't have to delete them but I do it
now<00:04:51.250> Rick<00:04:51.460> Rick<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.659> is<00:04:52.780> fear<00:04:53.879> smooth

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.520 

now<00:04:59.530> you<00:04:59.590> can<00:04:59.919> go<00:05:00.099> to<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.460> world<00:05:00.729> properties

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
now you can go to the world properties

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.240 
now you can go to the world properties
say<00:05:02.530> use<00:05:02.830> notes<00:05:04.139> environment<00:05:05.139> texture<00:05:05.650> open

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
say use notes environment texture open

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.010 
say use notes environment texture open
your<00:05:09.180> rendered<00:05:10.180> image<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:12.630> go<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.659> settings

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
your rendered image and go to settings

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.140 
your rendered image and go to settings
and<00:05:14.409> multi<00:05:15.190> important<00:05:15.639> sampling<00:05:16.169> example<00:05:17.169> and

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
and multi important sampling example and

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.559 
and multi important sampling example and
I<00:05:19.150> can<00:05:19.389> press<00:05:19.599> shift<00:05:19.630> C<00:05:21.030> maybe<00:05:22.030> give<00:05:22.360> the

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
I can press shift C maybe give the

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:29.249 
I can press shift C maybe give the
sphere<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.229> other<00:05:23.440> material<00:05:25.139> so<00:05:27.509> Josh<00:05:28.509> GPS

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
sphere and other material so Josh GPS

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:33.330 
sphere and other material so Josh GPS
yes<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:31.389> see<00:05:31.599> we<00:05:32.289> have<00:05:32.440> our<00:05:32.710> four<00:05:33.039> hundred

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
yes and to see we have our four hundred

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.670 
yes and to see we have our four hundred
sixty<00:05:33.550> degree<00:05:34.090> lighting<00:05:34.539> setup<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:37.680> it's

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
sixty degree lighting setup and it's

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.399 
sixty degree lighting setup and it's
very<00:05:38.889> useful<00:05:39.069> because<00:05:39.460> now<00:05:39.819> you<00:05:39.880> can<00:05:40.409> change

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
very useful because now you can change

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.640 
very useful because now you can change
the<00:05:41.740> strength<00:05:42.159> and<00:05:44.069> emits<00:05:45.069> or<00:05:45.849> it<00:05:46.090> emits

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
the strength and emits or it emits

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.890 
the strength and emits or it emits
really<00:05:47.650> much<00:05:47.800> light<00:05:48.039> here<00:05:48.449> because<00:05:49.449> it's<00:05:49.690> an

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
really much light here because it's an

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.779 
really much light here because it's an
HDR<00:05:50.500> image<00:05:51.340> high<00:05:51.699> dynamic<00:05:52.120> range<00:05:53.279> it<00:05:54.279> captures

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
HDR image high dynamic range it captures

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.570 
HDR image high dynamic range it captures
just<00:05:55.210> some<00:05:55.419> more<00:05:55.659> lighting<00:05:55.960> information<00:05:57.000> and

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
just some more lighting information and

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.809 
just some more lighting information and
now<00:06:00.580> you<00:06:00.729> have<00:06:00.819> your<00:06:01.000> own<00:06:01.060> lighting<00:06:01.960> setup<00:06:02.409> and

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819 
now you have your own lighting setup and

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.800 
now you have your own lighting setup and
you<00:06:03.819> can<00:06:03.969> use<00:06:04.150> that<00:06:04.330> to<00:06:04.690> make<00:06:04.810> your<00:06:05.080> own<00:06:06.810> setups

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
you can use that to make your own setups

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.129 
you can use that to make your own setups
and<00:06:08.259> now<00:06:08.500> I'll<00:06:08.800> repeat<00:06:09.099> myself<00:06:09.159> and<00:06:09.930> you<00:06:10.930> can

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
and now I'll repeat myself and you can

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.409 
and now I'll repeat myself and you can
make<00:06:11.319> hundreds<00:06:11.710> of<00:06:11.830> them<00:06:12.069> and<00:06:12.340> when<00:06:13.120> you<00:06:13.240> make

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
make hundreds of them and when you make

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.100 
make hundreds of them and when you make
a<00:06:13.900> car<00:06:14.469> render<00:06:14.830> for<00:06:14.979> example<00:06:15.810> you<00:06:16.810> can<00:06:17.080> just

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
a car render for example you can just

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.909 
a car render for example you can just
use<00:06:17.680> your<00:06:18.180> default<00:06:20.460> setup<00:06:21.460> for<00:06:21.729> that<00:06:22.710> yeah<00:06:23.710> I

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
use your default setup for that yeah I

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.029 
use your default setup for that yeah I
hope<00:06:24.099> to<00:06:24.310> check<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:24.610> you<00:06:24.699> and<00:06:25.500> hopefully<00:06:26.500> you

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
hope to check to you and hopefully you

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.559
