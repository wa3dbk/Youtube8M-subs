00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.490 

I've<00:00:02.330> had<00:00:02.510> this<00:00:02.659> question<00:00:03.110> for<00:00:03.290> a<00:00:03.350> while<00:00:03.850> and

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:05.500 
I've had this question for a while and

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.940 
I've had this question for a while and
get<00:00:06.500> in<00:00:06.649> there<00:00:06.799> little<00:00:07.009> closer<00:00:07.310> to<00:00:08.950> I'm

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
get in there little closer to I'm

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.250 
get in there little closer to I'm
wondering<00:00:10.490> what<00:00:10.730> intuition<00:00:11.690> is<00:00:11.870> and<00:00:14.110> when<00:00:15.110> you

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
wondering what intuition is and when you

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.550 
wondering what intuition is and when you
get<00:00:15.500> a<00:00:15.710> thought<00:00:16.100> that<00:00:16.370> stays<00:00:16.700> with<00:00:16.730> you<00:00:19.390> and<00:00:20.560> it

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
get a thought that stays with you and it

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.950 
get a thought that stays with you and it
isn't<00:00:21.920> something<00:00:22.070> that's<00:00:22.400> happened<00:00:23.950> so<00:00:24.950> maybe

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
isn't something that's happened so maybe

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.560 
isn't something that's happened so maybe
it<00:00:26.960> creates<00:00:27.440> an<00:00:27.650> emotion<00:00:31.000> do<00:00:32.000> you<00:00:32.090> stay<00:00:32.390> with

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
it creates an emotion do you stay with

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.370 
it creates an emotion do you stay with
that<00:00:32.810> or<00:00:33.110> do<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:33.350> try<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.590> change<00:00:34.010> it<00:00:34.310> and<00:00:35.380> I

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
that or do you try to change it and I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.590 
that or do you try to change it and I
like<00:00:36.770> us<00:00:36.950> most<00:00:37.190> importantly<00:00:37.700> what<00:00:37.910> what<00:00:38.360> is

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
like us most importantly what what is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.240 
like us most importantly what what is
intuition<00:00:39.170> is<00:00:39.560> it<00:00:41.680> well<00:00:42.680> let's<00:00:42.860> talk<00:00:43.100> about

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
intuition is it well let's talk about

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.000 
intuition is it well let's talk about
what<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:43.790> is<00:00:43.910> first<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:44.660> then<00:00:45.170> we<00:00:45.770> want<00:00:45.920> to

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
what it is first and then we want to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.250 
what it is first and then we want to
talk<00:00:46.160> about<00:00:46.220> what<00:00:47.210> we<00:00:47.360> would<00:00:47.510> do<00:00:47.690> if<00:00:47.960> we<00:00:47.989> were

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
talk about what we would do if we were

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.020 
talk about what we would do if we were
standing<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:48.770> your<00:00:48.950> physical<00:00:49.340> shoes<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.880> we

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
standing in your physical shoes and we

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.790 
standing in your physical shoes and we
were<00:00:50.620> feeling<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.950> or<00:00:52.270> getting<00:00:53.270> it<00:00:53.800> been

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
were feeling it or getting it been

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.470 
were feeling it or getting it been
talking<00:00:55.190> about<00:00:55.280> momentum<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:58.360> we've<00:00:59.360> been

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
talking about momentum and we've been

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.569 
talking about momentum and we've been
talking<00:00:59.870> about<00:00:59.930> getting<00:01:00.860> under<00:01:01.219> that<00:01:01.370> high

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
talking about getting under that high

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.869 
talking about getting under that high
flying<00:01:01.969> disk<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:03.069> practicing<00:01:04.069> it<00:01:04.219> long

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
flying disk and practicing it long

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.330 
flying disk and practicing it long
enough<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.179> you<00:01:05.479> really<00:01:05.869> are<00:01:06.079> it<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.249> you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
enough that you really are it that you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.410 
enough that you really are it that you
own<00:01:07.609> it<00:01:07.880> that<00:01:08.149> you're<00:01:08.420> stable<00:01:08.959> there<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:10.420> once

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
own it that you're stable there and once

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.519 
own it that you're stable there and once
you're<00:01:11.719> there<00:01:12.340> then<00:01:14.049> manifestations<00:01:15.049> begin

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:15.529 
you're there then manifestations begin

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:18.849 
you're there then manifestations begin
to<00:01:15.679> occur<00:01:16.179> now<00:01:17.200> manifestations<00:01:18.200> usually

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
to occur now manifestations usually

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.699 
to occur now manifestations usually
indicate<00:01:19.459> to<00:01:19.789> our<00:01:20.090> human<00:01:20.840> friends<00:01:21.139> things

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:21.709 
indicate to our human friends things

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:25.149 
indicate to our human friends things
like<00:01:22.039> cars<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:23.240> houses<00:01:23.719> and<00:01:24.380> physical<00:01:24.889> things

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
like cars and houses and physical things

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.489 
like cars and houses and physical things
but<00:01:26.029> we<00:01:26.299> would<00:01:26.479> like<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:27.020> broaden<00:01:27.469> your

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
but we would like you to broaden your

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.279 
but we would like you to broaden your
definition<00:01:28.429> of<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:28.579> a<00:01:28.729> little<00:01:29.090> bit<00:01:29.209> and<00:01:29.450> just

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
definition of that a little bit and just

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.339 
definition of that a little bit and just
call<00:01:30.889> manifestations<00:01:31.819> evidence<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.749> energy

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:33.349 
call manifestations evidence of energy

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:36.690 
call manifestations evidence of energy
evidence<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.609> aligning<00:01:35.179> with<00:01:35.509> something

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
evidence of aligning with something

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.800 
evidence of aligning with something
evidence<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.849> aligning<00:01:38.149> was<00:01:38.420> something

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
evidence of aligning was something

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.649 
evidence of aligning was something
wanted<00:01:39.259> or<00:01:39.380> unwanted<00:01:39.939> so<00:01:40.939> we<00:01:41.179> said<00:01:41.389> yesterday

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
wanted or unwanted so we said yesterday

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.159 
wanted or unwanted so we said yesterday
that<00:01:42.789> once<00:01:43.789> you're<00:01:44.090> in<00:01:44.270> alignment<00:01:44.659> once

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:45.169 
that once you're in alignment once

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:46.629 
that once you're in alignment once
you've<00:01:45.380> really<00:01:45.740> got<00:01:45.859> that<00:01:46.039> momentum<00:01:46.609> going

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
you've really got that momentum going

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.449 
you've really got that momentum going
and<00:01:47.179> let's<00:01:47.599> say<00:01:47.929> in<00:01:48.049> this<00:01:48.200> case<00:01:48.529> you're<00:01:49.130> in

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
and let's say in this case you're in

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.239 
and let's say in this case you're in
alignment<00:01:50.209> with<00:01:50.419> that<00:01:50.659> high-flying<00:01:51.349> pure

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
alignment with that high-flying pure

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.059 
alignment with that high-flying pure
positive<00:01:52.490> energy<00:01:53.349> the<00:01:54.349> first<00:01:54.649> thing<00:01:55.039> that

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
positive energy the first thing that

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.330 
positive energy the first thing that
happens<00:01:55.789> is<00:01:57.579> emotions<00:01:58.989> come<00:01:59.989> as<00:02:00.340> indicators

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
happens is emotions come as indicators

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.830 
happens is emotions come as indicators
and<00:02:01.520> we<00:02:01.729> want<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.029> call<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.329> emotion<00:02:02.749> and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
and we want to call the emotion and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.529 
and we want to call the emotion and
manifestation<00:02:03.709> and<00:02:03.889> then<00:02:04.789> streams<00:02:05.299> of

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
manifestation and then streams of

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.809 
manifestation and then streams of
thought<00:02:05.569> come<00:02:06.169> and<00:02:06.439> those<00:02:07.159> streams<00:02:07.579> of

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
thought come and those streams of

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.240 
thought come and those streams of
thought<00:02:07.849> that<00:02:08.119> come<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.560> state<00:02:10.130> of

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
thought that come in that state of

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.840 
thought that come in that state of
alignment<00:02:10.880> are<00:02:12.010> your<00:02:13.010> rendezvous

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
alignment are your rendezvous

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.190 
alignment are your rendezvous
with<00:02:14.560> other<00:02:15.560> minds<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:17.270> are<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.840> same

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
with other minds that are on that same

with other minds that are on that same
wavelength<00:02:18.860> interested<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.880> same

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210

subject the degree of resistance that is

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.820 
subject the degree of resistance that is
involved<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:26.330> other<00:02:26.480> words<00:02:26.720> we<00:02:27.170> would<00:02:27.320> like<00:02:27.530> to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
involved in other words we would like to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.790 
involved in other words we would like to
say<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.880> if<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.540> get<00:02:29.900> momentum<00:02:30.050> going<00:02:30.590> on<00:02:30.740> a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
say that if you get momentum going on a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.070 
say that if you get momentum going on a
lower<00:02:31.040> flying<00:02:31.430> disk<00:02:31.760> you're<00:02:32.540> still<00:02:32.810> going<00:02:33.050> to

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
lower flying disk you're still going to

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.160 
lower flying disk you're still going to
get<00:02:33.580> impulses<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:35.690> could<00:02:35.930> call<00:02:36.140> it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
get impulses you could call it

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.930 
get impulses you could call it
inspiration<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:37.070> let's<00:02:37.250> not<00:02:37.340> for<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> moment

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
inspiration but let's not for a moment

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.110 
inspiration but let's not for a moment
let's<00:02:38.540> say<00:02:38.890> impulses<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:39.920> thought<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.610> let's

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
way we would like to define inspiration

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.160 
way we would like to define inspiration
because<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.440> coming<00:02:49.070> from<00:02:49.190> within<00:02:49.430> it's<00:02:50.000> an

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
because it's coming from within it's an

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.860 
because it's coming from within it's an
inspiration<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.440> coming<00:02:51.710> from<00:02:52.070> within

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
inspiration that is coming from within

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.550 
inspiration that is coming from within
is<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.050> clear<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.490> its<00:02:55.670> momentum<00:02:59.560> but

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
is that clear to you so its momentum but

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.120 
is that clear to you so its momentum but
what<00:03:01.160> if<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:06.020> get<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.440> thought<00:03:06.770> that

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
what if you just get this thought that

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.970 
what if you just get this thought that
something<00:03:10.130> tells<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:11.000> oh<00:03:11.740> you<00:03:12.740> should

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
something tells you that oh you should

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.660 
something tells you that oh you should
do<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.430> or<00:03:13.820> or<00:03:14.480> or<00:03:15.170> don't<00:03:15.680> do<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:16.490> you<00:03:16.520> have

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
do this or or or don't do it so you have

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.690 
do this or or or don't do it so you have
to<00:03:16.790> go<00:03:16.970> somewhere<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.070> all<00:03:19.070> of<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.370> sudden<00:03:19.430> you

to go somewhere and all of a sudden you

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.910 
to go somewhere and all of a sudden you
get<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.970> strong<00:03:20.330> feeling<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:20.930> says<00:03:21.440> to

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
don't go or you get a thought change

come<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.580> an<00:04:58.700> intersection<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.630> Esther<00:05:00.260> would

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
come to an intersection and Esther would

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.220 
come to an intersection and Esther would
say<00:05:00.620> it<00:05:00.860> feels<00:05:01.250> that<00:05:01.550> way<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:02.420> feels<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:03.020> way

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
say it feels that way it feels that way

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.620 
say it feels that way it feels that way
or<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.770> feels<00:05:03.920> that<00:05:04.280> way<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:04.670> sometimes<00:05:05.180> she

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
or it feels that way and sometimes she

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.740 
or it feels that way and sometimes she
would<00:05:05.750> say<00:05:06.020> don't<00:05:06.650> go<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:07.160> way<00:05:07.480> but<00:05:08.480> it's<00:05:08.660> a

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
would say don't go that way but it's a

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.360 
would say don't go that way but it's a
subtle<00:05:08.960> difference<00:05:09.230> isn't<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.800> if<00:05:09.920> it<00:05:10.040> feels

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
subtle difference isn't it if it feels

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.580 
subtle difference isn't it if it feels
like<00:05:10.640> that<00:05:10.910> way<00:05:11.120> then<00:05:11.360> isn't<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:11.870> implication

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
like that way then isn't the implication

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.520 
like that way then isn't the implication
don't<00:05:12.890> go<00:05:13.070> that<00:05:13.280> way<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:15.050> just<00:05:15.260> sort<00:05:15.470> of

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
don't go that way so you just sort of

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.440 
don't go that way so you just sort of
begin<00:05:15.950> to<00:05:16.100> play<00:05:16.310> with<00:05:16.520> this<00:05:16.670> if<00:05:16.850> it<00:05:16.970> feels<00:05:17.180> like

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
begin to play with this if it feels like

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.210 
begin to play with this if it feels like
go<00:05:17.690> that<00:05:17.930> way<00:05:18.140> go<00:05:18.170> that<00:05:18.320> way<00:05:18.680> there<00:05:18.890> go<00:05:19.040> that

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
go that way go that way there go that

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.070 
go that way go that way there go that
way<00:05:19.430> if<00:05:19.670> it<00:05:19.940> feels<00:05:20.120> like<00:05:20.270> you're<00:05:20.510> being<00:05:20.720> called

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
way if it feels like you're being called

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.350 
way if it feels like you're being called
to<00:05:21.320> something<00:05:21.650> that's<00:05:22.370> an<00:05:22.580> indication<00:05:23.030> that

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
to something that's an indication that

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.690 
to something that's an indication that
you<00:05:23.540> are<00:05:23.570> in<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.230> higher<00:05:24.620> flying<00:05:25.040> vibration

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
you are in that higher flying vibration

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.460 
you are in that higher flying vibration
but<00:05:26.090> if<00:05:26.180> you're<00:05:26.270> getting<00:05:26.420> those<00:05:26.690> guarded<00:05:27.230> sort

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
but if you're getting those guarded sort

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.440 
but if you're getting those guarded sort
of<00:05:27.590> feelings<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.190> shouldn't<00:05:28.610> go<00:05:28.760> there<00:05:29.000> that's

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
of feelings I shouldn't go there that's

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.150 
of feelings I shouldn't go there that's
an<00:05:29.630> indication<00:05:30.050> that<00:05:30.230> you're<00:05:30.530> not<00:05:30.680> quite

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
an indication that you're not quite

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.280 
an indication that you're not quite
there<00:05:31.430> so<00:05:32.060> we'll<00:05:32.600> tell<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:32.870> rest<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.200> the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
there so we'll tell you the rest of the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.420 
there so we'll tell you the rest of the
story<00:05:33.500> even<00:05:33.740> though<00:05:33.860> we've<00:05:34.010> answered<00:05:34.130> your

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
story even though we've answered your

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.290 
story even though we've answered your
question<00:05:34.760> already<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:36.310> hours<00:05:37.310> went<00:05:37.580> by<00:05:37.640> Esther

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
question already so hours went by Esther

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.610 
question already so hours went by Esther
would<00:05:38.390> get<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.660> impulse<00:05:39.020> they<00:05:39.350> found

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
would get the impulse they found

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.790 
would get the impulse they found
themselves<00:05:39.830> on<00:05:40.510> camelback<00:05:41.510> road<00:05:41.870> behind<00:05:42.260> the

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
themselves on camelback road behind the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.220 
themselves on camelback road behind the
mountain<00:05:43.430> shadows<00:05:43.910> resort<00:05:44.390> sitting<00:05:45.050> by<00:05:45.170> the

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
mountain shadows resort sitting by the

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.070 
mountain shadows resort sitting by the
dumpster<00:05:45.830> and<00:05:45.950> Esther<00:05:46.490> said<00:05:46.610> I'm<00:05:46.820> sure<00:05:47.330> this

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
dumpster and Esther said I'm sure this

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.870 
dumpster and Esther said I'm sure this
is<00:05:48.140> where<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.740> was<00:05:48.950> but<00:05:49.220> they<00:05:49.340> were<00:05:49.400> not<00:05:49.610> there

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
is where it was but they were not there

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.640 
is where it was but they were not there
and<00:05:50.030> then<00:05:50.450> they<00:05:50.570> would<00:05:50.690> move<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:50.930> another<00:05:51.290> part

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
and then they would move to another part

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.870 
and then they would move to another part
and<00:05:51.800> then<00:05:51.890> to<00:05:52.040> another<00:05:52.220> part<00:05:52.520> into<00:05:52.670> another

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
and then to another part into another

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.880 
and then to another part into another
part<00:05:53.180> they<00:05:53.600> filled<00:05:53.870> up<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.050> car<00:05:54.320> with<00:05:54.350> gas

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
part they filled up the car with gas

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.940 
part they filled up the car with gas
twice

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
twice

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.790 
twice
and<00:05:58.230> then<00:05:59.520> they<00:06:00.520> found<00:06:00.730> them<00:06:01.030> and<00:06:01.560> Esther<00:06:02.560> said

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
and then they found them and Esther said

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.190 
and then they found them and Esther said
that<00:06:03.700> was<00:06:03.850> not<00:06:03.880> fun<00:06:04.330> and<00:06:04.510> we're<00:06:04.690> never<00:06:04.870> going

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
that was not fun and we're never going

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.120 
that was not fun and we're never going
to<00:06:05.290> do<00:06:05.440> that<00:06:05.470> again<00:06:06.250> I<00:06:07.680> didn't<00:06:08.680> think<00:06:08.860> it<00:06:09.010> would

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
to do that again I didn't think it would

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.400 
to do that again I didn't think it would
take<00:06:09.160> so<00:06:09.580> long<00:06:09.820> and<00:06:10.120> she<00:06:10.330> said<00:06:10.570> first<00:06:11.050> we<00:06:11.260> went

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
take so long and she said first we went

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.860 
take so long and she said first we went
there<00:06:11.740> then<00:06:12.280> we<00:06:12.490> went<00:06:12.640> there<00:06:13.060> then<00:06:13.540> we<00:06:13.750> went

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
there then we went there then we went

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.590 
there then we went there then we went
there<00:06:14.200> and<00:06:14.440> they<00:06:14.500> said<00:06:15.010> we<00:06:15.700> were<00:06:15.910> at<00:06:16.120> all<00:06:16.420> of

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
there and they said we were at all of

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.560 
there and they said we were at all of
those<00:06:16.750> places<00:06:17.310> but<00:06:18.310> we<00:06:18.490> felt<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:18.940> impulse<00:06:19.420> to

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
those places but we felt the impulse to

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:34.050 
those places but we felt the impulse to
keep<00:06:19.930> moving<00:06:31.200> so<00:06:32.280> impulse<00:06:33.280> is<00:06:33.580> one<00:06:33.790> thing

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
keep moving so impulse is one thing

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.690 
keep moving so impulse is one thing
let's<00:06:34.540> call<00:06:34.720> inspiration<00:06:35.530> something<00:06:36.340> even

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
let's call inspiration something even

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.890 
let's call inspiration something even
better<00:06:36.850> yes<00:06:37.570> so<00:06:38.230> if<00:06:38.590> if<00:06:39.010> the<00:06:39.640> inspiration<00:06:40.540> is

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
better yes so if if the inspiration is

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.670 
better yes so if if the inspiration is
at<00:06:41.110> a<00:06:41.140> low<00:06:41.440> flying<00:06:42.340> disk<00:06:43.140> realign<00:06:44.140> the<00:06:44.410> thought

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
at a low flying disk realign the thought

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.730 
at a low flying disk realign the thought
and<00:06:45.010> let's<00:06:45.250> call<00:06:45.580> it<00:06:45.820> inspiration<00:06:46.740> momentum

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
and let's call it inspiration momentum

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.920 
and let's call it inspiration momentum
let's<00:06:47.860> call<00:06:48.130> it<00:06:48.250> momentum<00:06:48.610> when<00:06:49.360> I've<00:06:49.570> revved

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
let's call it momentum when I've revved

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.310 
let's call it momentum when I've revved
up<00:06:50.110> my<00:06:50.320> momentum<00:06:50.710> enough<00:06:51.310> on<00:06:51.550> any<00:06:52.150> subject<00:06:52.840> on

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:53.320 
up my momentum enough on any subject on

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.870 
up my momentum enough on any subject on
any<00:06:54.030> point<00:06:55.030> of<00:06:55.150> attraction<00:06:55.690> disc<00:06:56.880> enough

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
any point of attraction disc enough

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.600 
any point of attraction disc enough
momentum<00:06:58.240> will<00:06:58.750> eventually<00:06:59.680> lead<00:06:59.950> me<00:07:00.190> to<00:07:00.400> want

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
momentum will eventually lead me to want

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.570 
momentum will eventually lead me to want
to<00:07:00.760> act<00:07:01.000> the<00:07:01.690> question<00:07:02.140> is<00:07:02.350> how<00:07:02.920> did<00:07:03.160> I<00:07:03.280> feel

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
to act the question is how did I feel

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.760 
to act the question is how did I feel
while<00:07:04.240> I<00:07:04.270> was<00:07:04.480> on<00:07:04.510> that<00:07:04.840> disc<00:07:05.170> and<00:07:05.530> how<00:07:05.710> does

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
while I was on that disc and how does
