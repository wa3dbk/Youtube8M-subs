00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.430
 ah 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.570
 good friends this is the song by 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.510
 what are you going to cry in this room 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.910
 introductory this you can do 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.040
 is harmonized in C major for that 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.430
 be in the room to take 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 sun positions greater by the east 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.500
 transportation of the tones to play 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.430
 sun major and minor with greater 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.430
 higher 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.710
 so for the whole song to finish 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:09.280
 and requinto at the fifth fret fifth 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.470
 rope and this fourth agreement to fifth 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.470
 fret and fourth we started in the fifth 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:37.770
 a fifth and fourth equally that would be 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:43.049
 this figurine is already complete and already there 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.240
 we go to 7 and 5 and finish in 7 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.020
 we go down to the second and first strings 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.330
 third fret and third and second of the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.170
 first the same formula 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.860
 and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.380
 and 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:05.140
 and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:09.220
 from there we go to 5 to 3 to 2 we go up 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:14.050
 to the 5th of the second 3rd of the 2nd and 5th of 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.380
 the second one we make a hammer 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.860
 the third to the east to the fifth of the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.860
 first 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.260
 whether it's like that would be 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.260
 in the world 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.430
 is this is the fifth one that gets this 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.010
 beginning and when they can be medium 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.570
 at the end you can do a variant 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:49.440
 this would be a tremolo that we started 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.440
 at door number two of the psoe fret 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.560
 and from there we go down to the first the third 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.190
 fret also 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.680
 the figure is repeated 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.170
 it does not matter in the third in the second 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.170
 second rope third fret 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.209
 we go to the fifth of the first string 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.209
 and there we go to 7 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.870
 53 2 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.100
 and they end up in 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.060
 one 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.060
 no no 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.000
 Y 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.670
 good about fifth this simple for 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.420
 put it this I repeat 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.550
 play it with the song for this one that 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.680
 listen more fully and at the time of 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.210
 accompanying them will be the same circle 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.810
 of weapons to square the times 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.120
 well I hope and it serves them a lot and we 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.450
 we see in a next video do not come 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.990

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.990
