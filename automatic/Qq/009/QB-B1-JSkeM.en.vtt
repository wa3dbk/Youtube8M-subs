00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.629 

leading<00:00:01.660> in<00:00:01.810> we<00:00:02.590> asked<00:00:02.770> the<00:00:02.919> question<00:00:03.340> how

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:03.639 
leading in we asked the question how

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.099 
leading in we asked the question how
many<00:00:04.420> times<00:00:04.690> does<00:00:04.930> this<00:00:05.140> happen<00:00:05.590> to<00:00:05.800> you<00:00:06.040> you

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
many times does this happen to you you

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.890 
many times does this happen to you you
open<00:00:08.109> the<00:00:08.230> incubator<00:00:08.940> only<00:00:09.940> to<00:00:10.089> find<00:00:10.269> nothing

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
open the incubator only to find nothing

your research how long does that process

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.480 
your research how long does that process
take<00:00:22.840> is<00:00:23.800> one<00:00:24.280> attempt<00:00:24.610> then<00:00:25.000> weeks<00:00:25.180> fine<00:00:25.420> so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
take is one attempt then weeks fine so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.429 
take is one attempt then weeks fine so

to identify this is the fastest way to

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.750 
to identify this is the fastest way to

identify the positive trend transformant
i<00:00:51.850> find<00:00:52.300> it<00:00:52.569> I<00:00:52.749> inoculate<00:00:53.739> another<00:00:54.039> culture

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579

day<00:01:02.769> for<00:01:03.280> I<00:01:03.689> am<00:01:05.280> sending<00:01:06.280> my<00:01:06.340> sample<00:01:07.180> off<00:01:07.390> for

day for I am sending my sample off for

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.270 
day for I am sending my sample off for
sequencing<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:09.939> I<00:01:10.329> would<00:01:11.140> propose<00:01:11.680> that<00:01:12.250> in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
sequencing so I would propose that in

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.560 
sequencing so I would propose that in
the<00:01:12.399> fastest<00:01:13.149> scenario<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:14.649> are<00:01:15.570> getting

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
the fastest scenario you are getting

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.649 
the fastest scenario you are getting

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
your external experimental result in one

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.980 
your external experimental result in one
week<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.490> that's<00:01:22.000> for<00:01:22.329> your<00:01:22.450> burden<00:01:22.930> that

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
week and that's for your burden that

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.840 
week and that's for your burden that
means<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.350> week<00:01:23.500> at<00:01:23.740> least<00:01:24.039> a<00:01:24.280> week<00:01:24.430> under<00:01:24.610> the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
means the week at least a week under the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.450 
means the week at least a week under the
way<00:01:25.000> right<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.420> how<00:01:28.990> how's<00:01:29.710> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.800 

for<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.520> large<00:01:33.789> fragment<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:36.579> redo<00:01:37.570> is

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
for a large fragment I for a redo is

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.870 
for a large fragment I for a redo is
that<00:01:38.020> what<00:01:38.170> you're<00:01:38.350> asking<00:01:38.649> I<00:01:39.159> would<00:01:39.609> say<00:01:39.789> it's

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
that what you're asking I would say it's

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.830 
that what you're asking I would say it's
probably<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:41.619> our<00:01:41.799> topo<00:01:42.670> technology<00:01:43.479> it's

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
probably with our topo technology it's

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.450 
probably with our topo technology it's
probably<00:01:44.020> about<00:01:44.289> fifty<00:01:44.740> percent<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.310> time

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
probably about fifty percent of the time

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.419 
probably about fifty percent of the time
and<00:01:45.880> with<00:01:46.270> others<00:01:46.630> it's<00:01:47.289> even<00:01:47.469> more<00:01:47.799> even<00:01:48.399> more

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
and with others it's even more even more

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.510 
and with others it's even more even more
yeah

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.630 

so<00:01:52.149> what<00:01:52.930> does<00:01:53.109> g<00:01:53.469> nite<00:01:53.679> solution<00:01:54.009> do<00:01:54.399> to

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
so what does g nite solution do to

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.779 
so what does g nite solution do to
reduce<00:01:54.759> that<00:01:55.149> so<00:01:55.600> gene<00:01:55.960> synthesis<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:58.500> you

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
reduce that so gene synthesis is you

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.169 
reduce that so gene synthesis is you
type<00:02:00.789> your<00:02:01.320> sequence<00:02:02.579> onto<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.670> computer<00:02:04.149> and

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
type your sequence onto the computer and

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.719 
type your sequence onto the computer and
send<00:02:04.719> it<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:07.229> less<00:02:08.229> than<00:02:08.259> 2<00:02:08.649> kb<00:02:09.190> you

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
send it and if it's less than 2 kb you

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.550 
send it and if it's less than 2 kb you
get<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.750> hundred<00:02:11.260> percent<00:02:12.330> accurate<00:02:13.500> may<00:02:14.500> be

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
get one hundred percent accurate may be

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.690 
get one hundred percent accurate may be
optimized<00:02:15.370> if<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.730> want<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.120> sequence<00:02:16.870> in

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
optimized if you want it sequence in

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.050 
optimized if you want it sequence in
basically<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.849> week<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:21.310> don't<00:02:21.549> don't

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
basically a week and you don't don't

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.880 
basically a week and you don't don't
have<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.330> sequence<00:02:22.780> word<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:23.349> when<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.709> why

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
have to sequence word but when the why

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.920 
have to sequence word but when the why
isn't<00:02:24.220> everybody<00:02:24.430> doing<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.030> there's<00:02:25.690> so

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
isn't everybody doing this there's so

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.559 
isn't everybody doing this there's so
there's<00:02:25.959> two<00:02:26.709> two<00:02:27.250> factors<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.030> first<00:02:28.269> is

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
there's two two factors the first is

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.080 
there's two two factors the first is
that<00:02:28.599> scientists<00:02:29.560> are<00:02:29.829> resistant<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.790> change

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that scientists are resistant to change

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
that scientists are resistant to change
so<00:02:31.930> even<00:02:32.890> though<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.610> an<00:02:34.000> imperfect

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so even though this is an imperfect

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.750 
so even though this is an imperfect
solution<00:02:35.920> right<00:02:36.700> now<00:02:36.880> it's<00:02:37.630> what<00:02:38.760> everybody

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
solution right now it's what everybody

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.600 
solution right now it's what everybody
else<00:02:40.000> does<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.840> what<00:02:41.049> I'm<00:02:41.140> used<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.610> I'm

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
else does it's what I'm used to I'm

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.400 
else does it's what I'm used to I'm
going<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.910> stick<00:02:43.060> with<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.599> then<00:02:44.079> there's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
going to stick with it and then there's

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.589 
going to stick with it and then there's
the<00:02:45.660> charge<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:49.209> do<00:02:49.360> gene

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
the charge so it is on to do gene

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.869 
the charge so it is on to do gene
synthesis<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.500> incremental<00:02:51.220> expense

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
synthesis so the incremental expense

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.970 
synthesis so the incremental expense
over<00:02:52.120> client<00:02:52.959> but<00:02:53.110> how<00:02:53.260> much<00:02:53.379> was<00:02:53.650> talking

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
over client but how much was talking

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.910 
over client but how much was talking
about<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.400> mean<00:02:54.549> a<00:02:54.670> week<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.120> time<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:56.530> not<00:02:56.709> just

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
about I mean a week of time and not just

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.670 
about I mean a week of time and not just
so<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> week<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:58.060> an<00:02:58.329> undergraduates<00:02:58.810> time<00:02:59.350> is

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
so a week of an undergraduates time is

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.879 
so a week of an undergraduates time is
almost<00:03:00.489> zero<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:03.160> week<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:05.620> know<00:03:05.739> an

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
almost zero a week of you know an

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.240 
almost zero a week of you know an
industrial<00:03:06.670> you're<00:03:06.940> asking<00:03:07.359> right<00:03:08.079> ok<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.680> week

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
industrial you're asking right ok a week

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.530 
industrial you're asking right ok a week
of<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.790> bench<00:03:10.420> scientist<00:03:11.019> at<00:03:11.290> amgen<00:03:11.950> is

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
of a bench scientist at amgen is

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.129 
of a bench scientist at amgen is
significantly<00:03:13.540> more<00:03:14.310> ok<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.579> when<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.959> but

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
significantly more ok so when and so but

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.490 
significantly more ok so when and so but
you<00:03:17.230> didn't<00:03:17.440> have<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.680> how<00:03:18.010> much<00:03:18.220> more<00:03:18.549> is<00:03:18.970> is

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
you didn't have to how much more is is

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.930 
you didn't have to how much more is is
the<00:03:20.500> something<00:03:21.190> dodgy<00:03:22.150> alternative<00:03:23.079> so

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the something dodgy alternative so

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.589 
the something dodgy alternative so
probably<00:03:24.940> about<00:03:26.280> five<00:03:27.280> hundred<00:03:27.549> dollars<00:03:28.090> for

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
probably about five hundred dollars for

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.870 
probably about five hundred dollars for
to<00:03:29.590> get<00:03:29.769> to<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:31.139> finished<00:03:32.220> cloned<00:03:33.220> sequence

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
to get to a finished cloned sequence

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.460 
to get to a finished cloned sequence
with<00:03:34.150> gene<00:03:34.389> synthesis<00:03:35.079> and<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:37.470> three

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
with gene synthesis and that three

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.580 
with gene synthesis and that three
hundred<00:03:38.739> fifty<00:03:38.859> dollar<00:03:39.220> range<00:03:39.519> with

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
hundred fifty dollar range with

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.199 
hundred fifty dollar range with
traditional<00:03:41.590> cloning<00:03:41.980> ok<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:42.970> difference

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
traditional cloning ok so the difference

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.159 
traditional cloning ok so the difference
is<00:03:43.630> not<00:03:43.959> three<00:03:44.500> or<00:03:44.620> four<00:03:44.799> times<00:03:44.950> it's<00:03:45.400> like

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
is not three or four times it's like

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.759 
is not three or four times it's like
cynics<00:03:47.169> 450<00:03:47.709> bucks<00:03:47.889> ism<00:03:48.280> if<00:03:49.079> everything<00:03:50.079> goes

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
cynics 450 bucks ism if everything goes

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.420 
cynics 450 bucks ism if everything goes
right<00:03:51.220> right<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:53.290> strip<00:03:53.680> labor<00:03:53.919> costs

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
right right and you strip labor costs

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.930 
right right and you strip labor costs
out<00:03:54.609> right<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:56.620> late<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.280> higher<00:03:57.519> labor

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
out right the late the higher labor

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.330 
out right the late the higher labor
costs<00:03:58.419> are<00:03:58.510> associated<00:03:58.810> with<00:03:59.260> manual<00:03:59.889> cloning

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
costs are associated with manual cloning

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.569 
costs are associated with manual cloning
so<00:04:00.880> when<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.180> push<00:04:01.419> that<00:04:01.690> into<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.350> equation

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
so when you push that into the equation

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.300 
so when you push that into the equation
then<00:04:03.579> they

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
then they

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.830 
then they
balance<00:04:04.849> out<00:04:05.090> basically<00:04:05.750> oh<00:04:06.020> yeah<00:04:06.440> but<00:04:07.099> the

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
balance out basically oh yeah but the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.640 
balance out basically oh yeah but the
labor<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:10.010> always<00:04:10.910> highly<00:04:11.510> debatable<00:04:12.140> what<00:04:12.560> is

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
labor is always highly debatable what is

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.259 
labor is always highly debatable what is
the<00:04:12.739> primary<00:04:12.980> motivation<00:04:13.790> for<00:04:14.120> people<00:04:14.770> to<00:04:15.770> do

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
the primary motivation for people to do

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.390 
the primary motivation for people to do
to<00:04:17.269> use<00:04:17.450> gene<00:04:17.930> synthesis<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.370> just

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
to use gene synthesis and is that just

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.750 
to use gene synthesis and is that just
is<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.540> kind<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.560> be<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.980> confidence<00:04:22.610> that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
is it the kind of be the confidence that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.340 
is it the kind of be the confidence that
I<00:04:22.850> know<00:04:22.910> maybe<00:04:23.240> get<00:04:23.480> it<00:04:23.510> right<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.050> I'm<00:04:24.169> not

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
I know maybe get it right and I'm not

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.540 
I know maybe get it right and I'm not
going<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.620> end<00:04:24.740> up<00:04:24.830> with<00:04:24.889> you<00:04:25.760> know<00:04:27.430> you<00:04:28.430> know

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
going to end up with you know you know

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.670 
going to end up with you know you know
fifty<00:04:28.880> percent<00:04:29.060> chasm<00:04:29.510> that<00:04:29.630> be<00:04:30.230> dead<00:04:30.410> when<00:04:30.590> I

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
fifty percent chasm that be dead when I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.190 
fifty percent chasm that be dead when I
was<00:04:30.800> an<00:04:30.919> incubator<00:04:31.340> across<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.450> board<00:04:32.720> the

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
was an incubator across the board the

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.159 
was an incubator across the board the
the<00:04:33.800> acts<00:04:34.790> of<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.750> one<00:04:35.900> hundred<00:04:36.139> percent

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
the acts of the the one hundred percent

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.370 
the acts of the the one hundred percent
sequence<00:04:36.590> accuracy<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.900> basically<00:04:38.900> freeing

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
sequence accuracy and basically freeing

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.240 
sequence accuracy and basically freeing
up<00:04:39.620> my<00:04:40.220> time<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:41.180> go<00:04:41.210> do<00:04:41.510> something<00:04:41.960> else

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
up my time to go do something else

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:50.469 
up my time to go do something else
that's<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:44.570> main<00:04:46.090> crux<00:04:49.270> so<00:04:50.270> this<00:04:50.450> is

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
that's the the main crux so this is

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.530 
that's the the main crux so this is
taking<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.020> phone<00:04:51.050> okay<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.860> next<00:04:51.889> one<00:04:52.130> is

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
taking the phone okay so the next one is

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:00.129 
taking the phone okay so the next one is
so<00:04:53.540> this<00:04:54.250> has<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.520> do<00:04:55.700> with<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:59.139> increasing

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
so this has to do with the increasing

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.040 
so this has to do with the increasing
need<00:05:00.560> through<00:05:01.190> systems<00:05:01.669> biology<00:05:01.880> for<00:05:02.660> people

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
need through systems biology for people

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.100 
need through systems biology for people
to<00:05:03.320> take<00:05:04.130> multiple<00:05:05.030> gene<00:05:05.360> fragments<00:05:05.990> and

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
to take multiple gene fragments and

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.500 
to take multiple gene fragments and
assemble<00:05:06.560> them<00:05:06.590> into<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:06.979> single<00:05:07.160> construct<00:05:07.910> so

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
assemble them into a single construct so

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.180 
assemble them into a single construct so
the<00:05:09.080> problem<00:05:09.350> that<00:05:09.680> happens<00:05:09.830> with

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
the problem that happens with

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.460 
the problem that happens with
traditional<00:05:10.760> experiments<00:05:11.390> is<00:05:11.539> you<00:05:12.080> end<00:05:12.260> up

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
traditional experiments is you end up

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.090 
traditional experiments is you end up
you<00:05:13.039> know<00:05:13.070> with<00:05:13.310> a<00:05:13.370> crazy<00:05:13.910> sequence<00:05:14.840> of<00:05:15.110> events

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
you know with a crazy sequence of events

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.810 
you know with a crazy sequence of events
to<00:05:16.820> try<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.270> assemble<00:05:17.930> one<00:05:18.530> at<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.800> time<00:05:19.130> each

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
to try and assemble one at a time each

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.090 
to try and assemble one at a time each
one<00:05:20.210> of<00:05:20.240> these<00:05:20.539> pieces<00:05:20.900> that<00:05:21.440> I<00:05:21.470> need<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.919> get

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
one of these pieces that I need to get

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.969 
one of these pieces that I need to get
into<00:05:22.250> my<00:05:22.430> construct<00:05:23.000> so<00:05:23.410> here<00:05:24.410> we<00:05:24.560> have<00:05:24.590> you

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
into my construct so here we have you

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.060 
into my construct so here we have you
know<00:05:25.100> basically<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.390> whiteboard<00:05:27.229> with<00:05:27.680> many

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
know basically a whiteboard with many

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.130 
know basically a whiteboard with many
different<00:05:28.310> enzymes<00:05:29.060> and<00:05:29.510> great<00:05:29.960> way<00:05:30.080> to

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
different enzymes and great way to

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.830 
different enzymes and great way to
illustrate<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:31.360> complexities<00:05:32.360> everybody

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
illustrate the complexities everybody

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.340 
illustrate the complexities everybody
has<00:05:33.380> seen<00:05:34.100> these<00:05:34.280> right<00:05:34.850> crazy<00:05:35.180> so<00:05:35.570> you<00:05:35.990> know

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
has seen these right crazy so you know

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.070 
has seen these right crazy so you know
people<00:05:37.280> still<00:05:37.550> attempted<00:05:38.120> they<00:05:38.270> say<00:05:38.510> okay

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
people still attempted they say okay

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.440 
people still attempted they say okay
yeah<00:05:39.979> I'm<00:05:40.220> gonna<00:05:40.340> give<00:05:40.550> us<00:05:40.669> a<00:05:40.760> shot<00:05:40.940> it's<00:05:41.240> going

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
yeah I'm gonna give us a shot it's going

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.379 
yeah I'm gonna give us a shot it's going
to<00:05:41.510> take<00:05:41.720> you<00:05:42.289> know<00:05:42.380> a<00:05:42.650> week<00:05:43.250> for<00:05:43.700> me<00:05:43.820> just<00:05:44.240> to

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
to take you know a week for me just to

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.450 
to take you know a week for me just to
try<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:44.930> do<00:05:45.110> you<00:05:45.770> know<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:45.919> different

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
try and do you know the different

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.330 
try and do you know the different
assemblies<00:05:46.850> if<00:05:47.440> everything<00:05:48.440> goes<00:05:48.680> right<00:05:48.830> so

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
assemblies if everything goes right so

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.700 
assemblies if everything goes right so
we're<00:05:49.940> saying<00:05:50.210> you<00:05:50.389> know<00:05:50.510> and<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:51.380> know<00:05:51.500> this

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
we're saying you know and you know this

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.659 
we're saying you know and you know this
sort<00:05:52.220> of<00:05:52.280> craziness<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:54.669> complex

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
sort of craziness of the complex

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.279 
sort of craziness of the complex
experiments<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:56.479> then<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:56.810> is<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:56.990> gene

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
experiments and then this is the gene

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.680 
experiments and then this is the gene
optimization<00:05:58.039> components<00:05:58.520> so<00:05:58.700> you<00:05:59.270> could<00:05:59.450> do

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
optimization components so you could do

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.980 
optimization components so you could do
everything<00:06:00.080> right<00:06:01.039> and<00:06:01.310> get<00:06:01.700> your<00:06:01.880> gene<00:06:02.180> into

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
everything right and get your gene into

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.870 
everything right and get your gene into
the<00:06:03.110> vector<00:06:03.500> and<00:06:03.740> then<00:06:04.160> you<00:06:04.280> put<00:06:04.490> it<00:06:04.520> into<00:06:04.850> a

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
the vector and then you put it into a

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.420 
the vector and then you put it into a
cell<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.600> doesn't<00:06:05.960> express<00:06:06.380> so<00:06:06.770> that's

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
cell and it doesn't express so that's

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.570 
cell and it doesn't express so that's
that<00:06:07.820> with<00:06:08.270> both<00:06:08.479> techniques<00:06:09.190> no<00:06:10.190> this<00:06:10.430> is

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
that with both techniques no this is

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.760 
that with both techniques no this is
with<00:06:10.820> traditional<00:06:11.810> cloning<00:06:12.200> so<00:06:12.380> why<00:06:12.530> isn't

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
with traditional cloning so why isn't

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.519 
with traditional cloning so why isn't
like

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
like

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:16.339 
like
the<00:06:14.039> gene<00:06:15.029> synthesis<00:06:15.569> because<00:06:16.049> of<00:06:16.199> gene

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
the gene synthesis because of gene

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.849 
the gene synthesis because of gene
optimization<00:06:17.159> okay<00:06:17.399> so<00:06:18.229> this<00:06:19.229> is<00:06:19.409> the<00:06:19.529> example

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:19.859 
optimization okay so this is the example

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:21.739 
optimization okay so this is the example
of<00:06:20.069> a<00:06:20.159> human<00:06:20.489> gene<00:06:20.669> being<00:06:20.999> expressed<00:06:21.479> in<00:06:21.659> a

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:21.749 
of a human gene being expressed in a

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:24.019 
of a human gene being expressed in a
bacterial<00:06:22.319> cell<00:06:22.559> sometimes<00:06:23.249> it<00:06:23.429> just<00:06:23.699> won't

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
bacterial cell sometimes it just won't

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:25.729 
bacterial cell sometimes it just won't
work<00:06:24.149> in<00:06:24.569> a<00:06:24.749> bacteria<00:06:25.169> it<00:06:25.259> could<00:06:25.379> be<00:06:25.469> toxic

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:25.739 
work in a bacteria it could be toxic

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:26.989 
work in a bacteria it could be toxic
there<00:06:26.189> are<00:06:26.279> a<00:06:26.309> number<00:06:26.339> of<00:06:26.549> different<00:06:26.669> reasons

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:26.999 
there are a number of different reasons

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:28.819 
there are a number of different reasons
but<00:06:27.779> do<00:06:28.079> you<00:06:28.169> think<00:06:28.229> you're<00:06:28.499> kind<00:06:28.679> of<00:06:28.709> like

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:28.829 
but do you think you're kind of like

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:32.179 
but do you think you're kind of like
over<00:06:29.189> the<00:06:29.309> hill<00:06:29.339> right<00:06:29.909> then<00:06:30.379> then<00:06:31.379> you<00:06:31.919> find

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:32.189 
over the hill right then then you find

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.029 
over the hill right then then you find
out<00:06:32.369> it<00:06:32.579> it's<00:06:32.849> not<00:06:33.029> going<00:06:33.209> to<00:06:33.329> expressing<00:06:34.039> what

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
out it it's not going to expressing what

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:36.589 
out it it's not going to expressing what
if<00:06:35.129> there<00:06:35.309> was<00:06:35.459> a<00:06:35.489> way<00:06:35.579> to<00:06:35.699> get<00:06:35.999> the<00:06:36.269> exact

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
if there was a way to get the exact

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:37.879 
if there was a way to get the exact
sequence<00:06:36.839> you<00:06:37.139> need<00:06:37.319> with<00:06:37.499> a<00:06:37.529> hundred<00:06:37.829> percent

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
sequence you need with a hundred percent

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.299 
sequence you need with a hundred percent
reliability<00:06:38.819> optimized<00:06:39.779> to<00:06:40.709> express<00:06:41.039> in<00:06:41.189> your

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:43.709 
host system in five working days yeah

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:45.639

you<00:06:43.979> know<00:06:44.069> would<00:06:44.249> you<00:06:44.339> be<00:06:44.489> interested<00:06:44.669> in<00:06:45.029> that

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:45.649 
you know would you be interested in that

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:49.669 
you know would you be interested in that
now<00:06:46.649> you<00:06:46.709> can<00:06:47.099> gene<00:06:47.879> gene<00:06:48.779> or<00:06:48.929> gene<00:06:49.169> synthesis

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:49.679 
now you can gene gene or gene synthesis

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:52.459 
now you can gene gene or gene synthesis
and<00:06:49.859> optimization<00:06:50.579> so<00:06:51.179> then<00:06:51.929> we<00:06:52.169> taught<00:06:52.439> them

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:52.469 
and optimization so then we taught them

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.609 
and optimization so then we taught them
where<00:06:52.919> you<00:06:53.309> know<00:06:53.429> basically<00:06:54.199> reiterating<00:06:55.199> the

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:55.619 
where you know basically reiterating the

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:58.399 
where you know basically reiterating the
points<00:06:56.009> about<00:06:56.579> gene<00:06:57.449> synthesis<00:06:58.049> gives<00:06:58.319> you

00:06:58.399 --> 00:06:58.409 
points about gene synthesis gives you

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.019 
points about gene synthesis gives you
freedom<00:06:58.649> from<00:06:58.949> the<00:06:59.099> burden<00:06:59.279> of<00:06:59.489> cloning<00:06:59.879> no

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
don't need to sequence and you have you

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.599 
don't need to sequence and you have you
know<00:07:10.349> the<00:07:10.469> option<00:07:10.859> to<00:07:10.889> have<00:07:11.099> your<00:07:11.249> sequence

goes<00:07:13.979> beyond<00:07:14.339> you<00:07:15.059> know<00:07:15.149> just<00:07:15.449> gene<00:07:15.659> synthesis

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 
goes beyond you know just gene synthesis

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:20.149 
goes beyond you know just gene synthesis
goes<00:07:16.919> into<00:07:17.219> this<00:07:17.339> realm<00:07:17.639> of<00:07:18.889> optimization<00:07:19.889> so

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:20.159 
goes into this realm of optimization so

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.789 
goes into this realm of optimization so
it's<00:07:20.699> proven<00:07:21.569> to<00:07:21.719> increase<00:07:21.899> protein

it's proven to increase protein

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:25.279 
it's proven to increase protein
expression<00:07:23.339> levels<00:07:23.849> you<00:07:24.449> know<00:07:24.539> it<00:07:24.749> does<00:07:24.959> this

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.289 
expression levels you know it does this

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:26.600 
expression levels you know it does this
one<00:07:25.649> of<00:07:25.739> the<00:07:25.799> ways<00:07:25.919> it<00:07:26.039> does<00:07:26.189> this<00:07:26.429> is<00:07:26.579> by

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
one of the ways it does this is by

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.359 
one of the ways it does this is by
stabilizing<00:07:27.079> mRNAs<00:07:28.079> optimizing<00:07:28.979> codon<00:07:29.339> usage

00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:29.369 
stabilizing mRNAs optimizing codon usage

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:35.869 
stabilizing mRNAs optimizing codon usage
etc<00:07:31.879> so<00:07:33.469> you<00:07:34.469> know<00:07:34.529> we're<00:07:34.829> now<00:07:35.189> speed<00:07:35.610> no

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 
etc so you know we're now speed no

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:37.549 
etc so you know we're now speed no

your<00:07:37.709> construct<00:07:38.399> you<00:07:38.639> know<00:07:38.789> we<00:07:38.969> have<00:07:39.149> a<00:07:39.179> super

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:39.719 
your construct you know we have a super

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:41.389 
your construct you know we have a super
speed<00:07:39.929> production<00:07:40.439> option<00:07:40.799> that<00:07:41.009> can<00:07:41.219> deliver

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:41.399 
speed production option that can deliver

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.939 
speed production option that can deliver

an<00:07:46.799> emergency<00:07:47.009> situation<00:07:47.359> see<00:07:48.409> so<00:07:49.409> there's<00:07:49.859> a

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:49.949 
an emergency situation see so there's a

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:54.169 
an emergency situation see so there's a
flu<00:07:50.819> pandemic<00:07:51.509> in<00:07:52.219> the<00:07:53.219> u.s.<00:07:53.549> I<00:07:53.789> just<00:07:54.059> need

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:54.179 
flu pandemic in the u.s. I just need

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:55.759
