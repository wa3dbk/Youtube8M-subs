originally<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.529> bought<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.040> actual<00:00:32.579> battery<00:00:32.910> box

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
originally I bought a actual battery box

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.440 
originally I bought a actual battery box
from<00:00:33.450> West<00:00:34.440> marine<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:35.969> was<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:36.180> of

Target and bought a 3.50 scent box here

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.069 
Target and bought a 3.50 scent box here
to<00:00:43.260> build<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.829> battery<00:00:44.160> box<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.870> ahead<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
to build my battery box so go ahead and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.170 
to build my battery box so go ahead and
open<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.950> show<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> guys<00:00:47.850> what<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
open it up here show you guys what it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.360 
open it up here show you guys what it
looks<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> basically<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> battery

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
looks like so basically have the battery

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.439 
looks like so basically have the battery
mounted<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.500> use<00:00:55.500> some<00:00:55.770> foam<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
mounted in here use some foam here to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.990 
mounted in here use some foam here to
kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.930> hold<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> battery<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> place<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.910> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
kind of hold the battery in place so it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.670 
kind of hold the battery in place so it
doesn't<00:01:00.030> move<00:01:00.329> around<00:01:00.539> when<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
doesn't move around when it's in the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.700 
doesn't move around when it's in the
hull<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> kayak<00:01:02.960> got<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> wired<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.409> here

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
hull of the kayak got a wired up here

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.230 
hull of the kayak got a wired up here
basically<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.689> positive<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
basically have the positive here with a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.080 
basically have the positive here with a
three<00:01:09.240> amp<00:01:09.390> fuse<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.890> then<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.939> your

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
three amp fuse and then you have your

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.210 
three amp fuse and then you have your
ground<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.110> which<00:01:13.970> runs<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:16.080> DSi<00:01:16.680> filter

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
ground here which runs to the DSi filter

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
ground here which runs to the DSi filter
and<00:01:17.400> then<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.360> runs<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> power<00:01:19.470> plug

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and then that runs to the power plug

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.969 
and then that runs to the power plug
here<00:01:19.979> which<00:01:20.700> actually<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> outside

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
here which actually have on the outside

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.719 
here which actually have on the outside
here<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.880> power<00:01:24.119> plug<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.680> plug<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.520> my

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
here the power plug so I can plug in my

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.450 
here the power plug so I can plug in my
other<00:01:27.479> end<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.810> my<00:01:28.259> fish<00:01:28.470> finder<00:01:28.829> power<00:01:29.009> cable

powered on so we have the power cable
here<00:02:06.610> for<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.420> fish<00:02:07.600> finder<00:02:07.899> which<00:02:08.470> actually

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
here for the fish finder which actually

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.550 
here for the fish finder which actually
cut<00:02:09.550> my<00:02:09.580> fish<00:02:09.970> finder<00:02:10.330> power<00:02:10.509> cord<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.140> then

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
cut my fish finder power cord and then

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.370 
cut my fish finder power cord and then
went<00:02:11.770> ahead<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:11.980> put<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.370> on<00:02:12.580> there<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:14.200> that

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
way we could power up the fish finder so

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.949 
way we could power up the fish finder so
you<00:02:17.770> can<00:02:17.860> see<00:02:18.040> here<00:02:18.400> went<00:02:19.209> ahead<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.600> got<00:02:19.780> this

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
as you can see it's got a nice tight

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.670 
as you can see it's got a nice tight
seal<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:46.030> way<00:02:46.209> no<00:02:46.959> water<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.380> going<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.590> be

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
seal so that way no water is going to be

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.890 
seal so that way no water is going to be
getting<00:02:47.890> inside<00:02:48.130> there<00:02:48.640> when<00:02:49.390> it's<00:02:49.540> hooked<00:02:49.720> up

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
getting inside there when it's hooked up

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.920 
getting inside there when it's hooked up
so<00:02:50.489> go<00:02:51.489> ahead<00:02:51.549> and<00:02:51.700> get<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:51.940> plugged<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:52.870> I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
so go ahead and get it plugged in like I

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.229 
so go ahead and get it plugged in like I
said<00:02:53.019> nice<00:02:53.920> tight<00:02:54.190> seal<00:02:54.459> there<00:02:54.760> as<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.209> can

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
said nice tight seal there as you can

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.069 
said nice tight seal there as you can
see<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.760> should<00:02:57.940> be<00:02:58.090> able<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.390> power

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
see and now it should be able to power

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:06.120 
see and now it should be able to power
on<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.410> fish<00:02:59.590> finder<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.620> as<00:03:05.829> you<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.070> see

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
on the fish finder so as you can see

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.289 
on the fish finder so as you can see
fish<00:03:06.730> finder<00:03:07.150> powered<00:03:07.720> up<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.850> then<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:09.940> got<00:03:10.120> my

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
fish finder powered up and then I got my

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.410 
fish finder powered up and then I got my
transducer<00:03:11.200> cable<00:03:11.380> all<00:03:12.040> zip-tied<00:03:12.850> here

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
transducer cable all zip-tied here

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.630 
transducer cable all zip-tied here
I<00:03:13.450> thought<00:03:14.200> about<00:03:14.440> splicing<00:03:15.070> this<00:03:15.220> but<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.459> read

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
I thought about splicing this but I read

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.630 
I thought about splicing this but I read
a<00:03:15.670> lot<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.180> stuff<00:03:16.480> online<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:16.900> said<00:03:17.890> probably

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
a lot of stuff online that said probably

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.580 
a lot of stuff online that said probably
not<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.850> good<00:03:19.030> idea<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.600> splice<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.380> I

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
not a good idea to splice it so I

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.440 
not a good idea to splice it so I
decided<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.519> know<00:03:21.670> probably<00:03:22.180> really

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
decided you know probably really

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.240 
decided you know probably really
wouldn't<00:03:22.690> get<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.930> way<00:03:23.079> too<00:03:23.140> much<00:03:23.470> just<00:03:24.160> go

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
wouldn't get in the way too much just go

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.240 
wouldn't get in the way too much just go
ahead<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.489> wrap<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.790> up<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.120> then<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.750> have<00:03:26.250> the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
ahead and wrap it up and then I have the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.509 
ahead and wrap it up and then I have the
transducer<00:03:28.030> down<00:03:28.209> there<00:03:28.450> mounted<00:03:29.290> on<00:03:29.380> my<00:03:29.519> rant

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
transducer down there mounted on my rant

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.420 
transducer down there mounted on my rant
about<00:03:30.820> this<00:03:31.090> setup<00:03:31.359> is<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.920> have<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.340> on

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
about this setup is that I do have it on

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.080 
about this setup is that I do have it on
the<00:03:33.609> RAM<00:03:33.820> mount<00:03:34.060> here<00:03:34.450> as<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.560> can<00:03:35.590> see<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.700> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
the RAM mount here as you can see so you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.840 
the RAM mount here as you can see so you
can<00:03:37.510> really<00:03:37.900> easily<00:03:38.530> change<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.250> position

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
can really easily change the position

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.599 
can really easily change the position
however<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.930> want<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.890> know<00:03:42.010> maybe<00:03:42.190> if<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.489> was

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
however you want you know maybe if I was

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.060 
however you want you know maybe if I was
standing<00:03:43.030> up<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.390> might<00:03:43.600> want<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.810> facing<00:03:44.260> up<00:03:44.410> so

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
standing up I might want it facing up so

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.770 
standing up I might want it facing up so
I<00:03:45.100> could<00:03:45.400> look<00:03:45.730> down<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.150> see<00:03:46.329> what's<00:03:46.510> going

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
I could look down and see what's going

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.220 
I could look down and see what's going
on<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.640> what's<00:03:48.640> also<00:03:48.820> nice<00:03:49.120> is<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.900> fact<00:03:50.140> that

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
on and what's also nice is the fact that

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.280 
on and what's also nice is the fact that
I<00:03:50.680> can<00:03:51.010> actually<00:03:51.040> move<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.930> wherever<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.109> want

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
I can actually move it wherever I want

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.199 
I can actually move it wherever I want
it<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.440> be<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.220> if<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.090> go<00:03:55.269> ahead<00:03:55.359> and<00:03:57.209> probably

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
it to be so if I go ahead and probably

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.559 
it to be so if I go ahead and probably
easier<00:03:58.600> if<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.870> unplug<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.440> cable<00:03:59.769> here

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.160 

so<00:04:06.569> I<00:04:06.629> actually<00:04:07.049> loosen<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.980> up<00:04:08.099> here<00:04:08.900> on<00:04:09.900> that

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
so I actually loosen it up here on that

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.449 
so I actually loosen it up here on that
ball<00:04:10.440> now<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.980> can<00:04:11.489> go<00:04:11.610> ahead<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:11.959> move<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.080> over

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
ball now I can go ahead and move it over

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:31.670 
ball now I can go ahead and move it over
to<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.580> side<00:04:14.849> here<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:27.830> as<00:04:28.940> you<00:04:29.940> can<00:04:30.000> see<00:04:30.680> kid

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
to the side here and as you can see kid

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.950 
to the side here and as you can see kid
have<00:04:31.979> it<00:04:32.010> over<00:04:32.460> on<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:33.030> side<00:04:33.060> if<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.570> wanted<00:04:33.840> to

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
have it over on the side if I wanted to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.500 
have it over on the side if I wanted to
switch<00:04:34.169> positions<00:04:34.380> or<00:04:35.039> could<00:04:35.789> even<00:04:35.940> even<00:04:36.300> move

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
switch positions or could even even move

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.740 
switch positions or could even even move
it<00:04:36.630> over<00:04:36.840> here<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.050> my<00:04:37.350> other<00:04:37.889> side<00:04:38.820> track<00:04:39.180> if<00:04:39.600> I

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
it over here to my other side track if I

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.050 
it over here to my other side track if I
wanted<00:04:39.990> to
