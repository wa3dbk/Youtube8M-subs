00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.790 

this<00:00:17.920> is<00:00:18.190> a<00:00:18.220> HSV<00:00:18.820> senator<00:00:19.119> it<00:00:19.630> uses<00:00:19.990> a<00:00:20.199> 6.2

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
this is a HSV senator it uses a 6.2

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.940 
this is a HSV senator it uses a 6.2
liter<00:00:21.190> v8<00:00:21.279> and<00:00:21.880> it<00:00:22.180> makes<00:00:22.500> 317<00:00:23.500> kilowatts<00:00:23.890> of

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
liter v8 and it makes 317 kilowatts of

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.550 
liter v8 and it makes 317 kilowatts of
power<00:00:24.100> so<00:00:24.730> it<00:00:24.850> goes<00:00:25.030> like<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:25.360> clappers<00:00:25.560> but

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
power so it goes like the clappers but

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.080 
power so it goes like the clappers but
this<00:00:26.680> one's<00:00:26.860> a<00:00:26.950> bit<00:00:27.070> special<00:00:27.370> this<00:00:27.790> is<00:00:27.850> an

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
this one's a bit special this is an

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.970 
this one's a bit special this is an
engineering<00:00:28.450> prototype<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.230> right<00:00:29.710> now

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
engineering prototype and right now

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.429 
engineering prototype and right now
believe<00:00:30.490> it<00:00:30.580> or<00:00:30.670> not<00:00:30.790> I'm<00:00:31.210> running<00:00:31.720> on<00:00:31.780> LP<00:00:32.200> gas

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
believe it or not I'm running on LP gas

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.950 
believe it or not I'm running on LP gas
yep<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.489> same<00:00:33.670> stuff<00:00:33.969> that<00:00:34.000> taxis<00:00:34.600> all<00:00:34.719> over

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
yep the same stuff that taxis all over

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.209 
yep the same stuff that taxis all over
the<00:00:35.050> country<00:00:35.350> used<00:00:35.559> through<00:00:35.770> the<00:00:35.860> week<00:00:36.010> and

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
the country used through the week and

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.479 
the country used through the week and
you<00:00:36.640> cook<00:00:36.820> your<00:00:36.969> sausages<00:00:37.360> on<00:00:37.539> at<00:00:37.749> the<00:00:38.019> weekend

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
you cook your sausages on at the weekend

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.740 
you cook your sausages on at the weekend
and<00:00:39.899> here's<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.050> proof<00:00:41.260> right<00:00:41.920> in<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.219> boot

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.530 

there<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.980> LP<00:00:48.430> gas<00:00:48.790> tank<00:00:49.120> there's<00:00:49.450> a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
there it is the LP gas tank there's a

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.150 
there it is the LP gas tank there's a
normal<00:00:49.750> fuel<00:00:50.110> tank<00:00:50.350> under<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.710> floor<00:00:50.920> in<00:00:51.070> the

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
normal fuel tank under the floor in the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.979 
normal fuel tank under the floor in the
normal<00:00:51.460> place<00:00:51.640> because<00:00:52.210> it<00:00:52.300> is<00:00:52.330> still<00:00:52.750> dual

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
normal place because it is still dual

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.110 
normal place because it is still dual
fuel<00:00:53.230> but<00:00:53.860> that<00:00:54.100> is<00:00:54.310> where<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.640> sausage<00:00:54.910> gas

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
fuel but that is where the sausage gas

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.520 
fuel but that is where the sausage gas
lives<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:55.630> there's<00:00:56.050> one<00:00:56.200> other<00:00:56.350> little

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
lives and there's one other little

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.970 
lives and there's one other little
giveaway<00:00:56.800> inside<00:00:57.580> and<00:00:58.650> it's<00:00:59.650> this<00:00:59.800> little

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
giveaway inside and it's this little

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.530 
giveaway inside and it's this little
switch<00:01:00.280> here<00:01:00.309> now<00:01:00.640> when<00:01:00.820> I<00:01:00.880> fire<00:01:01.150> it<00:01:01.180> up<00:01:01.390> it'll

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
switch here now when I fire it up it'll

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.780 
switch here now when I fire it up it'll
light<00:01:01.809> up<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:02.290> that's<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.160> switch<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.640> can

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
light up and that's the switch that can

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.040 
light up and that's the switch that can
take<00:01:04.000> me<00:01:04.119> from<00:01:04.300> petrol<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.190> LPG<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.900> those

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
take me from petrol back to LPG so those

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.930 
take me from petrol back to LPG so those
are<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.260> bits<00:01:08.410> that<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.680> can<00:01:08.890> see<00:01:09.130> what<00:01:09.760> about

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
are the bits that you can see what about

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.540 
are the bits that you can see what about
the<00:01:10.000> bits<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.390> can<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.860> basically<00:01:12.340> have

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
the bits that you can we basically have

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.550 
the bits that you can we basically have
a<00:01:12.580> tank<00:01:13.060> in<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.360> vehicle<00:01:13.900> with<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.080> pump<00:01:14.350> in<00:01:14.470> it

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
a tank in the vehicle with a pump in it

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.320 
a tank in the vehicle with a pump in it
that<00:01:15.070> actually<00:01:15.310> pumps<00:01:15.550> high-pressure<00:01:15.940> liquid

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
that actually pumps high-pressure liquid

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.320 
that actually pumps high-pressure liquid
gas<00:01:16.960> or<00:01:17.290> liquid<00:01:17.590> propane<00:01:18.160> into<00:01:18.759> our<00:01:18.880> injection

gas or liquid propane into our injection
ports<00:01:19.630> through<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.470> injectors<00:01:20.830> which<00:01:20.979> just

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
ports through the injectors which just

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.639 
ports through the injectors which just
sit<00:01:21.460> above<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.790> petrol<00:01:22.090> injectors<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.780> then

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
sit above the petrol injectors and then

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.740 
sit above the petrol injectors and then
return<00:01:24.160> out<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.460> system<00:01:24.790> it's<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:25.000> return<00:01:25.390> it's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
return out the system it's a return it's

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.530 
return out the system it's a return it's
a<00:01:25.810> returning<00:01:26.140> guest<00:01:26.320> system<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:28.000> they<00:01:28.300> pump

parallel or in series depending on the
configuration<00:01:32.619> we<00:01:33.160> end<00:01:33.280> up<00:01:33.369> with<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.789> at<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
configuration we end up with and at the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.760 
configuration we end up with and at the
end<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.840> day<00:01:34.960> we<00:01:35.110> don't<00:01:35.289> think<00:01:35.380> there'll

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
end of the day we don't think there'll

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.469 
end of the day we don't think there'll
be<00:01:35.800> any<00:01:35.860> difference<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.550> drive<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:36.970> between<00:01:37.360> a

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
be any difference to drive it between a

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.370 
be any difference to drive it between a
petrol<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:37.899> an<00:01:37.960> LBJ

one<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.220> really<00:01:39.520> nice<00:01:39.610> things<00:01:39.880> about<00:01:39.970> this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
one of the really nice things about this

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.420 
one of the really nice things about this
car<00:01:40.570> is<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.990> way<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.530> gas<00:01:41.740> conversion<00:01:42.340> that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
car is the way the gas conversion that

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.010 
car is the way the gas conversion that
is<00:01:42.580> integrated<00:01:43.270> into<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.600> rest<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.930> the

would<00:03:40.370> cost<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.700> run<00:03:40.850> and<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.600> should<00:03:41.870> pay

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
would cost to run and that should pay

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.510 
would cost to run and that should pay
for<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.230> conversion<00:03:42.530> in<00:03:42.830> about<00:03:43.220> twelve

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
for the conversion in about twelve

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.340 
for the conversion in about twelve
months<00:03:43.820> as<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.000> rule<00:03:44.270> of<00:03:44.390> thumb<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.020> work<00:03:45.200> it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
months as a rule of thumb so you work it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.100 
months as a rule of thumb so you work it
out<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.220> guess<00:03:46.400> for<00:03:46.550> me<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.030> question<00:03:47.420> now

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
out so I guess for me the question now

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.260 
out so I guess for me the question now
is<00:03:48.410> not<00:03:48.680> why<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.010> hell<00:03:49.340> I'd<00:03:49.489> want<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.760> HSV<00:03:50.239> a

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
is not why the hell I'd want to HSV a

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.000 
is not why the hell I'd want to HSV a
car<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:50.630> runs<00:03:50.720> on<00:03:50.900> gas<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.380> why<00:03:52.070> wouldn't<00:03:52.430> I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.069 

you
