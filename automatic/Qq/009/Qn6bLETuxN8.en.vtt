00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.410
 the operational cost of dangerous products is regulated by 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.970
 by means of the transport and transit legislation in force, the public 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.150
 job promotion cppt offers the course for free the interested student 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.760
 the initiative came from the state government in partnership with the city hall 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.560
 I do not use the tone 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.220
 is being taught that you have to have 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.390
 he 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.289
 fully covers 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.560
 they acted easy passed he had a cost of 800 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.350
 eight hundred reais 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.740
 I took it seriously 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.890
 the transport 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.150
 and the certificate 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.310
 trying is a very important unknown to be calm 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.290
 Nobody is going to be still 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.700
 staff during classrooms the teachers provide all the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.350
 necessary guidelines 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.030
 so that the future driver of this type of transport can work with 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.000
 security it is important to note that the securities it is expected to 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 midnight return 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.400
 the brazilian 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.800
 the reduction of 18.1 billion in 2004 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 it provides for the training of the driver 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.690
 this step piglet taking one step at a time was missing doing here in the area of 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.030
 dangerous products that is the block is one of the lucky courses that shivers 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.600
 reduction is a sport eighteen students participate in the course which has load 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.689
 200 hours class time 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.670
 the sector explains what is bug during this period of the course today it is 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.820
 divided into several rooms here as having an excessive workload 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.190
 200 class hours 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.170
 they will come to more serious than anticipated 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 in the course of normal what is I knew about defensive steering first 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030
 environmental aid published one of them was something big 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.550
 fire fighting 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.380
 they will have is the general legislation of the specific legislation and also the part 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.610
 specific handling of hazardous products they will be 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.390
 team leaders 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.530
 the doors of the dangerous product 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.630
 what they want without worrying about it first they know the product that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.590
 are carrying knows how all the logistics of the dangerous product works 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.229
 eto'o the main security 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.450
 give them as drivers of the environment 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.409
 this treatment 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.809
 hazards can affect the environment as well as safety 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.850
 of all people involved in the environment 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.850
 The people that 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.480
 practical classes, the participants had the opportunity to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.230
 close to the risks that the chemicals offer signed in the mid 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.399
 correct format 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:43.229
 first to bring 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:47.499
 in the classroom the potential risk that we have on the highways is with the contact 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.249
 with some products presents 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.170
 It's the first thing we did was with or 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.950
 the support of the vans that she in contact with the water emitted flammable p 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.729
 as a result explosion 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.729
 also show the flash point of some fuels 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.840
 the reaction the potassium permanganate that has in the release of oxygen 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.779
 instead of release due to heating 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.079
 and these are 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.889
 these three that brought them and that is not even thought in the midst of explosives 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.889
 also contact with the art of cinema and some with the metals 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.450
 for students 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.500
 professional qualification is essential when it comes to achieving 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.730
 best position in the labor market through gnl 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.789
 trained in engineering in the labor market 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.079
 in cabinda to cunene 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.529
 conquer a profession 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:35.769
 I have a housing plan 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.399
 what would he say in this moment? 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:42.069
 the identity of the detainees and this contributes no less 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.369
 for the region 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:03.309
 but Edmar wakes up early to take part in the course according to him the qualification 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.939
 as well as bringing knowledge 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.189
 opens doors so that other employment opportunities 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.279
 advances in transport 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.579
 I am working 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.239
 inside the company 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.159
 I travel 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.309
 she reports 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:22.309
 It is also part of the itamar driver 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.279
 in Denmark the companies with national performance 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.979
 then killed himself 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.979
 It's something that changes again. 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.099
 it's very good 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.099
 and now 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.889
 according to Elisabete in addition I think the following other teleconferencing 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.340
 different professional areas our proposal is to strengthen the cast 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.699
 today I do not like social contestation but also 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.300
 We are working on social issues. 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.099
 so we've had enough support 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.429
 just from the boat table we have the basic skills course for the 

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:04.839
 job 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:07.110
 the guitar course 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.189
 the waiter tickets 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.120
 of fabric paint 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.089
 the forklift course 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:14.889
 we are starting 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.210
 only repair and maintenance of industrial sewing machines 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:20.819
 which is a demand also 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:21.679
 from the market
