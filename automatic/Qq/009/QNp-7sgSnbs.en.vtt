00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
alright the body of this car is 98 the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.419 
alright the body of this car is 98 the
wiring<00:00:07.020> harnesses<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.620> 98<00:00:10.099> whole<00:00:11.099> front<00:00:11.370> of

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
wiring harnesses in 98 whole front of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.829 
wiring harnesses in 98 whole front of
this<00:00:11.550> car<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.049> 2000<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:14.210> you<00:00:15.210> know<00:00:15.330> that's<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
this car is 2000 and you know that's the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.349 
this car is 2000 and you know that's the
year<00:00:16.109> they<00:00:16.320> start<00:00:16.940> changing<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.060> adding

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
year they start changing and adding

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.080 
year they start changing and adding
stuff<00:00:18.890> so<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.000> 98<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.109> cooling<00:00:22.529> fan<00:00:23.090> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
stuff so on the 98 the cooling fan is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.880 
stuff so on the 98 the cooling fan is
actually<00:00:24.539> screwed<00:00:24.869> into<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> radiator<00:00:26.150> and

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
actually screwed into the radiator and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.740 
actually screwed into the radiator and
the<00:00:28.890> 2000s<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:31.099> but<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.130> least<00:00:32.750> they

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the 2000s it's not but at least they

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.500 
the 2000s it's not but at least they
were<00:00:33.870> smart<00:00:33.899> enough<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:35.460> put<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> plug<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.450> you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
were smart enough to put a plug so you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.770 
were smart enough to put a plug so you
could<00:00:36.750> put<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:36.989> sensor<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.360> just<00:00:39.360> plug<00:00:39.600> them

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
could put that sensor in just plug them

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.360 
could put that sensor in just plug them
kind<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> pain<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
kind of a pain to get to you with the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.799 
kind of a pain to get to you with the
radiator<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> car<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> wish<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.629> would<00:00:42.780> have

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
radiator in the car I wish I would have

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.779 
radiator in the car I wish I would have
caught<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.170> beforehand<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.160> straight

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
caught it beforehand you see straight

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.270 
caught it beforehand you see straight
down<00:00:48.059> there<00:00:49.879> that's<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> top<00:00:51.270> radiator<00:00:51.690> hose

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
down there that's the top radiator hose

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.700 
down there that's the top radiator hose
right<00:00:53.280> above<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.960> into<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> radiator<00:00:55.500> is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
right above it into the radiator is

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.189 
right above it into the radiator is
where<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.960> sensor<00:00:57.960> goes<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:01:00.199> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
where this sensor goes and then the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.770 
where this sensor goes and then the
wiring<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.390> have<00:01:03.390> stretched<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.270> then

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
wiring I have stretched up here and then

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.960 
wiring I have stretched up here and then
that's<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.340> left<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> hook

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that's I think all I have left to hook

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.120 
that's I think all I have left to hook
up<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.229> air<00:01:10.500> conditioner

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
up so I can get my air conditioner

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.520 
up so I can get my air conditioner
charged<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.210> didn't<00:01:12.960> want<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> charge<00:01:13.350> my

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
charged up I didn't want to charge my

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.960 
charged up I didn't want to charge my
air<00:01:13.680> conditioner<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.760> need<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
air conditioner up because I need the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.820 
air conditioner up because I need the
cooling<00:01:15.450> fan<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.840> run<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:18.530> had<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.560> pop

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
cooling fan to run and so had to pop

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.039 
cooling fan to run and so had to pop
that<00:01:20.040> lower<00:01:20.250> radiator<00:01:20.700> hose<00:01:20.820> off<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that lower radiator hose off and the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.039 
that lower radiator hose off and the
night<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.729> clip<00:01:23.970> somewhere<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.780> any<00:01:24.960> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
night is in the clip somewhere if any of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.810 
night is in the clip somewhere if any of
you<00:01:25.170> guys<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.650> these<00:01:26.009> clips

Volkswagen doesn't use clamps they have
a<00:01:33.119> big<00:01:33.390> plastic<00:01:33.920> clip<00:01:34.920> housing<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> slides

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
a big plastic clip housing that slides

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
a big plastic clip housing that slides
over<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> lower<00:01:38.420> radiator<00:01:39.420> snout<00:01:40.610> has<00:01:41.610> rubber

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
over the lower radiator snout has rubber

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.649 
over the lower radiator snout has rubber
o-ring<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.079> these<00:01:43.320> clips<00:01:44.659> actually

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
o-ring in it and these clips actually

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.760 
o-ring in it and these clips actually
this<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:47.390> heater<00:01:48.390> hose<00:01:48.630> these<00:01:49.259> two<00:01:49.409> heater

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
this is a heater hose these two heater

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.499 
this is a heater hose these two heater
hose<00:01:49.979> ones<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:53.360> fuel<00:01:54.360> pressure

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
hose ones and this is a fuel pressure

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.080 
hose ones and this is a fuel pressure
regulator<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.619> don't<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.490> another<00:01:56.759> lower

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
regulator one I don't have another lower

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.730 
regulator one I don't have another lower
radiator<00:01:57.600> hose<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> pretty<00:01:58.500> big

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
radiator hose when it's a pretty big

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.920 
radiator hose when it's a pretty big
limits<00:01:59.070> twice<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.579> size<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.090> these<00:02:00.210> things<00:02:00.600> so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
limits twice the size of these things so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.620 
limits twice the size of these things so
I'm<00:02:01.680> hoping<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.130> find<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.909> heard<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> zing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
I'm hoping I can find it I heard it zing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.520 
I'm hoping I can find it I heard it zing
and<00:02:03.930> land<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:06.000> did<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.329> hit<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.570> ground<00:02:06.719> stuck

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
and land it did not hit the ground stuck

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.450 
and land it did not hit the ground stuck
on<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.890> car<00:02:08.129> so

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
on the car so

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.860 
on the car so
I<00:02:10.520> got<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.760> crawl<00:02:11.000> under<00:02:11.270> there<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.450> see<00:02:11.690> if<00:02:11.780> I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
I got to crawl under there and see if I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.280 
I got to crawl under there and see if I
can<00:02:12.050> hunt<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.350> up<00:02:13.120> now<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.300> has<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> gasket<00:02:15.140> on

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
can hunt it up now that has a gasket on

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.010 
can hunt it up now that has a gasket on
it<00:02:15.440> like<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> drain<00:02:16.040> plug<00:02:16.250> but<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.970> went<00:02:17.930> ahead

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
it like a drain plug but I went ahead

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.660 
it like a drain plug but I went ahead
and<00:02:18.140> put<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> little<00:02:18.530> thin<00:02:19.220> film<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.730> our<00:02:20.000> TV

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
and put a little thin film of our TV

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.150 
and put a little thin film of our TV
around<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.880> threads<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.980> be<00:02:25.130> sure

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
around the threads just to be sure

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.300 
around the threads just to be sure
because<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:25.820> thing's<00:02:26.030> real<00:02:26.270> pain<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.540> change

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
because this thing's real pain to change

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.610 
because this thing's real pain to change
there's<00:02:28.310> my<00:02:28.870> door<00:02:29.870> glass<00:02:30.110> out<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.440> that

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
there's my door glass out of that

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.770

put a little D electric tune-up grease
on<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:46.630> connections<00:03:48.010> now<00:03:49.010> we<00:03:49.070> gotta<00:03:49.340> crawl<00:03:49.640> up

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
on the connections now we gotta crawl up

lower radiator hose on that's probably

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.680 
lower radiator hose on that's probably
the<00:03:53.900> hardest<00:03:54.200> part<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> whole<00:03:54.650> jihad<00:03:55.690> all

of<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.139> reason<00:04:41.260> I<00:04:41.470> did<00:04:41.650> this<00:04:41.680> job<00:04:42.160> today<00:04:42.370> I

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
of the reason I did this job today I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.909 
of the reason I did this job today I
pulled<00:04:42.940> this<00:04:43.120> off<00:04:43.360> last<00:04:43.690> night<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:47.800> know

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
pulled this off last night to you know

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.950 
pulled this off last night to you know
pull<00:04:48.220> it<00:04:48.250> in<00:04:48.460> cold<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.510> wouldn't<00:04:49.720> have<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.840> be

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
pull it in cold so I wouldn't have to be

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.480 
pull it in cold so I wouldn't have to be
dealing<00:04:50.169> with<00:04:50.320> this<00:04:50.500> hot<00:04:50.740> car<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.370> whole

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
dealing with this hot car and the whole

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.020 
dealing with this hot car and the whole
water<00:04:51.820> would<00:04:52.000> be<00:04:52.090> out<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.510> and<00:04:52.919> then<00:04:54.030> I'll

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
water would be out of it and then I'll

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.490 
water would be out of it and then I'll
put<00:04:55.240> any<00:04:55.389> fries<00:04:55.690> in<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.020> don't<00:04:56.169> want<00:04:56.289> to<00:04:56.380> run

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
put any fries in it I don't want to run

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.230 
put any fries in it I don't want to run
water<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:57.010> it's<00:04:57.250> all<00:04:57.370> aluminum<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.090> it'll

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
water and it's all aluminum and it'll

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.830 
water and it's all aluminum and it'll
calcify<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.110> plug<00:04:59.410> everything<00:04:59.680> up<00:05:00.810> now<00:05:01.810> I

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
calcify and plug everything up now I

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.080 
calcify and plug everything up now I
fill<00:05:02.320> them<00:05:02.410> up<00:05:02.500> with<00:05:02.560> water<00:05:03.009> when<00:05:03.910> they're

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
fill them up with water when they're

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.020 
fill them up with water when they're
empty<00:05:04.380> I'll<00:05:05.380> pull<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.889> sensor<00:05:06.669> out<00:05:06.789> of<00:05:06.940> the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
empty I'll pull that sensor out of the

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.420 
empty I'll pull that sensor out of the
back<00:05:07.180> of<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.419> head<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:07.990> then<00:05:08.979> fill<00:05:09.220> them<00:05:09.310> up

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
back of the head and then fill them up

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.550 
back of the head and then fill them up
until<00:05:09.849> you<00:05:10.539> know<00:05:10.599> get<00:05:10.870> green<00:05:11.110> antifreeze

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
until you know get green antifreeze

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.779 
until you know get green antifreeze
coming<00:05:11.949> out<00:05:12.039> of<00:05:12.070> there<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.400> then<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.580> put<00:05:12.760> the

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
coming out of there and then I put the

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.240 
coming out of there and then I put the
sensor<00:05:13.240> back<00:05:13.419> in<00:05:13.660> and<00:05:13.930> that<00:05:14.650> way<00:05:14.800> at<00:05:14.919> least<00:05:14.979> I

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
sensor back in and that way at least I

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.719 
sensor back in and that way at least I
know<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.610> head<00:05:15.820> has<00:05:17.280> antifreeze<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:18.520> it<00:05:18.610> and

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
know the head has antifreeze in it and

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.839 
know the head has antifreeze in it and
then<00:05:18.820> we'll<00:05:18.970> uh<00:05:20.039> you<00:05:21.039> know<00:05:21.159> get<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.550> rest<00:05:21.760> of

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
then we'll uh you know get the rest of

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.129 
then we'll uh you know get the rest of
it<00:05:21.970> filled<00:05:22.150> up<00:05:22.240> these<00:05:22.389> things<00:05:22.630> are<00:05:22.750> bad<00:05:22.900> about

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
it filled up these things are bad about

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.580 
it filled up these things are bad about
getting<00:05:23.320> air<00:05:23.560> bubbles<00:05:23.889> in<00:05:24.039> them<00:05:24.130> so<00:05:25.500> all<00:05:26.500> right

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
getting air bubbles in them so all right

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.920 
getting air bubbles in them so all right
I<00:05:26.620> went<00:05:26.860> ahead<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.070> got<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.400> sensor<00:05:27.820> out<00:05:28.000> cool

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
I went ahead and got the sensor out cool

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.279 
I went ahead and got the sensor out cool
deal<00:05:29.139> ring<00:05:29.820> that's<00:05:30.820> a<00:05:30.970> new<00:05:31.150> o-ring<00:05:31.570> isn't<00:05:32.229> in

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
deal ring that's a new o-ring isn't in

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.390

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
100 miles or so so we're going to go

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.680 
100 miles or so so we're going to go
ahead<00:05:39.310> and<00:05:39.460> reuse<00:05:39.940> this<00:05:40.240> ring<00:05:42.090> I<00:05:43.090> won't<00:05:43.599> hit

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
ahead and reuse this ring I won't hit

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.290 
ahead and reuse this ring I won't hit
greased<00:05:43.990> up<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.320> o-ring<00:05:45.150> got<00:05:46.150> some

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
greased up the o-ring got some

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.820 
greased up the o-ring got some
dielectric<00:05:46.570> grease<00:05:46.870> in<00:05:47.139> there<00:05:47.260> so<00:05:47.440> let<00:05:47.590> me<00:05:47.680> get

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
dielectric grease in there so let me get

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.350 
dielectric grease in there so let me get
antifreeze<00:05:48.250> we<00:05:48.460> can<00:05:48.610> plug<00:05:48.849> that<00:05:48.880> in<00:05:49.210> right

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
antifreeze we can plug that in right

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.670 
antifreeze we can plug that in right
away<00:05:49.449> you<00:05:49.570> have<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:49.900> put<00:05:50.080> some<00:05:50.260> oil<00:05:50.409> or

away you have to put some oil or

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.310 
away you have to put some oil or
something<00:05:51.070> on<00:05:51.190> it<00:05:51.370> if<00:05:52.060> you<00:05:52.240> don't<00:05:52.510> shoving<00:05:53.229> it

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
something on it if you don't shoving it

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.409 
something on it if you don't shoving it
in<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.590> hole<00:05:53.830> you'll<00:05:54.190> roll<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.849> thing<00:05:54.909> off

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
in that hole you'll roll that thing off

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.149 
in that hole you'll roll that thing off
your<00:05:55.449> role<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:56.020> o-ring<00:05:56.199> off<00:05:56.590> there<00:05:56.919> and<00:05:57.070> then

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
your role that o-ring off there and then

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.980 
your role that o-ring off there and then
the<00:05:58.150> next<00:05:58.270> thing<00:05:58.419> you<00:05:58.599> know<00:05:58.690> you're<00:05:58.840> going<00:05:58.930> to

the next thing you know you're going to

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.659 
the next thing you know you're going to
have<00:05:59.139> water<00:05:59.349> puking<00:05:59.830> all<00:05:59.919> over<00:05:59.949> to<00:06:00.250> placing

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
have water puking all over to placing

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.409 
have water puking all over to placing
not<00:06:01.150> knowing<00:06:01.449> what<00:06:01.599> the<00:06:01.720> heck's<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:02.020> problem
