00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 kate coriander this one i had it 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.460
 frozen so it changes 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.610
 there's no problem if it's cool 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.410
 perfect I have a bouquet of which I 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.040
 will use about half 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.750
 I need parsley of course 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.010
 the oil so there is oil 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 peanut and I will need oil 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.970
 olive also we will need a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.340
 spoon of harissa and spoon 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.410
 also pepper this is the first 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.109
 operation is to entrust 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.609
 of spinach so to fry the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.340
 spinach until they are well 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.500
 free well inflated and then we will pass 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.190
 as a result, that is cooking 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.190
 would have those foods 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.830
 I put the spinach in the pan 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.790
 so there a water is in the process of 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.800
 to evaporate gently once 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.180
 the water will evaporate I would add 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.010
 of oil to fry them and as 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.180
 this is the case j lo it is well evaporated 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.030
 it's time to add oil 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.760
 I will put two thirds of the oil 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.630
 of peanut thus induced olive and 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.650
 it is an operation that I will repeat 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.180
 many times because it has to 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:20.610
 really good laugh is never 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.610
 really not bad and olive oil 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.690
 it's a frying 30 minutes or so 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.190
 cooking we see that already the conflict 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.300
 begins to make the parties that 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.740
 are black but not yet 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.140
 enough and still a lot of green 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.510
 so we continue and will take place 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.119
 regularly, of course, add 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.820
 the civil oil has been absorbed beauty 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.880
 peace and we will end up having a credit 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.320
 perfect we postulate so that's about 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.780
 about 40 minutes that my conflict and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.150
 then we see that he has really changed 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.310
 color is much rarer than the 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.590
 green he also cut a lot when we 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.020
 should in the pan that's 950 g 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 spinach and much less classy but 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.790
 it's not over yet you have to continue 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.840
 because we have to know this truth 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.000
 conflict must be really fed up and 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.300
 as will be finished only when we will have to 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.700
 all this state there entrusted and united about 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.320
 one hour of cooking after stirring 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.370
 constantly so we see that he is well 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.230
 black it is ready to be used in 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 what are we going for there reserved conflict 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.130
 is ready now we are left 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.350
 more than put the beef in the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.030
 casserole veal cut in half 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.450
 I'm going to add here it's right at the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.450
 tip of the knife 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.360
 I want to add the two onions 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.360
 sliced 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:06.160
 I will see the slope laments parsley 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.670
 as well as coriander and that's it 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.640
 impec 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:20.850
 I will add our echoes that I 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:23.230
 do not forget them here they are 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.860
 spotless now i'm going to add 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.010
 a good tablespoon of pepper 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.010
 black 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:48.810
 that's about it will make the soup sphere 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:50.939
 of art and his soup spoon stop that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.829
 of course we put a lot of money 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.200
 because we like it 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.879
 noted if you do not like how that 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.799
 robin robin of course you put 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.689
 less evidence you put months 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.030
 stop this is it's time to 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.280
 add our confit of spinach which is 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.859
 well black I do not know if you hear it 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.730
 to noise and crisis a little it is the proof 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.260
 that he has fresh the conflict has joined 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.590
 the other ingredients in the casserole 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.510
 minute 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.780
 now we will cover up with 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.780
 water 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:34.430
 so do not omit 50 liters must 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.220
 just cover the height the swiss 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.759
 will reduce the sauce and we will have to have 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.819
 one in eight records neither too long 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.550
 here we go we will cook 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.720
 all so we will close the pressure cooker 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.440
 I am every month we will leave 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.490
 turn about 50 minutes 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.370
 here is cooking finished fifty 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.960
 minutes have elapsed 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.370
 well now is the time of that 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.940
 because we did not have 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.650
 salty as we do not salt the dishes 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.229
 with dried vegetables one rooms a 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.270
 Once they are ass so baverel rs 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.979
 more hunting allies and to taste these 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.979
 terrible to lode
