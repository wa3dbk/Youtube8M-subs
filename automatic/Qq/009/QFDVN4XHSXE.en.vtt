Oh see whatever shall we do and that was

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.300 
Oh see whatever shall we do and that was
it<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.540> was<00:02:50.720> Sidney's<00:02:51.500> final<00:02:51.830> haircut<00:02:52.159> I

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
it that was Sidney's final haircut I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.280 
it that was Sidney's final haircut I
think<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.610> looks<00:02:52.760> amazing<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.750> she<00:02:54.049> literally

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
think it looks amazing and she literally

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.710 
think it looks amazing and she literally
looks<00:02:54.470> like<00:02:54.590> she<00:02:54.799> spent<00:02:54.920> her<00:02:55.129> life<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.519> Sun

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
looks like she spent her life in the Sun

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.780 
looks like she spent her life in the Sun
so<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:57.049> Daisy<00:02:57.349> before<00:02:57.980> her<00:02:58.129> haircut<00:02:58.580> and

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
so this is Daisy before her haircut and

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.640 
so this is Daisy before her haircut and
I<00:02:59.090> personally<00:02:59.510> think<00:02:59.659> that<00:02:59.810> she<00:03:00.140> ended<00:03:00.500> up

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
I personally think that she ended up

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.110 
I personally think that she ended up
looking<00:03:00.860> like<00:03:01.010> Jennifer<00:03:01.430> Aniston<00:03:01.610> when<00:03:02.000> she

nerve-wracking<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.330> do<00:05:05.450> this<00:05:05.600> but<00:05:05.840> they<00:05:06.080> did

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
nerve-wracking to do this but they did

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.219 
nerve-wracking to do this but they did
such<00:05:06.889> a<00:05:06.919> great<00:05:07.220> job<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.729> was<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:08.750> good<00:05:08.900> I<00:05:09.050> think

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
and after he's finished cutting my hair

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.550

when<00:06:05.710> it<00:06:05.800> all<00:06:05.950> really<00:06:06.010> started<00:06:06.700> to<00:06:06.790> come

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
when it all really started to come
