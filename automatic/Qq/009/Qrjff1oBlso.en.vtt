00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hmm 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.290
 me 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.190
 With two aquariums today we will do two days today 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.770
 The 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.100
 This is how the current tank looks like 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.100
 Oh my 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.300
 Plant various aquatic plants ah 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:40.190
 I have quite grow 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.190
 The reason why it was half of the water is because we are planting another aquatic plant from now on 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.100
 Heagurasu short a bunch This is the lanky hungry before 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.350
 Guy is the guy the same guy to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.090
 After this 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:01:00.640
 Miyao Mos 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.640
 It's the same guy I wanted to see at the time, let's do this from now on 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.860
 I will tell you to hold it in the previous day 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.729
 I can tweet it 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.729
 After that, it will disappear as a tree if it stretches out 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.860
 I think that probably want roughly matching gone that there is 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.750
 It's underwater -there is 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.650
 Mon okay reason 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.650
 We firmly 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.479
 Do you see 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.729
 that's all 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.509
 For the time being it may not be good 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.710
 Cut the husk 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.480
 I think I want to open the Agulhas 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.580
 Then hair glass comes out 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.630
 I like this water bar 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.540
 Went stick was 5 In terms of the number 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:35.160
 Than is entangled with people 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.980
 A lot of now words have not been heard 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.680
 Well about this one 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.859
 To go 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.859
 Ah 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.860
 After going up 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.530
 As I will cut it out in five questions , it will grow 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.020
 For now 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.250
 Only one bundle 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.770
 Loosen up 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.720
 I think I'll try planting 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.720
 Try to see what Atodono much we need 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.820
 Hmm 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.820
 I will try planting this Takae rice bowl 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.930
 Ask to do from the back 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.930
 I can not see it 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.290
 By being patiently and carefully 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.470
 Beautifully in the whole area 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.130
 Because it will come 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.130
 No Kariya 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.820
 It came to an end on 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:51.200
 I would like to plant by solving the ai zard 2 Carver reports 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.200
 2, and the like rice 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.599
 Comes Santa panel 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.720
 Promising by what scene 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.660
 free 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:34.650
 After Hirota 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.650
 A lot of people who were in the beginning who would like to go to their favorite dreams anxious are just a few 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.470
 Say 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.030
 I wanted to do it 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.610
 th 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.610
 How about it for the first time 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.240
 For the time being we will trim next 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.330
 If I cut this before we 'll be there 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.169
 Is it hard to do? 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:51.090
 The person in the video that I referred to 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.090
 Because it was cut up after the forest 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.420
 Hmm 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.420
 I think I will put it 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 By say 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.810
 It became form somehow 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.980
 Most trimming and 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.980
 I cut it off 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.840
 Hair glass 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.840
 It was hard to get rid of 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.770
 By say 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.770
 Here you will 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.190
 For now for now 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.000
 The roots grow firmly 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.000
 So as not to go out 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:07.230
 I wish I could dare you from around me 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:14.060
 think 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:14.060
 We would like to in the future to see a growth process of this Heagurasu in that 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.350
 Then again 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.650
