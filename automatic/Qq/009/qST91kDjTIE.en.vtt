00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
so what ended up being was 18 millimeter

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.359 
so what ended up being was 18 millimeter
socket<00:01:19.850> big<00:01:20.850> hand<00:01:21.210> pitched<00:01:21.390> extension<00:01:22.369> bigger

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
fill plug out and letting the excess

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.230 
fill plug out and letting the excess
stuff<00:05:09.479> run<00:05:09.720> out<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.139> is<00:05:10.289> a<00:05:10.319> way<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:11.610> go<00:05:11.880> so
