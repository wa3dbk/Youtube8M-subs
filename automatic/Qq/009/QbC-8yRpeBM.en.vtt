00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.620
 hello friends friends 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.020
 now gladly doing it easy 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.230
 We will see how to maintain a 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.740
 gas heater and the precautions that 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.990
 we must have so that we do not 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.900
 explode burn our hair or burns 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.480
 very serious we continue the first thing that 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.270
 we have to do is recognize 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 This one does 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.060
 it gives us the opportunity to turn it on 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.890
 No problem to light the pilot and 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.550
 put the temperature that we want the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.370
 water is the regulator from the part d 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.680
 this is very important that they separate it if 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.739
 they do not repeat the video how many times is it in 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.140
 this part is when we need to oppress 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.589
 the left button to be undertaken 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 the pilot when we have that position 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.340
 is for the pilot the one on the right is 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.110
 for when it is closed and the one 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.830
 we have on the left towards the front 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.720
 is for us to turn on we are going to turn on 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.440
 now if the heater to issue 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.470
 first the button first and quickly to 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.680
 turn on the pylon 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.550
 see how the half flower is very 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.700
 small opens up a little bit bigger 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.840
 the top of the flave right now 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.270
 let's see how we are going to correct it 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.740
 see now how we are getting closer 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.890
 there to the yellow there is so much 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.130
 Flame thermos or a small gas leak 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.760
 which we must remove, look at you 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:01.000
 there in the photo as you can see the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.000
 approach there we have that tiny 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.780
 there it is in the arrow we are 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.569
 approaching in the photo and there is another 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.170
 arrow is to regulate the gas so that 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.220
 you see the flame more blue or more yellow 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.980
 Now look, they saw that garbage in there 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.880
 the one that is causing us the little 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.970
 gas leak as we are going to remove it with 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.020
 a small little wing we are going to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.440
 remove the land that we have there or the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.709
 obvious rust went out the pilot did not get 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.739
 worry because when it's leaking from 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.390
 pilot we are not going to have problems of a 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.880
 major fire is very little gas and will not 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.430
 spend more nothing more make sure to remove 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.040
 perfectly everything on earth everything 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.569
 that hinders us is a bit difficult 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.280
 with the camera put your hand in the light 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.550
 see how big are the microwaves 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.910
 if you can also with a brush 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.990
 these chiquititos without actually entering it 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.230
 we recommend but nothing else a blow 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.760
 and with that little wire, little by little, we're going to 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.670
 remove imperfections or garbage or 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.160
 in options that is like the average things 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.890
 rare sometimes and over the years we have to 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.870
 repair them 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.659
 Yes now 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.640
 you see that hole that right now we 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.450
 let's get closer that must be 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.390
 open because if not there if it comes when 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.129
 we sometimes have small explosions that 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.739
 there is going to be a little bit of gas out there 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.840
 when we lose it, see there, it's going to 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.790
 through the hole right now we are going to 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.640
 learn to see her as she catches all the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.560
 flare and the pilot has to leave 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.409
 there does look like left and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.379
 He makes the little boy that we put them 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.569
 a while ago there must be gas because 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.359
 if it does not come out then those are the 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.549
 explosions already turned it off we're going to 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.519
 learn it again so that they see 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.400
 you how should you turn on normally 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.449
 this type of heater see the flame 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.780
 it must be blue blue blue if there is no 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.479
 have to check the entrance to see that lid 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.610
 from above that is very important there 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.070
 we have when they are very old 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.560
 you have to change them because these 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.810
 they are oxidized and they get undone and 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.950
 then that's why it does not heat the water and it 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.890
 they miss them 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.640
 you really have to be very careful and 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.730
 you have to know how to change them we have finished 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.250
