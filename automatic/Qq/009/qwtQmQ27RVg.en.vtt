worse and that's stuck with me through
the<00:00:09.240> years<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:10.130> it<00:00:11.130> just<00:00:12.000> seems<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.540> really<00:00:12.929> get

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the years it it just seems to really get

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.049 
the years it it just seems to really get
into<00:00:13.380> my<00:00:13.530> head<00:00:13.559> because<00:00:14.009> naturally<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.790> think

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
into my head because naturally you think

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.790 
into my head because naturally you think
well<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.330> could<00:00:15.509> just<00:00:15.630> stay<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> same<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.500> as

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
well you could just stay the same but as

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.060 
well you could just stay the same but as
I've<00:00:17.460> grown<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.830> experienced<00:00:19.830> more

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
I've grown and and experienced more

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.490 
I've grown and and experienced more
challenges<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:20.939> life<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:22.140> kind<00:00:22.380> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
challenges in my life you you kind of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.140 
challenges in my life you you kind of
realize<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.340> you're<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.640> actively

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
realize that if you're not actively

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.029 
realize that if you're not actively
pursuing<00:00:24.570> getting<00:00:24.990> better<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.529> kind<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.859> do

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
pursuing getting better you kind of do

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.150 
pursuing getting better you kind of do
start<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> slip<00:00:26.580> backwards<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.330> not<00:00:27.539> really

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
start to slip backwards it's not really

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.589 
start to slip backwards it's not really
it's<00:00:29.160> not<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.369> an<00:00:29.699> even<00:00:29.970> spot<00:00:30.300> because

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it's not really an even spot because

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.380 
it's not really an even spot because
your<00:00:31.349> opportunities<00:00:31.980> start<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.430> move<00:00:32.910> forward

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
your opportunities start to move forward

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
your opportunities start to move forward
and<00:00:33.540> if<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:33.899> following<00:00:34.860> them<00:00:35.160> if

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and if you're not following them if

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.770 
and if you're not following them if
you're<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.520> chasing<00:00:35.820> those<00:00:36.090> forwards<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you're not chasing those forwards and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780 
you're not chasing those forwards and
then<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.800> kind<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.100> miss<00:00:38.309> those<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.700> you're

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
then you kind of miss those and you're

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.780 
then you kind of miss those and you're
farther<00:00:38.969> behind<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:40.399> that's<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.640> mentality

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
farther behind and that's the mentality

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.920 
farther behind and that's the mentality
that<00:00:42.210> I've<00:00:42.450> been<00:00:44.030> forced<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> revert<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that I've been forced to revert to I

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.680 
that I've been forced to revert to I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you understand the kind of effort that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.300 
you understand the kind of effort that
it<00:01:19.229> takes<00:01:19.259> when<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.680> give<00:01:19.890> something<00:01:20.159> you're

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
it takes when you give something you're

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
capable of producing and that's kind of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
capable of producing and that's kind of
what<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.460> last<00:01:23.729> week<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.720> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
what this last week is you really do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
what this last week is you really do
just<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> sell<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.159> through<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
just have to sell out and get through it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.980 
just have to sell out and get through it
but<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:28.130> always<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.759> tell<00:01:29.970> myself<00:01:30.119> every

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
but I always have to tell myself every

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.350 
but I always have to tell myself every
set<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.560> an<00:01:31.710> opportunity<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.520> improve<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.240> if

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
set is an opportunity to improve and if

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.210 
set is an opportunity to improve and if
you<00:01:33.450> don't<00:01:33.780> improve<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.619> set<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
you don't improve in that set then you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
you don't improve in that set then you
got<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> little<00:01:35.610> worse<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.329> improve

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
got a little worse if you don't improve

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.630 
got a little worse if you don't improve
during<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.500> set<00:01:37.799> you're<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.250> moving

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
during that set you're not moving

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480 
during that set you're not moving
forward<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.329> need<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.340> then<00:01:41.340> it's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
forward like you need to and then it's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700 
forward like you need to and then it's
pointless<00:01:41.820> why<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.780> through<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.200> pain<00:01:43.470> why

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pointless why go through this pain why

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.020 
pointless why go through this pain why
go<00:01:43.890> through<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.369> you're<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.579> actively

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
go through this if you're not actively

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.990 
go through this if you're not actively
trying<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.570> improve<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:47.340> mindset<00:01:47.729> has

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
trying to improve and that mindset has

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.030 
trying to improve and that mindset has
really<00:01:50.090> been<00:01:51.229> pulling<00:01:52.229> me<00:01:52.350> through<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
really been pulling me through this the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.609 
really been pulling me through this the
idea<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.790> can't<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.689> can't<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.290> let

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
idea that I can't just I can't just let

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
idea that I can't just I can't just let
it<00:01:55.770> happen<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.689> seek<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it happen I have to I have to seek the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.859 
it happen I have to I have to seek the
growth<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.950> seek<00:01:59.280> the<00:02:00.240> improvement

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
growth I have to seek the improvement

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.130 
growth I have to seek the improvement
and<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:03.299> does<00:02:03.659> carry<00:02:03.960> over

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and I think that really does carry over

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.719 
and I think that really does carry over
to<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.380> lot<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.740> different<00:02:04.770> aspects<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.670> your

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
to a lot of different aspects in your

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.340 
to a lot of different aspects in your
life<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.540> really<00:02:06.570> carries<00:02:07.079> over<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
life I think that really carries over to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.290 
life I think that really carries over to
anything<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.190> you're<00:02:08.399> pursuing<00:02:08.879> you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
anything that you're pursuing you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.070 
anything that you're pursuing you
to<00:02:09.510> try<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:10.080> better<00:02:10.320> at<00:02:12.080> every

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
to try to get better at every

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.720 
to try to get better at every
opportunity<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.710> have<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.520> try<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
opportunity you have you have to try to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.310 
opportunity you have you have to try to
improve<00:02:15.060> I've<00:02:15.300> been<00:02:15.420> noticing<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
improve I've been noticing that the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.930 
improve I've been noticing that the
musical<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.430> I'm<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:17.790> now

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
musical that I'm that I'm in right now

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000 
musical that I'm that I'm in right now
you<00:02:18.120> can't<00:02:18.540> really<00:02:18.720> be<00:02:18.930> complacent<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.710> every

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
you can't really be complacent and every

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.140 
you can't really be complacent and every

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
single night that we're doing run

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.450 
single night that we're doing run
throughs<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.660> have<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.110> try<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.130> be<00:02:23.280> better

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
throughs you have to try to be better

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.280

than the night before or else you're
further<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.920> further<00:02:26.040> behind<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:27.590> noticed

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
further and further behind I noticed

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.760 
further and further behind I noticed
that<00:02:29.060> just<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> idea<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
that just the idea that that you have to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.160 
that just the idea that that you have to
pursue<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.370> positive<00:02:32.820> change<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.480> things<00:02:33.870> if

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
pursue the positive change in things if

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.510 
pursue the positive change in things if
you're<00:02:34.320> not<00:02:34.440> happy<00:02:34.740> with<00:02:34.890> something<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.490> you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
you're not happy with something if you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.090 
you're not happy with something if you
an<00:02:36.210> example<00:02:36.990> would<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.260> I'm<00:02:37.440> not<00:02:37.470> very<00:02:37.830> happy

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
an example would be I'm not very happy

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.160 
an example would be I'm not very happy
with<00:02:38.310> my<00:02:38.430> squat<00:02:38.880> it's<00:02:39.390> getting<00:02:39.750> much<00:02:39.960> much

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
with my squat it's getting much much

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.260 
with my squat it's getting much much
better<00:02:40.440> than<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.190> started<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:41.820> I'm<00:02:41.910> still<00:02:42.240> not

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
better than I started but I'm still not

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.670 
better than I started but I'm still not
happy<00:02:43.040> about<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:45.200> want<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.410> continue

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
happy about it and I want to continue

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.620 
happy about it and I want to continue
improving<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.880> have<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.270> make<00:02:48.300> that

improving it and so I have to make that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.870 
improving it and so I have to make that
conscious<00:02:48.840> effort<00:02:49.260> every<00:02:49.560> single<00:02:49.860> time<00:02:50.070> to

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
conscious effort every single time to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.270 
conscious effort every single time to
keep<00:02:51.090> improving<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.840> see<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.050> did<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
keep improving it you see I did the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.400 
keep improving it you see I did the
first<00:02:53.310> two<00:02:53.730> sets<00:02:53.940> were<00:02:54.150> okay<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.690> third<00:02:54.900> set<00:02:55.200> I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
first two sets were okay the third set I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.530 
first two sets were okay the third set I
cut<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.860> depth<00:02:56.070> on<00:02:56.280> one<00:02:56.850> or<00:02:56.970> two<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.300> reps

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540

cut the depth on one or two of the reps
and<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.810> wasn't<00:02:58.110> happy<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:58.740> i<00:02:58.770> told<00:02:59.070> myself

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
the conscious effort to improve it and

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.960 
the conscious effort to improve it and
at<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.530> end<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.709> my<00:03:19.800> last<00:03:19.950> video<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.670> talked

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
at the end of my last video I talked

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.150 
at the end of my last video I talked
about<00:03:21.680> labeling<00:03:22.680> my<00:03:22.830> subscriber<00:03:23.280> base<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.880> I

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
about labeling my subscriber base and I

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.680 
about labeling my subscriber base and I
guess<00:03:26.160> giving<00:03:26.520> giving<00:03:26.850> people<00:03:27.270> something<00:03:27.540> to

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
guess giving giving people something to

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.479 
guess giving giving people something to
be<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> part<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.830> think<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.370> was<00:03:29.430> a

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
be a part of and I think that it was a

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.920 
be a part of and I think that it was a
little<00:03:29.700> bit<00:03:31.640> was<00:03:32.640> misunderstood<00:03:33.300> slightly

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
little bit was misunderstood slightly

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.600 
little bit was misunderstood slightly
and<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.410> believe<00:03:34.680> part<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.220> was<00:03:35.430> my

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
and I believe part of that was my

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.430 
and I believe part of that was my
failure<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.239> articulate<00:03:36.780> what<00:03:36.810> my<00:03:37.050> goal<00:03:37.230> was

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
failure to articulate what my goal was

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.930 
failure to articulate what my goal was
the<00:03:38.750> purpose<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.080> idea<00:03:40.290> wasn't<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.459> find

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
don't want it to be so that we can go

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.210 
don't want it to be so that we can go
around<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.910> have<00:04:03.840> rivalries<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.920> have

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
around and have rivalries and have

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.080 
around and have rivalries and have
people<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:07.560> use<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.310> group<00:04:08.760> as<00:04:09.030> a

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
people that that use that group as a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.030 
people that that use that group as a
back<00:04:09.450> dropping<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:10.019> say<00:04:10.200> negative<00:04:10.620> things<00:04:10.650> or

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
back dropping to say negative things or

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.449 
back dropping to say negative things or
spread<00:04:11.930> any<00:04:12.930> kind<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.320> negativity<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.040> idea

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
spread any kind of negativity the idea

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.510 
spread any kind of negativity the idea
that<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:14.790> was<00:04:14.970> hoping<00:04:15.600> for<00:04:15.890> would<00:04:16.890> be<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.220> come

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
that I was hoping for would be to come

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.640 
that I was hoping for would be to come
up<00:04:17.700> with<00:04:17.910> something

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
up with something

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.189 
up with something
that<00:04:19.489> would<00:04:19.609> be<00:04:19.699> an<00:04:19.820> inclusive<00:04:20.090> group<00:04:20.840> that

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
that would be an inclusive group that

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.710 
that would be an inclusive group that
people<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.799> all<00:04:22.160> be<00:04:22.639> a<00:04:22.669> part<00:04:22.970> of<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:23.690> I

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
people can all be a part of and so I

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.439 
people can all be a part of and so I
think<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.199> best<00:04:24.440> way<00:04:24.530> for<00:04:24.860> me<00:04:24.889> to<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:26.300> really

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
think the best way for me to to really

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.260 
think the best way for me to to really
articulate<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:27.289> is<00:04:27.699> instead<00:04:28.699> of<00:04:28.850> labeling

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
articulate that is instead of labeling

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.909 
articulate that is instead of labeling
my<00:04:29.419> subscriber<00:04:29.900> base<00:04:30.169> instead<00:04:30.530> of<00:04:30.590> giving

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
my subscriber base instead of giving

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.620 
my subscriber base instead of giving
people<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.250> name<00:04:31.460> although<00:04:31.729> I<00:04:31.970> was<00:04:32.330> laughing

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
people a name although I was laughing

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.210 
people a name although I was laughing
pretty<00:04:32.960> hard<00:04:33.050> at<00:04:33.380> many<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.860> names<00:04:34.039> that

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
pretty hard at many of the names that

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.710 
pretty hard at many of the names that
were<00:04:34.430> suggested<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:36.370> think<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.520> better<00:04:38.419> option

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
were suggested I think the better option

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.920 
were suggested I think the better option
for<00:04:38.990> that<00:04:39.320> would<00:04:39.740> be<00:04:39.919> to<00:04:40.160> just<00:04:40.570> find<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.720> way<00:04:41.870> to

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
for that would be to just find a way to

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.540 
for that would be to just find a way to
identify<00:04:42.880> what<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.690> journey<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.979> for<00:04:46.400> me

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
identify what this journey is and for me

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.640 
identify what this journey is and for me
I've<00:04:46.880> always<00:04:47.210> thought<00:04:47.539> of<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:47.780> as<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.020> grind

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
I've always thought of it as the grind

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.939 
I've always thought of it as the grind
because<00:04:48.949> my<00:04:49.610> biggest<00:04:50.180> my<00:04:51.110> biggest<00:04:51.590> thing<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
because my biggest my biggest thing the

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.170 
because my biggest my biggest thing the
biggest<00:04:52.220> point<00:04:52.430> that<00:04:52.580> I<00:04:52.610> always<00:04:52.850> try<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.090> make

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
biggest point that I always try to make

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.670 
biggest point that I always try to make
is<00:04:53.600> that<00:04:53.840> your<00:04:55.000> your<00:04:56.000> consistency<00:04:56.750> patience

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
is that your your consistency patience

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.700 
is that your your consistency patience
and<00:04:57.770> perseverance<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:58.639> going<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:59.030> equal<00:04:59.710> the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
and perseverance is going to equal the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.409 
and perseverance is going to equal the
greatest<00:05:01.070> success<00:05:01.460> if<00:05:01.699> you<00:05:01.789> keep<00:05:02.060> moving

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
greatest success if you keep moving

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.000 
greatest success if you keep moving
forward<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:02.960> keep<00:05:03.169> trying<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.650> improve

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
forward and you keep trying to improve

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.560 
forward and you keep trying to improve
over<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.370> long<00:05:04.639> period<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:05.090> time<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.479> will

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
over a long period of time you will

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.870 
over a long period of time you will
eventually<00:05:05.810> get<00:05:06.199> better<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.740> so<00:05:07.520> I've

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
eventually get better and so I've

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.850 
eventually get better and so I've
decided<00:05:08.210> that<00:05:08.630> I'm<00:05:08.810> going<00:05:09.020> to<00:05:09.260> call<00:05:09.500> my

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
journey this is this is the grind and

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.240 
journey this is this is the grind and
it's<00:05:14.030> something<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.510> everyone<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.830> welcome

it's something that everyone is welcome

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.770 
it's something that everyone is welcome
to<00:05:16.400> and<00:05:16.550> you<00:05:16.610> may<00:05:16.729> find<00:05:16.970> that<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.180> little<00:05:17.389> corny

you may find that a little well it's
just<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.639> name<00:05:19.789> but<00:05:20.210> if<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:20.870> have<00:05:21.110> an

positive community I feel like the
YouTube<00:05:27.560> fitness<00:05:27.889> community<00:05:28.070> is<00:05:28.370> not<00:05:28.550> where<00:05:28.760> I

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
YouTube fitness community is not where I

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.839 
YouTube fitness community is not where I
personally<00:05:29.960> would<00:05:30.139> like<00:05:30.260> it<00:05:30.440> to<00:05:30.530> be<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:30.949> that

personally would like it to be and that

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.540 
personally would like it to be and that
may<00:05:31.970> make<00:05:32.150> me<00:05:32.330> an<00:05:32.419> idealist<00:05:32.960> but<00:05:33.370> I<00:05:34.370> would

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
may make me an idealist but I would
