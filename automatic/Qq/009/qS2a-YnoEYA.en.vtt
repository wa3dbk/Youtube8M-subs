definitely beautiful it is a little bit
long<00:02:41.000> on<00:02:41.270> me<00:02:41.540> because<00:02:41.900> I'm<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:42.290> petite<00:02:42.890> so

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
long on me because I'm really petite so

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.650 
long on me because I'm really petite so
that<00:02:43.280> means<00:02:43.460> that<00:02:43.520> I'm<00:02:43.670> short<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.540> have

that means that I'm short and I have
short<00:02:44.930> arms<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.620> that's<00:02:46.280> why<00:02:46.520> it's<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> little

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
short arms so that's why it's a little

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.280 
short arms so that's why it's a little

lighting<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.510> means<00:03:08.810> then<00:03:08.990> you<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.500> to

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
lighting so that means then you have to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.500 
lighting so that means then you have to
make<00:03:09.800> sure<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.220> wear<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.790> extra<00:03:11.330> lining

is really true to size and I get this in
the<00:03:32.000> size<00:03:32.030> too<00:03:32.420> large

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
the size too large

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.450 
the size too large
