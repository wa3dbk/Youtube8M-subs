00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
the the crooked spire and that's why we

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.160

Bristol City was a particularly good
game<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.860> thought<00:00:44.130> initially<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.850> want<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
game I thought initially you want the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
then get something from your league you

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.040 
then get something from your league you
think<00:00:50.250> hold<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.700> could<00:00:50.910> regress<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> bit

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
think hold on we could regress a bit

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
think hold on we could regress a bit
further<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.890> wouldn't<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.250> game<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
further we wouldn't that game and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.590 
further we wouldn't that game and
eagerly<00:00:54.660> awaited<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> fourth<00:00:56.730> round<00:00:56.969> then

believe<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.560> quite<00:02:13.740> honest<00:02:14.100> when<00:02:14.340> when

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
believe it to be quite honest when when

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.760 
believe it to be quite honest when when
the<00:02:14.700> job<00:02:14.910> came<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.720> we've<00:02:15.870> got<00:02:15.900> Wrexham

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
