having<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.200> few<00:01:16.439> minutes<00:01:16.530> outside<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
having it a few minutes outside of the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.899 
having it a few minutes outside of the
box<00:01:17.850> look<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> fingerprints<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.049> there

box look at the fingerprints on there

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.399 
box look at the fingerprints on there
and<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.000> give<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.360> case<00:01:21.630> probably<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.110> couple

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and I give this case probably a couple

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
and I give this case probably a couple
weeks<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.830> it'll<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.100> scratched<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.909> you're

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
weeks and it'll be scratched if you're

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.130 
weeks and it'll be scratched if you're
putting<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.900> your<00:01:25.020> pocket

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and you know what this case is is a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.539 
and you know what this case is is a
two-piece<00:01:29.820> case<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> TPU<00:01:35.159> rubber

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
two-piece case you get a TPU rubber

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.090 
two-piece case you get a TPU rubber
inner<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.979> won't<00:01:38.159> stretch<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:39.509> good

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
inner that won't stretch so that's good

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.770 
inner that won't stretch so that's good
it's<00:01:41.100> good<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.490> shock<00:01:41.729> absorption<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.540> well<00:01:42.750> I

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it's good for shock absorption as well I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.380 
it's good for shock absorption as well I
guess<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:44.070> here's<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> inside<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.329> the
