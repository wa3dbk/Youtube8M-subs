this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:00.960> typical<00:00:01.230> tryout<00:00:01.650> day<00:00:01.890> and<00:00:02.129> that

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
this is the typical tryout day and that

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.480 
this is the typical tryout day and that
starts<00:00:03.060> with<00:00:03.149> throwing<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.080> balls<00:00:04.980> around

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
starts with throwing the balls around

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.880 
starts with throwing the balls around
getting<00:00:05.879> warmed<00:00:06.299> up<00:00:06.390> put<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.290> on<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> orange

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
getting warmed up put it on the orange

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.700 
getting warmed up put it on the orange
jerseys<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.179> numbers<00:00:09.540> help<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
jerseys and the numbers help the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.509 
jerseys and the numbers help the
managers<00:00:11.190> identify<00:00:11.340> each<00:00:11.910> player<00:00:12.210> and

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
managers identify each player and

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.320 
managers identify each player and
typically<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.759> players<00:00:15.230> get<00:00:16.230> their<00:00:16.500> caps<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
typically the players get their caps and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.320 
typically the players get their caps and
take<00:00:18.330> their<00:00:18.480> first<00:00:18.630> positions<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> first

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
take their first positions in the first

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.950 
take their first positions in the first
position<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.560> catching<00:00:22.560> flyballs<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> three

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
position is catching flyballs so three

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.080 
position is catching flyballs so three
pitching<00:00:25.289> machines<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.769> typically<00:00:26.070> used<00:00:26.340> one

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
pitching machines are typically used one

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
pitching machines are typically used one
pitching<00:00:27.449> machine<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> dedicated<00:00:28.439> just<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
pitching machine is dedicated just to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.370 
pitching machine is dedicated just to
fly<00:00:28.920> balls<00:00:29.269> see<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.660> being<00:00:30.810> used<00:00:30.990> right<00:00:31.230> now

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
fly balls see it's being used right now

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.990 
fly balls see it's being used right now
to<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> left<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> pitching

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
to the left of that is a pitching

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.840 
to the left of that is a pitching
machine<00:00:33.030> that's<00:00:33.450> used<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:33.750> ground<00:00:34.079> balls<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
machine that's used for ground balls and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.040 
machine that's used for ground balls and
then<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.270> pitching<00:00:36.570> machine<00:00:36.690> that's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
then we have the pitching machine that's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.360 
then we have the pitching machine that's
used<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.380> pitching<00:00:42.890> probably<00:00:43.890> make<00:00:44.010> sense<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
used for pitching probably make sense to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
used for pitching probably make sense to
have<00:00:44.489> two<00:00:44.730> people<00:00:44.910> doing<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.840> kind

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
have two people doing this one to kind

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.479 
have two people doing this one to kind
of<00:00:46.140> direct<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> players<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.129> then<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
of direct the players and then one to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.910 
of direct the players and then one to
actually<00:00:47.640> deliver<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> balls<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:49.890> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
actually deliver the balls so at a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.740 
actually deliver the balls so at a
minimum<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.480> good<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
minimum it would be really be good to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
minimum it would be really be good to
have<00:00:51.870> three<00:00:52.110> people<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.590> here<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.670> in

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
have three people out here one out in

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.770 
have three people out here one out in
the<00:00:53.850> outfield<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:55.260> manage<00:00:55.920> things<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.370> there

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
the outfield to manage things out there

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
the outfield to manage things out there
one<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.379> manage<00:00:58.649> things<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.160> then

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
one back here to manage things and then

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.700 
one back here to manage things and then
one<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.579> actually<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.899> balls<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.410> the

one to actually put balls in the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.210 
one to actually put balls in the
pitching<00:01:02.550> machine

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.670 

so<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.910> have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.390> first<00:01:07.050> baseman<00:01:07.700> we<00:01:08.700> set<00:01:08.910> up<00:01:08.940> the

procedure of throwing the ball into

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.979 
procedure of throwing the ball into
short<00:02:28.280> short<00:02:29.450> bursts<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:31.130> she<00:02:32.130> lines<00:02:32.459> up<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
short short bursts a she lines up to the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.390 
left of the cone has to run to her right
and<00:02:39.570> then<00:02:40.760> throws<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.690> second<00:02:43.400> who's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
and then throws it in to second who's

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
last ball she comes up to the count so

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.840 
last ball she comes up to the count so
this<00:02:51.870> ball<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.170> gonna<00:02:52.290> be<00:02:52.470> hit<00:02:52.590> over<00:02:52.620> at<00:02:53.130> and

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.890 
outfield
then<00:03:14.730> they'll<00:03:14.910> rotate<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.890> person<00:03:17.340> from<00:03:17.520> the

then they'll rotate the person from the
left<00:03:18.900> field<00:03:19.140> will<00:03:19.650> come<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:21.680> we'll<00:03:22.970> grab<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
left field will come in we'll grab the

left field will come in we'll grab the
backup<00:03:24.660> catcher's<00:03:25.140> mask<00:03:25.460> and<00:03:26.480> become<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
backup catcher's mask and become the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.620 
backup catcher's mask and become the
backup<00:03:27.930> catcher<00:03:28.550> that<00:03:29.550> formerly<00:03:30.000> backup

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
backup catcher that formerly backup

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.290 
backup catcher that formerly backup
catcher<00:03:30.840> becomes<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> new<00:03:31.530> catcher<00:03:33.290> and

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
catcher becomes the new catcher and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.550 
catcher becomes the new catcher and
there's<00:03:36.300> just<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.630> rotation<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.350> catcher

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
there's just a rotation so the catcher

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.270 
there's just a rotation so the catcher
goes<00:03:37.830> first<00:03:38.130> first<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.210> second<00:03:39.600> second<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.930> short

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
goes first first a second second a short

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.730 
goes first first a second second a short
short<00:03:41.280> out<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.910> backup<00:03:42.600> left<00:03:42.990> fielder<00:03:43.380> and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
short out to backup left fielder and

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:51.990 
short out to backup left fielder and
then<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.940> left<00:03:45.180> fielder<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.590> that's<00:03:46.800> it

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.210 

so<00:03:52.780> now<00:03:52.930> we're<00:03:53.560> going<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.010> do<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:56.220> grounders
