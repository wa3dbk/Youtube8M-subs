00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
see it's got a shock effect to it this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.030 
see it's got a shock effect to it this
is<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.270> ok<00:00:36.270> come<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:37.910> genius<00:00:39.829> it's<00:00:40.829> got<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
shock effect to it and it also reduces

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.580 
shock effect to it and it also reduces
enemies<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.850> ash<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> downside<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
enemies to ash so that's a downside to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.790 
enemies to ash so that's a downside to
it<00:00:46.860> because<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.340> can't<00:00:47.370> refight<00:00:48.090> them<00:00:48.800> let's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
it because you can't refight them let's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
it because you can't refight them let's
save<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> wasteland<00:00:50.430> ur<00:00:50.579> cool<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> does

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
save the wasteland ur cool but it does

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
save the wasteland ur cool but it does
about<00:00:53.820> 40<00:00:54.660> damage<00:00:55.100> but<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.960> mail<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.170> stat<00:00:58.590> is

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
about 40 damage but my mail a stat is

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.830 
about 40 damage but my mail a stat is
really<00:00:59.160> low<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.789> i<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:00.510> probably<00:01:01.140> ballpark

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
really low so i would probably ballpark

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.250 
really low so i would probably ballpark
50<00:01:03.840> damage<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.830> per<00:01:05.580> strike<00:01:06.170> we're<00:01:07.170> gonna

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
50 damage or so per strike we're gonna

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.160 
50 damage or so per strike we're gonna
kind<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.830> tend<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.729> hear

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.230 

can<00:01:14.170> we<00:01:14.260> get<00:01:14.410> for<00:01:14.740> strikes<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.430> bats<00:01:15.730> with<00:01:15.970> it

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
can we get for strikes and bats with it

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.590 
can we get for strikes and bats with it

look bad in the video right as you can
see<00:01:40.630> I'm<00:01:40.750> hacking<00:01:41.020> away<00:01:41.230> at<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.560> definitely

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
see I'm hacking away at it definitely

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.150 
see I'm hacking away at it definitely
not<00:01:42.670> quite<00:01:43.060> as<00:01:43.180> good<00:01:43.390> damage<00:01:43.870> wise<00:01:44.170> but<00:01:45.040> it

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
not quite as good damage wise but it

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.740 
not quite as good damage wise but it
doesn't<00:01:45.490> have<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:45.910> also<00:01:46.180> doesn't<00:01:46.450> have<00:01:46.540> the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
doesn't have it also doesn't have the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.930 
doesn't have it also doesn't have the
shock<00:01:47.050> effect<00:01:47.290> which<00:01:47.830> doesn't<00:01:48.280> reduce<00:01:48.370> people

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
shock effect which doesn't reduce people

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:59.820 
shock effect which doesn't reduce people
to<00:01:48.970> hack<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.770> good<00:01:51.100> thing<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.520> guess<00:01:58.830> if

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
to hack which is a good thing I guess if

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.850 
to hack which is a good thing I guess if
I<00:02:00.070> had<00:02:00.100> all<00:02:00.550> my<00:02:00.690> AP<00:02:01.690> my<00:02:02.020> action<00:02:02.380> points<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:02.800> would

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
I had all my AP my action points I would

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.370 
I had all my AP my action points I would
be<00:02:03.040> able<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.280> pull<00:02:03.460> off<00:02:03.490> six<00:02:03.910> hits<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.330> vats<00:02:04.600> my

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
be able to pull off six hits and vats my

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.780 
be able to pull off six hits and vats my
don'ts<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:08.410> does<00:02:08.830> no<00:02:09.399> damage<00:02:09.670> there<00:02:10.450> we<00:02:10.660> go

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
don'ts and it does no damage there we go

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.590 
don'ts and it does no damage there we go
alright<00:02:12.790> my<00:02:13.660> evaluation<00:02:14.620> would<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:16.300> shock

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
alright my evaluation would be the shock

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.400 
alright my evaluation would be the shock
sword<00:02:16.989> wins<00:02:17.880> unfortunately<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:18.910> guess<00:02:19.410> just

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
sword wins unfortunately I guess just

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.650 
sword wins unfortunately I guess just
the<00:02:20.620> fact<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:21.250> more<00:02:21.520> damage<00:02:22.060> per

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the fact that it's more damage per

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.660 
the fact that it's more damage per
strike<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.560> they're<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.160> fast<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:26.670> sorry
