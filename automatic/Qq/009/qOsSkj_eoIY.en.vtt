series<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:17.130> think<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> rivalry<00:00:18.300> between<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
series I think the rivalry between the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.230 
series I think the rivalry between the
two<00:00:18.720> countries<00:00:19.050> now<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.760> excellent<00:00:20.760> very

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
two countries now is excellent very

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
turbulent times in previous years and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.429 
turbulent times in previous years and
series<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.660> everyone's<00:00:28.170> come<00:00:28.410> out

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
series but I think everyone's come out

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.769 
series but I think everyone's come out
the<00:00:28.710> other<00:00:28.800> side<00:00:29.269> respecting<00:00:30.269> each<00:00:30.359> other<00:00:30.630> as

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the other side respecting each other as

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.290 
the other side respecting each other as
cricket<00:00:31.109> playing<00:00:31.349> nations<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.300> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
cricket playing nations and and and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
cricket playing nations and and and
often<00:00:33.630> when<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> respect<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.950> high<00:00:35.219> that

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
often when the respect is so high that

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.190 
often when the respect is so high that
leads<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> really<00:00:36.360> aggressive<00:00:36.630> cricket

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
leads to a really aggressive cricket

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.889 
leads to a really aggressive cricket
because<00:00:37.890> each<00:00:38.520> opponent<00:00:38.879> fears<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.750> other

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
because each opponent fears the other

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.380 
because each opponent fears the other
opponent<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.760> knowing<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:41.879> skillful

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
opponent out of knowing how skillful

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.610 
opponent out of knowing how skillful
they<00:00:42.510> are<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.530> be

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
they are so that that's going to be

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.549 
they are so that that's going to be
exciting<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.190> watch<00:00:45.260> there's<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.530> of

every time he scores a run he sets a new

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.590 
every time he scores a run he sets a new
record<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:49.670> it's<00:01:50.670> inevitable<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.420> will

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
