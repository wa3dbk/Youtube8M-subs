00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and of course that does fascinate any

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.890 
and of course that does fascinate any
novelist<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:29.310> other<00:02:29.489> benefit<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
novelist and the other benefit of a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.660 
novelist and the other benefit of a
novelist<00:02:31.379> for<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.620> First<00:02:31.830> World<00:02:32.040> War<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.370> the

novelist for the First World War and the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.690 
novelist for the First World War and the
second<00:02:33.060> herb<00:02:33.209> or<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.530> entire<00:02:35.340> nation

second herb or is that the entire nation

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.780 
second herb or is that the entire nation
is<00:02:36.180> being<00:02:36.510> disrupted<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.040> individual

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
is being disrupted so the individual

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.289 
is being disrupted so the individual
characters<00:02:39.360> choices<00:02:40.019> are<00:02:40.459> his<00:02:41.459> or<00:02:41.700> her<00:02:41.940> own

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
characters choices are his or her own

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.199 
characters choices are his or her own
but<00:02:43.019> they<00:02:43.200> are<00:02:43.319> also<00:02:43.489> related<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.760> this

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
but they are also related to this

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.870 
but they are also related to this
appalling<00:02:45.630> catastrophe<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.190> overtaking

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
appalling catastrophe that is overtaking

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.259 
appalling catastrophe that is overtaking
their<00:02:48.060> society<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.860> think<00:02:50.549> it's<00:02:50.819> very

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
their society and I think it's very

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.330 
their society and I think it's very
difficult<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:52.440> capture<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.280> a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
difficult to capture that in a

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.370 
difficult to capture that in a
contemporary<00:02:53.730> novel<00:02:54.329> because<00:02:54.750> most<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
contemporary novel because most of the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.009 
contemporary novel because most of the
time<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:56.130> live<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.459> little<00:02:56.730> capsules<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.870> know
