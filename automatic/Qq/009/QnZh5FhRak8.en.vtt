00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 our series of sheds today is with the 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.429
 nicole flower kiss 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.029
 We also talk about 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.130
 technological evolution I think this 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.750
 demand a certain visual language 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.849
 different from the hummingbird is different from 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.250
 other years as it is for you to bring 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.170
 design more daring but without losing the luxury 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.809
 what is the characteristic of school 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.329
 plot it goes of the luxury 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.699
 in this logical seat of the hummingbird that the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.159
 beginning of the whole story only by china 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.000
 example is the intention of the paper 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:49.879
 the top shouse nee and ends with high tech 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.550
 with the evolution of communication with 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.960
 led computer social networks 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.719
 today I think she will start more 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.210
 dark stronger in colors will brighten 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.170
 How is day to daylight? You'll see a kiss. 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.990
 Less feathered flower we do not use 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.100
 as in the carnival there is a lot of 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.190
 marchetti 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.830
 I believed the boys who created it, huh? 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.990
 who here why the team that designed 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.330
 another that creates exactly what goes 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.599
 do on top of what was drawn 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.149
 I have a very good team there for that. 

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:29.599
 I think we're in the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.670
 Right path chu I I never had 

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:35.239
 so confident in a great parade 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.080
 I never had that conviction that goes 

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:38.080
 to pack everything 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.719
 the band 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.030
 the gold 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.649
 the brigade 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.270
 you commented that if all the ideas that 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.159
 You were arguing, it's sincere. 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.009
 will revolutionize the allegories question 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.890
 be sure to let her talk to you 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.990
 Do you want to revolutionize within the 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.369
 society of our possibilities 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.390
 inside what we do not think 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.690
 My allegory is very closed, right? 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.700
 with a lot of information is already and reason 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.860
 people have lost some points 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.620
 the jury's claim that it was information 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.750
 Too bad, when you try 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.470
 it is culture as the team of the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.250
 school calls culture never is she 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.940
 too much 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.400
 but he understands understands him this way 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.470
 I believe that in recent years it is not the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.549
 of our entire era. 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.860
 commission 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:41.330
 They have not allegories are based 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.040
 it's not with another proposal it 's all those 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.269
 kallas proposals are completely 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.549
 different from those that the hummingbird 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.060
 Come and do it for us, the scene with 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.940
 time but we think we found the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.900
 Commission that calls the correct way 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.120
 it freezes it exactly explained 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.920
 content of the plot by the passages that the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.690
 people talk title designed 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.760
 For me, I'm glad I really do. 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.299
 that the new law has already been 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.299
 allegories 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.890
 ae 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.630
 the school received some criticism for 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.130
 account of our samba money and 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.500
 the first time the hummingbird is 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.780
 publicly defended 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.730
 to clarify everything because this time 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.550
 You voted to do this since in 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.890
 other years there were also critics on the river 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.380
 and brasÃ­lia the mangalarga horse itself and 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.580
 the schools remained quiet and now she 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.480
 decided to stand 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.420
 I think it was already a how people stayed 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.770
 very quiet in these always taking everything 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.220
 I think I have accumulated 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.230
 I am also supportive in knowing what the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.600
 People liked it and samba is good for us. 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.600
 For the community, we believe that 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.520
 do 11 thanks to your kids samba pra 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.860
 parade of the hummingbird for the community 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.350
 of the hummingbird and lace also think it is 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.370
 wonderful a great homage 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.750
 homage that opens a fan for you 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.150
 talk about a very good story that 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.090
 human communication since the times 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.690
 schools until the future the school is 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.730
 united, wanting and suddenly 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.330
 these criticisms we had with 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.970
 the samba is serving exactly 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.310
 to encourage the component that 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.530
 world thinks the guys who are in the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.880
 criticizing is wrong so I think 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.070
 on the right path 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.260
 I think the kissing flower will ride in the 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.210
 avenue a great spectacle 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.820
 You think I'm not much of a 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.050
 show because I'm afraid of 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.720
 massacre the samba school that the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.169
 shows that are proposing too much 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.570
 I think I try to unite I do not think 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.229
 show at school calls at school 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.680
 he called that reason of the people the 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.540
 head of the musical that allows you to 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.160
 have a great play because it does not 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.410
 great opera a big difference in the 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.520
 avenue we always there to our 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.660
 creation 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.169
 so that the flame is there exactly there 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.470
 there is 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.320
 the dynamism of following up on what 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.890
 the people we ask for are exactly 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.490
 within the horizon 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.490
 under the skin 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.250
 the chassis here a message for your 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.110
 community you want loulean grew up 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.970
 in the hummingbird practically that can 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.660
 take the hummingbird in this carnival 2014 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.910
 I'm already happy, I'm happy. 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.560
 really communicating with the public 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.169
 was very happy with what is 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.199
 happened that the school bought the 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.870
 noise along with me in relation to 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.419
 these criticisms is that they did not have 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.840
 we were not deserving and we are in the 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:02.210
 right path and let's always think 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.210
 that we will take this title to pull
