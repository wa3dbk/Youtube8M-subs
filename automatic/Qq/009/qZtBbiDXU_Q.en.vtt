00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.670
 Many job and I always hurt a lot 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.259
 that I'm in the film comedy because other 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.150
 he is not too bad for anything though 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.190
 He is such a very good actor 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.619

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.619

 out 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.980
 I do not understand that one does not really 30 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 and that's still scary 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.900
 but this is already alive 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.360

 ted is from the year 2012 a good 106 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.470
 minutes tells the story of 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.810
 little boy john bennett january 1985 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.489
 Simple small settlements live and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.110
 with one of these boys is always 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.700
 Teased is done and done 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.140
 not have a single friend 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.120
 That's why he wants to be around 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.439
 It's a teddy the Christmas time 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.720
 you may get your gift 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.549
 best friend could be forever and 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.459
 what is stronger than the wish of one 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.780
 toddler and so is this 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.180
 actually alive and they would be best 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.650
 friends forever under both damn 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.170
 much fear of lightning and thunder hamm 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.790
 so-called thunder buddies of the time jump 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.859
 many many years later meanwhile that 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.599
 already 35 years old and teddy is called 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.099
 with elli but ted and actually 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.900
 spend most of their time with drugs 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.150
 to consume for smoking and women 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.859
 but to look at is john now in 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.530
 a great relationship with nobody 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.269
 less than mila kunis de this role 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.159
 fills in and then we have one here 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.040
 Comedy about the story of two 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.299
 best friends the relationships 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.680
 is put to the test because he 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.269
 one of them likes to 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.730
 wants to grow up and so on 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.049
 I have to look for a job someday 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.220
 then you do not know what the movie 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.840
 I have a story to tell 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.650
 If you want the trailer sees it 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.109
 I do not want that either 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.030
 anticipate but great fun 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.739
 Ted is not true if I'm honest 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.389
 less than the best comedy of the year 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.459
 for me that is partly because of it 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.359
 that merck fall here both direct 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.889
 leads as well as the script 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.900
 inventor of family has co-authored 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.940
 guy and the man with the vulgar plump 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.489
 and yet somehow intelligent humor 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.229
 and you can tell by ted unbelievable 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.359
 strong because very many of the individual 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.799
 Scenes are something of original and under 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.959
 the waistline but somehow always 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.609
 still totally funny not so stupid as 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.079
 it makes some other movies wrong and 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.389
 marco maiberger mila kunis are themselves 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.639
 not too bad, for example, too 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.979
 the prostitution of a prostitute vom 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.539
 to clear the floor and that is it 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.710
 not even in Hollywood 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.940
 everyday business and doing so 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.770
 especially fun 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.810
 if you have so much self-irony to the day 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.490
 is placed and when it is ready something 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.169
 to turn very very special 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.490
 funny the scene tried in fact 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.020
 to get a job and the reason 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.970
 why he set in the supermarket 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.620
 i should just have me 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.000
 laughed the film will make the 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.550
 original of course much more 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.680
 fun because the gags are watching comedy im 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.900
 again ignite completely different in the o-tone 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.520
 so should be in English 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.200
 otherwise we have next to mark 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.970
 Wahlberg and Mila Kunis in the lead role 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.460
 a wonderfully funny career of 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.500
 Ryan Reynolds the original main actor 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.180
 from flash gordon as well as norah jones 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.220
 you are attracted by leather 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.570
 little interesting things that 106th 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.160
 minutes to fill the film 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.930
 could have done better then maybe 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.040
 a little action to end the rausnimmt 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.180
 a little time and you would have 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.830
 maybe eight or ten minutes 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.180
 less to the film packed at the 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.980
 best even better 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.600
 okay as already mentioned 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.070
 We now evaluate Tab is the best 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.200
 comedy of the year what has one too 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.120
 little is that this year not 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.920
 just the movie of the funny films was 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.690
 but rather the involuntarily funny 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.580
 but then these are not comedies and 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.680
 that's why it comes from me an absolute 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.480
 top values ​​but not quite the best 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.850
 I have seen better comedies 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.980
 and that makes me a comedy 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.050
 within 10 possible points and 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.970
 overall really great 8 within 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.620
 of 10 possible points above all 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.540
 because I'm sure with the film 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.530
 could look at two three times more and 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.390
 therefore especially in the group 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.900
 To take miracle weapons must be loud 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.190
 laugh 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.810
 the perfect movie for a 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.930
 cinema night and a lot of fun wished 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.950
 I'm releasing it for home theater now 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.200
 all who have not seen the movie yet 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.370
 he always has fun i have fun 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.120
 I wish I did not have it in the cinema 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.980
 lost 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.870
 Ok, that's what it was from me for today 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.750
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock is of course a new one 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.090
 video and until then I have been you 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.090
 of course again tomorrow at 3 o'clock
