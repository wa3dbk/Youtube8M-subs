00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.410
 hello my name is jens wohlers from 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.449
 forest edge in Germany and I may 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.730
 give them the newly introduced t4 today 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.190
 We have this machine in the shop 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.440
 november last year introduced to 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.160
 currently the series production runs on 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.559
 full tours 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.399
 to start the tsv we catch 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.280
 in the front 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.620
 we have in front of work with 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.190
 We have a capacity of 51 tons 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.769
 output 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.110
 the front axle is supported by 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.720
 a pneumatic suspension it always 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.280
 as standard integrated in machines for 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.460
 front axle is also to say we have 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.720
 very strong turning angle 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.850
 we generally have a machine with us 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.200
 a very long wheelbase but this one 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.940
 stop angle from the front axle 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.720
 gives the machine a tremendous 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.539
 maneuverability 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.600
 we have the capacity of five meters 25 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.369
 we have four motors from ratti in the forest 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.050
 battery power 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.360
 we have two different engines 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.909
 sizes in the offer 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.310
 6.6 liters of engines and 7.4 liters of engines 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.270
 the ps classes that we class in this model 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.549
 Approach ranges from 150 ps to 255 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.579
 we have the engine to the newest 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.310
 exhaust level brought on deep fine and 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.079
 that alone with et 04 disposal otherwise 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.610
 No external filtering via any filter technology 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.950
 exhaust gas recirculation can this 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.259
 particulate filter only now we use 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.750
 now the machine is natural for the 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.159
 Farmers have been developed 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.240
 Of course, the cabin is closed 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.860
 but also see the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.750
 Service-friendliness of the machines 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.899
 they get to all service points 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.540
 easy to see for example here in front 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.160
 Take the hydraulic oil with you every time 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.019
 it is to be seen we have two 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.930
 separate households for hydraulics and 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.790
 gearbox also at the rear of the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.120
 Machine is a sight glass where you can find that 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.709
 gear oil can look down the machine 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.140
 is completely new that means also the 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.420
 Cabin is new the driver is with us 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.799
 Of course the center of attention is the cabin 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.500
 got around the bike around it 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.019
 developed valtra cabins are 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.609
 tend to have always been big 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.980
 that we also carry with this series 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.019
 also the noise pollution is very high 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.709
 we have cabins under the 70 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.580
 decibel 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.920
 we have three stages 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.080
 easy access to the driver's seat also the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.020
 ride comfort has been significantly improved 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.980
 we have padded as standard 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.069
 passenger seats also cool boxes where 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.220
 fit in one and a half liter bottles 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.620
 So we can get enough quantities 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.000
 take along which we can cool well 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.040
 also shelves are created 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.569
 been 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.130
 Of course, the overview is also 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.100
 has been significantly improved 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.209
 we have big disc surfaces 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.370
 arched slices so we one 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.810
 optimal overview course in front 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.090
 construction area but ultimately has the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.260
 Machine over a 55 east cabins 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.940
 concept to the right we have 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.100
 No annoying posts anywhere 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.870
 View restricts ball tractors 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.580
 stands out among other things by the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.800
 function from that we always standard 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.090
 we have a revolving seat 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.550
 us easily with a valtra 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.650
 Tractors turn with a slip 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.690
 we can order and so on back 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.690
 the work tools are working well 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.269
 even the armrest all 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.659
 control units panning with the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.909
 driver has space the cabin is in her 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.359
 dimensions grown by 20 cm wider 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.359
 become 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.590
 we have new pairs at valtra 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.639
 principles integrated in just one 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.420
 lugs drag 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.729
 they see it here on the verso we 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.099
 now have a vehicle or a 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.599
 Joystick integrated in the vehicle with what 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.070
 the machine can be controlled 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.900
 Here also they switch las 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.500
 and so on 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.990
 automatic switching activates others 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.150
 control units the hydraulics of 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.460
 Hydraulic joystick are very good 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.750
 Ergonomically prepared so that the driver 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.830
 always full control over the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.410
 Machine also retains the far sides 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.090
 console is placed so that it constantly 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.020
 to reach are the important ones 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.740
 functions lie ahead like four-wheel 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.150
 differential settings 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.150
 tends to be a bit further back 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.530
 In addition, the machine has now 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.030
 about many possibilities of the 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.699
 electricity connection we have innumerable 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.560
 three-pin sockets bipolar 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.970
 sockets also in the front 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.479
 Vehicle area are such 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.190
 there are possibilities and we have one 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.199
 completely new cabin that means 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.000
 of course, a canopy here 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.240
 we have a roof window 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.849
 integrated that is installable that is 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.639
 made of polycarbonate so safety tested 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:26.930
 the material especially good overview 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:29.900
 some frontal work 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.370
 functions have remained tried and tested the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.659
 steering wheel fixing the walls 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.039
 but last but not least was cabin 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.080
 completely revised also new 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.550
 we have processed materials 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.070
 for example, a higher value 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.780
 achieved bright materials used 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.430
 so that the driver always feels comfortable 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.379
 and the comfort improvement of the cabin 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.300
 For example, we have air springs 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.949
 cabins mechanical cabin suspension systems 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.560
 We always have the high level of comfort 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.569
 through the movement system hinbekommen 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.759
 also the service point in the cabin 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.710
 we have improved 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:06.189
 for example, the fuse above 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.930
 for the machine interior and exterior 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:10.330
 a machine providing collateral for the 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.270
 machines outside we come now to 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.729
 Technique box on the tractor most useful 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.219
 be part of every country 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:23.349
 She is lockable at the same time 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:23.919
 You can dust dust 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.229
 protected 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.219
 you can see it here in the interior many 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.659
 integration 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.960
 we have a warning triangle here 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.580
 integrated the highlighted half finds 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.919
 yourself here 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.039
 we have a removable one 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:42.729
 a toolbox let remain free 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.499
 bin where a second tool box 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:48.339
 could be taken the battery 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:50.319
 with her poles forward and one 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.360
 fuse box for the outside 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.099
 the machine was secured at the rear 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.680
 completely revised 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:07:00.400
 we have a new footwear that 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.710
 walter has a maximum lifting capacity of 95 tons 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.990
 typical is the high excavation height of the 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.889
 gravel work on the complete geometry 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.930
 has changed 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:10.000
 the ludwig's wave has gotten bigger 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.539
 so even more burden 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.430
 you can see that, too 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:18.509
 connections the hydraulic connections 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:22.060
 At most we have five hydraulic valves 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:23.740
 in the back plus a black and white valve what 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.229
 would for the hydraulic upper 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.960
 can use without us no 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:30.029
 problem all proportional valve here 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.689
 get lost 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:36.849
 all are arranged on one side 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:38.770
 The power socket is also still down 

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:41.050
 down the easy access hiked 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.389
 walter is also typical of this 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.189
 Of course the air connection is small 

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:48.129
 detail but of great practicality 

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:50.529
 use it for more information 

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:52.360
 Of course we are happy to help 

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:53.589
 For one thing , they can be ours 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.959
 Report your trading partner 

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:57.339
 in the field of distribution among others 

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:58.980
 But they also inform on the 

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:02.090
 homepage www 

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:04.800
 alter.de will give you detailed 

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.570
 Information on all models too 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.080
 the other models of waldrach 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.080
 Many Thanks
