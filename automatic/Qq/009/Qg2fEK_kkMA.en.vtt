another<00:00:00.420> killer<00:00:00.810> planes<00:00:01.230> video

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:18.939 

and<00:00:08.469> it's<00:00:09.469> got<00:00:09.650> a<00:00:09.679> high<00:00:10.190> revving<00:00:11.120> motor<00:00:17.949> hey

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
and it's got a high revving motor hey

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.130 
and it's got a high revving motor hey
its<00:00:19.220> handheld<00:00:19.400> day<00:00:19.789> down<00:00:20.000> at<00:00:20.030> the<00:00:20.210> airport<00:00:20.630> are

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
its handheld day down at the airport are

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.900 
its handheld day down at the airport are
we<00:00:21.260> new<00:00:21.350> in<00:00:21.440> at<00:00:21.530> the<00:00:21.619> airport<00:00:21.710> we<00:00:22.070> go<00:00:22.250> to<00:00:22.310> a<00:00:22.430> park

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
we new in at the airport we go to a park

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.820 
we new in at the airport we go to a park
what<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.119> hell<00:00:23.240> we're<00:00:23.720> here<00:00:23.930> let's<00:00:24.350> fly<00:00:24.650> them

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
what the hell we're here let's fly them

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.240 
what the hell we're here let's fly them
this<00:00:25.430> is<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.910> ROC<00:00:26.359> swift<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:27.050> hear<00:00:27.920> that<00:00:28.070> it<00:00:28.220> is

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
this is the ROC swift I hear that it is

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.950 
this is the ROC swift I hear that it is
Swift<00:00:28.699> we're<00:00:29.210> going<00:00:29.420> to<00:00:29.539> find<00:00:29.779> out

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
Swift we're going to find out

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.929 
Swift we're going to find out
theoretically<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.010> plane<00:00:31.220> goes<00:00:31.400> over<00:00:31.640> 100

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
theoretically this plane goes over 100

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.040 
theoretically this plane goes over 100
miles<00:00:32.059> an<00:00:32.180> hour<00:00:32.300> but<00:00:32.480> I<00:00:32.539> think<00:00:32.719> that<00:00:32.870> might<00:00:33.019> be

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
miles an hour but I think that might be

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.229 
miles an hour but I think that might be
with<00:00:33.260> a<00:00:33.320> for<00:00:33.530> assault<00:00:33.800> battery<00:00:33.949> I<00:00:34.370> have<00:00:34.969> three

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
with a for assault battery I have three

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.280 
with a for assault battery I have three
cells<00:00:35.480> with<00:00:35.720> me<00:00:35.870> now

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
cells with me now

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.920 
cells with me now
so<00:00:36.590> it's<00:00:36.950> this<00:00:37.220> big<00:00:37.520> I<00:00:37.790> think<00:00:37.850> it's<00:00:38.149> got<00:00:38.329> this

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
so it's this big I think it's got this

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.139 
so it's this big I think it's got this
wingspan<00:00:39.530> it<00:00:39.770> weighs<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.309> much<00:00:40.370> it's<00:00:40.880> this

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
wingspan it weighs this much it's this

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.100 
wingspan it weighs this much it's this
long<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:41.630> it<00:00:41.690> uses<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:42.290> battery<00:00:42.739> and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
long and it uses this battery and

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.110 
long and it uses this battery and
theoretically<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:45.260> goes<00:00:45.410> this<00:00:45.770> fast<00:00:46.120> once

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
theoretically it goes this fast once

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.250 
theoretically it goes this fast once
again<00:00:47.450> of<00:00:47.690> course

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
again of course

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.990 
again of course
we've<00:00:48.530> put<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.770> reinforcement<00:00:49.040> kit<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:49.790> here

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
we've put a reinforcement kit in here

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.209 
we've put a reinforcement kit in here
like<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:50.360> do<00:00:50.510> with<00:00:50.629> everything<00:00:51.079> just<00:00:51.980> in<00:00:52.070> case

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
like we do with everything just in case

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.500 
like we do with everything just in case
you<00:00:52.340> don't<00:00:52.430> believe<00:00:52.700> it<00:00:52.850> we're<00:00:53.210> gonna<00:00:53.300> take

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
you don't believe it we're gonna take

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.360 
you don't believe it we're gonna take
this<00:00:53.629> brand-new<00:00:53.930> plane<00:00:54.200> crash<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:54.920> just<00:00:55.250> so

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
this brand-new plane crash it just so

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.459 
this brand-new plane crash it just so
you<00:00:55.430> can<00:00:55.730> see<00:00:55.940> how<00:00:56.600> well<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.050> crack<00:00:57.260> through

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
you can see how well the crack through

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.350 
you can see how well the crack through

planes<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.310> think<00:01:41.299> maybe<00:01:41.450> I'll<00:01:41.689> put<00:01:41.959> some

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:42.169 
planes I think maybe I'll put some

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:46.089 
planes I think maybe I'll put some
higher<00:01:43.990> Expo<00:01:44.990> rates<00:01:45.259> on<00:01:45.469> so<00:01:45.859> I've<00:01:46.069> just

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:46.099 
higher Expo rates on so I've just

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.449 
higher Expo rates on so I've just
flicked<00:01:46.700> my<00:01:46.999> switches<00:01:47.359> down<00:01:47.749> to<00:01:48.049> be<00:01:48.200> higher

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
flicked my switches down to be higher

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.789 
flicked my switches down to be higher
exploration

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.310 

anyone<00:01:52.520> have<00:01:52.670> throttling<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:54.079> is

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
anyone have throttling and this is

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.760 
anyone have throttling and this is
around<00:01:54.619> half<00:01:54.920> throttle<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:57.049> would<00:01:57.469> say<00:01:57.740> that

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
around half throttle so I would say that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.219 
around half throttle so I would say that
this<00:01:58.219> thing<00:01:58.460> has<00:01:59.110> plenty<00:02:00.110> of<00:02:00.140> power<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:03.110> we're

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
this thing has plenty of power so we're

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.760 
this thing has plenty of power so we're
going<00:02:03.380> into<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.829> wind<00:02:03.979> now

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.390 

yes<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:11.080> small<00:02:11.410> fast<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.069> there's<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.980> um

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
yes the small fast and there's so um

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.729 
yes the small fast and there's so um
this<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.849> 3-cell<00:02:19.360> battery<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:20.379> doesn't

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
this is it's a 3-cell battery it doesn't

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.009 
this is it's a 3-cell battery it doesn't
weigh<00:02:20.890> much<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:22.060> tell<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.870> it's

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
weigh much I can tell you that and it's

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.670 
weigh much I can tell you that and it's
got<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.230> tiny<00:02:23.530> little<00:02:23.709> propeller<00:02:25.380> but<00:02:26.380> it's<00:02:26.500> got

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
got a tiny little propeller but it's got

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
have this you know weighted so that the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.219 
have this you know weighted so that the
nose<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.530> way<00:05:20.490> heavy<00:05:20.880> because<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.750> battery<00:05:22.200> I

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
nose is way heavy because the battery I

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.100 
nose is way heavy because the battery I
think<00:05:22.830> is<00:05:23.520> heavier<00:05:24.410> then

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
think is heavier then

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.990 
think is heavier then
they<00:05:26.530> recommend<00:05:26.980> they<00:05:27.130> might<00:05:27.370> recommend<00:05:27.730> an

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
they recommend they might recommend an

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.810 
they recommend they might recommend an
1800<00:05:29.370> which<00:05:30.370> would<00:05:30.670> I

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
1800 which would I

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:44.679 
1800 which would I
I<00:05:31.030> assume<00:05:31.570> make<00:05:31.780> it<00:05:31.960> go<00:05:32.580> faster<00:05:33.580> vertically

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:44.689 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.390 

there<00:05:45.689> we<00:05:45.810> go<00:05:45.960> that's<00:05:46.110> me<00:05:46.349> I<00:05:46.830> think<00:05:46.949> those<00:05:47.159> dogs

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
there we go that's me I think those dogs

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.189 
there we go that's me I think those dogs
kind<00:05:47.729> of<00:05:47.819> gave<00:05:47.969> up<00:05:48.180> when<00:05:48.389> they<00:05:48.479> realized<00:05:48.930> it

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
kind of gave up when they realized it

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.050 
kind of gave up when they realized it
was<00:05:49.229> going<00:05:49.560> to<00:05:49.650> eat<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.740> million<00:05:50.009> miles<00:05:50.400> an<00:05:50.639> hour

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
was going to eat a million miles an hour

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.159 
was going to eat a million miles an hour
actually<00:05:51.479> I<00:05:51.509> think<00:05:51.569> they<00:05:51.779> probably<00:05:51.990> got

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
actually I think they probably got

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.480 
actually I think they probably got
called<00:05:52.469> back<00:05:54.680> those<00:05:55.680> are<00:05:55.889> not<00:05:56.009> that's<00:05:56.400> not

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
called back those are not that's not

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.369 
called back those are not that's not
even<00:05:56.909> Brito<00:05:57.150> that's<00:05:57.419> a<00:05:57.509> no<00:05:57.749> blink<00:05:58.020> eyes<00:05:58.139> are

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:58.379 
even Brito that's a no blink eyes are

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:59.779 
even Brito that's a no blink eyes are
friends<00:05:58.680> of<00:05:58.710> ours<00:05:58.860> yeah

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789

don't know hundreds of feet that it just

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.409 
don't know hundreds of feet that it just
went<00:06:14.939> oh<00:06:16.189> well<00:06:17.189> I'll<00:06:17.279> say<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.639> battery<00:06:18.029> lasts

went oh well I'll say the battery lasts
a<00:06:18.479> long<00:06:18.689> time<00:06:18.749> on<00:06:19.349> this<00:06:19.529> baby<00:06:19.860> yeah<00:06:20.789> you<00:06:20.849> get

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
a long time on this baby yeah you get

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.709 
a long time on this baby yeah you get
the<00:06:21.330> nice<00:06:21.539> way<00:06:21.870> 20200<00:06:24.379> what<00:06:25.379> she<00:06:25.529> SPECT<00:06:25.770> out<00:06:25.949> at

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
the nice way 20200 what she SPECT out at

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:31.550 
the nice way 20200 what she SPECT out at
89<00:06:27.719> 1,800<00:06:28.409> I'm<00:06:28.499> pretty<00:06:28.740> sure<00:06:29.210> 1803<00:06:30.210> sell<00:06:30.509> and<00:06:30.810> I

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
89 1,800 I'm pretty sure 1803 sell and I

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.439 
89 1,800 I'm pretty sure 1803 sell and I
actually<00:06:31.830> think<00:06:32.310> that<00:06:32.430> this<00:06:32.729> is<00:06:32.789> able<00:06:33.300> to

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
actually think that this is able to

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.959 
actually think that this is able to
handle<00:06:33.779> a<00:06:33.870> for<00:06:34.169> sell<00:06:34.409> it<00:06:34.710> certainly<00:06:35.189> has<00:06:35.580> a

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
handle a for sell it certainly has a

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:41.119 
handle a for sell it certainly has a
huge<00:06:36.870> honking<00:06:37.819> exp<00:06:38.849> which<00:06:39.779> looks<00:06:40.379> capable

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
huge honking exp which looks capable

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.309 
huge honking exp which looks capable
anyways<00:06:41.520> I<00:06:41.729> haven't<00:06:42.060> seen<00:06:42.479> the<00:06:42.659> specs<00:06:42.930> on<00:06:43.169> it

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
anyways I haven't seen the specs on it

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:58.439 
anyways I haven't seen the specs on it
but<00:06:43.580> it's<00:06:44.580> big<00:06:44.939> with<00:06:45.659> a<00:06:45.719> big<00:06:46.399> heat<00:06:47.399> sink<00:06:47.430> on<00:06:47.879> it
