and<00:01:13.640> we<00:01:14.630> managed<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:14.960> be<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.439> weather<00:01:15.890> system

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
and we managed to be the weather system

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.539 
and we managed to be the weather system
that<00:01:17.659> came<00:01:17.900> down<00:01:18.140> right<00:01:18.500> after<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.070> it's<00:01:19.250> no

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
that came down right after and it's no

to<00:01:42.710> make<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.920> decision<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.840> other<00:01:44.960> day<00:01:45.170> we<00:01:45.350> came

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
to make a decision the other day we came

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.890 
to make a decision the other day we came
to<00:01:45.710> conclusion<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.549> it's<00:01:46.909> just<00:01:47.210> not<00:01:47.360> safe<00:01:47.630> to

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
to conclusion that it's just not safe to

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.240 
to conclusion that it's just not safe to
continue<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:49.790> we<00:01:50.659> decided<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.560> best<00:01:51.860> of

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250
