guy are you got four kills right now so

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.220 
guy are you got four kills right now so
I'm<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> great<00:00:32.189> start<00:00:33.050> don't<00:00:34.050> want<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I'm up to a great start don't want to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.170 
I'm up to a great start don't want to
push<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.710> too<00:00:35.040> hard<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.940> kind<00:00:36.059> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
push up too hard because it's kind of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.569 
push up too hard because it's kind of
laggy<00:00:36.360> right<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.110> when<00:00:37.860> ever<00:00:38.160> it's

laggy right now and when ever it's
lagging<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.300> whenever<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> killstreak

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
lagging and whenever I'm on a killstreak

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.880 
lagging and whenever I'm on a killstreak
it<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.239> odds<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.870> against<00:00:43.290> me<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.590> just

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it the odds are just against me I just

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.310 
it the odds are just against me I just
get<00:00:44.070> fucked<00:00:44.430> over<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.050> trying<00:00:46.289> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
let that happen again I'll get killed by

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.250 
let that happen again I'll get killed by
some<00:00:48.750> BS<00:00:49.350> way<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.539> like<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.629> said<00:00:51.690> I'm<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:52.140> not

five like terminal you put it in the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.080 
five like terminal you put it in the
gift<00:01:24.900> shop<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> five<00:01:26.549> man<00:01:26.820> kill

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
gift shop and get like a five man kill

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.990 
gift shop and get like a five man kill
in<00:01:27.210> their<00:01:27.530> way<00:01:28.530> i'm<00:01:28.680> using<00:01:28.950> m16<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> red

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
in their way i'm using m16 with the red

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.899 
in their way i'm using m16 with the red
dot<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.650> i'm<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.950> using<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.430> holographic

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
dot and i'm not using the holographic

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.050 
dot and i'm not using the holographic
because<00:01:33.390> i<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.890> red<00:01:35.040> dot<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
because i just like the red dot more the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.950 
because i just like the red dot more the
red<00:01:36.299> dot<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:37.130> there's<00:01:38.130> no<00:01:38.400> glare<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.119> sides

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
red dot is there's no glare on the sides

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
red dot is there's no glare on the sides
it<00:01:40.740> gives<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.009> little<00:01:41.250> bit<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.549> recoil<00:01:41.939> just

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
it gives a little bit more recoil just

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.499 
it gives a little bit more recoil just
the<00:01:42.600> spread<00:01:42.899> apart<00:01:43.140> Lulu<00:01:43.710> sorry<00:01:44.250> about<00:01:44.340> that

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
the spread apart Lulu sorry about that

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.530 
the spread apart Lulu sorry about that
spread<00:01:45.509> patterns<00:01:45.869> aren't<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.860> straight<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
spread patterns aren't as straight but I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
spread patterns aren't as straight but I
like<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.590> jumping

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
like that I like that it's just jumping

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
like that I like that it's just jumping
around<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.460> bit<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.780> kind

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
around a little bit more because it kind

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.469 
around a little bit more because it kind
of<00:01:52.049> brings<00:01:52.560> him<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.610> quality<00:01:54.270> for

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
of brings him back to the quality for

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.410 
of brings him back to the quality for
days<00:01:54.689> caldy<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.250> was<00:01:56.460> almost<00:01:56.670> exactly

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
days caldy for it was almost exactly

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.440 
days caldy for it was almost exactly
like<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.549> I'm<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.610> really<00:02:00.030> comfortable

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
like this so I'm just really comfortable

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.929 
like this so I'm just really comfortable
with<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.079> red<00:02:01.259> dot<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:02.610> why<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> don't

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
with the red dot so that's why I don't

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.760 
with the red dot so that's why I don't
use<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.450> holographic<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.259> him<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
use the holographic on him because I
