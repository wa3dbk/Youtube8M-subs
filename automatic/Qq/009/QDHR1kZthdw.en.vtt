when you shred cheese instead of slicing

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.170 
when you shred cheese instead of slicing
it<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.960> actually<00:01:29.590> helps<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.160> add<00:01:30.310> less<00:01:30.670> cheese

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
it it actually helps you add less cheese

it it actually helps you add less cheese
to<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.479> sandwich<00:01:31.840> so<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.170> cut<00:01:32.350> down<00:01:32.470> a

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.310 
to the sandwich so you can cut down a
little<00:01:32.800> on<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.950> little<00:01:33.190> bit<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.520> fat<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:34.320> of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
little on a little bit of the fat and of

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.010 
little on a little bit of the fat and of
course<00:01:35.619> our<00:01:36.009> lobster<00:01:36.880> meat<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.660> adds<00:01:37.840> lots

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
course our lobster meat this adds lots

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.900 
course our lobster meat this adds lots
of<00:01:38.200> protein<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.920> it's<00:01:39.009> low<00:01:39.039> in<00:01:39.250> fat<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.880> you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
of protein and it's low in fat so you

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.699 
of protein and it's low in fat so you
can<00:01:40.210> kind<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.960> know<00:01:41.020> go<00:01:41.200> for<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.560> little
