up<00:00:16.610> there<00:00:16.760> making<00:00:16.880> TV<00:00:17.210> show<00:00:17.510> my<00:00:18.289> first<00:00:18.530> thought

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
up there making TV show my first thought

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.850 
up there making TV show my first thought
was<00:00:18.980> that<00:00:19.039> well<00:00:20.140> George<00:00:21.140> looks<00:00:21.440> really<00:00:21.710> is

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
was that well George looks really is

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.530 
was that well George looks really is
milking<00:00:22.279> this<00:00:22.430> franchise<00:00:22.970> right<00:00:23.210> into<00:00:23.420> the

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
milking this franchise right into the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.990 
milking this franchise right into the
ground<00:00:23.690> and<00:00:24.550> then<00:00:25.550> I<00:00:25.610> hear<00:00:25.760> about<00:00:25.850> the

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
ground and then I hear about the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.590 
ground and then I hear about the
animated<00:00:26.540> movie<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:28.550> still<00:00:29.150> thought<00:00:29.420> the

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
animated movie and I still thought the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.080 
animated movie and I still thought the
same<00:00:29.840> thing<00:00:29.870> because<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.370> movie<00:00:31.670> wasn't<00:00:31.880> all

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
same thing because the movie wasn't all

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.660 
same thing because the movie wasn't all
that<00:00:32.119> great<00:00:32.450> it<00:00:32.930> wasn't<00:00:33.200> terrible<00:00:33.800> but<00:00:34.039> was

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
that great it wasn't terrible but was

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.970 
that great it wasn't terrible but was
not<00:00:34.879> that<00:00:35.059> great<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:36.140> thought<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.410> TV<00:00:36.739> show

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
not that great and I thought the TV show

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.380 
not that great and I thought the TV show
was<00:00:37.160> probably<00:00:37.460> going<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.670> be<00:00:37.760> just<00:00:38.180> like<00:00:38.210> the

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
was probably going to be just like the

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.610 
was probably going to be just like the
movie<00:00:38.719> and<00:00:38.929> boy<00:00:39.559> was<00:00:39.859> I<00:00:40.010> wrong<00:00:40.039> the<00:00:41.030> TV<00:00:41.420> show

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
movie and boy was I wrong the TV show

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.709 
movie and boy was I wrong the TV show
was<00:00:42.620> awesome<00:00:42.909> first<00:00:43.909> thing<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.179> talk<00:00:44.390> about<00:00:44.420> is

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
was awesome first thing I talk about is

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.930 
was awesome first thing I talk about is
the<00:00:44.870> animation<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:45.739> animation<00:00:46.339> in<00:00:46.519> this<00:00:46.670> show

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
the animation the animation in this show

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.110 
the animation the animation in this show
is<00:00:47.210> better<00:00:48.109> than<00:00:48.319> any<00:00:48.530> CG<00:00:49.519> animation<00:00:49.909> I've

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
is better than any CG animation I've

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.029 
is better than any CG animation I've
seen<00:00:50.359> in<00:00:50.449> any<00:00:50.569> other<00:00:50.659> show<00:00:50.989> it's<00:00:51.559> even<00:00:51.739> better

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
seen in any other show it's even better

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.500 
seen in any other show it's even better
than<00:00:52.190> good<00:00:52.640> length<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.999> the<00:00:53.059> animated<00:00:53.479> series

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
than good length of the animated series

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.399 
than good length of the animated series
and<00:00:55.089> transformers<00:00:56.089> prime<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.079> order<00:00:57.350> are

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
and transformers prime the order are

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:58.750 
and transformers prime the order are
both<00:00:57.559> very<00:00:57.769> good<00:00:58.039> shows<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.550> their<00:00:58.639> own

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
both very good shows and their own

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.750 
both very good shows and their own
rights<00:00:59.089> but<00:00:59.449> it's<00:00:59.929> because<00:01:00.139> that<00:01:00.289> Star<00:01:00.559> Wars

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
rights but it's because that Star Wars

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.969 
rights but it's because that Star Wars
probably<00:01:01.760> has<00:01:01.940> an<00:01:02.149> inflated<00:01:02.510> budget<00:01:03.079> so<00:01:03.229> they

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
probably has an inflated budget so they

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.310 
probably has an inflated budget so they
can<00:01:04.159> put<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.430> extra<00:01:04.760> mileage<00:01:05.120> in<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:06.020> make<00:01:06.200> it

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
can put the extra mileage in to make it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.550 
can put the extra mileage in to make it
look<00:01:06.440> look<00:01:07.370> extra<00:01:07.790> pretty<00:01:08.290> there<00:01:09.290> are<00:01:09.409> some

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
look look extra pretty there are some

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.380 
look look extra pretty there are some
scenes<00:01:09.890> in<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.159> shield<00:01:10.370> actually<00:01:10.700> look<00:01:10.850> photo

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
scenes in the shield actually look photo

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.030 
scenes in the shield actually look photo
realistic<00:01:11.710> what's<00:01:12.710> kind<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:12.920> interesting

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
realistic what's kind of interesting

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.980 
realistic what's kind of interesting
because<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.670> characters<00:01:14.360> have<00:01:14.690> kind<00:01:14.870> of<00:01:14.900> a

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
because the characters have kind of a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.530 
because the characters have kind of a
cartoony<00:01:15.410> design<00:01:15.830> but<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.880> backgrounds<00:01:17.450> in

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
cartoony design but the backgrounds in

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.750 
cartoony design but the backgrounds in
objects<00:01:18.350> will<00:01:18.530> have<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:18.890> photorealistic

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
objects will have a photorealistic

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.270 
objects will have a photorealistic
design<00:01:20.320> which<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.380> actually<00:01:21.500> pretty<00:01:21.770> cool<00:01:22.010> and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
design which is actually pretty cool and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.420 
design which is actually pretty cool and
the<00:01:22.820> characters<00:01:23.420> when<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.050> saw<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.410> show<00:01:24.740> it

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
the characters when I saw the show it

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.420 
the characters when I saw the show it
just<00:01:25.730> made<00:01:26.000> watching<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.340> prequel<00:01:28.340> trilogy

just made watching the prequel trilogy

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.270 
just made watching the prequel trilogy
is<00:01:28.730> even<00:01:29.000> harder<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.510> watch<00:01:29.690> because<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.070> show

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
is even harder to watch because the show

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.780 
is even harder to watch because the show
makes<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.790> jedis<00:01:32.260> look<00:01:33.260> so<00:01:33.440> awesome<00:01:33.680> yet<00:01:34.580> in

she<00:01:50.150> starts<00:01:50.510> off<00:01:50.660> kind<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.080> as<00:01:51.320> like<00:01:51.530> the
