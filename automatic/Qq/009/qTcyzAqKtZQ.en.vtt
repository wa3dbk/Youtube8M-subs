00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.439
 or the real rough as they are derby 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.370
 commenting and now I'm going to talk about 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:13.040
 the new one that went out for resident evil 6 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.059
 it's about the map of the mercenaries of 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.490
 Chad 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.000
 the heights and four 3 this map that you 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.820
 it came included in the residence and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.830
 preordered the game I yesterday I'm going to 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.260
 order problem for like two 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.510
 weeks then yesterday I went to game planet 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.509
 that I bought myself in that place 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.990
 but I already had gold money because it makes 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.760
 as six seven months had sold about 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.670
 games there then I said then let's 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.580
 take advantage of I already have and have not saved what 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.460
 no worse and then we when out since 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.790
 give it to me or then when they give you the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.040
 game only give you a code a 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.020
 code they have on your ticket and what 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.510
 you can change on your page and it's there 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.780
 where they gave you this gossip of map 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.920
 that is quite small is like a ship 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.890
 military 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 and I liked it here I put the click on the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.399
 directly from cursed these 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.070
 güeyes are already called you as they were 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.770
 made by the virus 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.150
 this no longer believe that you are exposed to the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 Most of the know came out in the fucking 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.030
 demo and then if you have not played the demo 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.040
 still they do not care much 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.960
 history of errors and horrors and leveled 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.420
 in general 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.700
 here as you see this game mode is 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.240
 quite entertaining I liked how 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.970
 they did it 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.130
 mons the way in how illusion in this 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.479
 res and level 6 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.070
 although I must emphasize that if it has 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.130
 liked more how mercenaries did 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.659
 in the first new world good in 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.080
 I liked the first ones 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.090
 receipts but then until now I play 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.390
 of racing 16 has not left me bad 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.180
 taste of mouth if it has its parts that you 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.700
 they leave with their mouths open 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.049
 I liked it here, throwing 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.000
 this damn I have 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.729
 as I tell you, it is handled in 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.280
 enough moments with a good taste of 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.670
 mouth this game 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.310
 the story is bad enough 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.610
 worked on you see that they got it 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:22.070
 the Japanese rappers capcom 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.400
 and also in several things you have to 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.890
 say it loads something we like the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.410
 camera but good that and afterwards the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.210
 I commented on a video analysis that I will do 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.910
 of the game but well let's go to the hole this 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.720
 this model of mercenaries basically 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.960
 is about how it was a sand way not 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.300
 survival where we have to kill 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.209
 to as many zombies as possible 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.310
 in the determined time that they put us 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.430
 for example at the beginning they put us between 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.040
 two or three minutes but that time what 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.400
 we will be able to increase this with 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.070
 beams of light that will be scattered 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.030
 Throughout the map the beams of light 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.310
 they are going to increase the time 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.959
 progressively for example when 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.060
 we will give an ace of light will increase us 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.310
 30 seconds of time when we will give the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.110
 second are going to be 45 and so 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.650
 consecutively to increase our 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.849
 time now and be able to kill more enemies 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.590
 and that generates more points at the same time 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:31.099
 every time we kill an enemy and 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.349
 then we will give a lot to kill the 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.989
 next enemy are going to leave us 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.609
 they are going to accumulate combos that are going to 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.170
 give much more very efficient points here 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.299
 are the beams of light that I tell you that 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.220
 they increase us in time but good 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.090
 back to the combos we have to kill 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.950
 the enemies consecutively and we 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.390
 they will be increasing the combos 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.310
 this is how good is going to give us a lot 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.379
 higher score apart from that they're going to 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.480
 appear in our our record 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.480
 common 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.519
 a web feature and a data 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.750
 quite important especially if you 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.390
 we want to compare with our friends 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.379
 that is something that has beat me a lot 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.420
 in this receipt the 6 that for example 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.760
 you enter the game and your friends tell you 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.220
 all assume the progress they carry 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.780
 your friends in the game and all appear 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.859
 the knicks of your purchases that are 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.900
 playing at that moment the game 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.900
 and it's pretty good on this map 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:30.460
 one of the things that I can not understand 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:33.349
 after krapp com and crown because it's a 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.080
 as I mention in several things the shit 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.969
 for example this DLD cost them a lot 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.590
 I work to put it directly in the 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:45.439
 click game be web or force you between 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.400
 quotes to forgive this the game for 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:50.139
 what gives you on this map 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.020
 Well, you know, the 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.479
 the fucking robbery of these six of capon 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.139
 that whenever they take them they get 20,000 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:03.800
 of the descent but good and something have 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:06.710
 to get more out of the güeyes not 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:10.790
 well, here, jac 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.440
 almost ending the game I would not have 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.600
 I could make the gameplay longer but 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.670
 at the end already 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.230
 just the one to show them the game already 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.600
 after extracting in a mercenary is 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.370
 where if you make a record or where there is 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.440
 fighting for fight a record for example 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.670
 there they see that there are some of light no longer what 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.760
 I catch these guys the sniper fuck me 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.650
 drip a puncture shot as they throw you 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.830
 is Castro are quite castros or 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.380
 and then here 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.260
 As I already commented to you, being in the video 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.360
 analysis I hope soon my opinion on 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.360
 the racing game level 6 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.650
 Well, the game is ending 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.530
 making a little 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.060
 So that you have nothing and God 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.000
 true that it is quite enough 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.960
 heavy that I get a lot I 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.100
 they finished the bullets now yes to hear 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.020
 wang and it's over the fucking game very 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.930
 well let's see the records is 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.240
 quite difficult to get good ranges already 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.490
 you will see it by changes is a maximum ramón 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.320
 that taken colors sees well enough 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.030
 difficult is that I see I did a good one 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.240
 good part but good is because it has 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:27.490
 liked the video you know this I 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.030
 sweater beit a greeting and see you later 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.030
 carnal
