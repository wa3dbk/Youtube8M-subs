00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.860 
hey guys this cave you ready one here I
was<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.520> through<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.790> gun<00:00:05.940> safe<00:00:06.240> today<00:00:06.600> and

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
was going through the gun safe today and

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.900 
was going through the gun safe today and
I<00:00:07.410> came<00:00:07.620> across<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:09.170> H&amp;R<00:00:10.170> arms<00:00:11.240> HR<00:00:12.620> 2922<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.910> I

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
I came across the H&amp;R arms HR 2922 and I

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.369 
I came across the H&amp;R arms HR 2922 and I
realized<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.389> hadn't<00:00:15.660> done<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> shooting<00:00:16.139> video

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379

with<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.740> yet<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.150> thought<00:00:18.510> I'd<00:00:18.630> bring<00:00:18.750> it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

with it yet so I thought I'd bring it
out<00:00:19.020> since<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.529> nice<00:00:19.680> day<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.250> try<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.119> do
