00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.549
 for this reason of his residence 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.249
 speaks seriously 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.550
 participated yesterday of the big release we have of 50 goals I made the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.140
 centerpiece 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.880
 and with him the motto for him 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.269
 we have to have an attention of 60 and 70 points in March for 50 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.870
 I know that there were 50 billion and here we had more than 50 the converter to 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.740
 to work in the 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.080
 steve and 50 pump bags 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.270
 and after hearing the ones involved 50 points 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.620
 then it is not working 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.420
 and remembering that the converter only works with sectors will start to work 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 if you decide if you are not working 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.310
 no sesc rio grande do sul 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.680
 taking away our favor said 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.650
 in the corridor of roads in serious condition 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.790
 and will not fail us to receive the resources coming from the structure 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.010
 this we can do the last few months seems to have worked 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.440
 or their the monologue we will see more forward 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.690
 let's move on with your residence 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.070
 a change in the resolution of 1024 768 - four years 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.320
 7 68 billion 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.390
 due to the robin dance tension 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.570
 50 years lives in the street 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.890
 after one year we have more than 50 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.040
 in this case not taking goals is the maximum of the revolution in attention to what is 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.050
 different is going to be done without naming names 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.830
 everything started this wish be it works 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.460
 three laps from the end and we can not see better 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.900
 we will check 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.820
 if a rainy month we were together 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.610
 the image rights 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.220
 there are several solutions 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.700
 this relationship is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.689
 put the celestial team into networks 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.770
 and placed in the same corresponding position 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.119
 we only have to play with ten 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.079
 if you do not have the strength to put that kind of proposal on the table it is good for all 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.290
 citizens 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.159
 and right now at Christmas 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.889
 the last defeat was in vain to use 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.109
 placed 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.589
 on renault in tests 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:27.779
 this is funny 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.180
 the voltage is approximately 2 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.949
 good 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:32.699
 indicated forward 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.829
 we have faith and it goes well in points 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.299
 that space 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.639
 carlos cruz 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.759
 if it did not get here on our foot I had a devastating start coming 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.519
 the ground is raining the green light was very good no one wants to go 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.519
 furthermore, if the presence of 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.999
 the same 7 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.879
 is what we call returning to the country 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.569
 that he was married 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.469
 How are we going to give up? 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.099
 on set 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.010
 and we have 48 what the m is in the frequency of that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.709
 in 48 hours 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.870
 however, in addition to reserve converters or 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.289
 the cipar efforts conversations to work 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.349
 was in a more serious state were taken to popular jury 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.529
 now we put a new resolution of images of the set 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.279
 those with that they like in the united states 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.749
 this Wednesday, 19 nodes 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.239
 Teresa Lima 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.589
 the same 50 years and reside on the bridge 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:38.459
 he took his one-year-old son 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.869
 we now have September 7 his cronies ciro gomes 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:48.189
 I thought it was better they are not better and better paid by the newspaper 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.959
 and now but the sun comes up and it does not rain 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:58.269
 it would not be now often that the one who does everything seems to compensate for this 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.699
 imbalance 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.989
 was 48 heard to 5 billion 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.699
 they really are 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:11.599
 and now it's practically 38 reais for 2012 we're going to save everyone looking like 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.059
 of the frequency talked
