00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it's sort of the red/black setup with a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.769 
it's sort of the red/black setup with a
little<00:00:23.609> bit<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> change<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> bunch<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
little bit of change we have a bunch of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.269 
little bit of change we have a bunch of
black<00:00:24.960> cards<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> bottom<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
black cards on the bottom we have a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.920 
black cards on the bottom we have a
bunch<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.550> red<00:00:26.730> cards<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
bunch of red cards and then we have a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.470 
bunch of red cards and then we have a
small<00:00:28.349> set<00:00:28.680> up<00:00:28.800> with<00:00:29.070> red<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.609> black<00:00:30.090> cards

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
small set up with red and black cards

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.910 
small set up with red and black cards
and<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.689> way<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.960> goes<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.579> red<00:00:32.719> red<00:00:33.920> black

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and the way this goes is red red black

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.420 
and the way this goes is red red black
red<00:00:35.280> black<00:00:36.649> black<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.250> one

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
red black black and then there's one

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.630 
red black black and then there's one
more<00:00:38.460> red<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:40.680> two<00:00:40.920> Reds<00:00:41.190> black<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
more red one so it's two Reds black a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.660 
more red one so it's two Reds black a
red<00:00:41.910> two<00:00:42.239> blacks<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.870> red<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.670> spread

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
red two blacks and a red you can spread

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670 
red two blacks and a red you can spread
it<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.940> way<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.809> easier<00:00:46.140> but

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it this way so you can see it easier but

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
it this way so you can see it easier but
it<00:00:46.980> goes<00:00:47.399> red<00:00:47.610> red<00:00:47.850> black<00:00:48.090> red<00:00:48.120> black<00:00:48.480> black

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it goes red red black red black black

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.450 
it goes red red black red black black
red<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.170> pretty<00:00:49.440> easy<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.890> remember<00:00:50.129> if

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
red that's pretty easy to remember if

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430 
red that's pretty easy to remember if
you<00:00:50.820> run<00:00:51.120> through<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> few<00:00:51.750> times<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:52.289> what

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you run through it a few times now what

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.180 
you run through it a few times now what
that<00:00:52.469> leaves<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.960> 22<00:00:54.960> red<00:00:55.590> cards<00:00:56.010> and

23 black cards and you're going to put
those<00:00:58.410> together<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> you're

going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> take<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.500> set<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.520> top

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
going to take this set up put it on top

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.440 
going to take this set up put it on top
stick<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> box<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> card<00:01:05.880> case<00:01:06.180> now

you can do your false cut if you want
this<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> situation<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:13.110> want

this is a situation where you don't want
the<00:01:14.490> audience<00:01:14.850> member<00:01:15.270> cutting<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> deck<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the audience member cutting the deck but

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
the audience member cutting the deck but
then<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.380> talk<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.369> tell<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
then you talk about how you can tell the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.590 
then you talk about how you can tell the
colors<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.150> cards<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.659> by<00:01:19.670> just<00:01:20.670> by<00:01:20.820> feel<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
colors of cards just by just by feel and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.789 
colors of cards just by just by feel and
by<00:01:21.780> intuition

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
by intuition

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
by intuition
and<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.119> through<00:01:24.150> your<00:01:24.420> setup<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and you go through your setup that's a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.100 
and you go through your setup that's a
red<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.280> red<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.960> think<00:01:27.960> this

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
red one that's a red one I think this

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
red one that's a red one I think this
one's<00:01:28.320> black<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:29.159> might<00:01:29.369> require<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.759> little

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
one's black this might require a little

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.690 
one's black this might require a little
bit<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> acting<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.960> one's<00:01:31.170> red<00:01:31.490> this<00:01:32.490> one's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
bit of acting this one's red this one's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.429 
bit of acting this one's red this one's
black<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.150> one's<00:01:33.360> definitely<00:01:33.600> black<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
black this one's definitely black and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.950 
black this one's definitely black and
this<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.920> red<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:35.970> know<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> have

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
this one is red now I know that I have

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.830 
this one is red now I know that I have
this<00:01:37.229> pile<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.130> cards<00:01:38.400> left<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.790> 23<00:01:39.420> red<00:01:39.630> ones

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this pile of cards left with 23 red ones

what's happened is all these cards are
red<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.990> end<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:34.800> pile<00:02:35.130> is

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
red and and in the end this pile is

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.680 
red and and in the end this pile is
actually<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.850> be<00:02:35.910> backwards<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.600> I'm

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
actually going to be backwards but I'm

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.930 
actually going to be backwards but I'm
going<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> show<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.170> how<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.290> deal<00:02:37.560> with<00:02:37.740> that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
going to show you how to deal with that

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
going to show you how to deal with that
now<00:02:38.940> we're<00:02:39.150> going<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.480> change<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.680> colors<00:02:40.950> of

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
now we're going to change the colors of

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.010 
now we're going to change the colors of
the<00:02:41.220> piles<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.210> black<00:02:42.450> pile<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
the piles so this is the black pile and

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.500 
the piles so this is the black pile and
this<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.860> red<00:02:44.010> pile<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.610> want<00:02:45.420> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
this is the red pile and you want to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.000 
this is the red pile and you want to
encourage<00:02:45.870> them<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.140> go<00:02:46.380> as<00:02:46.500> quickly<00:02:46.680> as

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
encourage them to go as quickly as

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.680 
encourage them to go as quickly as
possible<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.060> trick<00:02:48.270> doesn't<00:02:48.390> take

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
possible so the trick doesn't take

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.840 
possible so the trick doesn't take
forever<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.230> deal<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.890> cards<00:02:50.190> wherever<00:02:50.730> they

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
forever and deal the cards wherever they

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.190 
forever and deal the cards wherever they
think<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.240> now<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.360> don't<00:02:51.630> even<00:02:51.780> have<00:02:51.990> to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
think and now you don't even have to

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.420 
think and now you don't even have to
count<00:02:52.350> you're<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.770> going<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:52.950> let<00:02:53.070> them<00:02:53.220> deal

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
count you're just going to let them deal

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.949 
count you're just going to let them deal
until<00:02:53.760> they<00:02:53.850> run<00:02:54.030> out<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.209> cards<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:54.810> now

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
until they run out of cards because now

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.580 
until they run out of cards because now
they're<00:02:55.140> dealing<00:02:55.260> all<00:02:55.620> black<00:02:55.950> cards
