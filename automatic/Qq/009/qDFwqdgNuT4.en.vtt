00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.420
 I wish a nice good day mr 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.590
 play minecraft but again my wish 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.580
 tutorial and nothing 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:18.539
 So I was a bit cold 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.100
 Please do not agree with me right now 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 let's go today when is it coming ? 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.070
 the room and currently comes with 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.359
 automatic light created so 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.059
 Ambitious space is leaving again 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.460
 not then it will not be extinguished 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.260
 So practically son and I'll say that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.260
 eat first try very briefly 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.629
 I will not go out I go 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:56.730
 actually quite good 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:58.850
 we now have a house for the tomb 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.850
 raider 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.790
 let's say so 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.320
 I just wanted to go green like that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.320
 it would be our house 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.440
 and that is relatively dark we want 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.170
 now like here 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.280
 Doctors and tips to bring the too 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.110
 Lights start reporting space 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.479
 Enter that means we would do it 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.720
 theoretically go several ways 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.880
 I do that with the object of 1.3 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.820
 point 2 with the trip or the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.910
 tripwire, so to speak, that's me 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.030
 pass here a mechanism and 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.920
 see through a string 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.899
 you can hear here now would be a 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.580
 signal routed so that you can also 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.739
 hide a bit if you want 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:15.030
 one can so him like no idea 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.030
 Let's come up with it, ok 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.099
 here is the part 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.060
 but signals come out and still quite 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.060
 to show briefly 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.599
 Yes exactly 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:43.470
 we already know is seen 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.660
 works fine so ok the naked 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.640
 problem is if we now the whole 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:57.170
 just connect to the lamp 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.170
 the following happens so goes in 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.470
 then, but then it just works out 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:10.100
 just as long as we are in here 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:13.880
 when taking what in turn means so 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.209
 do not need it even when we return 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.730
 go out that is very bitter 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.180
 we need a flip flop for that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.880
 it knows much better ways 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.310
 blablabla i do not care i build mine 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.320
 possibility is a bit bigger though 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.110
 I know how it works 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.650
 the other half knows neither 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:44.720
 More whole again works so well 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.560
 what is that that is, if I have one 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.780
 turn it on 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.470
 the signal is only for a day like 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.470
 Let 's take advantage of that 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.890
 if a runway has an entry signal 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.680
 So pull in Bitzen up to 2,616,301 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.600
 when you signal the slopes to a text 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.260
 then it turns out so old 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.660
 that in the block can post on 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.390
 cd and next time with so 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.090
 the deep fleet now works the 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.010
 slopes seem to block the torch 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.010
 that means this sports 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.790
 we have a signal 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.800
 neither is it pulled away signal that 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.700
 means we have our permanent signal 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.100
 so if I had to do it now theoretically 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.680
 function 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.860
 we do not care how long we have 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.670
 not me go out 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.670
 that should not fly right now 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.720
 so not out and out 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.770
 he is a bit weird again because 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.270
 I somehow you just have to over 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.800
 really running in and out 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.180
 It just works like that 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.070
 I'll take a look at you next time 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.420
 couple go shop because I'm one 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:25.950
 to work up a bit 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:29.190
 I have already and oh yes this 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:32.400
 tutorial the sharkbar often less 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:35.760
 Felix's videos are tutorials 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.890
 and partly I find that things in the 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.710
 totally great change the a bit off 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.210
 and sexy then myself or myself 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.380
 Show yourself that way again because I think 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.640
 yes that must just know and that we 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.980
 for example, stones the comments 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.850
 something like a few years expanded 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.220
 you build that exactly the tutorial 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.620
 made because someone asked 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.630
 I do not care if that happens or not 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.340
 there is 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.960
 that you are when you are not 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.640
 then I show again kienreich 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.750
 try to show so the next goal 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.750
 will probably be 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:21.310
 I have laughed me such a so broken 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:23.300
 The principle is simple from the Mr. yoo 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.350
 preliminary video maybe or something 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.350
 little lexmark show
