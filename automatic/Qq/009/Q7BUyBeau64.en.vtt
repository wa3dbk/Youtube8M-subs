00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.930

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.830
 Obviously giving an account if I agree to 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.830
 any of those movies I could 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.900
 maybe read hypnosis some reviews 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.140
 what people have written about the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.860
 movie or even there could be what 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.170
 it's a trailer or a bit of the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.330
 movie to see what it is about ok you 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.790
 I'll give pause I'll come again 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.530
 from this side to what is my window 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.870
 main here I already have what is the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.550
 active application if I wanted to erase 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.320
 some application what would have to 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.640
 do is give right button on the 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.940
 application and from this side select 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.920
 uninstall it 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.780
 in case I did not like it and 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.210
 in the same way I could go back to the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.310
 store and keep looking for any 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.500
 another type of application that can 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.270
 serve with this button up here I 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.030
 I can go back to where I was 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.580
 initially and if you have paid attention to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.160
 the upper right corner whenever 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.050
 I have applications installed in what 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.070
 what is windows 8 is always going to put me 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.990
 here the option to update the because 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.880
 because the creators of these 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.190
 applications are constantly being 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.050
 updating and well then here I will 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.510
 tell the store that all of these 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.180
 applications are available 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.460
 come to be updated by default 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.830
 all selected if I wanted 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.570
 update all together only 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.160
 I would give you a click on this side where it says 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.830
 to install automatically 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.100
 begin to install or I can click 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.680
 to basically select some 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.740
 applications individually and 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.320
 immediately after giving it install 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.570
 when I give him install on this side he tells me 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.630
 that are being updated basically 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:05.050
 the applications that I select and a 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.890
 once finished basically they would already be 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.930
 available and well then this was a 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.820
 brief tour about the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.520
 Windows 8 functionality I hope 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.959
