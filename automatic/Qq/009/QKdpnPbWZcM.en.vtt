00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.910
 all means are good to stop 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.750
 to smoke in my body to me it was the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.370
 m strike mandate 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 now for short gustavo but I 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.600
 think it might surprise you it's a 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.350
 example it is the biggest Christ 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.090
 cabinet this lung smoking increases 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.230
 broadly the possibilities of diseases 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.150
 cardiovascular but certainly 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.830
 the possibilities of 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.840
 develop cancers like for example 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.390
 cancer of the pharyngeal mouth of the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 larynx of the esophagus of the stomach 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.520
 lungs then also gives cancer 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.430
 lungs and the number 1 cause of death 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.870
 by cancer in canada and 85 % of cancers 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.080
 lung are directly related to 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.089
 the habit of smoking is a small 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.769
 but the nicotine stimulates the 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.680
 dopamine secretion which gives us 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.090
 the impression of reading what makes the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.220
 things a little bit more complicated so 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 within 24 hours after abandoning everything 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 first there is a minimum of four 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.799
 following decades that may appear 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.409
 we enter the depressed mood 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.820
 insomnia irritability anxiety the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.159
 difficulty concentrating 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.900
 the feverishness the decrease of the rhythm 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.000
 heart and increased appetite 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.909
 but believe me in the long run the effects 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.189
 are only positive according to the creator of 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.189
 psycho cybernetics and maxwell maul 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.100
 it would take about 21 days to brain 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.830
 to condition or unpack a 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.900
 habit established his 30 day site 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.520
 for less than 30 days without smoke it 's 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.860
 represent tons and tons of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.020
 pencil walking hours of self 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.510
 mutilation with elastic elbow but also 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.010
 huge savings of money 30 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.100
 days for me it must represent a 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.400
 saving about 120 dollars that one 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.360
 speak about 80 coffee if we bring back 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.710
 that over a year 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.280
 it's about 1560 dollars or 1040 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.130
 coffee where we travel in Sweden but that's 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.810
