00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.980
 he has always defended 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 by the human person as an end never as a means 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.090
 has defended the freedom of thought other reasonable reasoned thinking 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.220
 critical 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.210
 he has defended freedom 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.820
 against prices 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 different from the dictates of any 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.460
 authoritarian regime 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.010
 we try to carry out the studies 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.700
 comprehensive training 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.300
 that you can talk about different careers 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.930
 but what I did in the background there is a tradition says it is man 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.410
 and it is known that it is impossible 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.410
 it's the love of the country in this way things clearly 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.260
 the Catholic nasa has a girl who is fundamental and who for us in 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.030
 psychology that are alien or work that line social responsibility 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 university 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.230
 on August 15 after the earthquake that shook 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.020
 in that country mainly in the southern area 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.900
 st us 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.179
 we decided to make an intervention 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.639
 the issue of mental health because the affected population not only lose 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.100
 their houses 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.320
 If not that by the houses also loses a project of life 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.700
 we travel in the luxury van 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.059
 humanity is that or not 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.689
 the driver was a devout world specialty very large and small 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:19.329
 somehow everyone felt the need to be a necessity of 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.329
 commit and offer the user 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.409
 there we arrived and proposed a dynamic in that sense that there is freedom to 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.869
 we all know that we have to deal with children 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.869
 also yesterday we will propose 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.869
 the type of game the type of the mic adduced the workshop 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.609
 but many people are a are in a situation 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.159
 hence they have lost everything 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.089
 previously as if it was finished 3 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.219
 there are for us together with parade 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.219
 at some time 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.950
 the Taliban 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.509
 mel of activities 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.859
 they do well not only 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.659
 love has revealed academic but also your most human side not then 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.879
 I do not think there can be a professional that is excellent, let's say 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.709
 with very good and that does not have its values 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.779
 also hand in hand 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.009
 and nobody escapes from this edition 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.529
 an example is the dynamic is to say the silence of history through the 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.859
 Riva-AgÃ¼ero Institute 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.829
 just here you are looking for your approach 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:32.589
 to the peoples this approach to this reality 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.859
 because in addition 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.109
 as dead comes from antiquity 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.439
 the history 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.769
 is in some way master of life 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.839
 a shepherd already 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:50.339
 it is not known where the professional knowledge will be applied 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.059
 no engineers are trained 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:55.409
 abstract 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.709
 yes no engineers who have to know the national reality 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.199
 later the diversity 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.609
 to the oscar libertarian 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.930
 there is freedom of the press are to be able to express their ideas percent 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.249
 give a personal touch to the contents presented health 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:19.840
 from iu you have to be motivated in 1 here not necessarily what you have to 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.840
 apply are expensive measures 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.770
 the now I find out 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.250
 over 18 years through research projects projected that this is 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.419
 the one of the students of the catholic university the objective of the first group 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.699
 of support sprint access 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.759
 to the population below economic resources to appropriate technologies 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.900
 due to the fact that it is used economic materials of the area 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.259
 and they do not harm the environment 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.710
 it seems to me that it is the best radio as 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.349
 percent from my own experience working with the miners 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.569
 percent 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.300
 with communicators 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.750
 Lawyers who are asked care about the environment by the way 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.750
 solve urgent needs of the country 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.779
 I see this university 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.779
 a university of cultural diversity 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:41.779
 that for me is 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:42.969
 so hard 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.409
 what a university welcomes me 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.069
 as well as me peasants 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.469
 have never had this opportunity 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:55.719
 and here I am studying in this is a moment is without surgery 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:57.119
 in the path 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:58.439
 I'm living 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.439
 suddenly boyera political science 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.480
 I will never forget the teachers their names I want to carry in my memory 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.180
 because there is a lot 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.580
 many teachers who have motivated me as well as classmates when 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.000
 we work in groups we have also had some discrepancies because I 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.979
 I know the reality
