class<00:00:06.779> smoke<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.290> asked<00:00:08.220> for<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:09.150> suggestion<00:00:10.139> of

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
class smoke I asked for a suggestion of

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.799 
class smoke I asked for a suggestion of
which<00:00:11.130> tivo<00:00:11.759> class<00:00:11.969> would<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.570> see

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
which tivo class would you like to see

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.919 
which tivo class would you like to see
next<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.759> this<00:00:14.759> library<00:00:15.150> class<00:00:15.450> were<00:00:15.660> really

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
next and this library class were really

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.290 
next and this library class were really
prevalent<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.310> interchange<00:00:17.970> map

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
prevalent and I got this interchange map

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.640 
prevalent and I got this interchange map
and<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.810> thought<00:00:18.990> I'd<00:00:19.140> go<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.529> because

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
and I thought I'd go for it because

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.080 
and I thought I'd go for it because
interchange<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.189> really<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.520> best<00:00:20.550> map<00:00:20.880> for

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
interchange is really the best map for

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.460 
interchange is really the best map for
sniper<00:00:21.270> mobs<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> easiest<00:00:22.050> method<00:00:22.320> for

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
sniper mobs and the easiest method for

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
sniper mobs and the easiest method for
them<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.369> you're<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.580> go<00:00:23.730> for<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.090> go<00:00:24.300> for

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
them so if you're not go for some go for

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.420 
them so if you're not go for some go for
it<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.960> look<00:00:25.109> down<00:00:25.230> look<00:00:25.500> down<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:26.130> on

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it and just look down look down them on

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.089 
it and just look down look down them on
the<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> spoon<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.500> leg<00:00:28.500> off<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> bat<00:00:28.890> right

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the a spoon and leg off the bat right

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.400 
the a spoon and leg off the bat right
off<00:00:29.130> about<00:00:29.369> captured<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:31.260> you

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
off about captured be and see if you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.110 
off about captured be and see if you
want<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> delay<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> game<00:00:32.340> let<00:00:32.579> them<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.790> let

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
want to delay the game let them get let

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.520 
want to delay the game let them get let
them<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.570> them<00:00:33.750> push<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.079> off<00:00:34.230> see

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
them get to see them push them off see

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.799 
them get to see them push them off see
so<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.460> seen<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> mean

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so they have seen you have to see I mean

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.780 
so they have seen you have to see I mean
so<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.590> CCAP<00:00:38.040> been<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> cap<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
so they have the CCAP been a cap and you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.270 
so they have the CCAP been a cap and you
have<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> points<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.320> tick<00:00:40.860> towards

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
have be so the points like tick towards

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.299 
have be so the points like tick towards
them<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.670> beginning<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:43.040> one<00:00:44.040> like

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
them in the beginning and when one like

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889 
them in the beginning and when one like
the<00:00:44.489> game<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.670> half<00:00:44.910> through<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.420> cap<00:00:45.600> see

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the game is half through you can cap see

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.569 
the game is half through you can cap see
and<00:00:46.170> hope<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> same<00:00:47.010> time<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.280> win<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
and hope be at the same time and win the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.250 
and hope be at the same time and win the
game<00:00:47.700> closely<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.660> time<00:00:48.899> overall

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
game closely and have more time overall

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
game closely and have more time overall
so<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.550> that's<00:00:50.820> one<00:00:51.030> main<00:00:51.180> thing<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
so that is like that's one main thing I

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
so that is like that's one main thing I
give<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.870> how<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.110> time<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.949> nervous

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
give it on how much time you get nervous

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.270 
give it on how much time you get nervous
and<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.550> start<00:00:53.760> making<00:00:53.969> mistakes<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:55.280> that's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and you start making mistakes and that's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.770 
and you start making mistakes and that's
that's<00:00:56.520> where<00:00:56.789> most<00:00:56.940> people<00:00:57.270> fail<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.629> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
that's where most people fail with that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
that's where most people fail with that
moves<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.680> don't<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.920> enough<00:00:59.100> sign

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
moves just they don't have enough sign

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
moves just they don't have enough sign
and<00:00:59.520> that's<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.809> want<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and that's what I do when I want to

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.720 
and that's what I do when I want to
really<00:01:01.590> prolong<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> games<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.399> get<00:01:02.579> myself

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
really prolong the games I get myself

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.539 
really prolong the games I get myself
more<00:01:03.059> time<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.660> could<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.470> don't<00:01:04.710> get

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
more time and I could I just don't get

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.240 
more time and I could I just don't get
as<00:01:05.790> nervous<00:01:06.260> but<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> beginning<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
as nervous but in the beginning of this

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
as nervous but in the beginning of this
game<00:01:08.340> actually<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.850> first<00:01:08.970> time<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.479> thought

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
game actually the first time I thought

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.780 
game actually the first time I thought
about<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.930> ACR<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.470> thought<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.159> doing<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
about an ACR I thought about doing a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.399 
about an ACR I thought about doing a
hundred<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> no<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.810> something<00:01:13.110> ain't<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
hundred of no or something ain't it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.039 
hundred of no or something ain't it
because<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.280> easy<00:01:14.310> math<00:01:14.580> words

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
because this is a really easy math words

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.530 
because this is a really easy math words
but<00:01:16.049> unfortunately<00:01:16.560> died<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> switch<00:01:18.360> back
