changes<00:02:59.740> and<00:02:59.920> you<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.220> point<00:03:00.430> out<00:03:00.610> carbon

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
changes and you just point out carbon

emissions up by forty percent are their
success<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.960> people<00:03:05.290> can<00:03:05.470> point<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.160> that

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
thing they're going to be looking at is

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.610
