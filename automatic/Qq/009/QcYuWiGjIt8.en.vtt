bye<00:02:08.849> remember<00:02:09.599> how<00:02:09.890> deep<00:02:10.890> is

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
bye remember how deep is

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.960 
bye remember how deep is
why<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:13.140> pretty<00:02:13.319> big<00:02:13.470> 22<00:02:14.040> HBase<00:02:14.430> TRO<00:02:14.640> anyway

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
why it's pretty big 22 HBase TRO anyway

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.199 
why it's pretty big 22 HBase TRO anyway
and<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:16.140> um<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:17.040> sounds<00:02:17.220> sounds<00:02:17.819> incredible

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
and it's um it sounds sounds incredible

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.190 
and it's um it sounds sounds incredible
was<00:02:18.330> really<00:02:18.600> big<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.470> hyperdrive<00:02:20.459> has<00:02:20.490> these

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
was really big the hyperdrive has these

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.370 
was really big the hyperdrive has these
shallow<00:02:22.220> starcast<00:02:23.220> mounted<00:02:23.760> toms<00:02:24.630> which<00:02:25.200> give

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
shallow starcast mounted toms which give

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.890 
shallow starcast mounted toms which give
it<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.500> real<00:02:25.590> punch<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.250> they're<00:02:27.240> really<00:02:27.510> they

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
it a real punch and they're really they

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
it a real punch and they're really they
because<00:02:28.380> they're<00:02:28.560> attached<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.489> these<00:02:29.640> here

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
because they're attached to these here

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.520 
because they're attached to these here
and<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.120> lugs<00:02:30.420> are<00:02:30.600> not<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.989> drum<00:02:31.200> itself

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
and the lugs are not to the drum itself

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.360 
and the lugs are not to the drum itself
they<00:02:32.630> resonate<00:02:33.630> much<00:02:33.870> nicer<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.160> have<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
they resonate much nicer but have a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.449 
they resonate much nicer but have a
quick<00:02:35.640> decay<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.920> outcome<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.430> a

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
quick decay so the the outcome is a

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.699 
quick decay so the the outcome is a
really<00:02:38.760> strong<00:02:39.090> tone<00:02:39.780> without<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:41.030> ring<00:02:42.030> or<00:02:42.300> an

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
really strong tone without a ring or an

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.050 
really strong tone without a ring or an
unwanted<00:02:43.709> resonance<00:02:44.450> I've<00:02:45.830> got<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.060> samurai

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
unwanted resonance I've got the samurai

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.360 
unwanted resonance I've got the samurai
on<00:02:48.209> Cobra<00:02:48.480> jr.<00:02:48.870> pedal<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.860> only<00:02:50.040> difference

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
on Cobra jr. pedal the only difference

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.860 
on Cobra jr. pedal the only difference
is<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.640> doesn't<00:02:50.790> have<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.030> spring<00:02:51.450> which<00:02:51.630> goes

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
is it doesn't have a spring which goes

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.390 
is it doesn't have a spring which goes
underneath<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.630> here's<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.810> 13<00:02:55.550> by<00:02:56.550> 13

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
underneath here and here's the 13 by 13

for<00:02:59.400> 13<00:02:59.640> by<00:03:00.769> five<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:02.190> think

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
for 13 by five I think

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.930 
for 13 by five I think
snare<00:03:03.950> sounds<00:03:04.950> incredible<00:03:05.400> pretty<00:03:05.700> punchy

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
snare sounds incredible pretty punchy

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.800 
snare sounds incredible pretty punchy
really<00:03:06.330> snappy<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:08.060> love<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.180> air<00:03:09.360> drum<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:09.720> I

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
really snappy I love this air drum and I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.490 
really snappy I love this air drum and I
normally<00:03:10.140> use<00:03:10.319> a<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:12.660> Easter<00:03:12.930> 13<00:03:13.319> by<00:03:13.680> 7

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.949 

snare<00:03:17.070> drum<00:03:17.100> war<00:03:17.519> yeah<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.480> that's<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.840> lot

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
snare drum war yeah and that's a lot

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.539 
snare drum war yeah and that's a lot
deeper<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.380> that's<00:03:19.500> an<00:03:19.560> acrylic<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.489> I

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
deeper and that's an acrylic so but I

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.830 
deeper and that's an acrylic so but I
tuned<00:03:20.760> out<00:03:20.910> quite<00:03:21.180> high<00:03:21.329> so<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.720> quite

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
tuned out quite high so this is quite

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.210 
tuned out quite high so this is quite
nice<00:03:22.049> because<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:22.620> quite<00:03:22.799> high<00:03:22.980> pitch

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
nice because it's quite high pitch

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.960 
nice because it's quite high pitch
anyway<00:03:23.519> quite<00:03:23.880> punchy<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:25.730> haven't<00:03:26.730> filled<00:03:26.910> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
anyway quite punchy I haven't filled the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.280 
anyway quite punchy I haven't filled the
bass<00:03:27.120> drum<00:03:27.360> yet<00:03:27.540> because<00:03:27.750> I've<00:03:27.840> only<00:03:27.900> got<00:03:28.200> it

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290

master sound eyes you can see they've

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.229 
master sound eyes you can see they've
had<00:03:40.680> some<00:03:40.859> use<00:03:41.040> but<00:03:41.790> they<00:03:41.880> still<00:03:42.090> sound

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
had some use but they still sound

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.569 
had some use but they still sound
incredible<00:03:42.810> really<00:03:43.049> crisp<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:45.079> the

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
incredible really crisp and the the

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.590 
incredible really crisp and the the
slightly<00:03:47.750> wobbled<00:03:49.130> grooved<00:03:50.130> bottom<00:03:50.820> allows

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
slightly wobbled grooved bottom allows

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.520 
slightly wobbled grooved bottom allows
air<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:53.690> escape<00:03:54.690> through<00:03:54.959> these<00:03:55.140> bits<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.500> here

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
air to escape through these bits in here

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.130 
air to escape through these bits in here
now<00:03:56.250> they<00:03:56.489> didn't<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.090> they<00:03:57.239> create<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.690> vacuum

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
now they didn't and they create a vacuum

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.280 
now they didn't and they create a vacuum
at<00:03:58.820> Sabian<00:03:59.820> ax<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.600> Bulls<00:04:00.750> have<00:04:00.870> holes<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.200> the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.259 
at Sabian ax and Bulls have holes in the
