 of rougemont it is a test which is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.550

 sixth of the quinté reference the price 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.980
 universe ii 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.610
 Besides, we can see it in pictures 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 this quinté reference is very important 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.040

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.260
 find Saturday took part in this 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.000
 quinté plus so it's really a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.360
 test to look at all 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 seams 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.680

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.629
 selection of wholesaler idol clad 6th on 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.219

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.039
 really very interesting race the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.440
 last time his entourage is confident 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.359
 is fit and I think that ride a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.470
 a little closer he can create a 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.570
 big surprise in this event 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.710
 then the number 5 the friend serge we come 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.540
 see him second of the race reference 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.790
 it's the vincent tandem 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.170
 guillaume macaire is the basis of this 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 test and I think it will be one of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.320
 favorites 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.509
 difficult to go against him really he 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.970

 marcel rolland are in shape 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.650
 that's why the places and 3rd of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.869
 this selection is the same every 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.340
 lights are green really difficult 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.630
 to go against also then the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.829
 number 7 protect protect april 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.720
 protector he had finished fourth of 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.790
 price wild monarch last year in the beginning 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.210
 season in April and its end 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.710
 race in 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.420
 by the end of the year was really 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.049
 attractive to auteuil in a lot that 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.549
 was driving 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.229
 certainly he does go back but he is 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.440
 waiter guy cherel return 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.000
 generally well fresh and are really 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.770
 able to run from the start so this is 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.340
 for that I tried to place it 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.830
 quite high 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.080
 then the number 18 news line to 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.310
 rich he alternated the good and the least 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.190
 good on the racecourse audigane 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.380
 cagnes-sur-mer recently completed in the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.989
 price universe ii not very far from the 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.459
 race horses finished third 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.510
 this is the training of the unique 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.650
 single point point wins a lot of 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.959
 races right now it's also a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.580
 sure value we must we must to include it 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.840
 in our games then the number 4 of 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.040
 stomp the stomp finished with 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.330
 the best of his generation 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.510

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.530
 in the finished indy price 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.760
 suitably a sixth place this 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.540
 times and goes down from category c its 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.940
 first handicap 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.290

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.300
 the scale of values ​​he is able to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.980
 do something in this test 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.890
 then two numbers 8 form theft of 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.000
