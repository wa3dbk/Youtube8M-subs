as opposed to when they're out of high

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.910 
as opposed to when they're out of high
school<00:03:24.239> they'd<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.840> better<00:03:25.049> informed<00:03:25.380> and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920

better voters for life and of course we

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.539 
better voters for life and of course we
know<00:03:27.569> we<00:03:27.690> have<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> problem<00:03:28.829> getting<00:03:29.190> younger

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
know we have a problem getting younger

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.699 
know we have a problem getting younger
voters<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.180> vote<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.840> think<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.410> too<00:03:31.560> late

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
voters to vote but I think it's too late

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.440 
voters to vote but I think it's too late
we<00:03:31.920> lose<00:03:32.160> them<00:03:32.519> by<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.819> time<00:03:33.090> they're<00:03:33.299> in

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
we lose them by the time they're in

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.300 
we lose them by the time they're in
college<00:03:33.780> or<00:03:34.139> out<00:03:34.260> working<00:03:34.650> whenever<00:03:35.190> they're

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
college or out working whenever they're

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.830

doing<00:03:35.519> after<00:03:35.760> high<00:03:35.880> school<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.329> I<00:03:36.359> think<00:03:36.480> we<00:03:36.690> go

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
doing after high school so I think we go

marry more than one person well i think

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.199 
marry more than one person well i think
that<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.609> is<00:04:14.790> certainly<00:04:15.150> outdated<00:04:16.160> its

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
that that is certainly outdated its

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.580 
that that is certainly outdated its
polygamy<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.239> multiple<00:04:18.780> marriages<00:04:18.989> are<00:04:19.380> just

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
polygamy and multiple marriages are just

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.230 
polygamy and multiple marriages are just
not<00:04:20.720> made<00:04:21.720> for<00:04:21.750> this<00:04:21.989> country<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:23.060> don't<00:04:24.060> care

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
not made for this country I don't care

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.520 
not made for this country I don't care
about<00:04:24.330> other<00:04:24.570> countries<00:04:24.810> but<00:04:25.020> certainly<00:04:25.440> in

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
about other countries but certainly in

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.320 
about other countries but certainly in
the<00:04:25.590> United<00:04:25.830> States<00:04:25.889> we<00:04:26.250> have<00:04:26.280> law<00:04:26.669> with<00:04:26.970> no

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
the United States we have law with no

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.570 
the United States we have law with no
polygamy<00:04:27.810> allowed<00:04:28.050> since<00:04:28.320> 1890<00:04:28.710> I<00:04:29.250> think

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
polygamy allowed since 1890 I think

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.339 
polygamy allowed since 1890 I think
that's<00:04:29.729> important<00:04:30.270> I<00:04:30.450> like<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.020> fact<00:04:31.169> the

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
that's important I like the fact the

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:33.590 
that's important I like the fact the
Mormon<00:04:31.650> Church<00:04:31.680> did<00:04:32.310> change<00:04:32.700> its<00:04:33.000> it

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
Mormon Church did change its it

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.810 
Mormon Church did change its it
rule<00:04:34.020> on<00:04:34.230> that<00:04:34.260> I'm<00:04:35.100> hopeful<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.640> they<00:04:35.790> will

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
rule on that I'm hopeful that they will

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.870 
rule on that I'm hopeful that they will
use<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.120> same<00:04:36.570> rationale<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.620> stop<00:04:38.580> all

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
use that same rationale to stop all

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.490 
use that same rationale to stop all
their<00:04:39.060> anti-gay<00:04:39.390> activities<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:40.440> the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
their anti-gay activities and the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.750 
their anti-gay activities and the
campaign<00:04:40.890> front<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.400> way<00:04:41.550> they<00:04:41.730> treat

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
campaign front and the way they treat

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.020 
campaign front and the way they treat
their<00:04:42.660> members<00:04:43.170> who<00:04:43.320> happen<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.620> be<00:04:43.710> LGBT<00:04:44.030> so

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
their members who happen to be LGBT so

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.570 
their members who happen to be LGBT so
I'm<00:04:45.870> just<00:04:46.170> not<00:04:46.290> an<00:04:46.440> advocate<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:47.040> multiple

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
I'm just not an advocate of multiple

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.700 
I'm just not an advocate of multiple
marriage<00:04:47.850> but<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.120> think<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.690> we<00:04:49.350> certainly

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
marriage but I think that we certainly

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
are that there's a gay gene I've got a

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.040
