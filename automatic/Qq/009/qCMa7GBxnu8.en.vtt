ways<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:27.530> yeah<00:02:28.530> that's<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.070> car<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.520> turned

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
ways but yeah that's the car it turned

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.120 
ways but yeah that's the car it turned
out<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.120> well<00:02:30.630> now<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.440> have<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.650> do<00:02:31.860> is

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
out really well now all I have to do is

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.340 
out really well now all I have to do is
in<00:02:32.400> my<00:02:32.940> opinion<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.360> fun<00:02:33.660> part<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.140> was<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
in my opinion the fun part this was the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.500 
in my opinion the fun part this was the
not<00:02:34.710> fun<00:02:34.980> part<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.580> unfun<00:02:36.830> part<00:02:38.300> what's<00:02:39.300> next

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
not fun part the unfun part what's next

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.670 
not fun part the unfun part what's next
though<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:41.190> coding<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:42.600> now<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.500> go

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
though is the coding so now I just go

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.000 
though is the coding so now I just go
it's<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.460> be<00:02:44.550> fun<00:02:44.790> I'm<00:02:45.560> thinking<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
it's going to be fun I'm thinking of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.040 
it's going to be fun I'm thinking of
making<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.880> tire<00:02:48.180> trail<00:02:48.630> when<00:02:48.900> you're

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
making like a tire trail when you're

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.110 
making like a tire trail when you're
drifting<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.740> i'm<00:02:50.040> trying<00:02:50.400> i'm<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> try

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
drifting and i'm trying i'm going to try

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.440 
drifting and i'm trying i'm going to try
to<00:02:51.180> put<00:02:51.360> drifting<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:52.580> these<00:02:53.580> worthy<00:02:54.150> parts

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
to put drifting in these worthy parts

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.440 
to put drifting in these worthy parts
are<00:02:54.600> used<00:02:54.840> i<00:02:55.110> did<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.620> use<00:02:55.860> out<00:02:56.220> not<00:02:57.030> including

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
are used i did not use out not including

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.780 
are used i did not use out not including
the<00:02:57.570> wheel<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.410> steering<00:02:58.860> wheel<00:02:58.980> i<00:02:59.220> did

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
the wheel and the steering wheel i did

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.840 
the wheel and the steering wheel i did
not<00:02:59.880> use<00:03:00.030> any<00:03:00.270> other<00:03:00.420> parts<00:03:00.780> except<00:03:01.140> those<00:03:01.850> but

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
not use any other parts except those but

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.640 
not use any other parts except those but
as<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.390> was<00:03:03.510> saying<00:03:03.720> for<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.080> coating<00:03:04.500> I'm

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
as I was saying for the coating I'm

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.700 
as I was saying for the coating I'm
going<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.100> try<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.780> make<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:07.140> able<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.440> drift

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
going to try to make it be able to drift

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.690 
going to try to make it be able to drift
that<00:03:08.160> would<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:08.340> nice<00:03:08.720> make<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.870> turning

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
that would be nice make the turning

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.370 
that would be nice make the turning
gradual<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.360> either<00:03:12.660> you're<00:03:12.930> turning

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
gradual not like either you're turning

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.510 
gradual not like either you're turning
or<00:03:13.500> you're<00:03:13.650> going<00:03:13.740> straight<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.070> want<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.400> make

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
or you're going straight I want to make

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.300 
or you're going straight I want to make
it<00:03:14.640> like<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.840> can<00:03:15.989> turn<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.920> or<00:03:17.250> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
it like you can turn a little or a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.570 
it like you can turn a little or a
little<00:03:17.730> more<00:03:17.880> or<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.390> lot<00:03:19.310> it's<00:03:20.310> hard<00:03:20.489> to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
little more or a lot it's hard to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.240 
little more or a lot it's hard to
explain<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.860> realistic<00:03:22.860> i'm<00:03:22.980> going<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.190> try

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
explain but realistic i'm going to try

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.199 
explain but realistic i'm going to try
to<00:03:23.340> make<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.610> turning<00:03:23.910> realistic<00:03:25.489> uh<00:03:26.489> with<00:03:27.060> a

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
to make the turning realistic uh with a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.820 
to make the turning realistic uh with a
trail<00:03:27.720> when<00:03:27.930> you're<00:03:28.050> drifting<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.650> would<00:03:28.739> be

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
trail when you're drifting that would be

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.979 
trail when you're drifting that would be
cool<00:03:29.040> like<00:03:29.459> marks<00:03:30.030> on<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.270> ground<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.750> bet<00:03:30.959> that

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
cool like marks on the ground I bet that

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.610 
cool like marks on the ground I bet that
shouldn't<00:03:31.350> be<00:03:31.410> too<00:03:31.440> hard<00:03:33.260> what<00:03:34.260> else<00:03:34.410> am<00:03:34.500> I

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
shouldn't be too hard what else am I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
shouldn't be too hard what else am I
going<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.800> code<00:03:35.040> uh<00:03:36.950> maybe<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.070> nice<00:03:38.250> camera

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
going to code uh maybe a nice camera

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.330 
going to code uh maybe a nice camera
sweep<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.690> very<00:03:39.900> beginning<00:03:40.050> like<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.190> it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
sweep in the very beginning like so it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.500 
sweep in the very beginning like so it
gets<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.880> 360<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.660> car<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:46.610> oh<00:03:47.610> oh<00:03:48.120> one<00:03:48.360> more

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
gets a 360 of the car and oh oh one more

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.729 
gets a 360 of the car and oh oh one more
thing<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:49.700> gradually<00:03:50.700> increases<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.420> speed

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
thing it gradually increases in speed

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.900 
thing it gradually increases in speed
actually<00:03:52.739> that<00:03:52.920> that's<00:03:53.190> already<00:03:53.430> built<00:03:53.640> into

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
actually that that's already built into

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.820 
actually that that's already built into
the<00:03:54.030> game<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.209> what<00:03:54.600> isn't<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.260> sound<00:03:55.650> of

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
the game but what isn't is the sound of

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.620 
the game but what isn't is the sound of
the<00:03:55.920> engine<00:03:56.280> if<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.610> can<00:03:56.760> get<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.970> engine<00:03:57.360> sound

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
the engine if I can get the engine sound

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.400 
the engine if I can get the engine sound
too<00:03:57.870> like<00:03:58.050> rev<00:03:58.440> up<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.830> would<00:03:59.070> be<00:03:59.220> sweet<00:04:00.410> so

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
too like rev up that would be sweet so

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.800 
too like rev up that would be sweet so
