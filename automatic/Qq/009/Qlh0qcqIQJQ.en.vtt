00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that's the way I think about it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.950

and<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.680> part<00:01:22.980> of<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.250> heritage<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.060> Who<00:01:24.870> I

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and it is part of my heritage and Who I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.470 
and it is part of my heritage and Who I

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
I think Ed's the silent Buddha who

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
I think Ed's the silent Buddha who
doesn't<00:01:31.350> speak<00:01:31.800> much<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.460> he<00:01:32.520> does<00:01:32.729> it's

at<00:02:38.549> this<00:02:38.730> point<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.299> we<00:02:39.360> don't<00:02:39.630> make<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
at this point if we don't make it to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.750 
at this point if we don't make it to
where<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.590> think<00:02:40.890> we're<00:02:41.100> going<00:02:41.130> or<00:02:41.430> screwed

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
let's see if we can figure out where we

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.789 
let's see if we can figure out where we
are<00:02:43.709> with<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.070> terrain<00:02:44.370> Association<00:02:45.799> dude
