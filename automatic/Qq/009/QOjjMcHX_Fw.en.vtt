00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.170
 the first problem of water is its use 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.410
 almost 80% is destined to irrigation 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.209
 agricultural because so much so that an 80 to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.050
 90 percent of the 2 that are those of 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.410
 irrigation is lost by filtration the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.410
 nutrients 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.030
 not everything we have in the field are 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.789
 the solution proposed by this engineer 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.980
 polytechnic is the solid rain in this 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.069
 product the moment you are in contact 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.800
 with water generations that what 

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:45.839
 we do adorando improved side this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.170
 allows that the reduces are absorbed co2 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.989
 any plants or any vegetable 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.179
 take easily or doubt like this the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.059
 water does not infiltrate and it is not necessary and 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.230
 water again in several weeks and only 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.200
 what the plant needs is consumed 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.720
 a house of service not of the operation 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.140
 surely they will be able to watch 3,800 mobs 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.810
 not to export since not even 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.119
 enough for high consumption 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.780
 it does not change the techniques are reached 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.780
 averages 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.970
 according to specialists other 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.490
 advantage of solid rain is that it does not 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.950
 have side effects we can enter 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:35.540
 in a technical discussion that is not 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.270
 organic but I always tell them a 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.120
 little story of the balance let's put it 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.080
 in the balance the serious problem of 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.220
 the water crisis 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.160
 against a polymer that until now 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.690
 all scientific evidence demonstrates 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:58.450
 that its metabolism is not causing 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.810
 collateral damage my hook to be 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.210
 not even human and irritation at 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.040
 direct contact with substance ni 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.050
 even the intake of the substance 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.729
 causes some discomfort the next 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.680
 experiment is an alternative to 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.080
 problem of drought in the north of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.300
 country 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.300
 This dust is known as rain 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.050
 solid when added in water forms a 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.810
 solid body in a matter of minutes 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.330
 is the use of a polymer that 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.690
 we do not know as just about water 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.170
 but do not be water 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.750
 and we use it to solidify your palm 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.530
 in jaguars it is a polymer that 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.510
 absorbs five hundred times its weight in water 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.120
 It was created by a graduate of the institute 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.670
 National Polytechnic is a formula of 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.680
 potassium polyacrylate that allows 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.520
 imitate liquids and rehydrate 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.520
 for 10 years 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.010
 the solid state water contain moisture 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.940
 or environments the roots the buildings their 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.860
 dreams and the best 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.660
 and it is only containing what the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.690
 plant 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.040
 which represents we can reduce the 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.080
 risk costs a 70 80 percent the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.780
 technique is already applied successfully 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.600
 in towns of veracruz michoacÃ¡n el 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.500
 federal district and Jalisco we have 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.500
 places like 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.790
 where they barely managed things 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.050
 they were looking for popular neighborhoods 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.270
 but it has already crossed borders 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.700
 South America europe either already use it 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.100
 help in the cultivation of pastures forests 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.770
 greenhouse fields and especially in the 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.990
 food production to face 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.760
 the problems of drought the engineer 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.940
 rico velasco had an approach with 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.790
 federal authorities but he just stayed 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.460
 in an interview but you think it's 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.490
 fantasy because they are not willing to 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.800
 be beyond strictly 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.500
 responsible how things change with 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.210
 this technology although the rain stops 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.790
 Plant remains growing 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.130
 and what is most important when 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.260
 rains are finished do not miss the 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.120
 crops 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.319
 we have a reserve of olivera in the 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.359
 root 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.639
 that allows the plant to finish its 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.460
 Christ and development rise up 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.320
 harvests although here a month before 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.780
 stopped light the researcher has pointed out 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.930
 that this product can be used in 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.180
 all kinds of vegetation such as pastures or 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.820
 forests and especially in the sector 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.940
 agricultural this technique has proven its 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.630
 effectiveness since 2005 after it 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.569
 applied to corn crops in the state 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.899
 western jalisco
