00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
alright when you want to start working

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.539 
alright when you want to start working
with<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.000> stylus<00:00:12.769> there's<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.860> little<00:00:14.130> screw

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
with the stylus there's a little screw

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.120 
with the stylus there's a little screw
at<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.030> point<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:16.590> change<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
at the point here that you change the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.880 
at the point here that you change the
points<00:00:17.460> by<00:00:17.580> loosening<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> screw<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.890> turn

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
points by loosening the screw just turn

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.310 
points by loosening the screw just turn
that<00:00:19.920> screw<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.609> half<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.420> turn<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.990> that'll

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
that screw a half a turn and that'll

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.019 
that screw a half a turn and that'll
loosen<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.890> point<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:23.760> put

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
loosen the point and you can then put

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.330 
loosen the point and you can then put
another<00:00:24.269> point<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:25.019> if<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.680> loosen<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.099> too

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
another point in if you loosen it too

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.070 
another point in if you loosen it too
much<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.029> fall<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.810> screw

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
much it's going to fall out that screw

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.330 
much it's going to fall out that screw
is<00:00:28.170> going<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.470> hot<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.859> you're<00:00:28.980> gonna<00:00:29.099> hack

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
is going to be hot and you're gonna hack

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.580 
is going to be hot and you're gonna hack
a<00:00:29.369> darn<00:00:29.849> time<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.840> hot<00:00:31.080> screw<00:00:31.410> back

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
a darn time to get that hot screw back

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.799 
a darn time to get that hot screw back
in<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:32.040> again<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:32.880> turn<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.480> half<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
in there again so just turn it a half a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
in there again so just turn it a half a
turn<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.070> different<00:00:35.640> points<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.030> work

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
turn we have different points to work

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630 
turn we have different points to work
with<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> triangle<00:00:37.530> shaped<00:00:38.340> piece

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
with we have this triangle shaped piece

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.010 
with we have this triangle shaped piece
this<00:00:39.540> round<00:00:40.280> piece<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:42.180> little<00:00:42.420> pen<00:00:42.719> point

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this round piece the little pen point

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.360 
this round piece the little pen point
like<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.360> small<00:00:46.039> mini<00:00:47.039> iron

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
like this here is a very small mini iron

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.119 
like this here is a very small mini iron
shape<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.570> which<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.860> find

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
shape like that which I think I find

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.639 
shape like that which I think I find
this<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.460> most<00:00:50.670> useful<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
this the most useful one right there and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.819 
this the most useful one right there and
a<00:00:53.010> wire<00:00:53.370> brush<00:00:53.870> now<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> wire<00:00:55.199> brush<00:00:55.620> you

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
a wire brush now the wire brush you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.680 
a wire brush now the wire brush you
can't<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.550> use<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> paintbrush

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
can't really use like a paintbrush

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
can't really use like a paintbrush
unless<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.559> want<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> cause<00:00:59.399> yourself

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
unless you want to just cause yourself

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
unless you want to just cause yourself
all<00:01:00.000> kinds<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.359> grief<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> little

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
all kinds of grief because the little

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.390 
all kinds of grief because the little
wire<00:01:01.649> bristles<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.989> will<00:01:03.989> twist<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
wire bristles here will twist all up and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.490 
wire bristles here will twist all up and
then<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.450> take<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> sharp<00:01:06.990> tool<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
then you have to take a sharp tool and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
then you have to take a sharp tool and
straighten<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.310> each<00:01:08.729> piece<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> wire<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
straighten out each piece of wire so the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830 
straighten out each piece of wire so the
way<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> use<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.010> mostly<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.939> drag<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
way I use this is mostly to drag it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.219 
way I use this is mostly to drag it
through<00:01:12.869> wax<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.090> dragging<00:01:15.630> motion<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
through wax and in a dragging motion and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.880 
through wax and in a dragging motion and
create<00:01:16.530> sort<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.920> feathery<00:01:17.340> effect<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
create sort of a feathery effect with it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.010 
create sort of a feathery effect with it
it's<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:19.979> less<00:01:20.580> trouble<00:01:21.119> using<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.780> way

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it's just less trouble using it that way

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.050 
it's just less trouble using it that way
but<00:01:22.259> let's<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.100> pen<00:01:23.430> point<00:01:23.759> for

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
but let's take this pen point for

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.330 
but let's take this pen point for
instance<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:25.049> lets<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.799> kinds<00:01:25.830> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
instance this lets you do all kinds of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.359 
instance this lets you do all kinds of
very<00:01:26.549> detailed<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:28.110> lines<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
very detailed little lines like this and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.350 
very detailed little lines like this and
so<00:01:30.180> let's<00:01:31.049> say<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.100> later<00:01:32.369> talked<00:01:33.030> about

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so let's say when we later talked about

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.179 
so let's say when we later talked about
working<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.869> rubber<00:01:34.110> stamps<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.799> lets<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
working with rubber stamps this lets you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.060 
working with rubber stamps this lets you
do<00:01:35.369> very<00:01:35.640> detailed<00:01:36.229> designs<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> point

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
do very detailed designs with the point

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.240 
do very detailed designs with the point
for<00:01:38.939> instance<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.689> touch<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
for instance you can just touch that to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.730 
for instance you can just touch that to
the<00:01:41.369> wax<00:01:41.610> block<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.750> wax<00:01:42.990> sucks<00:01:43.470> up

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the wax block and the wax sucks up

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.950 
the wax block and the wax sucks up
inside<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.090> pin<00:01:45.299> point<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.689> an<00:01:45.810> old

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
inside that little pin point like an old

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.380 
inside that little pin point like an old
quill<00:01:46.290> pen<00:01:46.619> holds<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> melted<00:01:47.880> wax<00:01:48.030> right

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
quill pen holds the melted wax right

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.440 
quill pen holds the melted wax right
between<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.049> two<00:01:49.079> nibs<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.000> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
between the two nibs like that and you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.910 
between the two nibs like that and you
could<00:01:51.630> touch<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.320> card

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
could touch it to the card

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.219
