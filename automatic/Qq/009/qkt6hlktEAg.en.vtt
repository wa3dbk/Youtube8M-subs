actually<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:36.469> don't<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.680> like

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
actually in this one I don't really like

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.000 
actually in this one I don't really like
the<00:00:38.040> volume<00:00:38.340> buttons<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.820> Xperia<00:00:39.660> phones<00:00:40.010> are

the volume buttons and Xperia phones are

00:00:41.010 --> 00:01:19.499 
the volume buttons and Xperia phones are
quite<00:00:41.219> horrible

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.880 

okay<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:20.569> it's<00:01:20.990> not<00:01:21.049> up<00:01:21.259> here<00:01:21.469> all<00:01:21.799> in<00:01:22.069> the<00:01:22.250> air

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
okay so it's not up here all in the air

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:33.500 
okay so it's not up here all in the air
on<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:27.549> on<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.700> m2

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.740 

and<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.370> a<00:01:35.430> cool<00:01:35.610> pocket<00:01:35.910> game<00:01:36.300> off<00:01:36.510> games

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and this is a cool pocket game off games

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
and this is a cool pocket game off games
they're<00:01:36.990> actually<00:01:37.260> working<00:01:37.440> quite<00:01:37.590> well<00:01:37.830> here

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
they're actually working quite well here

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.360 
they're actually working quite well here
on<00:01:38.910> this<00:01:39.090> m2<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.840> m2<00:01:40.440> is<00:01:40.740> not<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> best

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
on this m2 and m2 is not like the best

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.820 
on this m2 and m2 is not like the best
to<00:01:41.580> myself<00:01:41.910> there<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:43.080> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.260> still<00:01:43.530> play

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
to myself there but if you still play

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.550 
to myself there but if you still play
this<00:01:43.890> game<00:01:44.190> one<00:01:44.370> starter<00:01:44.760> very<00:01:45.000> impressive<00:01:48.560> of

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
this game one starter very impressive of

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.780 
this game one starter very impressive of
course<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.010> doesn't<00:01:50.190> have<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> 1080p

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
course it doesn't have a 1080p

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:03.300 
course it doesn't have a 1080p
displaying<00:01:51.630> such<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.380> still<00:01:53.090> pretty<00:01:54.090> cool

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.839 

I<00:02:05.399> don't<00:02:06.399> notice<00:02:06.640> any<00:02:07.060> single<00:02:07.530> frame<00:02:08.530> problem

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.820 

or<00:02:12.849> anything<00:02:13.090> like<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.500> which<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.680> quite

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
or anything like that which is quite

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:29.479 
or anything like that which is quite
nice

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.949 

now<00:02:30.489> let's<00:02:30.760> say<00:02:30.999> she<00:02:31.209> got<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.510> bigger<00:02:31.749> bowl

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
now let's say she got the bigger bowl

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.720 
now let's say she got the bigger bowl
here<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:36.599> Xperia<00:02:37.599> z2<00:02:38.189> which<00:02:39.189> I<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.519> already

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
here the Xperia z2 which I can already

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.610 
here the Xperia z2 which I can already
see<00:02:39.999> as<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> way<00:02:40.359> better<00:02:40.599> display<00:02:41.079> more<00:02:41.319> clear

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
see as a way better display more clear

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.629 
see as a way better display more clear
from<00:02:41.889> a<00:02:41.920> two<00:02:42.159> inch<00:02:42.340> display<00:02:42.700> here<00:02:42.909> versus<00:02:43.329> only

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
from a two inch display here versus only

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:50.240 
from a two inch display here versus only
only<00:02:45.639> only<00:02:45.819> only<00:02:46.120> only<00:02:46.359> eight<00:02:46.780> let's<00:02:47.409> see<00:02:47.530> here

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.429 

what's<00:02:51.250> compensating<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:55.439> good

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
what's compensating I think so good

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.020 
what's compensating I think so good
before<00:02:56.769> whatever<00:02:56.859> one<00:02:57.340> thing<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.579> open<00:02:57.879> date

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
before whatever one thing is open date

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.970 
before whatever one thing is open date
but<00:02:58.900> yeah<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.169> one<00:02:59.379> definitely<00:02:59.469> way<00:02:59.950> better

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
but yeah this one definitely way better

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.709 
but yeah this one definitely way better
it's<00:03:00.370> more<00:03:00.549> performance<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.329> all<00:03:01.419> feels<00:03:01.659> a

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
it's more performance it all feels a

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.449 
it's more performance it all feels a
little<00:03:01.780> bit<00:03:01.930> better<00:03:02.109> in<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:02.620> end<00:03:02.799> a<00:03:03.219> little

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
little bit better in the end a little

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.879 
little bit better in the end a little
bit<00:03:03.639> more<00:03:03.819> lightweight<00:03:04.409> the<00:03:05.409> glass<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:05.859> the

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
bit more lightweight the glass on the

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.679 
bit more lightweight the glass on the
back<00:03:06.129> feels<00:03:06.430> better<00:03:06.519> feels<00:03:07.180> like<00:03:07.359> an<00:03:07.480> embedded

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
back feels better feels like an embedded

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.470 
back feels better feels like an embedded
great<00:03:09.389> used<00:03:10.389> f5<00:03:10.750> into<00:03:10.989> each<00:03:11.109> display<00:03:11.379> then

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
great used f5 into each display then

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.050 
great used f5 into each display then
it's<00:03:13.480> nice<00:03:14.310> there's<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.400> little<00:03:15.579> bit<00:03:15.669> bigger

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
it's nice there's a little bit bigger

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.610 
it's nice there's a little bit bigger
than<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.419> galaxy<00:03:16.840> s2

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.380 

also<00:03:23.340> there's<00:03:23.489> something<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.940> are<00:03:24.030> there<00:03:24.209> with

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
also there's something we are there with

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.979 
also there's something we are there with
the<00:03:24.510> sound<00:03:24.870> on<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.560> ammeter<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.330> goes<00:03:27.630> up

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
the sound on the ammeter it is goes up

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:46.530 
the sound on the ammeter it is goes up
wherever<00:03:28.920> we<00:03:29.220> are<00:03:29.370> there<00:03:29.670> we<00:03:29.970> lost<00:03:30.180> stage

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.449 

but<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:47.689> one<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.079> feels<00:03:48.319> so<00:03:48.620> much<00:03:48.829> better

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
but this one is feels so much better

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.130 
but this one is feels so much better
holding<00:03:49.879> it<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.150> your<00:03:50.269> hand<00:03:50.450> but<00:03:50.659> also<00:03:50.989> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
holding it in your hand but also the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.800 
holding it in your hand but also the
performance<00:03:52.239> really<00:03:53.239> really<00:03:53.510> impressive

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
performance really really impressive

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.009 
performance really really impressive
here<00:03:54.200> oh<00:03:56.409> my<00:03:57.409> god<00:03:58.420> probably<00:03:59.420> one<00:03:59.689> of<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> best

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
here oh my god probably one of the best

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:10.940 
here oh my god probably one of the best
devices<00:04:00.409> I<00:04:00.709> had<00:04:01.069> in<00:04:01.189> my<00:04:01.280> hand
