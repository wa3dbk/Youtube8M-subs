already a jar file so we're not going to
have<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.890> do<00:02:26.980> much<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.460> in<00:02:27.730> fact<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.120> is

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
have to do much of this in fact this is

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.940 
have to do much of this in fact this is
one<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.600> simplest<00:02:28.930> installations<00:02:29.710> I've

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
one of the simplest installations I've

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.760 
one of the simplest installations I've
ever<00:02:30.160> seen<00:02:30.459> we<00:02:31.030> just<00:02:31.209> right<00:02:31.450> click<00:02:31.720> go<00:02:31.930> copy

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
ever seen we just right click go copy

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.070 
ever seen we just right click go copy
then<00:02:33.550> we<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.820> close<00:02:34.060> down<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.480> window<00:02:34.660> as

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
then we can close down this window as

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.990 
then we can close down this window as
we're<00:02:35.290> done<00:02:35.380> with<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.860> click<00:02:36.490> on<00:02:36.610> your<00:02:36.730> dot

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
and that's pretty much it all the only

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.510 
and that's pretty much it all the only
thing<00:02:47.050> left<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.380> do<00:02:47.500> now<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.310> load

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
thing left to do now is to load

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.540 
thing left to do now is to load
minecraft<00:02:49.420> itself<00:02:50.110> there<00:02:50.980> we<00:02:51.100> go<00:02:51.250> there's
