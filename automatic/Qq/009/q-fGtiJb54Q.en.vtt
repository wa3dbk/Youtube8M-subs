00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.070
 hello welcome to this new guide 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.049
 dark souls in which we will continue 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.080
 playing with an arsonist in the city 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.119
 infested in this guide let's see how 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.560
 you get the katana light or which 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.529
 It is located in a quite area 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.470
 hard to reach is katana is a 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.689
 very good skill weapon is very similar 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.240
 to the Chicatana in terms of movement 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.179
 and hurt the only differences with it 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.370
 is that the sword has a requirement 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.820
 higher in dexterity than scale 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:42.010
 slightly better with the dexterity 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.620
 has a strong attack a little more 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.410
 quick that what you earn and that your attack 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.080
 long with two hands is more is greater 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.930
 good in short very good weapon for 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.930
 tv and for pvp is also a very good 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.050
 weapon for the pyro matiko since at 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.750
 work with the skill then 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.550
 we also increase the speed of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.130
 casting spells 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.160
 so it is highly recommended if you choose 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.020
 this class this difference in launching the 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.990
 faster spells makes the thousand of 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.590
 skills are more advisable for the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.350
 arsonists especially if we play pvp in 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.060
 tve the truth is that it does not influence either 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.530
 so much and we can play quietly with 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.360
 a skillful force as I am doing 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.490
 I say it in my videos 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.830
 well let's see how this is achieved 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.870
 super weapon 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.150
 we started from the first bonfire of the 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.360
 cold civil state 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.760
 which we saw how to get from the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.850
 sewers in the previous video and good and 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.890
 instead of serving by the way we 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.110
 it would take deeper in the city 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.330
 infested as we deviate 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.480
 on the other side that's because I'm 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.640
 seeing 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.560
 where are we these little people 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.990
 and we beat them as you see I'm going to armed 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.230
 with chainmail armor here I was 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.460
 forgot to equip me the gargoyle helmet 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.470
 which is better than the one I carry and good 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.680
 growing a big blow because I ask for 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.030
 the back with left button and good and 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.160
 I wear the spider shield that protects me 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.930
 of the poison and that is very useful in the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.060
 infested city 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.060
 the reinforced club 6 and that's 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.020
 and of rings I wear a ring that goes up 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.930
 life when 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.700
 when we kill an enemy and the ring of 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.700
 haven that allows me to carry more cargo 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.700
 good anyway for this what 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.170
 I'm telling you, it does not influence 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.180
 decisively for the people who are 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.970
 making the way of piro manti co that 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.689
 as I do not recommend that you see 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.569
 well then here's what this is 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.560
 killing these little people these dogs 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.440
 which are quite 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.660
 cabroncetes because then when we do 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.780
 the jump to get the option to tana 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.790
 sorry to get the katana light or 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.970
 if we find that we will ask questions in 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.520
 surface and they will take away enough life 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.300
 what happens if we kill these 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.250
 enemies before 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.680
 almost a 99% chance that we 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.080
 kill us on the floor and that 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.090
 we are dead instead in this way 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.560
 then we can try the jump several 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.660
 times 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.860
 and if we fail we will simply see 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.110
 a portion quotes of these and nothing and 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.180
 we will repeat the jump and we can 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.590
 try it several times and if we fail 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.850
 much then in that case we will have 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.240
 to go back to rest in the bonfire 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.370
 well here I am already practicing as I go 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.890
 to make the jump the peculiarity of this 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.960
 jump that you are going to see is that it is not worth 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.490
 like when we went back 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.250
 operated not dead with simply 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.460
 approach the edge or go running and 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.240
 make a jump attack 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:16.110
 with strong advance not if we do that 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.190
 for much though we go naked and without 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:22.440
 load we will not make the jump 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.330
 so then how good is this 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.660
 You will ask yourselves good I am the truth 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.660
 is that 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.830
 I watched a Youtube video and I was not able 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.840
 of 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.630
 but who do this if I'm not able 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.600
 to do this jump and after much 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.160
 try it then looking in forums because 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.139
 there was a bit of the solution as it turns out 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.139
 that there was a movement 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.280
 in data that I had not used 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.009
 and only one of these from this moment and 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.520
 look that the game was not over and it was 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:01.389
 the jump and how this jump is achieved 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.580
 it is very easy in good these these 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.680
 little people that are not very difficult 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.810
 well what I was saying is that for 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.710
 make the jump that you will see later 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.030
 then you have to press the button 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.350
 I do not speak on pc which is where I am 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.500
 Playing 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.420
 in consoles will have to do similar 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.280
 but slightly different then you have to 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:28.610
 press and hold the s button 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.610
 the button to roll and then we will run 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.610
 faster than usual 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.930
 then while we are running 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.270
 we will press lightly again this 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.949
 button and then we will execute a jump 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.979
 this jump is much farther than if 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:49.460
 we were just running without 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.260
 press the roll button and let's give a 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.090
 jump attack 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.760
 so good if we want to guarantee 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.310
 that we are going to make that jump even more 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.600
 far we put ourselves in balls that is 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.450
 where else will we run and here in the background 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.480
 well we get closer we look and see that 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.840
 little person that corpse there is 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.670
 this this super weapon that is going to be 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.250
 very useful as we have commented to 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.830
 principle and that we will come very well 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.220
 for a skillful one 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:25.290
 We focus on the wood and I tell you 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.290
 leave the roll button pressed 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:35.160
 we press again and that's it and we paste 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:36.639
 there is a jump and here we have the ayto 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.080
 good 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.240
 There has been one thing that 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.770
 well do not comment a little 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.039
 characteristics that is it seemed the 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:50.590
 chicatana and has also the property 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:50.590
 to bleed the enemy 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.070
 and when we do bleed it 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.620
 remove yet 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.750
 a third of the good life here the 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.940
 you have as you see a very cool sword 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.950
 pity that I am using a vile d 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.440
 of strength as you will know what is 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.240
 following would be good because that has been 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.780
 everything for today I hope you liked it 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.480

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:19.370
 I like to subscribe , you know what 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.370
