 that ronaldinho is not going to be the patron of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.010
 Queretaro's staff since it reaches the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.780
 team as one more although it was admitted 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.370

 Antonio Naelson Sinha said that the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.470
 Ronaldinho's arrival to the team will give him 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 a new perspective to the whole without 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.149
 However, only team work 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.100
 will give good results while 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.079
 He affirmed that not everything depends on a player 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.760
 and that the squad is working to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.940
 correct the mistakes made in the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.940
 past 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.480
 for that part and happy because it's a 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.000
 game different from a player written on 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.550
 world has admired all life and will come 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.460
 to be by his side to us 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.019
 he's happy for me it 's a privilege 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 have it here by I think that for all 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.149
 those of us who are part of that campus is a 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.460
 priority to have here and hopefully 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:08.289
 both he and we understand that 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.200
 we all want to win something here, not that 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.690
 be eating add to a project that 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.390
 from the beginning is to fight for something 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.039
 important that so far it is not 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.750
 has contemplated a change in the 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.250
 game outline of ignacio ambríz and 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.440
 will continue as in the beginning of the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.119
 season if we do not focus 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.149
 at work, nothing will work 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.649
 admire if we will continue to admire but the 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.400
 day by day you have to work so that 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.470
 the team can 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.750
 flow and can give the result until the 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.290
 moment we have not changed anything has not 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.520
 said nothing of a tactical question or 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.080
 some movement that can be done 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.320
 different to the one they came to the child I think 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.110
 what 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.220
 it would not change much because a player of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.200
 game that I can play on the court 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.270
 He said that it will be a privilege to play 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.190
 before people in the next day since 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.320
