layer of snow organizers tell us it's an

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
layer of snow organizers tell us it's an
exhilarating<00:00:30.300> way<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.810> kick<00:00:31.050> off<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.260> new

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
exhilarating way to kick off the new

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.930 
exhilarating way to kick off the new
year<00:00:32.239> yeah<00:00:33.239> but<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:35.250> bad<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
year yeah but it's not as bad as you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610 
year yeah but it's not as bad as you
think<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.780> go<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> water<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
think it is if you go in the water in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.250 
think it is if you go in the water in
the<00:00:37.649> spring<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> year<00:00:38.270> it<00:00:39.270> hurts<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the spring of the year it hurts for a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260 
the spring of the year it hurts for a
simple<00:00:40.590> reason<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> water<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.579> 40<00:00:41.940> degrees

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
simple reason is the water is 40 degrees

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
simple reason is the water is 40 degrees
then<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> air<00:00:43.590> temperature<00:00:43.860> could<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.160> 70

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
then and the air temperature could be 70

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.600 
then and the air temperature could be 70
now<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.690> water<00:00:46.469> temperature<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.010> 40<00:00:47.219> degrees

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
now the water temperature is 40 degrees

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540 
now the water temperature is 40 degrees
and<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.450> air<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.750> colder<00:00:49.530> than<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.770> water<00:00:49.800> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and the air is colder than the water so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.979 
and the air is colder than the water so
actually<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.059> warmer<00:00:51.420> than<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> water<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
actually it's warmer than the water that

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.130 
actually it's warmer than the water that
is<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> air<00:00:52.500> does<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.550> sense<00:00:54.140> not

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
is in the air does it make sense not

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.680 
is in the air does it make sense not
really<00:00:55.530> don't<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> water<00:00:57.059> or<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
really don't be in the water or in the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
really don't be in the water or in the
air<00:00:57.840> would<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.770> guess<00:00:59.039> most<00:00:59.280> people's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
air would be the I guess most people's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
air would be the I guess most people's
take<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> 161<00:01:00.780> people<00:01:01.379> thought<00:01:01.649> otherwise

take on a 161 people thought otherwise

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.860 
take on a 161 people thought otherwise
though<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.489> were<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.449> water<00:01:03.629> day

though and they were in the water day

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.299 
though and they were in the water day
that's<00:01:04.080> 11<00:01:04.379> more<00:01:04.409> people<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:04.949> took<00:01:05.100> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that's 11 more people then took that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.359 
that's 11 more people then took that
same<00:01:05.519> plunge<00:01:05.880> last<00:01:06.510> year<00:01:07.220> sensible<00:01:08.220> about

same plunge last year sensible about

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.670 
same plunge last year sensible about
that<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.030> their<00:01:09.240> experience<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.500> it's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
that it is their experience and it's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.170 
that it is their experience and it's
absolutely<00:01:11.100> no<00:01:11.250> sense<00:01:11.549> would<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> rather<00:01:12.030> be
