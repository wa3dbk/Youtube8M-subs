00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.600
 to a new video of game with more 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.519
 children's toys I have something today 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.429
 other things for you and that the city â€‹â€‹people 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.410
 livestock often needs some of modeling clay 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.139
 you may know that it is one 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.600
 creative material similar to kneading 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 I would almost say but this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.039
 material then you have to burn so that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.850
 whole hardens so in principle in the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.859
 do oven 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.560
 you can make all sorts of material out of the material 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.990
 things shape from figures to pearls 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.550
 whatever attachments are there 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.329
 creativity really no limits 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.250
 set 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.440
 I would say I'll do it now 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.489
 little in the review and we are looking 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.489
 give us a closer look 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:53.969
 we have some colors here at fimo's 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.989
 There are now a total of twelve pieces in blue 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.020
 light blue green brown gray black purple 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.899
 pink red orange yellow and white 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.270
 and I would say you hit me 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.430
 so to speak, before what emerges from these colors 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.110
 should form 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.780
 at the end, the whole is then burned 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.900
 or not done in the oven 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.600
 more than 130 degrees or I believe in 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.670
 ten degrees are used for this and this 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.229
 things that come out of it lost 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.150
 I will give you or give away to you 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.509
 how I do that exactly I still know 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.400
 Not 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.130
 So you just write in the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.409
 comments from this video like me 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.990
 So much should use this much 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.630
 I should make out of it figures trailer 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.500
 whatever just writes in the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.990
 comments are creative and these things 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.930
 I'll do it in the oven and then 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.369
 Finally, you can then this figure 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.820
 has trailer whatever the end 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.320
 when rauskommt win 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.890
 I hope you have a few now 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.979
 suggestions so let your creativity 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.600
 Freerunning 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.520
 Give me a thumbs up 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.469
 leave me a comment and forget 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.300
 Of course not to subscribe to the channel 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.390
 See you next time 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.390
 is
