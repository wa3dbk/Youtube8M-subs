00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
and that's essentially where this list

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.340 
and that's essentially where this list
of<00:02:22.400> lodges<00:02:22.790> came<00:02:23.030> for

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
of lodges came for

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.310 
of lodges came for
but<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.250> think<00:02:24.400> what<00:02:24.700> makes<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.420> beautiful

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
but I think what makes it a beautiful

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.990 
but I think what makes it a beautiful
book<00:02:27.120> more<00:02:29.040> certainly<00:02:30.040> less<00:02:30.250> from<00:02:30.460> my<00:02:30.580> writing

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
book more certainly less from my writing

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.090 
book more certainly less from my writing
but<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.270> fact<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.570> Rizzoli<00:02:32.020> truly<00:02:32.860> knows

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
but the fact that Rizzoli truly knows

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.040 
but the fact that Rizzoli truly knows
how<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.400> put<00:02:33.670> these<00:02:33.850> books<00:02:34.060> together<00:02:34.300> they<00:02:34.990> do

how to put these books together they do

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.130
