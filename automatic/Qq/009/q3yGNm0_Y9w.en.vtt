 Laggenbeck 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.210
 9 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.539
 9 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.809
 Berlin 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 such a people today I show you here own text he bad luck before 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.880
 eintracht- 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.730
 can create 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.009
 For that I have failed 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.980
 to simplify the whole 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.150
 this has been such a small camp live so far it will look like this 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.529
 To give 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.320
 there are also percent 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.320
 Full HD in Sumo Ultra HD for you 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.150
 this requires hundreds of 28 pixels but needed 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.240
 rather a mistake to install it later 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.220
 SR man heavy 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.610
 and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.770
 if she is around now 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.290
 choose 4 1 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.879
 and then it works better and he is on Clack 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.760
 and 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.470
 but that requires Photoshop 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.550
 not necessarily but you can also order a template if you want 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 Med a PNG Campliter documentation van Gogh 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.760
 I do not know where else could you search this 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.070
 but I'm doing it now a slideshow I've already downloaded from the 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.880
 SVP 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 Self-knowledge who leads the German 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.479
 here I also have to play 56 CET from the 56 riot de 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.700
 the problem is that percent 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.400
 my creates crashes with me so i do not know how they got through the soot 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.670
 out 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690
 and then I also downloaded suntech plucked 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.480
 the kitsch so that the sand end so installed 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.480
 is the link leaves as Tectura PAP 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.760
 the last photo to be in the photo gallery 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.760
 all already done 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.760
 Percent that can see here 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.760
 So first Rungg open like the whole thing out 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.510
 last living there is being expelled abroad 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.800
 and she already knows how to recognize 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.860
 that sounds like little opening 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.719
 again 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.529
 it wants to have raced here 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:13.749
 Steiner 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:18.199
 our earth would like to be the one with ten percent Kross on top 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.739
 Small almost never what is that is around 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.879
 Wood was seen from above from the side 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.179
 the percent no idea what and sand and so on and so forth 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.179
 then all elements have to go through this procedure 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.929
 so if she wants to change 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:34.529
 It's totally easy 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:38.429
 and I just picked out a picture from Google so I can do it too 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.429
 Do it fast and Voigt 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.219
 so bring 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.839
 not just that 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.479
 Copy 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.479
 and 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.409
 missing in it 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.979
 stand for stations 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.129
 because it is there to invest 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.810
 So it's all about the beer 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.179
 these pictures he pave there 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.389
 the Truth just stand with your own 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:15.569
 Dr 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.359
 paint yourself or draw from the internet or whatever 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.280
 and I just took this one of the rocks here 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.219
 it has won this earth 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.169
 to show us how it is 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.239
 of course I have that is not perfect a little adapted I wanted 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.590
 never get in as many as possible so he can do it 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.729
 now really be sunk in the Main 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.019
 that has changed 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.420
 sorry i have it like this 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.709
 stored I speak now 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.449
 I'll do it quickly 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.580
 since then 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.199
 Promises as children improved 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.109
 very important is PNG 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.999
 and then the name is percent Rheine 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.099
 but I do not know is to be excluded 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.109
 Fri-so 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.109
 speaker 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.609
 So I do not show everything to families just know the here 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.150
 individual elements rushes 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.569
 Exchange percent by simply sending the balls over 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.389
 Copy and paste 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.209
 moves in there 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.209
 and everything is actually pretty well described 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.269
 what i just wanted to do is briefly the tableau age 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.299
 now belongs to my Kreft 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.949
 No, not quite 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.520
 so now I do not have them SID TERA 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.499
 because the pond 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.960
 That's what she looks like 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.000
 the woods later realize that it is not in the hand that leaves him 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.080
 32 times 32 is what the noisemakers 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.059
 and therefore, do not be surprised 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.680
 Now, "Arquette, what I'm going to deliver to you, is for those in this text 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.960
 2 the file will become 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.330
 replace 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
 to use other things in the last round, for example 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.650
 that's the way the war looks like 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.120
 he looks funny 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.879
 SID the shrine off 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.219
 and so on 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:56.599
 definitely 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.960
 Max, he will everything right click 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.159
 to be content in the archive and as Sept 1 you will 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.289
 this is the village open 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.210
 No, because he is always fast around 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.550
 Text percent of Bern 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.279
 and Gerd primarily 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.740
 not meant font 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.749
 rather 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:24.059
 Irrel Altdorf the camp c Patzer subdivided energy third part 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.989
 Bieber 16 times 16 is so if she has better quality school now 

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:29.289
 have installed 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.339
 Dortmund epd 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.580
 and he trusts the program 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.580
 and now they have the whole thing is difficult but is too small 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.469
 click on Rosberg of Turkey 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.979
 including the file which promises one-to-one interviews 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.669
 and 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.979
 thanks to the automatic age of 10 and 28 years 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.469
 let us be there 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:55.469
 and make patch now 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.940
 but I think of Ann Bartels from 128 the butterfly speech 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.849
 Potthoff would never have worked 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.599
 very important the spot 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.559
 is already the way it was made 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.159
 So sing last year 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.480
 confess a hangs a world where I have nothing 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.480
 Edited requires playing with it 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.110
 and he already realizes that 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.469
 everything looks different 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.610
 I manage my head by managed one of a hand 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.610
 the vote very different quality than usual 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:35.309
 it probably jerks Rottweil I no longer responsible 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:37.710
 and here he sees too 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.219
 these 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.479
 Texts the 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.729
 say what that is the stand of the synonymous in the photo distributed it is yes 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.409
 actually defended the dead city booked afterwards 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:48.919
 Margret 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.120
 and if you see on the spot also text 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.120
 As a first step on the way and make your own pictures 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.819
 in addition to carry the water 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:01.770
 I hope helpful 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.500
 I still have a few others Â»Resch means too expensive or Gamper is or 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.999
 What ever 

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:08.410
 to upload 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.399
 and if it was right now 

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:13.720
 So make it up and do not subscribe like that 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.759
 Until next time
