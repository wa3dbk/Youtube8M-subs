00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.560
 my head is exactly the bar 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.829
 the exactly one pole went around the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.000
 judge 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.000
 first try next week 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:14.909
 this was the first attempt at the side exactly 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.909
 how not to do that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.680
 first try number two relative 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.790
 clean tries then the one tries 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.790
 then not so clean 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.659
 so the study is supposed to follow sometimes 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.200
 I can not so often namely 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.390
 would like to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.289
 how do you see the quality changes 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.759
 just not that difficult 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.619
 fast in the studio I do not want others 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.789
 faces great with music on it 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.560
 also I have all slices now 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.240
 Of course, this is how you train 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.789
 not that should only show how much 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.960
 I have basic power and I, so to speak 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.090
 I will try the next weeks 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.319
 to improve and then more 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.550
 I will also repeat in that 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.810
 weight down a bit 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.399
 do some clean repetitions 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.000
 You always have to differentiate witte 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.530
 between force demonstration videos and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.720
 also training videos that are two pairs 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.850
 shoes all right 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.140
 first try as I said I look 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.959
 the week that I'm a bit clean 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.700
 I'll work out regularly 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.700
 must improve and present what
