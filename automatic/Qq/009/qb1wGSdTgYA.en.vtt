00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.940 

and<00:00:02.610> this<00:00:02.820> part<00:00:03.120> here<00:00:03.210> we<00:00:03.810> have<00:00:04.020> our<00:00:04.500> little

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
and this part here we have our little

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.070 
and this part here we have our little
brain<00:00:05.160> gear<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.730> we've<00:00:06.240> printed<00:00:06.600> this<00:00:06.720> part

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
brain gear and we've printed this part

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.790 
brain gear and we've printed this part
as<00:00:07.410> one<00:00:08.189> piece<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.360> we<00:00:09.870> designed<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.500> 3d

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
as one piece so we designed this in 3d

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.730 
as one piece so we designed this in 3d
CAD<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.519> then<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.120> took<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.679> our

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
CAD and then we took this and to our

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.029 
CAD and then we took this and to our
printer<00:00:14.360> and<00:00:15.360> printed<00:00:15.839> as<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.199> piece<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
printer and printed as one piece and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.740 
printer and printed as one piece and
what<00:00:17.279> we're<00:00:17.460> doing<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:18.090> again<00:00:18.449> we're

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
what we're doing here again we're

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.570 
what we're doing here again we're
talking<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.109> building<00:00:19.439> we're<00:00:20.189> taking<00:00:20.490> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
talking about building we're taking it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.120 
talking about building we're taking it
at<00:00:20.699> micron<00:00:21.180> levels<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.260> building<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> part

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
at micron levels and building the part

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.310 
at micron levels and building the part
and<00:00:23.670> were<00:00:23.820> able<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.330> these<00:00:24.630> moving<00:00:25.019> gears

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and were able to get these moving gears

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.759 
and were able to get these moving gears
because<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.849> printer<00:00:27.570> has<00:00:27.720> read<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
because we the printer has read that the

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.200 
because we the printer has read that the
support<00:00:29.130> structure<00:00:29.490> needs<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.910> placed

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
support structure needs to be placed

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.359 
support structure needs to be placed
anywhere<00:00:30.869> where<00:00:31.320> there's<00:00:31.500> an<00:00:31.650> undercut<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
anywhere where there's an undercut the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.000 
anywhere where there's an undercut the
clearance<00:00:32.820> opening<00:00:33.390> void<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.800> great

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
clearance opening void and the great

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.470 
clearance opening void and the great
part<00:00:35.160> about<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.489> technology<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
part about this technology is that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.630 
part about this technology is that
support<00:00:36.989> structure<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> gel-like

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
support structure is a gel-like

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.600 
support structure is a gel-like
substance<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.079> once<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> parts<00:00:40.980> done<00:00:41.250> we

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
substance so all once the parts done we

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
substance so all once the parts done we
take<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> into<00:00:42.180> our<00:00:42.210> water<00:00:42.510> jet<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> just

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
take it into our water jet and just

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
take it into our water jet and just
water<00:00:43.829> jet<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> support<00:00:44.910> structure<00:00:45.329> out

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
water jet all the support structure out

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.010 
water jet all the support structure out
of<00:00:45.660> every<00:00:45.899> crevice<00:00:46.140> every<00:00:46.610> corner<00:00:47.610> within<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
of every crevice every corner within the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.069 
of every crevice every corner within the
clearances<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> moving<00:00:51.629> part

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
clearances so that we have a moving part

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.170 
clearances so that we have a moving part
and<00:00:52.289> moving<00:00:52.500> assembly<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:53.280> gear<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.000> this

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.140 

and<00:00:59.810> now<00:00:59.960> we<00:01:00.020> have<00:01:00.320> another<00:01:00.620> part<00:01:01.010> here<00:01:01.310> a

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
and now we have another part here a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.180 
and now we have another part here a
little<00:01:02.660> part

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
little part

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.950 
little part
that<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> mini<00:01:04.940> toy<00:01:05.830> car<00:01:07.120> and<00:01:08.120> this<00:01:08.330> part<00:01:08.690> has

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
that is a mini toy car and this part has

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.430 
that is a mini toy car and this part has

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
very very thin walls and only I mean our

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.950 
very very thin walls and only I mean our
technology<00:01:13.010> is<00:01:13.130> capturing<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:14.330> amount<00:01:14.870> of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
technology is capturing the amount of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.740 
technology is capturing the amount of
detail<00:01:15.410> that's<00:01:15.620> in<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.550> part<00:01:16.880> as<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:17.630> can
