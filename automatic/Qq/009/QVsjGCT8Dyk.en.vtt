this was $25 from Amazon and it should

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.080 
this was $25 from Amazon and it should
be<00:00:19.090> popping<00:00:19.270> up<00:00:20.040> pretty<00:00:21.040> much<00:00:21.160> everywhere

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
be popping up pretty much everywhere

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.830 
be popping up pretty much everywhere
nerf<00:00:22.780> is<00:00:22.990> sold<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.880> Masson<00:00:25.180> just<00:00:25.360> Mitch<00:00:25.480> get<00:00:25.750> it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
nerf is sold in Masson just Mitch get it

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.510 
nerf is sold in Masson just Mitch get it
first<00:00:26.140> so<00:00:26.410> Thunder<00:00:26.890> blast<00:00:27.190> and<00:00:29.220> yeah<00:00:30.220> and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
first so Thunder blast and yeah and

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.580 
first so Thunder blast and yeah and
strike<00:00:31.090> not<00:00:31.480> elite<00:00:31.780> but<00:00:31.990> I<00:00:32.050> guess<00:00:32.259> that<00:00:32.410> makes

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
strike not elite but I guess that makes

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.560 
strike not elite but I guess that makes
sense<00:00:32.710> because<00:00:33.129> this<00:00:33.579> guy's<00:00:33.730> just<00:00:34.000> powered<00:00:34.390> by

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
sense because this guy's just powered by

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.740 
sense because this guy's just powered by
you<00:00:34.920> moving<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.010> handle<00:00:36.370> essentially<00:00:37.239> if<00:00:37.420> you

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
you moving the handle essentially if you

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.930 
you moving the handle essentially if you
remember<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.590> missile<00:00:39.190> launcher<00:00:39.520> off<00:00:39.700> of<00:00:39.880> the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
remember the missile launcher off of the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.930 
remember the missile launcher off of the
demolisher<00:00:40.540> they're<00:00:41.320> just<00:00:41.590> like<00:00:41.739> huh<00:00:41.980> people

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
demolisher they're just like huh people

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.760 
demolisher they're just like huh people
seem<00:00:43.120> to<00:00:43.149> like<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.450> missile<00:00:43.720> launcher<00:00:44.050> let's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
seem to like the missile launcher let's

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.220 
seem to like the missile launcher let's
just<00:00:45.070> make<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:45.640> its<00:00:45.940> own<00:00:46.090> blaster<00:00:46.570> and<00:00:46.960> so

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
just make it its own blaster and so

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.450 
just make it its own blaster and so
that's<00:00:47.410> what<00:00:47.590> we<00:00:47.680> have<00:00:47.860> here<00:00:49.110> comes<00:00:50.110> with<00:00:50.460> two

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
that's what we have here comes with two

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.720 
that's what we have here comes with two
rockets<00:00:52.390> as<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.690> can<00:00:52.809> see<00:00:52.989> there<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:54.309> flip

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
rockets as you can see there that's flip

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.100 
rockets as you can see there that's flip
around<00:00:54.940> no<00:00:55.840> actually<00:00:56.469> I<00:00:57.210> almost<00:00:58.210> missed<00:00:58.960> that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
around no actually I almost missed that

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.930 
around no actually I almost missed that
because<00:00:59.500> I<00:00:59.649> wasn't<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.219> font<00:01:00.460> was<00:01:00.610> weird<00:01:00.820> no

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
because I wasn't the font was weird no

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.760 
because I wasn't the font was weird no
it<00:01:01.000> wasn't<00:01:01.210> really<00:01:01.420> reading<00:01:01.540> it<00:01:01.780> up<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.440> sixty

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
it wasn't really reading it up to sixty

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.189 
it wasn't really reading it up to sixty
feet<00:01:02.950> so<00:01:03.370> guess<00:01:04.239> they're<00:01:04.449> saying<00:01:04.719> that<00:01:04.989> that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
feet so guess they're saying that that

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.190 
feet so guess they're saying that that
is<00:01:05.439> the<00:01:05.579> absolute<00:01:06.579> max<00:01:06.880> he<00:01:07.060> could<00:01:07.210> pump<00:01:07.959> out<00:01:08.079> of

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
is the absolute max he could pump out of

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.739 
is the absolute max he could pump out of
this<00:01:08.350> thing<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:09.069> is<00:01:09.189> based<00:01:09.490> on<00:01:09.729> how<00:01:10.539> hard

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
this thing and it is based on how hard

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.029 
this thing and it is based on how hard
you<00:01:10.840> move<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.170> handle<00:01:11.469> so<00:01:11.619> it'll<00:01:11.920> be

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
you move the handle so it'll be

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.529 
you move the handle so it'll be
interesting<00:01:12.219> to<00:01:12.459> see<00:01:12.639> what<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.030> actually<00:01:13.179> does

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
interesting to see what it actually does

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.120 
interesting to see what it actually does
when<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:13.899> take<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.319> outside<00:01:14.469> into<00:01:14.859> the<00:01:14.979> real

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
when you take it outside into the real

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.239 
when you take it outside into the real
world<00:01:15.340> do<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.549> range<00:01:15.789> test<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.179> this<00:01:16.359> but

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
world do a range test on this but

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.929 
world do a range test on this but
already<00:01:18.779> so<00:01:19.779> let's<00:01:20.289> check<00:01:20.649> out<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.979> back<00:01:21.429> here

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
already so let's check out the back here

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.149 
already so let's check out the back here
and<00:01:23.249> you<00:01:24.249> know<00:01:24.490> unfortunately<00:01:25.920> can't<00:01:26.920> really

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
and you know unfortunately can't really

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.739 
and you know unfortunately can't really
do<00:01:27.279> too<00:01:27.520> much<00:01:27.700> about<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.060> glare<00:01:28.240> there<00:01:28.479> but

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
do too much about the glare there but

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.679 
do too much about the glare there but
let's<00:01:29.249> take<00:01:30.249> a<00:01:30.310> closer<00:01:30.670> look<00:01:30.819> and<00:01:31.389> the

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
let's take a closer look and the

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:32.699 
let's take a closer look and the
different<00:01:32.109> things

00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:32.709 
different things

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.449
