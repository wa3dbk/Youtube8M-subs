00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:50.299 
I'm not sure but that all I will say is

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:52.270 
I'm not sure but that all I will say is
that<00:00:50.629> they<00:00:50.750> are<00:00:50.839> definitely<00:00:51.559> an<00:00:51.739> item<00:00:52.129> that

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
that they are definitely an item that

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.829 
that they are definitely an item that
I'm<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:52.760> pleased<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:53.059> I<00:00:53.269> got<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.510> winter

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.660 
I'm so pleased that I got the winter
because<00:00:54.530> I'm<00:00:54.680> not<00:00:54.799> really<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:55.070> fan<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.489> all<00:00:55.580> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
because I'm not really a fan of all the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.189 
because I'm not really a fan of all the
boot<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.030> that's<00:00:56.360> just<00:00:56.449> like<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:56.659> personal

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
boot so that's just like a personal

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.270 
boot so that's just like a personal
preference<00:00:57.409> I<00:00:57.739> don't<00:00:57.920> mind<00:00:58.040> one<00:00:58.129> of<00:00:58.220> the

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
preference I don't mind one of the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.009 
preference I don't mind one of the
people<00:00:58.460> I'm<00:00:59.210> just<00:00:59.269> not<00:00:59.600> sure<00:00:59.750> if<00:00:59.839> they<00:00:59.930> would

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
people I'm just not sure if they would

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.420 
people I'm just not sure if they would
suit<00:01:00.260> me<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:02.600> obviously<00:01:03.559> I<00:01:03.860> tend<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.250> like

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
suit me and so obviously I tend to like

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.250 
suit me and so obviously I tend to like
a<00:01:04.489> lot<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.790> dr.<00:01:05.030> Martin<00:01:05.360> boots<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.170> am

really really happy with these they I'm

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.480 
really really happy with these they I'm
not<00:01:09.409> sure<00:01:09.920> if<00:01:10.010> they<00:01:10.100> came<00:01:10.250> with<00:01:10.400> different

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
not sure if they came with different

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.430 
not sure if they came with different
color<00:01:10.820> laces<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.510> probably<00:01:11.900> welcome<00:01:12.230> most

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
color laces and probably welcome most

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.070 
color laces and probably welcome most
dr.<00:01:12.650> Martens<00:01:12.920> shoes<00:01:13.010> do<00:01:13.390> but<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.420> am<00:01:14.570> pleased

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
dr. Martens shoes do but I am pleased

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.960 
dr. Martens shoes do but I am pleased
with<00:01:15.230> the<00:01:15.410> way<00:01:15.560> that<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.800> turns<00:01:16.040> out<00:01:16.280> because<00:01:16.940> I

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
with the way that it turns out because I

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.000 
with the way that it turns out because I
think<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.750> matches<00:01:17.930> in<00:01:18.290> a<00:01:18.410> different<00:01:18.890> way<00:01:18.980> I

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
think it matches in a different way I

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.980 
think it matches in a different way I
think<00:01:19.190> they're<00:01:19.340> quite<00:01:19.490> different<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.330> also

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
think they're quite different I also

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.210 
think they're quite different I also
think<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:21.470> because<00:01:21.710> they're<00:01:21.830> quite<00:01:21.950> rugged

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
think that because they're quite rugged

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.880 
think that because they're quite rugged
it's<00:01:22.490> like<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.640> men's<00:01:23.020> men's<00:01:24.020> style<00:01:24.380> boot<00:01:24.620> so<00:01:24.860> I

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
it's like a men's men's style boot so I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.800 
it's like a men's men's style boot so I
I<00:01:25.340> quite<00:01:25.790> like<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.030> lot<00:01:26.240> of<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:28.570> as<00:01:29.570> far<00:01:29.750> as

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
I quite like a lot of the as far as

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.450 
I quite like a lot of the as far as
there<00:01:30.080> is<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.230> name<00:01:30.620> for<00:01:30.650> that<00:01:31.040> fashion<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:33.460> do

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
there is a name for that fashion I do

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.790

these<00:01:55.159> are<00:01:55.370> 105<00:01:56.180> pounds<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.780> dot<00:01:56.930> smart

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
these are 105 pounds of the dot smart

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.450 
these are 105 pounds of the dot smart
and<00:01:57.350> website<00:01:57.620> you<00:01:57.710> can<00:01:57.830> probably<00:01:57.979> find<00:01:58.250> them

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
and website you can probably find them

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.610

just<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.210> little<00:01:59.240> bit<00:01:59.540> cheaper<00:01:59.750> but<00:01:59.900> they<00:02:00.140> do

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
just a little bit cheaper but they do

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.610 
just a little bit cheaper but they do
tend<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.890> range<00:02:01.159> about<00:02:01.659> 95<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.870> 105<00:02:03.320> pounds

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
tend to range about 95 to 105 pounds

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.899 
tend to range about 95 to 105 pounds
because<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.159> are<00:02:04.250> paying<00:02:04.430> for<00:02:04.520> top<00:02:04.760> quality

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
because you are paying for top quality

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.839 
because you are paying for top quality
so<00:02:06.850> my<00:02:07.850> tendon<00:02:08.330> just<00:02:08.569> moved<00:02:09.519> so<00:02:10.519> I<00:02:10.549> would

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
so my tendon just moved so I would

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.289 
so my tendon just moved so I would
definitely<00:02:12.159> make<00:02:13.159> these<00:02:13.519> as<00:02:13.700> an<00:02:13.790> investment

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
definitely make these as an investment

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.339 
definitely make these as an investment

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.720 
obviously if you are new to dr. Martens
the<00:02:17.569> fact<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:17.810> they<00:02:17.959> are<00:02:18.080> 105

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
the fact that they are 105

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
making really really extensive so I can

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.130

a<00:02:40.180> while<00:02:41.519> but<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.580> would<00:02:42.760> say<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:42.940> but<00:02:43.870> they

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
a while but I would say that but they

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.300
