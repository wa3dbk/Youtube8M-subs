I've got on my iPad I try to keep it to
a<00:03:09.330> minimum<00:03:09.390> because<00:03:10.020> if<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:10.740> a<00:03:10.770> whole<00:03:11.010> lot

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
a minimum because if you get a whole lot

of<00:03:11.900> repose<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:13.140> there<00:03:13.410> then<00:03:13.770> when<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:14.400> search

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
of repose on there then when you search

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.090

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
for it to go through all the information

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.500 
for it to go through all the information
that<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:20.130> makes<00:03:20.340> your<00:03:20.550> searches<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:21.240> much

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
that it makes your searches with much

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.740 
that it makes your searches with much
longer<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.100> try<00:03:23.460> to<00:03:23.490> keep<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.360> just<00:03:24.390> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
longer so I try to keep it to just the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.000 
longer so I try to keep it to just the
