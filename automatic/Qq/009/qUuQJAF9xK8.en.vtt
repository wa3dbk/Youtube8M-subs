00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
standard flavors I didn't detect any

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.180 
standard flavors I didn't detect any
double<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> double<00:02:11.910> cheddar<00:02:12.240> at<00:02:12.510> all

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
double in the double cheddar at all

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.280 
double in the double cheddar at all
however<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.400> Parmesan<00:02:15.150> cheese<00:02:15.180> puffs

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
however the Parmesan cheese puffs

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.100 
however the Parmesan cheese puffs
does<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> real<00:02:17.280> parmesan<00:02:18.090> taste<00:02:18.510> which<00:02:18.900> is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
does have a real parmesan taste which is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.550 
does have a real parmesan taste which is
unusual<00:02:19.380> for<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.730> flavor<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.569> chip<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.200> I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
unusual for a flavor and a chip so I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.120 
unusual for a flavor and a chip so I
give<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.190> one<00:02:23.400> five<00:02:23.790> stars<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.560> nacho

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
give that one five stars and the nacho

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.290 
give that one five stars and the nacho
grid<00:02:26.610> shape<00:02:27.739> was<00:02:28.739> very<00:02:29.040> reminiscent<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
grid shape was very reminiscent of the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.620 
grid shape was very reminiscent of the
nacho<00:02:30.840> bugles<00:02:31.470> from<00:02:31.860> many<00:02:32.100> years<00:02:32.400> ago<00:02:32.670> also<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
nacho bugles from many years ago also a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.370 
nacho bugles from many years ago also a
great<00:02:34.050> flavor<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.920> five<00:02:35.190> stars<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.380> overall

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
great flavor and five stars so overall

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.610 
great flavor and five stars so overall
this<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.100> definitely<00:02:38.640> worth<00:02:38.940> getting<00:02:39.620> for

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
this is definitely worth getting for

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.720 
this is definitely worth getting for
those<00:02:40.860> two<00:02:41.250> parmesan<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.570> nacho<00:02:43.290> flavors<00:02:43.950> but

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
those two parmesan and nacho flavors but

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.240 
those two parmesan and nacho flavors but
it<00:02:44.850> doesn't<00:02:45.269> deliver<00:02:45.930> under<00:02:46.410> stress<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.010> on

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
it doesn't deliver under stress and on

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.229 
it doesn't deliver under stress and on
the<00:02:47.459> extra<00:02:48.330> cheesy<00:02:48.660> label<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> hope<00:02:51.060> you
