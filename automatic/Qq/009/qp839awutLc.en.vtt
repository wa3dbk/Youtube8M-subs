00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.370
 xbox and dead rising have always gone to 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.230
 arm 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.870
 so much so that the first chapter in skiing 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.699
 exclusive to xbox 360 is more first 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.310
 title to sell just a million 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.100
 of copies just for that dead console 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.760
 rising 3 is presented at the launch of xbox 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.760
 one 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.190
 the def and dead rising 3 does not appear 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.050
 depart particularly from that 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.420
 of the past chapters open spaces 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.460
 invaded by hundreds of simple zombies 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.230
 optional secondary lens visions e 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.480
 a system of combining objects 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.010
 during our test we had 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.720
 opportunity to try all of them for a long time 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.580
 these gameplay features are 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.350
 experimenting with combination of objects e 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.570
 vehicles that follow more routes 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.110
 linear trying to complete the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.480
 missions 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.430
 unfortunately we cannot tell you anything about the 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.320
 history but we can already anticipate that 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.960
 it is not that there are particular blows of 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.210
 scene the heart of everything is the massacre of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.500
 hundreds of undead but sometimes there 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.270
 is asked to release a 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.520
 survived or to follow paths 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.320
 in the car or even to venture into 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.759
 closed places or simple solve 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 environmental puzzles 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.090
 in all this we insert the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.830
 secondary objectives that generally 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.780
 concern the killing of a certain person 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.450
 number of enemies within a time limit 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.800
 everything is negotiable in company 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.930
 just the presence of the mode 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.240
 two player cooperative one of the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.979
 strongest points of the capcom title and not 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.810
 just because it can do even more 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.610
 fun game action but also 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.770
 for the mechanics and two provided by 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 many of the alleys combined the two 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.100
 however players will not be forced to 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.410
 play together all the time but 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.319
 they will be free to roam around the 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.399
 map will be approached only when 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.690
 one of the two will trigger one of the steps 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.030
 of the main adventure unleashing the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.920
 filmed the normal zombies are not then 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.140
 so difficult to break down but to put 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.390
 some pepper report we think some 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.770
 Special types of players not dead 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.300
 of American football enjoy 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.310
 special protections 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.950
 the firemen are the grandchildren and armed with 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.900
 ax while other zombies are infected 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.010
 from a parasite that will make them explode at 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.780
 contact 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.270
 if you get tired of taking a 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.099
 blows and hundreds of carcasses 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.020
 putrescent from the racing 3 field 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.090
 also of the armed gangs of men in 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.950
 enemy flesh and bones that offer one 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.510
 decidedly more interesting challenge though 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.530
 without becoming a problem for the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.330
 player 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.370
 the speeches deserve a separate speech 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.349
 elaborate bosses to be fought with 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.480
 a more careful approach perhaps a thread 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.780
 less caciarone than the usual tonnara of 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.819
 not 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.740
 deaths on a technical level we note a 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.240
 improved stable framerate 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.280
 compared to previous meetings it is 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.709
 settled on 30 frames per second 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.080
 most of the time with so much 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.850
 of 1080 pixel resolution 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.470
 it is undoubted, however, that in most situations 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.209
 crowded some slowdown is 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.790
 visible but in the vast majority 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.370
 in some cases the images remain fluid 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.700
 therefore dead rising three between integration 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.160
 with kinect smuggler thousands of zombies 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.410
 on screen is likely to be the game 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.670
 more fun than all the launch of 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.670
 scholes but we will not see 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.270
 Yup 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.680
 never asked 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.140
 xbox and dead rising have always gone to 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.630
 arm so much that the first chapter 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.900
 exclusive sheen for xbox 360 and was the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.900
 first
