 welcome everyone to my channel here 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.790
 finished 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.210

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.109
 badly washed 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.780
 sealed up all the gaps between fireclay bricks 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.440
 the camera 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.440
 defecation 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.400
 thought the name for the boiler 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.030
 are hot stream 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.910
 only I got it, but he doesn't have a name 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.370

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.590
 rated capacity performance 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.590
 forty five kilowatt boiler 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.310
 how already loaded 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.430
 firewood 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:00.530
 the cauldron has almost reached the top 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.530
 fan for blowing the boiler 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.970

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.070
 fan donation 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 he's adjusting hitters there 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.030
 secondary air 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.820
 Here is such a facility in the garage closely 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.940
 there is little space but nothing new 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.660
 digging 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.660
 years awful 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.390
 half a kilo 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.270
 inflames 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 looking brick i'm warming too 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.980
 reduce the length 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.730
 recoil 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.730
 secondary 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.590
 changed 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.330
 need to add a little more 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.239
 jam 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.239
 you are correct 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.090
 very interrupted 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:49.420
 improvised chimney well smoke out 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:54.010
 he doesnâ€™t say that firewood 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:03:02.730
 burn completely duyko for blowing 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:06.600
 thousand 400 cubes gives thermocouple measures 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.600
 flue gas temperature 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.850
 intel tor for burning 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.090
 performance three hundred and fifty 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.090
 cubes 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:36.770
 well turned off disorder need to turn on 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.860
 force 2 thermocouples measure flow 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.860
 hot air 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.930
 Well, we stood a little now let's run 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.930
 fan forced 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.450
 hatch for cleaning the heat exchanger hall and 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.450
 shallow which hold there 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.260
 about 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.260
 broke out a little bit 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.360
 principle this is his working mode but on 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:29.680
 in fact, the fan speed will be 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.979
 reduced because so much heat is not 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.979
 need to 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.259
 garages are already almost impossible 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:56.389
 the temperature has risen to 10 5 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.219
 degrees hot 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:03.590
 boiler designed for heating 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:10.699
 rooms 424 130 squares 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.699
 in the garage in 10 minutes he will make a sauna 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:19.129
 fireclay bricks in the chamber should just 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.539
 we set temporarily 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:24.599
 further i wanna do both 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:29.930
 lay completely close but side 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.930
 the walls and the front wall of the chamber must 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:41.849
 on the construction of the boiler left sheet 6 meters 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:48.770
 one and a half meter wide metal with 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:54.300
 4 millimeters thick two sheets of two 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:06:00.000
 250 per meter twenty five by us and the ghetto 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:02.330
 4 square sheets with a thickness of 5 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.330
 millimeters 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:16.280
 Well, the boiler went to mode 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:23.900
 a little bit needs to be tweaked 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:26.690
 supply secondary air open the chamber 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:31.540
 gasification friend put to quite 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:34.669
 a little visible as they burn out 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.070
 performance checks me principle 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:45.919
 no longer needed to put them there 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:51.460
 because it is very hot but firewood 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:51.460
 burn out the facts better and so intense 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:03.669
 the boiler itself will sell the smoke temperature 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:08.580
 gas one hundred four degrees temperature 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:08.580
 hot air outlet 200 degrees 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:34.370
 this boiler is made to order will heat 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:40.100
 greenhouse size greenhouse 400 square 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:46.250
 meters very hurry to finish it to 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:49.220
 frost is now in the off season my greenhouses 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:54.040
 work is wrong but so take orders 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.040
 for the manufacture of such boilers 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.180
 well, all the wood burned out 

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:13.690
 the whole is almost no camera 

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:13.690
 gasification is not in the chamber even
