walk<00:02:08.679> it<00:02:08.800> around<00:02:09.990> total<00:02:10.990> weight<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
walk it around total weight of the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.979 
walk it around total weight of the
machine<00:02:11.709> is<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.970> machine<00:02:13.330> here<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.780> about

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989
