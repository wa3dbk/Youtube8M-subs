take a little bit of breaking in well of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.129

course the boot requires some breaking

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:46.489 
course the boot requires some breaking
in<00:01:43.319> but<00:01:44.130> at<00:01:44.459> first<00:01:44.849> it's<00:01:45.149> hard<00:01:45.209> to<00:01:45.719> get<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.170> nice

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
in but at first it's hard to get it nice

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.589 
in but at first it's hard to get it nice
and<00:01:46.529> evenly<00:01:47.279> talk<00:01:47.670> without<00:01:47.939> having<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> go

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
and evenly talk without having to go

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.089 
and evenly talk without having to go
through<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.170> adjust<00:01:49.259> everything<00:01:49.799> manually

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:50.099 
through and adjust everything manually

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.249 
through and adjust everything manually
but<00:01:50.759> eventually<00:01:51.029> as<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> boot<00:01:51.749> gets<00:01:51.959> less

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
but eventually as the boot gets less

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.449 
but eventually as the boot gets less
stiff<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:53.569> it's<00:01:54.569> easier<00:01:55.109> to<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.829> cinch<00:01:56.310> it

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
stiff then it's easier to just cinch it

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.050 
stiff then it's easier to just cinch it
up<00:01:56.579> once<00:01:56.789> it's<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:58.459> these<00:01:59.459> eyelets<00:01:59.909> work

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
up once it's on these eyelets work

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.559 
up once it's on these eyelets work
really<00:02:00.209> well<00:02:00.419> they<00:02:01.079> are<00:02:01.939> not<00:02:02.939> quite<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.419> good

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
really well they are not quite as good

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.169 
really well they are not quite as good
as<00:02:03.810> some<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.139> the<00:02:04.229> speed<00:02:04.649> laces<00:02:05.099> you<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.849> on

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
as some of the speed laces you see on

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:07.399 
as some of the speed laces you see on
some<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.810> other<00:02:06.929> boots

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
some of the other boots

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.399 
some of the other boots
that's<00:02:07.909> duffle<00:02:08.909> metal<00:02:09.450> eyelets<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.110> stick

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
that's duffle metal eyelets that stick

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.949 
that's duffle metal eyelets that stick
out<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:11.640> lace<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.150> move<00:02:12.599> through<00:02:12.900> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
out so that the lace can move through a

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.940 
out so that the lace can move through a
lot<00:02:13.170> easier

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
lot easier

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.290 
lot easier
but<00:02:14.400> these<00:02:14.940> don't<00:02:15.629> allow<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.050> laces<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:17.300> move

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
but these don't allow the laces to move

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.750 
but these don't allow the laces to move
which<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:18.989> also<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> good<00:02:19.769> thing<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.250> once

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
which is also a good thing because once

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.180 
which is also a good thing because once
you<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.239> boot<00:02:21.480> cinched<00:02:21.959> up<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.769> it

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
you have your boot cinched up then it

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.190 
you have your boot cinched up then it
doesn't<00:02:23.459> get<00:02:23.580> loose<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.390> everything

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
doesn't get loose on you everything

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.410 
doesn't get loose on you everything
stays<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.620> place

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
stays in place

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.890 
stays in place

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
them from they are not waterproof but

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.990 
them from they are not waterproof but
they<00:02:39.569> also<00:02:39.780> will<00:02:40.440> be<00:02:40.830> resistant<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.700> things

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
they also will be resistant to things

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.110 
they also will be resistant to things
like<00:02:42.180> puddles<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.650> rain<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.910> really

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
like puddles and rain and it's really

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.759 
like puddles and rain and it's really
only<00:02:45.209> walking<00:02:45.840> through<00:02:45.989> standing<00:02:46.440> water<00:02:46.620> that

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
only walking through standing water that

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.039 
only walking through standing water that
these<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.970> not<00:02:48.150> waterproof<00:02:48.450> becomes<00:02:48.900> an

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
these the not waterproof becomes an

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.100 
these the not waterproof becomes an
issue<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.980> are<00:02:50.010> no<00:02:50.459> vents<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:52.019> know

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
issue there are no vents on it you know

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.900 
issue there are no vents on it you know
I<00:02:52.140> caught<00:02:52.380> weather<00:02:52.560> groups<00:02:52.829> have<00:02:53.069> side<00:02:53.519> vents

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
I caught weather groups have side vents

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030 
I caught weather groups have side vents
these<00:02:54.599> do<00:02:54.930> not<00:02:54.959> have<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.380> vents<00:02:55.650> which<00:02:55.799> means

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
these do not have the vents which means

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.530 
these do not have the vents which means
that<00:02:56.280> they<00:02:56.400> don't<00:02:56.579> leak<00:02:56.819> through<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.239> vents

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
that they don't leak through the vents

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.670 
that they don't leak through the vents
but<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.290> boots<00:02:58.620> are<00:02:58.860> breathable<00:03:00.680> enough

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
but the boots are breathable enough

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.630 
but the boots are breathable enough
already

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
already

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.610 
already
so<00:03:02.880> when<00:03:03.540> I'm<00:03:03.690> wearing<00:03:03.930> these<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.230> don't<00:03:04.470> have

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
so when I'm wearing these I don't have

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.080 
so when I'm wearing these I don't have
problems<00:03:05.069> with<00:03:05.130> my<00:03:05.280> feet<00:03:05.519> getting<00:03:05.730> hot<00:03:05.910> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
problems with my feet getting hot and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.789 
problems with my feet getting hot and
sweaty<00:03:06.329> they're<00:03:06.569> always<00:03:06.720> nice<00:03:07.500> and

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
sweaty they're always nice and

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.740 
sweaty they're always nice and
comfortable<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.060> boot<00:03:09.209> itself<00:03:09.569> is

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
comfortable because the boot itself is

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.080 
comfortable because the boot itself is
very<00:03:09.930> breathable

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
very breathable

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.819 
very breathable
now<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.569> boots<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:13.319> an<00:03:13.440> interesting

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
now the boots have an interesting

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.069 
now the boots have an interesting
feature<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.640> pretty<00:03:15.239> well<00:03:15.420> common<00:03:15.870> to

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
feature that is pretty well common to

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.710 
feature that is pretty well common to
5-11<00:03:16.799> boots<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.280> that's<00:03:17.940> right<00:03:18.150> here<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
5-11 boots and that's right here on the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.770 
5-11 boots and that's right here on the
outside<00:03:19.109> you<00:03:19.739> have<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.250> hidden<00:03:20.549> pocket<00:03:21.150> now

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
outside you have this hidden pocket now

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.420 
outside you have this hidden pocket now
it's<00:03:21.959> not<00:03:22.109> real<00:03:22.380> obvious<00:03:22.590> because<00:03:23.220> it's

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
it's not real obvious because it's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.420 
it's not real obvious because it's
stitched<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:24.389> like<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:25.200> other<00:03:25.350> side<00:03:25.680> which

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
stitched just like the other side which

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.900 
stitched just like the other side which
does<00:03:27.120> not<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.569> pocket<00:03:27.989> but<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.639> you

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
does not have the pocket but if you

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.879 
does not have the pocket but if you
notice<00:03:30.269> there's<00:03:31.049> some<00:03:31.230> space<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.650> here<00:03:31.829> so

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
notice there's some space in here so

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.090 
notice there's some space in here so
they<00:03:32.700> actually<00:03:32.880> make<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.359> 5-11<00:03:34.319> boot<00:03:34.680> knife<00:03:34.859> you

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
they actually make a 5-11 boot knife you

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.490 
they actually make a 5-11 boot knife you
can<00:03:35.250> put<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.549> here<00:03:35.579> or<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:37.079> put<00:03:37.260> things

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
can put in here or you can put things

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.979 
can put in here or you can put things
that<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.280> may<00:03:38.459> need<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.730> have<00:03:38.819> access<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.510> Kies

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
that you may need to have access to Kies

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.830 
that you may need to have access to Kies
a<00:03:40.530> handcuff<00:03:40.980> key<00:03:41.180> something<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.540> that

I'm<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.620> have<00:03:43.709> backups<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:44.459> not

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
I'm just going to have backups but not

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.759 
I'm just going to have backups but not
real<00:03:44.940> obvious<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:46.019> know<00:03:46.139> where<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.440> put<00:03:46.590> them

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
these boots do break in really quickly

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.629 
these boots do break in really quickly
