00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.920

have like muscular calves but at the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.509 
have like muscular calves but at the
same<00:03:13.140> time<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.379> wish<00:03:13.530> they<00:03:13.800> could<00:03:13.950> be<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.129> little

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
same time I wish they could be a little

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.089 
same time I wish they could be a little
more<00:03:14.700> tailored<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.360> I'm<00:03:15.480> considering<00:03:16.170> maybe

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
more tailored so I'm considering maybe

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.869 
more tailored so I'm considering maybe
um<00:03:18.409> maybe<00:03:19.409> taking<00:03:19.980> them<00:03:20.099> depending<00:03:20.700> on<00:03:20.700> if

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
um maybe taking them depending on if

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:21.979 
um maybe taking them depending on if
it's<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.209> it<00:03:21.300> just<00:03:21.450> looks<00:03:21.629> too<00:03:21.690> much<00:03:21.810> like

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
it's if it just looks too much like

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.259 
it's if it just looks too much like
Peter<00:03:22.379> Pan<00:03:22.560> boots<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.099> might<00:03:23.730> take<00:03:23.970> them<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.239> a

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
Peter Pan boots I might take them to a

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.420 
Peter Pan boots I might take them to a
tailor<00:03:24.599> because<00:03:24.930> there<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.709> front<00:03:26.099> seen

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
tailor because there is a front seen

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.160 
tailor because there is a front seen
here<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.239> feel<00:03:27.420> like<00:03:27.510> something<00:03:27.959> could<00:03:28.140> be

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
here so I feel like something could be

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.009 
here so I feel like something could be
done<00:03:28.260> as<00:03:28.739> far<00:03:28.950> as<00:03:29.099> like<00:03:29.420> taking<00:03:30.420> them<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.810> or

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
done as far as like taking them in or

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.030 
done as far as like taking them in or
something<00:03:31.170> like<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.379> but<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:31.799> that's

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
something like that but that's that's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.339 
something like that but that's that's
just<00:03:32.310> an<00:03:32.430> idea<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:33.180> got<00:03:33.569> used<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.930> them<00:03:34.049> and

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
just an idea I I got used to them and

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.750 
just an idea I I got used to them and
the<00:03:34.440> way<00:03:34.560> they<00:03:34.680> looked<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.220> store<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.700> I

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
the way they looked in the store so I

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.490 
the way they looked in the store so I
figured<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.330> would<00:03:36.690> try<00:03:36.720> them<00:03:36.930> with<00:03:36.989> an<00:03:37.140> outfit

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
figured I would try them with an outfit

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.170 
figured I would try them with an outfit
and<00:03:37.680> then<00:03:37.980> go<00:03:38.099> from<00:03:38.250> there<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.000> thought

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
and then go from there but I thought

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.820 
and then go from there but I thought
they<00:03:39.269> were<00:03:39.330> just<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.110> don't<00:03:40.140> have<00:03:40.409> any<00:03:40.590> red

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
they were just so I don't have any red

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.410 
they were just so I don't have any red
boots<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.310> don't<00:03:41.459> have<00:03:41.519> any<00:03:41.700> boots<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.269> this

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
boots I don't have any boots in this

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.930 
boots I don't have any boots in this
style<00:03:42.690> anyways<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.430> thought<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.760> red

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
style anyways but I thought the red

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.580 
style anyways but I thought the red
would<00:03:45.150> be<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.690> fabulous<00:03:46.080> look<00:03:46.379> like<00:03:46.500> an

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
would be so fabulous look like an

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.630 
would be so fabulous look like an
all-black<00:03:47.120> outfit<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.920> yeah<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.099> just<00:03:50.250> had<00:03:50.519> to

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
all-black outfit and yeah I just had to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.210
