said the cultural differences come up
also<00:03:15.709> when<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.099> think<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.819> cultures<00:03:17.209> are

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
also when you think the cultures are

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.190 
also when you think the cultures are
very<00:03:17.510> similar

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
very similar

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.809 
very similar
from<00:03:18.440> past<00:03:18.620> experience<00:03:18.769> I<00:03:19.250> can<00:03:19.400> say<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:19.730> the

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
from past experience I can say that the

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.220 
from past experience I can say that the
way<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.060> thinking<00:03:20.329> about<00:03:20.569> life<00:03:20.870> can<00:03:21.109> be<00:03:21.200> very

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
way of thinking about life can be very

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.960 
way of thinking about life can be very
different<00:03:21.680> even<00:03:22.069> between<00:03:22.310> people<00:03:22.400> from<00:03:22.669> two

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
different even between people from two

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.819 
different even between people from two
Western<00:03:23.450> countries<00:03:23.930> which<00:03:24.380> often<00:03:24.709> get

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
Western countries which often get

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.589 
Western countries which often get
bundled<00:03:25.040> together<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.700> pretty<00:03:25.940> much<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.389> same

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
bundled together is pretty much the same

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.199 
bundled together is pretty much the same
that<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.620> very<00:03:28.069> true<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.639> it<00:03:28.880> is<00:03:29.000> something

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
that is very true and it is something

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.240 
that is very true and it is something
that<00:03:29.450> people<00:03:29.959> sort<00:03:30.109> of<00:03:30.169> don't<00:03:30.230> realize<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.190> I

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
that people sort of don't realize and I

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.949 
that people sort of don't realize and I
feel<00:03:31.459> like<00:03:31.639> in<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.880> past<00:03:32.120> 10<00:03:32.510> years<00:03:32.540> we're
