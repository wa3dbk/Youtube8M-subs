 with 2 0 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.329
 of the match 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.329
 handsome attack from young ajax and the early lead 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 and the first the best attack hits it immediately 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.680
 arica plays the ball hard 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.140
 he was sick of it 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.630
 farmers rebound 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.420
 I sent away and the good cross worked through the inside of the pole 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.010

 and putting pressure on the hari room 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.390
 you can take over ado after the working hours without violation 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 from Rhine 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.290
 arica 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 via a knock at sbs cross 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.880
 but i just can't reach the ball and the same goes for ricardo chicken anyway 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.240
 but lost the ball 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.210
 We begin 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.570
 erica responds as if he was sitting 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.390
 well done tip 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.390
 and there it is 2 0 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130
 good place is that he pumps 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.810
 ours run smart 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.820
 ricardo chicken 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 signs for the 2 0 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 how hanging 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.239
 and there is the wheel 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.239
 canberra riga with the goal 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.190
 front of dico heads 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.190
 frequent picture in the first half 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.589
 thus resulted in the goal 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.589
 from jennen arica 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.369
 4 0 at least 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.549
 good for his husband to come 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.309
 some luck with the finish but 4 0 second goal from arica this 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.379
 competition scored earlier in young FC Utrecht elimination knows nothing yet 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.219
 to create 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.759
 again ajax special 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.759
 pressure is increasing on the goal of ado the hague 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.289
 8 that silver she grabbed her fork 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:05.289
 see it at lightning speed 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.809
 he still gets the ball 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.179
 alida castelein must travel 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.179
 but shoot the ball past 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.339
 where previously the soli solar allergy lands might be the talent of the 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.459
 ajax training a cross 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.459
 of special header from arica in the hands of the black 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.509
 where that tom farmer could in the ball 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.509
 prototype 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.859
 farmers back on arica 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.789
 arica cross 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.789
 easily worked away 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.619
 aissatti who came up with me from rijn 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:02.579
 in arica 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.579
 the ball curls over the black goal 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:15.579
 the cookie plays boring the farmer sees arica away immigrants offside 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.989
 not eaten and days it is 5 0 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.989
 goal scorer provided for you 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.340
 because an offside does indeed bounce in the middle more often 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.090
 hang on to the defender 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.300
