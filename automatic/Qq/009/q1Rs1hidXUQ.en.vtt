go to 45 degree and I just see my cap in
the<00:02:22.360> skyline<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:29.140> I'm<00:02:29.260> done<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.500> can<00:02:29.560> see<00:02:29.799> like

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
the skyline so I'm done you can see like

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.740 
the skyline so I'm done you can see like
is<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.310> short<00:02:30.610> too<00:02:30.790> long<00:02:31.000> because<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.569> want<00:02:31.720> to

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
is this short too long because I want to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.000 
is this short too long because I want to
keep<00:02:31.959> everything<00:02:32.319> in<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> long<00:02:32.739> on<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:32.980> sides

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
keep everything in a long on the sides

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.190 
keep everything in a long on the sides
and<00:02:33.519> shorten<00:02:33.940> over<00:02:34.120> here<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.750> when<00:02:34.870> I'm<00:02:34.959> going

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
and shorten over here so when I'm going

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.150 
and shorten over here so when I'm going
to<00:02:35.260> short<00:02:35.500> over<00:02:35.650> there<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:35.799> can<00:02:35.980> see<00:02:36.130> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
to short over there I can see the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:47.410 
to short over there I can see the
gradual<00:02:36.609> nice<00:02:37.000> volume<00:02:37.359> on<00:02:37.660> over<00:02:37.870> here

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.940 

when<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.630> after<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.930> cut<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:49.380> can<00:02:49.560> always

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
when we after the cut we can always

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.070 
when we after the cut we can always
relevant<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.550> be<00:02:50.700> checked<00:02:51.480> into<00:02:51.780> sections

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
relevant to be checked into sections

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.229 
relevant to be checked into sections
because<00:02:52.200> if<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.250> did<00:02:53.370> anything<00:02:53.520> wrong<00:02:54.030> will

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
because if we did anything wrong will

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.930 
because if we did anything wrong will
always<00:02:54.989> tell<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.380> when<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.709> measuring<00:02:56.220> up

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:10.360 

I'm<00:02:59.940> going<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.239> same<00:03:00.450> thing<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.930> mine<00:03:01.200> -<00:03:01.560> accent

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.880 

so<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.730> done<00:03:11.910> our<00:03:12.120> whole<00:03:12.870> back<00:03:13.140> right<00:03:13.380> now<00:03:13.590> and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
so we done our whole back right now and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.009 
so we done our whole back right now and
we<00:03:14.040> shall<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.310> like<00:03:14.459> short<00:03:15.209> too<00:03:15.540> long<00:03:15.720> and

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
we shall be like short too long and

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.590 
we shall be like short too long and
we're<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.530> keep<00:03:16.769> very<00:03:17.130> short<00:03:17.700> on<00:03:17.760> me<00:03:17.910> here<00:03:18.150> and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
we're I keep very short on me here and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.090 
we're I keep very short on me here and
keeping<00:03:18.840> long<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.230> case<00:03:19.410> through<00:03:19.620> volume<00:03:19.890> in

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
keeping long to case through volume in

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.670 
keeping long to case through volume in
it<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.760> my<00:03:21.360> second<00:03:21.660> like<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.870> shoulder<00:03:22.260> firstly

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
it so my second like a shoulder firstly

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.890 
it so my second like a shoulder firstly
I<00:03:22.830> take<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.130> diagonals<00:03:23.519> then<00:03:23.640> all<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.180> did<00:03:24.600> over

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
I take on diagonals then all I did over

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.050 
I take on diagonals then all I did over
director<00:03:25.260> -<00:03:25.350> 45<00:03:25.739> degree<00:03:26.069> same<00:03:26.580> as<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.910> other

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
director - 45 degree same as the other

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.030 
director - 45 degree same as the other
sides<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.600> now<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.170> want<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.410> keep<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.769> longer

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
sides and now I want to keep the longer

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.070 
sides and now I want to keep the longer
than<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.250> front<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.730> same<00:03:30.690> technique<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.049> am

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
than the front so same technique I am

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.330 
than the front so same technique I am
going<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.380> use<00:03:31.500> which<00:03:31.739> end<00:03:31.860> be<00:03:31.950> my<00:03:32.069> same

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
going to use which end be my same

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.860 
going to use which end be my same
diagonal<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.880> section<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.299> am<00:03:33.330> going<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.630> over

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
diagonal in section I am going to over

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.920 
diagonal in section I am going to over
direct<00:03:33.989> hole<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.069> back<00:03:35.220> code<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.930> make

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
direct hole to the back code and make

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.660 
direct hole to the back code and make
sure<00:03:37.049> you're<00:03:37.200> like<00:03:37.349> guideline<00:03:37.950> exactly<00:03:38.580> on

you and if I see my guidance here and
I'm<00:03:40.620> going<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.860> cut<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.519> I'm<00:03:47.670> done<00:03:47.880> with<00:03:48.120> my

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
I'm going to cut so I'm done with my

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.880 
I'm going to cut so I'm done with my
complete<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.380> got<00:03:49.530> now

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
complete I got now

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.949 
complete I got now
so<00:03:50.070> after<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.459> I'm<00:03:50.609> going<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.820> try<00:03:51.480> her<00:03:51.750> hair

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
so after this I'm going to try her hair

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.170 
so after this I'm going to try her hair
to<00:03:52.109> check<00:03:52.320> do<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.280> lot<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.459> fracture<00:03:53.790> rising<00:03:54.060> it

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
to check do a lot of fracture rising it

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.390 
to check do a lot of fracture rising it
because<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.750> want<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.019> set<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.890> volume<00:03:56.040> on<00:03:56.370> it

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
because I want to set the volume on it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.430 
because I want to set the volume on it
all<00:03:56.700> over<00:03:56.880> around<00:03:57.090> for<00:03:57.420> her<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.690> no<00:03:57.840> need<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.140> do

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
all over around for her is no need to do

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.229 
all over around for her is no need to do
or<00:03:58.590> dryer<00:03:58.799> every<00:03:59.160> time<00:03:59.310> at<00:03:59.489> home<00:03:59.670> because<00:04:00.000> they

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
or dryer every time at home because they

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.630 
or dryer every time at home because they
cut<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.959> then<00:04:01.170> taught<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.560> learn<00:04:01.769> up<00:04:02.100> so<00:04:02.549> if

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
cut it then taught you learn up so if

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.890 
cut it then taught you learn up so if
you<00:04:02.850> do<00:04:03.060> French<00:04:03.540> also<00:04:03.930> looks<00:04:04.140> nicer

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.110 

so<00:04:09.470> we<00:04:09.650> done<00:04:09.830> our<00:04:09.860> hackett<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.610> can<00:04:10.760> see<00:04:10.940> now

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
so we done our hackett you can see now

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.910 
so we done our hackett you can see now
what<00:04:11.360> I<00:04:11.390> told<00:04:11.599> it<00:04:11.840> I'm<00:04:12.080> going<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.349> keep<00:04:12.500> longer

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
what I told it I'm going to keep longer

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.070 
what I told it I'm going to keep longer
and<00:04:13.099> be<00:04:13.190> front<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.700> short<00:04:13.970> already<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:14.330> it'd<00:04:14.930> be

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
and be front and short already I it'd be

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.170 
and be front and short already I it'd be
nice<00:04:15.230> watching<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.070> can<00:04:16.430> see<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.639> volume<00:04:16.850> now

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
nice watching and can see the volume now

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.879 
nice watching and can see the volume now
he<00:04:17.389> was<00:04:17.510> like<00:04:17.660> looking<00:04:17.840> too<00:04:18.019> flat<00:04:18.290> now<00:04:18.530> we<00:04:18.590> have

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
he was like looking too flat now we have

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.250 
he was like looking too flat now we have
a<00:04:18.919> good<00:04:19.130> volume<00:04:19.459> on<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:20.600> keep<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:21.109> side

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
a good volume on it and I keep one side

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.320 
a good volume on it and I keep one side
longer<00:04:21.620> on<00:04:21.769> size<00:04:22.010> shorter<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.460> frame<00:04:22.970> our<00:04:23.090> face

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
longer on size shorter to frame our face

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.600 
longer on size shorter to frame our face
nicely
