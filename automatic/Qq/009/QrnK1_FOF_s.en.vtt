00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.859
 it's about the weaving technique in 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.680
 canvas and wool this plastic mesh is 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.900
 becomes a canvas that offers a 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.630
 countless options to create 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.199
 items for personal use or for 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.170
 home using as materials the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.460
 Needle wool canvas and your imagination and 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.370
 this as you say lorena I the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.030
 initiated by patience something that has 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.850
 served in that time is pierce of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.469
 it's something out of the ordinary to say it 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.539
 because he has always worked with another 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.699
 kind of materials but I what I know 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.420
 work with wool first the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.510
 camera that can not miss the wool and my 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.329
 most secret weapon the scissors and a needle 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.390
 capotera if you can without tip because 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 when you start you 're here, restito 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.440
 being able to those of the yolk of the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.710
 fingers and whether or not you want to be uncomfortable 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.470
 but already with the experience one does not even 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.440
 it hurts and it's still not easy to use the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.170
 needle with a tip there is if I have 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.630
 some drawing especially I do what 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.360
 I do grids but lately I 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.869
 dedicated better in searching the networks 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.230
 social this patterns in the area of 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.020
 cross point 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.060
 I have this pattern is cross stitch and I 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.690
 what I have done is put it in this of the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.540
 canvas 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.450
 The first step is to choose the drawing that 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.790
 will decorate your work you can be guided by the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.190
 figures made in knitted pattern 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.560
 cross later 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.920
 you choose the size of the piece to work 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.610
 and cut the prawns needed to 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.550
 complete it a lot of patience is required 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.820
 to fill all the pieces with wool 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.580
 This is one of the biggest advantages of 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.880
 work with this technique because it 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.610
 develop perseverance 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.520
 contemplation and fine motor once 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.220
 the pieces are woven in wool arrives 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.280
 the moment to join them to complete your 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.170
 work we take what we already have 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.870
 our drawing that we have done and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 we have finished all our box 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.760
 we started to unite the two parties with the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.040
 same wool as when we want to finish 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.709
 and we began to join the paintings 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.900
 each box that does have to match 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.140
 because before we had seen that lorena 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.120
 I'm wrong in the world but if that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.760
 it always happens at the beginning to me it happened to me 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.819
 then this here every table has to 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.689
 match join the pieces only takes 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.790
 a few minutes with this same technique 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.790
 can create a variety of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.439
 figures with different colors and 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.439
 small and woven 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.049
 here we can see already finished our 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.180
 box and we can do different as 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.819

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.560
 counted what we in our 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.019
