00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
it's so ugly but I know it's going to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.710 
it's so ugly but I know it's going to
perform<00:04:31.410> really<00:04:31.860> really<00:04:32.190> well<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.639> then<00:04:33.330> the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
perform really really well and then the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.360

next one came out and it was uglier and

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.350 
next one came out and it was uglier and
then<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:36.740> 2006<00:04:37.740> refresh<00:04:38.190> oakley<00:04:38.820> are<00:04:38.970> still
