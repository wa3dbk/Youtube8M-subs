00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.969 
you have it to fill up and drink now
almost<00:01:42.360> always<00:01:42.750> you're<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.860> get

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
almost always you're not going to get

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.210 
almost always you're not going to get
the<00:01:44.479> cleanest<00:01:45.479> looking<00:01:45.899> water<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.860> assure

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the cleanest looking water but I assure

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.789 
the cleanest looking water but I assure
you<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.270> purified<00:01:49.259> through<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you it is all purified through the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.280 
you it is all purified through the
ground<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.490> perfectly<00:01:51.030> okay<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> drink<00:01:51.750> even

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
ground it's perfectly okay to drink even

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.080 
ground it's perfectly okay to drink even
if<00:01:52.500> you're<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> ocean<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.820> far

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
if you're at the ocean if you go far

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.209 
if you're at the ocean if you go far
enough<00:01:54.240> inland<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.259> dig<00:01:55.590> down<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.040> where

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
enough inland you can dig down to where

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.100 
enough inland you can dig down to where
that<00:01:56.310> ocean<00:01:56.729> water<00:01:56.850> seeped<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.659> is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that ocean water seeped in and is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.700 
that ocean water seeped in and is
completely<00:01:58.950> fresh<00:01:59.219> water<00:01:59.579> completely

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
completely fresh water completely

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.460 
completely fresh water completely
absolute<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.890> salt<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
absolute of salt and

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.610 
absolute of salt and
and<00:02:03.590> chlorine<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:04.640> sodium<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.510> that's<00:02:06.500> the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
and chlorine and sodium so that's the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.950 
and chlorine and sodium so that's the
basic<00:02:06.920> way<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.130> purify<00:02:08.000> water<00:02:08.240> using<00:02:08.930> the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
basic way to purify water using the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.590 
basic way to purify water using the
ground<00:02:09.610> let's<00:02:10.610> move<00:02:10.820> on<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.150> next<00:02:11.390> way<00:02:11.570> of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
ground let's move on to this next way of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.350 
ground let's move on to this next way of
purifying<00:02:12.110> water
