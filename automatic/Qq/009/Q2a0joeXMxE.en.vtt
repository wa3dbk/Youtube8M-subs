00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
biggest I felt him because look at

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.199 
biggest I felt him because look at
Hadden<00:02:52.680> did<00:02:52.799> real<00:02:52.980> well<00:02:53.010> less<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.549> big

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
Hadden did real well less and the big

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.900 
Hadden did real well less and the big
crowd<00:02:54.450> Mayweather<00:02:55.310> he<00:02:56.310> doesn't<00:02:56.610> drive<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
crowd Mayweather he doesn't drive the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.550 
crowd Mayweather he doesn't drive the
pay-per-view<00:02:57.209> wise<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:57.840> Manny<00:02:58.080> Pacquiao<00:02:58.530> is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
pay-per-view wise like Manny Pacquiao is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.759 
pay-per-view wise like Manny Pacquiao is
I<00:02:59.010> think<00:02:59.069> Hadden<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.910> Pacquiao<00:03:00.720> would<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:01.049> one

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
I think Hadden and Pacquiao would be one

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:02.949 
I think Hadden and Pacquiao would be one
of<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.920> biggest<00:03:02.070> fights<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.579> time

for<00:04:19.350> Manny<00:04:19.530> Pacquiao<00:04:20.039> well<00:04:20.370> perhaps<00:04:20.639> I<00:04:21.269> think

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
for Manny Pacquiao well perhaps I think

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.749

the<00:04:21.930> big<00:04:22.109> fight<00:04:22.320> out<00:04:22.470> there<00:04:22.500> for<00:04:22.830> him<00:04:22.949> is<00:04:23.130> Ricky

the big fight out there for him is Ricky

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.980 
the big fight out there for him is Ricky
Hatton<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.300> think<00:04:24.509> we'll<00:04:24.630> see<00:04:24.810> that

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990
