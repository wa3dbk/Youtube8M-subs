00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.880 
let's see how we can transfer them into
something<00:00:54.590> new<00:00:54.859> without<00:00:55.210> just<00:00:56.210> mimicking

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
something new without just mimicking

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.229 
something new without just mimicking
electronic<00:00:57.890> music<00:00:58.760> for<00:00:59.660> an<00:00:59.750> orchestra<00:01:00.789> in<00:01:01.789> the

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
electronic music for an orchestra in the

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.479 
electronic music for an orchestra in the
beginning<00:01:02.629> I<00:01:02.870> still<00:01:03.079> had<00:01:03.289> an<00:01:03.530> iPad<00:01:04.040> with<00:01:04.280> me

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
beginning I still had an iPad with me

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.850 
beginning I still had an iPad with me
that<00:01:04.790> controlled<00:01:05.269> some<00:01:06.140> effects<00:01:06.650> where<00:01:06.830> I

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
that controlled some effects where I

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.710 
that controlled some effects where I
because<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:07.550> thought<00:01:07.820> this<00:01:08.030> could<00:01:08.180> be<00:01:08.240> nice<00:01:08.450> but

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
because I thought this could be nice but

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.760 
because I thought this could be nice but
when<00:01:08.900> I<00:01:08.990> listened<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:10.329> the<00:01:11.530> rehearsal<00:01:12.530> I

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
when I listened to the rehearsal I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.039 
when I listened to the rehearsal I
thought<00:01:13.520> nah<00:01:13.790> man<00:01:14.000> this<00:01:14.180> is<00:01:14.329> gonna<00:01:14.540> be<00:01:14.630> even

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
thought nah man this is gonna be even

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.219 
thought nah man this is gonna be even
better<00:01:15.670> without<00:01:16.670> because<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:17.689> means<00:01:17.900> in<00:01:18.140> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
better without because that means in the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.630 
better without because that means in the
end<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:18.439> don't<00:01:18.590> need<00:01:18.890> microphones

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
end you don't need microphones

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.120 
end you don't need microphones
you<00:01:20.180> don't<00:01:20.420> need<00:01:20.720> speakers<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:21.680> don't<00:01:21.890> need

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
you don't need speakers you don't need

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.060 
you don't need speakers you don't need
need<00:01:22.610> mixing<00:01:23.090> discs<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:24.710> don't<00:01:24.920> need

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
need mixing discs and you don't need

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.120 
need mixing discs and you don't need
power<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.670> was<00:01:26.299> quite<00:01:26.540> fascinated<00:01:26.780> by<00:01:27.740> saying

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
power I was quite fascinated by saying

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.520 
power I was quite fascinated by saying
okay<00:01:29.000> we're<00:01:29.090> gonna<00:01:29.180> cut<00:01:29.720> all<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.020> away<00:01:30.259> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
okay we're gonna cut all that away and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.800 
okay we're gonna cut all that away and
make<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.009> pure<00:01:31.310> this<00:01:32.149> made<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:32.600> even<00:01:32.689> more

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
make it pure this made it even more

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.780 
make it pure this made it even more
difficult<00:01:33.140> in<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.649> end<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.040> but<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.490> think<00:01:34.700> it

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
difficult in the end but but I think it

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.840 
difficult in the end but but I think it
was<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.909> good<00:01:35.060> idea

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.540 

these<00:01:38.850> instruments<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.510> made<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.320> play<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
these instruments are made to play in a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.280 
these instruments are made to play in a
concert<00:01:41.850> hall<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.510> that<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.960> hall<00:01:43.140> is

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
concert hall and and that the hall is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.900 
concert hall and and that the hall is
there<00:01:43.650> for<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.550> there<00:01:44.730> for

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
there for them and they are there for

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.640 
there for them and they are there for
the<00:01:44.970> hall<00:01:45.120> so<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.080> you<00:01:46.200> bring<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.500> together

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
the hall so if you bring them together

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.700 
the hall so if you bring them together
it<00:01:46.890> absolutely<00:01:47.310> makes<00:01:47.520> sense<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
it absolutely makes sense and and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.100 
it absolutely makes sense and and
somehow<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.980> more<00:01:50.190> essential<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.110> think

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
somehow it's more essential I think

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
somehow it's more essential I think
whenever<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.620> write<00:01:52.980> something<00:01:53.400> especially

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
whenever you write something especially

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270 
whenever you write something especially
if<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.300> a<00:01:54.360> bigger<00:01:54.570> thing<00:01:54.690> for<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.410> film<00:01:55.650> or<00:01:56.040> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
if it's a bigger thing for a film or a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.840 
if it's a bigger thing for a film or a
whole<00:01:56.970> album<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.920> think<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.040> always<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.640> good

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
whole album I think it's always a good

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060 
whole album I think it's always a good
idea<00:01:59.910> to<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> big<00:02:00.720> concept<00:02:01.590> an<00:02:01.830> idea

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
idea to have a big concept an idea

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.040 
idea to have a big concept an idea
behind<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.060> whole<00:02:03.180> thing<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.870> that

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
behind the whole thing because that

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.590 
behind the whole thing because that
keeps<00:02:04.620> everything<00:02:04.950> together<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.970> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
keeps everything together so and I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.060 
keeps everything together so and I
wouldn't<00:02:06.840> even<00:02:06.900> call<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> limitation<00:02:07.950> it's

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
wouldn't even call it a limitation it's

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.480 
wouldn't even call it a limitation it's
more<00:02:08.660> certain<00:02:09.660> parameters<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
more certain parameters and then you

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.860 
more certain parameters and then you
work<00:02:11.640> within<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.540> very<00:02:12.720> often

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
work within that and that's very often

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.420 
work within that and that's very often
very<00:02:13.140> helpful<00:02:13.320> if<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.770> want<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.040> create

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
very helpful if you want to create

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.869 
very helpful if you want to create
something

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.089 

it's<00:02:18.749> always<00:02:18.870> difficult<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.499> me<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.709> be<00:02:19.799> proud

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
it's always difficult for me to be proud

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's always difficult for me to be proud
of<00:02:20.129> something<00:02:20.780> because<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.069> probably<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.189> work

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
of something because I probably I work

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.039 
of something because I probably I work
too<00:02:23.579> much<00:02:23.609> in<00:02:23.969> there<00:02:24.120> because<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.450> jump<00:02:24.930> from

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
too much in there because I jump from

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.949 
too much in there because I jump from
one<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.499> the<00:02:25.530> next<00:02:25.620> thing<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.269> but<00:02:27.269> when<00:02:27.659> this

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
one to the next thing and but when this

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.709 
one to the next thing and but when this
was<00:02:28.170> played<00:02:28.439> in<00:02:28.469> Berlin<00:02:28.950> at<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.430> Philharmonic

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
was played in Berlin at the Philharmonic

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.390 
was played in Berlin at the Philharmonic
and<00:02:30.719> I<00:02:30.870> sat<00:02:31.349> in<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.530> audience<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:32.249> thought

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and I sat in the audience and I thought

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.479 
and I sat in the audience and I thought
yeah<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.989> now<00:02:34.109> there's<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.010> lot<00:02:35.189> of<00:02:35.310> work

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
yeah this is now there's a lot of work

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.420 
yeah this is now there's a lot of work
involved<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.569> think<00:02:36.810> it's<00:02:36.930> good<00:02:37.139> and<00:02:37.400> yeah

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
involved and I think it's good and yeah

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.220 
involved and I think it's good and yeah
I<00:02:38.579> felt

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230
