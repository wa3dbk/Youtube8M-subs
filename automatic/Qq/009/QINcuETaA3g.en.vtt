curvy shape the patent was actually

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.650 
curvy shape the patent was actually
submitted<00:00:58.289> way<00:00:58.440> back<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.890> 2010<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.910> probably

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
submitted way back in 2010 so probably

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.459 
submitted way back in 2010 so probably
means<00:01:00.840> they've<00:01:00.930> been<00:01:01.050> prepping<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
means they've been prepping that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
means they've been prepping that
technology<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> past<00:01:02.430> few<00:01:02.640> years<00:01:02.969> but

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
technology for the past few years but

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.179 
technology for the past few years but
don't<00:01:04.110> keep<00:01:04.320> your<00:01:04.500> fingers<00:01:04.799> crossed<00:01:04.830> we're

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
gonna see it anytime in the near future

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
gonna see it anytime in the near future
far<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> put<00:01:07.140> money<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> I'd<00:01:07.799> say<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.189> this

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
far to put money on it I'd say that this

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.590 
far to put money on it I'd say that this
is<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.610> used<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:08.909> entirely<00:01:09.270> new<00:01:09.420> type

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
is gonna be used for entirely new type

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.929 
is gonna be used for entirely new type
of<00:01:09.659> products<00:01:10.170> perhaps<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.760> would

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
of products perhaps one that you would

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.960 
of products perhaps one that you would
wear<00:01:12.180> somewhere<00:01:13.170> other<00:01:13.799> than<00:01:13.950> talk<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
wear somewhere other than talk to on a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
wear somewhere other than talk to on a
phone<00:01:15.270> would<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.659> pretty<00:01:15.930> good<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> new

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
phone would be pretty good for a new

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.560 
phone would be pretty good for a new
curved<00:01:17.220> touchscreen<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.299> might<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
curved touchscreen that might be the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.899 
curved touchscreen that might be the
first<00:01:18.840> place<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.409> something<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.580> curved

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
first place we see something on a curved

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.609 
first place we see something on a curved
touchscreen<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> bet<00:01:21.990> we'll<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
touchscreen and I bet we'll see that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.320 
touchscreen and I bet we'll see that
sometime<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.900> 2014<00:01:25.040> it's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.189> watch<00:01:26.460> Android<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
sometime in 2014 it's a watch Android is

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.940 
sometime in 2014 it's a watch Android is
quite<00:01:27.600> obviously<00:01:27.960> taking<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> mobile<00:01:28.860> world

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
quite obviously taking the mobile world

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.410 
quite obviously taking the mobile world
by<00:01:29.189> storm<00:01:29.250> largely<00:01:29.850> due<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> price<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
by storm largely due to the price that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.910 
by storm largely due to the price that
it<00:01:30.630> costs<00:01:30.840> manufacturers<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> might<00:01:31.770> want

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it costs manufacturers so you might want

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.289 
it costs manufacturers so you might want
to<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.310> calculator<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.090> cost

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to get out your calculator but it cost

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.620 
to get out your calculator but it cost
them<00:01:33.450> zero<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.439> goose<00:01:34.950> egg<00:01:35.159> big<00:01:35.729> fatty<00:01:36.030> bigger
