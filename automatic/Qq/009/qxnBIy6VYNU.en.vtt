these are very little small speakers but

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.660 
these are very little small speakers but
they<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.290> give<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.799> pretty<00:01:41.040> good<00:01:41.280> amount<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
they do give you a pretty good amount of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429 
they do give you a pretty good amount of
sound<00:01:41.820> also<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> back<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.350> have

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
sound also on the back of this you have

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.030 
sound also on the back of this you have
a<00:01:43.590> 3.5<00:01:44.399> millimeter<00:01:44.820> stereo<00:01:45.810> audio<00:01:46.259> jack<00:01:46.799> so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
a 3.5 millimeter stereo audio jack so

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.380 
a 3.5 millimeter stereo audio jack so
that<00:01:47.159> means<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.640> only<00:01:47.850> does<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.210> work

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that means it not only does this work

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
that means it not only does this work
with<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.140> iPod<00:01:49.500> Nano<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> iPod<00:01:50.310> Touch

and the iPod Classic and also the iPhone

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.219 
and the iPod Classic and also the iPhone
but<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.030> work<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.270> any<00:01:54.509> mp3<00:01:54.840> player<00:01:55.170> that
