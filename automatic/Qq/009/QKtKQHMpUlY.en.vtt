00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 well after 51 very pretty careers tell 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.250
 if passing by is very beautiful 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.480
 effect even I reached a length 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.899
 cool 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.559
 in my good scarf that's what it is 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.960
 bigger 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:35.640
 makes more careers or less - 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.360
 careers study in differs from your 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.629
 execution 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.910
 the jewel as I already joins mine here 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.040
 I'm going to perform one last 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.920
 lows career to have a 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.010
 final one a finalization in truth is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.469
 of execution at that point because I still 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.359
 I'll put some items 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.870
 So that's the way I 'm setting the 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.059
 wire leaves're pinching me well can 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.789
 unless there is blur at this point 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.150
 do not know is whether or not you 're making a 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.510
 run around and see your work 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.900
 now you work each point one point 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.490
 low no novelty no simple 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.320
 low points 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.840
 always remembering that we were 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:27.420
 working with 18 points 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:31.140
 then I should hit 18 lows 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.049
 In this career, I will also close my 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.659
 running'll cut my wire will 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.130
 get my wire and then I'll go back here 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:45.180
 to add the last or best 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.020
 the last items for which our piece 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:54.000
 be completely closed 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.759
 good now it's just the last moments 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.359
 of our execution so here I already have 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.140
 the whole piece is made and I only need to close 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.429
 on the tips each tip has 18 stitches 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.030
 low 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:11.250
 I here opt for fringes that I think 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.560
 very beautiful I think it gives a charm to 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.770
 more to the piece right? 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.240
 so here we will make fringes for 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.269
 run the fringe 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.690
 obviously you will need the wire 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.620
 nothing changes you will need something that 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.830
 serve 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.650
 by default the size of your fringe 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.690
 I'm going to use a dvd box. 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.440
 here i have blame abba ball show 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.159
 and love really cool flap disc as well but 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.549
 finally 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:44.250
 So I'm going to use a capinha here. 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:49.319
 of cd / dvd né 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.829
 where I will pass my wire doubly 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.489
 or for each point I will have two 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.829
 wires by assembling the strip totaling 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.470
 four points at the same point 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:06.989
 and I saw what confusion we are going to 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.959
 life is like this, put the wire right 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:15.030
 I positioned it and you're going cold 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:18.870
 that's the way I want it too 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.819
 My double for every point I'll have 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.299
 two tips 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:29.849
 What I 'm going to do instead of 18 laps 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:32.220
 I 'll give 36 after the 36 laps we 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.069
 We'll cut then I 'll tell you here 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:40.290
 My twists and I'm going back here to cut 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:43.470
 with you 36 turns in the box after the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.750
 It cuts as my my account 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.480
 is at the top the cut is done in 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.269
 It's also good, so go ahead and 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.730
 scissors by the wire look what I passing 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.319
 and cut 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.629
 Just let me get it right here that I see. 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.629
 A movie is out, I'm cutting it. 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.120
 zinho 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:10.500
 cut and cut this tip that also 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.379
 because they have not been cut or 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.480
 cut it back here 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:18.269
 now I have everything cut out frontin 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.690
 here are the wires that will be used to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.610
 Fringe fitting good here I am 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.590
 making the fringe of one end tá 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.690
 You'll have to do this twice. 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.970
 because I'll do it twice too 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.400
 here we will see how it is placed 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.919
 frange then look here, I already come with 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.469
 some fringes placed for you to have 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.950
 how this is done is the 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:43.620
 next one 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.840
 payer two ne wires strips that you 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.560
 cut fold in half 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.130
 here you will have the exact center point 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.920
 of your children 's bent that the 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.460
 People are going to do the needle with the 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.650
 front facing you 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:07.290
 passes the needle through a low 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.600
 let me position it right there 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.910
 not getting to pick up now I will 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.110
 catch a train and was all right here 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:20.790
 I got then I got the fringe 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:25.170
 half and passes it thrown inside the 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.750
 point and the wide loop is all fringes 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.150
 and passes through the point that was 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.960
 on the needle 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:38.370
 I fix it, force it legal, and the fringe is 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.840
 placed look there seeing belezinha 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:48.570
 let's do it once again pick up two wires 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:53.550
 there in the middle passes the needle through the 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:57.710
 low pull the thrown out the 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.940
 close loop everything and pass after that 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.450
 tightens the knot 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.260
 Look, the betting fringe is now repeating. 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:10.280
 that at every point on this side and 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.280
 this side
