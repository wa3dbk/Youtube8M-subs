 offered 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.800
 the security at the airport was enormous 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.380
 important, at least, you can see that too 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.050
 employer side so the federal association 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 the security industry is bdsg 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.260

 strike at the expense of passengers 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.609
 record today 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.949
 with an increase of only 20 percent 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.110
 the bds like to offer that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.619
 Airport staff but not satisfied 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.360
 give 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.189
 we just think that ours 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.530
 work to be paid somewhere more 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.750
 must be recognized for it and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.130
 not always with small droplets yes 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.810
 we have been where we are for years 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.450
 go where more lag behind 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.740
 yes and everything will be more expensive outside 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.229
 should we still finance that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.970
 yes, that is no longer yes how should 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 today my glasses should pay for my 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.720
 I pay teeth to a pension 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.600
 what have to do and that with 1300 euro 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.829
 the bargaining should be on 5 march 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.320
 to be continued 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.329
 the bdsd points out that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 a possible tariff increase but also 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.320
 Negative consequences bring with it last 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.820
 endes and of course that's the topic 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.409
 what you need to address him directly 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.939
 Here are the costs then increased 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.189
 if he continues to be given, that is 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.380
 for example, the air security forces 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.360
 value over fees paid over the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.920
 Air safety charges if you 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.630
 Next time you leave 30 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 percent or pay 40 percent more 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.759
 if I think so too 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.409
 not be so pleased 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.090
 So just the whole context 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.560
 See that would be synonymous other benefits 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.880
 getting more expensive again is not like that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.920
 we are in a vacuum but the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 increase granted today so far 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.910
 from the customers last endes too 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.850
 get paid 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.740
 in the terminals got the ca 150th 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.720
 a thousand vacation and business travelers 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.400
 the disputes between employers 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.710
 and employees 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.780
 three hours wait and more before the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.790
 Security checks canceled flights 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.080
 and pass them because of the stuffy 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.450
 air collapsed 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.030
 at the airport there was chaos in the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.440
 areas of personal control 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.090
 cargo control airport security and 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.730
 Services was not working anymore 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.430
 I understand for the strike I 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.600
 but that would have to be better organized 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.250
 it will be a few this morning 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.100
 people fell over because of the air 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.400
 bad was only then came to air 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.950
 drove in the front area and it is very 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.260
 exhausting especially for the elderly it 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.720
 is impossible that there is more than here 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.250
 20,000 people want to fly here 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.290
 we already have enough money for it 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.810
 I always have understanding for 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.430
 strike I have myself in the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.020
 industry worked and traveled the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.590
 Strikes are necessary if you 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.540
 something has to prevail 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.400
 my patience and my tolerance before 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.140
 Unfortunately, everything is godly now 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.390
 exhausted because they have to 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.790
 imagine that you have 50,000 people 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.160
 stand each fate 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.900
 and then you have to do that too 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.519
 responsible once ask this 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.209
 avert strike 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.769
 There are financial resources in advance 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.140
 to do that but I have very big 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.239
 Understanding would be the fair wages 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.379
 you do not need to pay a line to get paid 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.300
 stand 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.710
 circuit senior 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.450
 if you yourself are concerned at work 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.880
 is one wants to also decent of you 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.170
 the service staff will be paid on 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.400
 Airport was trying 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.560
 damage limitation 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.590
 sandwiches and water were free 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.480
 distributed to the waiting until 23 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.010
 The strike is supposed to continue 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.180
 tomorrow, however, the flight operations 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.180
 normalize again
