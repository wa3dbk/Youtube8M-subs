 hi youtube friends 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.980
 today I will talk a little about how to recover 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.570
 your blurred photos we see a 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.470
 little by little we have our own photo 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:33.930
 obviously there is not a fuzzy one but 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:38.930
 now directly this nature the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.930
 our true in a bit so much will come 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.220
 done 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.110
 then we do publish a 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:54.520
 image or against j 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.060
 or we bring our level here 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.920
 let's take the diffusion methods 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:08.620
 overlay we go into the other filter 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:11.070
 at the massage center and from here 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.070
 we regulate 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:26.100
 click on here as you see the photo 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.180
 real played a little 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.270
 we then recovered something else 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.270
 we can also use this function for 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.040
 give a little sharpness of ours 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.460
 foto we propose you a photo with the mass 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.490
 on perfect fire and we do the same 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:03.390
 process after I call them overlap 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:12.050
 filter 100 steps we don't put of a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:12.050
 fur the ray as you see 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 does not address our photo is 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.460
 augmented I hope this tutorial there 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.110
 both liked it 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.110
 see you at the next tutorial
