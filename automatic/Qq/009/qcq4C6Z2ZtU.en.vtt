00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
actually know what this isn't that great

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.379 
actually know what this isn't that great
of<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.739> spot<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> pretty<00:03:08.760> good<00:03:09.060> spot

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
of a spot but it is a pretty good spot

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.370 
of a spot but it is a pretty good spot
I'd<00:03:09.569> have<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.870> say<00:03:10.370> looks<00:03:11.370> like

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
I'd have to say looks like

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
I'd have to say looks like
it<00:03:14.380> almost<00:03:14.530> looks<00:03:14.860> like<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.070> could<00:03:15.160> get<00:03:15.310> right

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
it almost looks like you could get right

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.430 
it almost looks like you could get right
there<00:03:15.550> look<00:03:15.730> at<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:15.880> it's<00:03:16.120> kind<00:03:16.270> of<00:03:16.390> clear<00:03:16.750> is

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
there look at that it's kind of clear is

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.380 
there look at that it's kind of clear is
that<00:03:17.500> ice<00:03:17.800> or<00:03:18.040> something<00:03:18.190> cuz<00:03:19.030> look<00:03:19.180> at<00:03:19.300> it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
that ice or something cuz look at it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.020 
that ice or something cuz look at it
it's<00:03:19.540> clear<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.430> don't<00:03:21.430> know<00:03:21.490> we're<00:03:21.700> gonna<00:03:21.820> stay

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
it's clear I don't know we're gonna stay

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.690 
it's clear I don't know we're gonna stay
on<00:03:22.270> this<00:03:22.660> tree<00:03:22.990> until<00:03:23.230> we<00:03:23.500> see<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.860> hider<00:03:24.160> or

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
on this tree until we see the hider or

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.250 
on this tree until we see the hider or
the<00:03:24.850> seeker<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.600> we<00:03:25.690> see<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.900> seeker

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
the seeker so we see the seeker

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.230 
the seeker so we see the seeker
somewhere<00:03:27.070> near<00:03:27.340> us<00:03:27.460> once<00:03:27.670> we<00:03:27.760> see<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.970> secret

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
somewhere near us once we see the secret

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.730 
somewhere near us once we see the secret
we're<00:03:28.360> going<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.540> start<00:03:28.720> running<00:03:29.050> around<00:03:29.500> and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
we're going to start running around and

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.530 
we're going to start running around and
hopefully<00:03:30.340> just<00:03:30.820> hopefully<00:03:31.270> we<00:03:31.390> don't

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
hopefully just hopefully we don't

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.230 
hopefully just hopefully we don't
actually<00:03:31.780> get<00:03:32.080> guy<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.910> os<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.030> him<00:03:34.150> up

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
actually get guy and os that him up

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.540 
actually get guy and os that him up
there<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.570> think<00:03:34.870> that's<00:03:34.990> them<00:03:35.110> I'm<00:03:36.100> not<00:03:36.490> sure

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
there I think that's them I'm not sure

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.880 
there I think that's them I'm not sure
who<00:03:37.090> is<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.360> either<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.870> really<00:03:38.590> have<00:03:38.680> no<00:03:38.860> clue

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
who is it either I really have no clue

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.350 
who is it either I really have no clue
is<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.550> don't<00:03:39.790> know<00:03:39.910> all<00:03:40.120> they're

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
is it I don't know all they're

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.120 
is it I don't know all they're
everywhere<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.140> think<00:03:41.470> everybody<00:03:41.830> had<00:03:42.010> the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
everywhere I think everybody had the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.860 
everywhere I think everybody had the
same<00:03:42.160> kind<00:03:42.550> of<00:03:42.670> idea<00:03:42.820> just<00:03:43.180> go<00:03:43.390> up<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.720> top

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
same kind of idea just go up to the top

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.810 
same kind of idea just go up to the top
if<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.770> is<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.070> person<00:03:45.340> who's<00:03:45.460> that<00:03:45.640> he

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
if that is the person who's that he

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
if that is the person who's that he
definitely<00:03:46.060> just<00:03:46.480> saw<00:03:46.660> me<00:03:48.180> but<00:03:49.180> then<00:03:49.330> again<00:03:49.360> if

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
definitely just saw me but then again if

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.300 
definitely just saw me but then again if
the<00:03:49.930> person<00:03:50.170> who<00:03:50.230> set<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.440> up<00:03:50.560> there<00:03:50.800> we<00:03:51.130> really

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
the person who set it up there we really

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.350 
the person who set it up there we really
should<00:03:51.520> have<00:03:51.580> did<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> chest<00:03:52.000> way<00:03:52.150> thing<00:03:52.330> I

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
should have did the chest way thing I

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.490 
should have did the chest way thing I
should've<00:03:52.600> been<00:03:52.630> more<00:03:52.720> clear<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.200> basically

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
should've been more clear but basically

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.740 
should've been more clear but basically
normally<00:03:54.400> what<00:03:54.550> would<00:03:54.670> happen<00:03:55.030> i<00:03:55.090> think<00:03:55.450> is

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
normally what would happen i think is

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.850 
normally what would happen i think is
whenever<00:03:56.020> you're<00:03:56.260> doing<00:03:56.500> this<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.740> would

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
whenever you're doing this you would

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.110 
whenever you're doing this you would
take<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.160> chest<00:03:57.400> plate<00:03:57.580> off<00:03:57.730> if<00:03:57.940> you're<00:03:58.090> a

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
take the chest plate off if you're a

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.840 
take the chest plate off if you're a

oh here we go or does this go oh yeah
this<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.590> decent

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
this is decent

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.429 
this is decent
yeah<00:05:13.490> yeah<00:05:14.360> yeah<00:05:14.599> yeah<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:14.900> think<00:05:15.289> this<00:05:15.379> is

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.439 
yeah yeah yeah yeah I think this is

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.529 
yeah yeah yeah yeah I think this is
gonna<00:05:15.770> be<00:05:16.009> the<00:05:16.129> best<00:05:16.340> pot<00:05:16.639> and<00:05:16.969> this<00:05:17.240> goes<00:05:17.419> down

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
gonna be the best pot and this goes down

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:18.999 
gonna be the best pot and this goes down
to<00:05:17.689> their<00:05:17.870> which<00:05:18.080> they<00:05:18.229> might<00:05:18.439> actually<00:05:18.650> come

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
to their which they might actually come

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.309 
to their which they might actually come
up<00:05:19.189> here<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.729> think<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.300> best<00:05:20.569> way<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.990> hide

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
up here I think the best way to hide

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.260 
up here I think the best way to hide
here<00:05:21.770> would<00:05:22.159> be<00:05:22.189> to<00:05:22.280> like<00:05:22.490> stand<00:05:22.969> right<00:05:23.240> here

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270
