just starting with those two and then

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.040 
just starting with those two and then
we'll<00:00:34.649> build<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:35.100> there<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:36.840> have

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and we're gonna go back to the same

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.179 
and we're gonna go back to the same
example<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.230> our<00:01:01.730> dragon<00:01:02.730> guns<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
example of our dragon guns and so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.000 
example of our dragon guns and so
unbeknownst<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.640> party<00:01:06.530> what<00:01:07.530> happens

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
unbeknownst to the party what happens

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.969 
unbeknownst to the party what happens
here<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.960> goblins<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.470> let's<00:01:10.860> say

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
here is that the goblins are let's say

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.840 
here is that the goblins are let's say
they're<00:01:11.189> one<00:01:11.820> spraying<00:01:12.270> fire<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:14.520> other<00:01:14.610> one

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
they're one spraying fire the other one

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.359 
they're one spraying fire the other one
sprays<00:01:15.180> acid<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:21.320> now<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.040> they

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
sprays acid and now you have and they

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.609 
sprays acid and now you have and they
should<00:01:23.610> overlap<00:01:24.060> there<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> middle<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
should overlap there in the middle so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.179 
should overlap there in the middle so
that's<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.130> very<00:01:26.369> dangerous<00:01:26.549> spot<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:28.189> once

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that's a very dangerous spot to be once

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.100 
that's a very dangerous spot to be once
the<00:01:29.340> fight<00:01:29.520> starts<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> party<00:01:30.900> begins

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the fight starts and the party begins

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.010 
the fight starts and the party begins
moving<00:01:31.490> these<00:01:32.490> guns<00:01:32.820> begin<00:01:33.240> spraying<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
moving these guns begin spraying and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
moving these guns begin spraying and
these<00:01:34.500> goblins<00:01:34.890> because<00:01:35.189> they're<00:01:35.369> behind

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

there's only one that they can see they
have<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.119> somehow<00:01:48.329> stop<00:01:48.840> them<00:01:49.170> from<00:01:50.780> or

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.910 
having a different more difficult time
because<00:02:09.959> there's<00:02:10.259> an<00:02:10.349> arrow<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> choke<00:02:10.890> point

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
because there's an arrow a choke point

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.190 
because there's an arrow a choke point
and<00:02:11.760> they're<00:02:11.879> getting<00:02:12.000> sprayed<00:02:12.450> almost

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
and they're getting sprayed almost

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040 
and they're getting sprayed almost
time<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:14.209> perhaps<00:02:15.209> one<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.540> them<00:02:15.810> has

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
time so perhaps one of them has

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.410 
time so perhaps one of them has
resistance<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.190> but<00:02:17.610> has<00:02:17.790> two<00:02:18.030> let's<00:02:18.360> say

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
resistance to one but has two let's say

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.240 
resistance to one but has two let's say
our<00:02:18.569> fighter<00:02:18.870> has<00:02:19.140> fire<00:02:19.410> resistance<00:02:19.980> maybe

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
our fighter has fire resistance maybe

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.030 
our fighter has fire resistance maybe
he's<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.519> tea<00:02:21.209> fling<00:02:21.510> or<00:02:21.629> something<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.590> he

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
he's a tea fling or something and he

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.640 
he's a tea fling or something and he
comes<00:02:23.310> over<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.879> he's<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.360> well<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.349> can<00:02:25.620> I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
comes over to the he's like well I can I

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.740 
comes over to the he's like well I can I
can<00:02:25.920> try<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.220> go<00:02:26.879> that<00:02:27.090> way<00:02:27.269> or<00:02:29.269> he<00:02:30.269> moves<00:02:30.540> her

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
can try and go that way or he moves her

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.420 
can try and go that way or he moves her
maybe<00:02:30.989> he's<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.140> azemar<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.739> has<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.069> acid

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
maybe he's in azemar and has the acid

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.910 
maybe he's in azemar and has the acid
resistance<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.970> think<00:02:33.180> they<00:02:33.300> have<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.560> so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
resistance I think they have that and so

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.490 
resistance I think they have that and so
they<00:02:35.069> choose<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.810> know<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.080> better<00:02:37.260> of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
they choose the you know the better of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.699 
they choose the you know the better of
the<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.190> two<00:02:38.400> situations<00:02:39.180> or<00:02:39.510> they<00:02:40.470> try

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
the the two situations or they try

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.800 
the the two situations or they try
precision<00:02:41.340> shots<00:02:41.700> through<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.540> narrow

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
precision shots through the narrow

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.710 
precision shots through the narrow
entryway<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:43.680> they<00:02:44.040> try<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.310> clog<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:44.940> now

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
entryway or they try and clog it up now

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720 
entryway or they try and clog it up now
they<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> lot<00:02:46.440> more<00:02:46.620> difficult<00:02:47.130> time

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
they have a lot more difficult time

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.319 
they have a lot more difficult time
ahead<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.269> them<00:02:48.680> but<00:02:49.680> all<00:02:50.099> we're<00:02:50.970> only<00:02:51.120> using

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
movement speed and now you have to get a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.949 
movement speed and now you have to get a
heal<00:03:28.739> check<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.459> pry<00:03:30.299> them<00:03:30.540> out<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.840> to

stop the bleeding and the pain so this

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.170 
stop the bleeding and the pain so this
adds<00:03:34.380> another<00:03:34.530> another<00:03:35.160> elements<00:03:35.730> it's<00:03:36.000> an

adds another another elements it's an

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.180 
adds another another elements it's an
item<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.660> creates<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.170> terrain<00:03:37.470> effect<00:03:37.889> or<00:03:38.100> an

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
area condition and now look at this they

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.410 
area condition and now look at this they
they<00:03:42.420> are<00:03:42.600> moving<00:03:42.989> through<00:03:43.519> different<00:03:44.519> ways

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
they are moving through different ways

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.530 
they are moving through different ways
you<00:03:45.720> know<00:03:45.810> fiery<00:03:46.519> acid<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:48.060> they're<00:03:48.329> getting

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
you know fiery acid and they're getting

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.539 
you know fiery acid and they're getting
their<00:03:48.750> feet

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
their feet

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.710

stepped<00:03:50.549> on<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.269> figure<00:03:51.480> out<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.690> know

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
stepped on I have to figure out you know

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.379 
stepped on I have to figure out you know
maybe<00:03:51.989> they'll<00:03:52.200> do<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.920> gust<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.850> wind<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.299> blow

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
maybe they'll do a gust of wind to blow

the<00:03:54.630> cow<00:03:54.840> chops<00:03:55.230> away<00:03:56.090> maybe<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.359> works

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
the cow chops away maybe that works

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.420 
the cow chops away maybe that works
maybe<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.109> doesn't<00:03:58.230> maybe<00:03:58.769> their<00:03:59.010> gust<00:03:59.190> isn't

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
maybe it doesn't maybe their gust isn't

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.699 
maybe it doesn't maybe their gust isn't
