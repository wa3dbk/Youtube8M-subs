I like a sign up to five tire it's fine

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:52.750 
I like a sign up to five tire it's fine
without<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> lot<00:02:37.450> easier

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.429 

a<00:02:53.230> little<00:02:54.230> bit<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.439> that<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.079> always<00:02:57.290> got

a little bit of that and you always got
look<00:02:57.560> for<00:02:57.680> direction<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.189> tire<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.610> tire

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
look for direction the tire this tire

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.390 
look for direction the tire this tire
here<00:02:59.319> scaled<00:03:00.319> up<00:03:00.379> on<00:03:00.530> sister<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.220> tire<00:03:01.370> is

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
here scaled up on sister this tire is

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.770 
here scaled up on sister this tire is
meant<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.700> drive<00:03:01.879> that<00:03:02.120> family<00:03:02.769> so<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:05.180> brakes

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
meant to drive that family so the brakes

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.839 
meant to drive that family so the brakes
are<00:03:05.930> always<00:03:06.200> on<00:03:06.319> this<00:03:06.470> side<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:07.579> is<00:03:07.640> the

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
are always on this side so this is the

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.160 
are always on this side so this is the
right<00:03:07.970> direction<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.629> actually<00:03:08.930> spinning

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
right direction to actually spinning

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.000 
right direction to actually spinning
it's<00:03:12.170> basically<00:03:12.739> fine<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:15.260> rim<00:03:15.470> pole<00:03:15.709> where<00:03:15.980> I

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
it's basically fine the rim pole where I

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.399 
it's basically fine the rim pole where I
already<00:03:16.400> thought<00:03:16.610> right<00:03:16.879> here<00:03:18.159> stick<00:03:23.409> you

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
already thought right here stick you

stick the bow stem through the hole put
the<00:03:28.310> nut<00:03:28.489> on<00:03:28.519> just<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.060> hold<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.329> so<00:03:29.510> that'll

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
the nut on just to hold it so that'll

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.839 
the nut on just to hold it so that'll
slide<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.170> -<00:03:30.349> under<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.799> insulation<00:03:33.849> and
