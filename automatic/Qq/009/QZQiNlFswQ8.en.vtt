at the same time without tripping

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.309 
at the same time without tripping
breakers<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:46.509> other<00:01:46.689> option<00:01:47.049> you<00:01:47.109> have<00:01:47.170> is

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
breakers the other option you have is

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.739 
breakers the other option you have is
your<00:01:47.679> shoreline<00:01:47.979> so<00:01:48.819> basically<00:01:49.149> I<00:01:49.240> can<00:01:49.539> plug

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
your shoreline so basically I can plug

your shoreline so basically I can plug
into<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:50.859> customers<00:01:51.399> home<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.630> can

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
into the to the customers home and I can

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.629 
into the to the customers home and I can
run<00:01:52.990> my<00:01:53.020> power<00:01:53.350> off<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.829> shoreline<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.490> their

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
run my power off the shoreline of their

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.609 
run my power off the shoreline of their
home<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.179> can<00:01:55.329> run<00:01:55.479> my<00:01:55.509> equipment<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.409> only

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
home and I can run my equipment the only

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.129 
home and I can run my equipment the only
drawback<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.159> if<00:01:57.789> if<00:01:58.329> I<00:01:58.509> have<00:01:58.659> everything<00:01:58.929> on

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
drawback is if if I have everything on

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:00.690 
drawback is if if I have everything on
in<00:01:59.289> my<00:01:59.380> van<00:01:59.560> at<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.799> same<00:01:59.979> time<00:02:00.219> it<00:02:00.399> will<00:02:00.520> trip

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
in my van at the same time it will trip

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.309 
in my van at the same time it will trip

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
their breakers so you want to make sure

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.230 
their breakers so you want to make sure
you<00:02:02.740> either<00:02:02.889> plug<00:02:03.189> in<00:02:03.369> two<00:02:03.459> separate<00:02:03.789> outlets

or in the fall or in the wintertime when
it's<00:02:10.420> cool<00:02:10.599> I<00:02:10.899> typically<00:02:11.650> always<00:02:11.860> plug<00:02:12.280> in

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
it's cool I typically always plug in

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
my oil myself I make sure my air filters

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.950 
my oil myself I make sure my air filters
changed

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
changed

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.170 
changed

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
of the components that keep me working

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.710 
of the components that keep me working
every<00:02:41.830> day<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:42.610> want<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.940> make<00:02:43.090> sure<00:02:43.330> you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
have a good air conditioner that has

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.490 
have a good air conditioner that has
enough<00:02:45.520> BTUs<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.480> keep<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.780> van<00:02:46.960> cool<00:02:47.260> during

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
enough BTUs to keep the van cool during

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.650 
enough BTUs to keep the van cool during
the<00:02:47.620> day<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:47.890> basically<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.850> have<00:02:48.970> an<00:02:49.060> RV<00:02:49.270> type

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the day so basically I have an RV type

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.780 
the day so basically I have an RV type
air<00:02:49.960> conditioner<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.680> top<00:02:50.860> in<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.460> can

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
air conditioner on the top in it I can

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.490 
air conditioner on the top in it I can
run<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.420> keeps<00:02:52.690> everything<00:02:52.930> cool<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.470> I

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
run it and it keeps everything cool so I

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.380 
run it and it keeps everything cool so I
don't<00:02:53.680> have<00:02:53.770> any<00:02:53.920> problem<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.400> do<00:02:55.210> all

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
don't have any problem with that do all

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.630 
don't have any problem with that do all
my<00:02:55.510> grooming<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.990> my<00:02:56.140> table<00:02:56.890> here<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.520> an

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
my grooming on my table here this is an

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.700 
my grooming on my table here this is an
ultra<00:02:57.940> lift<00:02:58.120> table<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.870> went<00:02:59.380> with<00:02:59.590> the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
ultra lift table so I went with the

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.470 
ultra lift table so I went with the
electric<00:03:00.100> table<00:03:00.400> instead<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.880> hydraulics

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
electric table instead of the hydraulics

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.330 
electric table instead of the hydraulics
so<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.660> can<00:03:01.930> basically<00:03:02.080> lower<00:03:02.530> my<00:03:02.740> table<00:03:03.130> almost

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.220 
so I can basically lower my table almost
to<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.700> floor<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.210> if<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.390> have<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.540> big<00:03:04.780> dog<00:03:04.990> I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.840 
to the floor so if I have a big dog I
can<00:03:05.290> bring<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.680> big<00:03:05.830> dog<00:03:06.010> right<00:03:06.220> up<00:03:06.400> on<00:03:06.580> it<00:03:06.700> and

gives me a lot of flexibility so from
what<00:03:14.710> we<00:03:14.830> saw<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.220> back<00:03:15.370> where<00:03:15.640> my<00:03:15.790> clipper

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
what we saw in the back where my clipper

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.760 
what we saw in the back where my clipper
vac<00:03:16.270> system<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.750> this<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.320> hose<00:03:17.530> that

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
comes in so basically that hose runs to
