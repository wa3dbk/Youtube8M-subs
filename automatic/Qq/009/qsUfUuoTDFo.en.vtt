00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.420
 the first step is to put a pan in 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.480
 our stove with oil and we're going to 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.110
 start browning the chops for both 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.659
 sides so that it is well browned and 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.790
 what we are going to do is to drain the very 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.790
 well of the excess oil that they have 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.700
 once they are well drained I'm going 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.619
 to put on a plate and I put them 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.799

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.539
 only those that we are going to occupy we are going 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.689
 to put in our blender what is 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:41.590
 the English sauce sorry let's put 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:46.929
 also what is the piece of onion 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.180
 garlic and cumin little fist will 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:53.600
 put the two tablespoons of sugar 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.770
 we will also put in the three quarters of 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.770

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.420
 to your liking 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.400
 and we are going to liquefy this mixture very well 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.620
 until without interest if they want then if 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.690
 it looks very thick they can add a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.280
 little water to make it less 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.940
 thick 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.850
 We are going to put a pan on the fire and 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.010
 let's put a little oil in 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.410
 this oil what we are going to do is that 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.110
 let's add what is the sauce that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.210
 we liquefy and we will try to 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.240
 let it boil a little 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.900
 let's put it on a slow fire so that 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.200
 this sauce can what is cooking very 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.200
 all right 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.840
 after this procedure we are going to 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.500
 add little by little the chops and 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.930
 The only thing we are going to do is try to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.920
 the chops are impregnated with this sauce 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.520
 and we're going to leave them for a few minutes 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.350
 that boils and we can cover them if they like 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.800
 you can not do them by turning to stay 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.989
 in the flavor of the sauce and it's all that 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.989
 let's wait for them to be ready 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.890
 and ready the only thing they have to do is 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.250
