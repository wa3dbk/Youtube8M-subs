 as smooth as possible at low 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.099
 the whole axis method is used 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:17.190
 crossed step technique which the viewer 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.350
 can see the movie second be zen

 stone by

 counterattack wave energy movement should 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:35.239
 be as soft and smooth as possible

 need to learn to react sensitively 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 for every movement of training

 partner only in this case can 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.370
 achieve significant results in 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.370
 this exercise 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.030
 look closely at the position of the legs

 human view, which can be determined 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.890
 in a very simple way of spreading your arms 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.530
 the sides simultaneously looking at

 watch when your fingers disappear from the field 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.750
 This view is the boundaries of your

 peripheral vision performer 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.360
 must be outside these boundaries 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.360
 constantly
