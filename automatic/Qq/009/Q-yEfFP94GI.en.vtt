00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.850
 hello everyone with you max and today we 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.920
 review mod you have 2206 loaf for 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.990
 spintires 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:28.349
 let's start with the appearance of the car did vasik 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.040
 dirty that is he practically 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.690
 completely covered with dirt 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.200
 as I understood the author could not do 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 clear varnish on 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:47.340
 and here I did something incomprehensible in general I 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.440
 did not understand the idea let's say even if it 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 could not make a transparent window but not 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.570
 able analysis failed he could 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.239
 just scientists did what it was to do 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.289
 that's what I understand he wanted 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.289
 do mud I whom the window near judging by 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.289
 divorces 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.840
 it seems to be mud 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.689
 hotter to be honest not if she 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.820
 wanted to make the windows dirty he could he 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.490
 here to take this texture that's something that 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 kuza did five he couldn't do there 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.190
 window window for some reason here's a bargain orange 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.590
 In general, I do not know the first impression when 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.020
 see it is created on the windows 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:38.700
 rust for some reason but so it is generally in 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.250
 pony my vision looks great of course 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.300
 wheels even near the body all the coals and 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.540
 everything is as it should be volume 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:54.660
 fuel tank 80 liters and 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:02:00.390
 300 points of damage addons it does not have 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.390
 his sound is from UAZ 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.349
 the main thing from him is taken from 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.709
 from UAZ that is, and the fuel tank and glasses 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.489
 damage but physics he has his own ie 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.920
 physics 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.930
 the author did his physics to him and 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.660
 very good cross him 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.030
 very good meaning he is not good 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.069
 goes even without locks that is enough 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:39.550
 turn on all-wheel drive it is already normal 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:43.630
 will go here stop signals are burning here we are 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.299
 see a number of dimensions lights are on and if I 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.030
 I do not know, they illuminate something or not it is necessary to 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.940
 will watch at night in general put 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:59.819
 learn but connected five do not burn 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.819
 dimensions do not burn order 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.370
 and we have a lot to stretch for a long time 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.190
 I'll just go for a ride I 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.190
 show a little so he drives 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.980
 Well, here it is almost the same 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.459
 same as it arose or the same i am not 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.569
 I remember neither in my opinion it’s the same here 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.999
 i want 1 used 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.680
 although blocking notice i won't turn that 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.680
 there is only four-wheel drive 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.650
 do not you agree, he goes well 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.760
 here many already sit down before unlocking 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.410
 here and so here 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.950
 besides the texture on where is the same 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.310
 superimposed more and here's the game so 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.310
 to tell 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.110
 mazik such a little with Russian ideas 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:29.320
 in terms of what's on his side and a shovel 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.320
 fastened and an ax on the back door 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.669
 but 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:43.080
 he has no problems with water 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.080
 he has no problems either 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.650
 Here are these generally excellent plus 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.650
 Kostanay be given a little 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.470
 don't often see quality lasik 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.910
 bespin tarasa because water 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.360
 there were steam trains good in terms of model 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.550
 but in the tomb here is the fact that they have 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.910
 there was a physics standard troops which 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:21.040
 I personally like it categorically 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.040
 it hurts soft and I don’t know 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.990
 quite correct azik standard here 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.840
 she keeps getting ready for a while 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:54.139
 by the way I looked about him from you 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.139
 military campaign yes he has military basses 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:01.250
 have a loaf on military bridges you like 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.699
 it says what our people just do not 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.699
 will make 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.360
 oh not diagonal like 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.740
 you look well it's just nonsense 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.740
 how where are you still did not take the lock 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.530
 But in general, such a doctor turned out 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:35.360
 I really liked the plan 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:37.400
 passable physics here it is necessary he even 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.320
 it looks good again 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.360
 tense up 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.780
 windows by the way here is the salon 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:48.050
 But if he and he fi normal windows 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:54.380
 by the way there is no dirt even in the cabin and 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:56.570
 camouflage including generally very 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.230
 good mod is the only thing that me 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:04.160
 annoying it is that he has the front 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:07.700
 hooks and the rear ones, too, into it 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.490
 hooks 2 hooks for some reason go from 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.820
 hooked so to speak for protection 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:16.880
 steering at all for the first time so attacks 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.760
 This despite the fact that it is not worth 10 winch and 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.090
 Why did the author do this and Azadi total for 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.090
 bridge 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.260
 Well, somehow a little strange in my opinion and 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.160
 hardly that life for the bridge is better at all 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.960
 don't cling because it's easy to snatch it 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:38.970
 I did not understand why I did not do it for 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:41.820
 protection if she has a winch in general 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.160
 have some misunderstandings of my pancakes with 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.870
 do something at least with windows 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.490
 head wait transparent but at least 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.740
 do you not know here or 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:54.620
 redo this dirt or just do 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:59.520
 hell texture and everything is well in general here 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:03.920
 so here's a medic everyone thanks for watching 

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.920
 with you was max all bye
