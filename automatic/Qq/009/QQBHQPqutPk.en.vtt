 just a new gamepad by the way irfa for 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.750

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.750
 America 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.380
 just bought one joystick so far tomorrow 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.799
 buy one more 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.840
 fate could well yes and rude yes I 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.899
 I play on the emulator on the way 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.850
 comp 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:32.479
 Until I bought one joystick to test 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:40.310
 work does not work son order all 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:43.179
 It operates such a huddle blockages and villages 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.179
 let's finish it 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.110
 Today 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.150
 just look like what's on the gamepad 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.690
 but on the keyboard I do not recommend 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.900
 pass on such an atrocity 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.620
 fucking hands can break it by the way Sorry 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.880
 the sound of the sound does not work the court of Macedonia 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.720
 and then did not try does not appear 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:14.770
 so by the way we play according to the scheme of a new sheet 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.770
 i.e. maher my list is easier to say so 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.820
 Yesterday I remember, I no longer played 4 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:31.870

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:37.870

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:43.230

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:48.700

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:55.299
 blew yesterday registered in general like this 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:03:00.959
 Here's the way the game does not hang 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.959
 to brake on just the fuck brakes 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.349
 quietly quietly be prescribed now 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.349
 basic do not indulge 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.420

 I'll really say the fish well I'm already starting 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.220
 little by little 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.220
 beat the keys 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.800
 to remember the blows 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:48.860

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.230
 tambourine and reading lucky ok on 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.230
 gamepad is much nicer than 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.739
 way than on the keyboard much 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.390
 more pleasant to play on the gamepad 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:18.570
 i'm a simple gamepad nothing tricky and 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:21.019
 bananas no vibration simple simple 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.019
 justin 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.849
 inspiration first day path to station 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.849
 So 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.059
 pull on 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.480

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.830
 thank you mortal kombat'a that nice 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:46.669
 gamepad eat circular joking of course but 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.180
 nothing is ruled out until we get insolently 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:52.460
 him 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:55.190
 until you kill herself angles this 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.870
 the final boss tony knows maybe and drag 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.870
 there was no spoiler for all the same 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:08.009
 and whether I will have a ceiling 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:12.389
 I honestly don't know something about 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.389
 playstation joystick 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.900
 everything will be now 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.300
 just 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.190
 do not seem to try right away 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:36.520
 do on the keyboard on the joystick me 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:36.520
 I somehow played a little like that without recording 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:44.690
 everything is normal in fatality there somehow 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.159
 being done by us did not work can are looking for 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.990
 don't give them poke i'm not used to 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.990
 gamepad game give power an hour and a half 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.990
 already decided to include the record well on this we 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:03.590
 and finish now the actual volume 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:07.159
 Jaks and you will be happy so how would 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.270
 we have to finish you then my dear 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.270
 the way to finish off 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.919
 do not think now that he wants to take 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:26.660
 she wants to take a gun from her 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:30.479
 here is the head of Ermak 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.979
 fatalities in general it tries at all 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.289
 can apply here no own 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.970
 Fatality combinations here 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.889
 think of them yourself let's say I 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.669
 now applied remember to whom 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.479
 I wonder who can not dig up the top 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.180
 triangle 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.539
 then down down x then down down 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.009
 triangle that's when he too do 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:53.580
 up top triangle he tore him 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:58.289
 arm closer to the end of school I pressed down 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:01.800
 down x then when he when he broke in 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:04.320
 second hand I pressed down the bottom of the triangle 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:08.550
 and to give them the spine pressed 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.669
 down the bottom circle so follow you 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.990
 teach him a year but little thought for you 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.990
 kill already in the next part 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:25.880
