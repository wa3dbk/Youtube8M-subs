00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
ain't going to work but after you got

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.699 
ain't going to work but after you got
that<00:03:55.049> done<00:03:55.319> you<00:03:56.220> push<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.639> button<00:03:56.849> up<00:03:57.150> here

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
that done you push this button up here

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.800 
that done you push this button up here
and<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:59.099> will<00:03:59.340> retracting<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.450> rest<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
and it will retracting the rest of the

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.210 
and it will retracting the rest of the
string<00:04:01.079> as<00:04:01.859> so<00:04:04.340> now<00:04:06.019> by<00:04:07.019> doing<00:04:07.349> so<00:04:07.560> he<00:04:08.069> can

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
string as so now by doing so he can

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.420 
string as so now by doing so he can
become<00:04:08.340> loose<00:04:08.609> and<00:04:08.849> fall<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.980> but<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.280> does

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
become loose and fall so but it does

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.920 
become loose and fall so but it does
serve<00:04:11.730> as<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> nice<00:04:12.120> display<00:04:12.419> piece<00:04:12.540> though

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
serve as a nice display piece though

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.990 
serve as a nice display piece though
which<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:14.010> will<00:04:14.130> have<00:04:14.160> them<00:04:14.340> displayed<00:04:14.669> with

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
which I will have them displayed with

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.930 
which I will have them displayed with
either<00:04:15.150> spider-man<00:04:15.630> hanging<00:04:16.049> or<00:04:16.940> sitting

perched on top of the gargoyle base
itself<00:04:20.959> now<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.109> is<00:04:22.229> probably<00:04:22.409> one<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
itself now this is probably one of the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.050 
itself now this is probably one of the
better<00:04:22.950> figures<00:04:23.520> with<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.729> gimmick<00:04:23.940> because

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
better figures with the gimmick because

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.760 
better figures with the gimmick because
it<00:04:24.240> doesn't<00:04:24.479> impede<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.200> figure<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.500> any<00:04:25.620> way

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
it doesn't impede the figure in any way

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.570 
it doesn't impede the figure in any way
shape<00:04:25.950> or<00:04:26.099> form<00:04:26.159> because

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
shape or form because

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.279 
shape or form because
chattering<00:04:26.759> how<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.030> gimmick<00:04:27.449> is<00:04:27.599> a<00:04:27.659> separate

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
chattering how the gimmick is a separate

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.369 
chattering how the gimmick is a separate
piece<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.960> live<00:04:31.169> right<00:04:31.470> here<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:34.080> as<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.319> was

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
piece so live right here so as I was

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.499 
piece so live right here so as I was
saying<00:04:34.490> this<00:04:35.490> spider-man<00:04:36.000> figure<00:04:36.270> is

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
saying this spider-man figure is

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.689 
saying this spider-man figure is
possibly<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.199> best<00:04:37.349> figure<00:04:37.650> out<00:04:37.800> their<00:04:37.979> best

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
possibly the best figure out their best

opinion<00:04:40.520> uh<00:04:42.740> coming<00:04:43.740> next<00:04:44.009> would<00:04:44.159> be<00:04:44.340> the

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
opinion uh coming next would be the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.480 
opinion uh coming next would be the

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
well from the Aerie series and a little

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.869 
well from the Aerie series and a little
gray<00:04:51.659> felt<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.020> speaker<00:04:52.460> move<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.550> bass<00:04:53.729> out

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
gray felt the speaker move the bass out

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.689 
gray felt the speaker move the bass out
of<00:04:53.939> the<00:04:54.060> way

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
of the way

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.369 
of the way
my<00:04:56.699> only<00:04:56.849> grapes<00:04:57.150> about<00:04:57.900> this<00:04:58.020> figure<00:04:58.169> are

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 
my only grapes about this figure are

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.300 
my only grapes about this figure are
actually<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:59.039> mine<00:04:59.310> in<00:04:59.460> particular

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
actually in mine in particular

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.570 
actually in mine in particular
unfortunately<00:05:02.310> though<00:05:02.460> he<00:05:03.030> has<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:04.280> very<00:05:05.280> loose

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
unfortunately though he has a very loose

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.899 
unfortunately though he has a very loose
torso<00:05:07.159> as<00:05:08.159> well<00:05:08.219> as<00:05:08.610> one<00:05:08.969> his<00:05:09.449> left<00:05:09.840> knee<00:05:10.909> the

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
torso as well as one his left knee the

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.390 
torso as well as one his left knee the
one<00:05:12.060> right<00:05:12.240> here<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.629> top<00:05:13.530> one<00:05:13.710> is<00:05:13.889> very<00:05:14.099> this<00:05:14.219> as

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
one right here a top one is very this as

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.439 
one right here a top one is very this as
well<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.879> makes<00:05:15.060> him<00:05:15.270> hard<00:05:15.539> for<00:05:15.690> standing

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
well so it makes him hard for standing

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.909 
well so it makes him hard for standing
now<00:05:18.449> one<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:18.900> might<00:05:19.080> be<00:05:19.199> universal<00:05:19.740> in<00:05:19.830> all

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
now one that might be universal in all

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.209 
now one that might be universal in all
figures<00:05:20.279> are<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:21.000> fingers<00:05:22.250> itself<00:05:25.069> back<00:05:26.069> it

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
figures are the fingers itself back it

up<00:05:26.279> I<00:05:26.430> think<00:05:26.669> I<00:05:26.759> said<00:05:26.939> Universal<00:05:27.509> fingers<00:05:27.810> I

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
up I think I said Universal fingers I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.119 
up I think I said Universal fingers I
met<00:05:28.500> figures<00:05:29.599> anyways<00:05:30.599> his<00:05:31.289> fingers<00:05:31.740> if<00:05:32.009> you

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 
met figures anyways his fingers if you

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.839 
met figures anyways his fingers if you
can<00:05:32.400> kind<00:05:32.819> of<00:05:33.000> see<00:05:33.889> and<00:05:34.889> I<00:05:35.430> think<00:05:35.490> is<00:05:35.699> going<00:05:35.729> to

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
can kind of see and I think is going to

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.809 
can kind of see and I think is going to
focus<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:37.620> probably<00:05:37.949> not<00:05:38.039> but<00:05:39.029> the<00:05:39.150> very<00:05:39.330> thin

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
focus and probably not but the very thin

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.700 
focus and probably not but the very thin
so<00:05:41.819> they<00:05:41.940> feel<00:05:42.120> like<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:43.169> move<00:05:43.289> too<00:05:43.529> much<00:05:43.560> I

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
so they feel like to move too much I

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.790 
so they feel like to move too much I
feel<00:05:44.039> really<00:05:44.279> loose<00:05:44.520> as<00:05:44.759> you<00:05:44.789> move<00:05:45.000> them<00:05:45.800> so

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
feel really loose as you move them so

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.430 
feel really loose as you move them so
beware<00:05:47.279> that<00:05:47.490> they<00:05:47.669> might<00:05:47.990> over<00:05:48.990> time<00:05:49.229> they

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
beware that they might over time they

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.240 
beware that they might over time they
might<00:05:49.620> stress<00:05:49.979> enough<00:05:50.580> and<00:05:50.819> break<00:05:51.029> off<00:05:52.250> so

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
might stress enough and break off so

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.680
