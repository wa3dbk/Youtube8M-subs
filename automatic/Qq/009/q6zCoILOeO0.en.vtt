14<00:00:42.629> not<00:00:43.629> bad<00:00:44.640> okay<00:00:45.640> so<00:00:45.870> these<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:47.890> expendable

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
14 not bad okay so these are expendable

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.049 
14 not bad okay so these are expendable
they<00:00:49.989> could<00:00:50.199> fit<00:00:50.379> very<00:00:50.620> large<00:00:50.890> heads<00:00:51.160> like

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
they could fit very large heads like

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.270 
they could fit very large heads like
that<00:00:54.809> ok<00:00:55.809> so<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.290> plastic<00:00:56.680> they<00:00:56.800> made<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.130> with

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
that ok so the plastic they made it with

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.110 
that ok so the plastic they made it with
seems<00:00:57.910> kind<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.329> cheap<00:00:58.630> and<00:00:58.870> flimsy<00:00:59.550> when<00:01:00.550> you

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
seems kind of cheap and flimsy when you

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.420 
seems kind of cheap and flimsy when you
fold<00:01:01.390> it<00:01:01.600> when<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:01.989> when<00:01:02.649> I'm<00:01:02.770> folding<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.280> I'm

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
fold it when I when I'm folding it I'm

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.249 
fold it when I when I'm folding it I'm
scared<00:01:04.180> it's<00:01:04.330> like<00:01:04.449> you're<00:01:04.570> gonna<00:01:04.690> break<00:01:05.050> off

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
scared it's like you're gonna break off

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.820 
scared it's like you're gonna break off
or<00:01:05.500> something<00:01:06.270> these<00:01:07.270> ear<00:01:07.540> cushions<00:01:08.050> very

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
or something these ear cushions very

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.620 
or something these ear cushions very
soft<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.550> top<00:01:10.180> ones<00:01:10.390> here<00:01:12.420> unfortunately<00:01:13.420> it

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
soft and top ones here unfortunately it

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.790 
soft and top ones here unfortunately it
has<00:01:13.780> two<00:01:14.080> chords<00:01:14.970> leaning<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.149> one<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:17.560> would

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
has two chords leaning to one it would

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.170 
has two chords leaning to one it would
have<00:01:17.890> been<00:01:17.979> better<00:01:18.039> it<00:01:18.369> feels<00:01:18.399> just<00:01:18.610> one<00:01:18.880> chord

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
have been better it feels just one chord

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.200 
have been better it feels just one chord
so<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.630> could<00:01:19.810> be<00:01:19.840> more<00:01:20.170> manageable<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
so it could be more manageable this

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.680 
so it could be more manageable this
chord<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.930> about<00:01:23.229> four<00:01:23.530> feet<00:01:23.740> long<00:01:24.360> has<00:01:25.360> a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
chord is about four feet long has a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.559 
chord is about four feet long has a
gold-plated<00:01:26.880> 3.5<00:01:27.880> millimeter<00:01:28.179> jack<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:30.569> it

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
gold-plated 3.5 millimeter jack and it

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.370 
gold-plated 3.5 millimeter jack and it
has<00:01:31.780> hinges<00:01:32.229> here<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.729> both<00:01:33.940> sides<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.569> a<00:01:34.599> huge

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
has hinges here on both sides and a huge

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.120 
has hinges here on both sides and a huge
there<00:01:35.679> you<00:01:35.979> can<00:01:36.130> see<00:01:37.410> that's<00:01:38.410> for<00:01:38.590> folding<00:01:38.950> it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
there you can see that's for folding it

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.859 
there you can see that's for folding it
and<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.470> easiest<00:01:41.860> way<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:42.130> fold<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.670> is<00:01:42.869> to

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
and the easiest way to fold it is to

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
and the easiest way to fold it is to
start<00:01:44.080> off<00:01:44.170> like<00:01:44.319> this<00:01:44.700> both<00:01:45.700> facing<00:01:46.119> down<00:01:46.330> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
start off like this both facing down and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.050 
start off like this both facing down and
put<00:01:48.880> one<00:01:49.090> up<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:50.190> just<00:01:51.190> fold<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.849> top

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
put one up and just fold this the top

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.910 
put one up and just fold this the top
that's<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.899> smallest<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.380> could<00:01:53.530> get<00:01:53.679> pretty

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
that's the smallest it could get pretty

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.339 
that's the smallest it could get pretty
good<00:01:54.340> size<00:01:54.550> so<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:55.509> can<00:01:55.720> bring<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.959> on<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.080> plane

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
good size so you can bring it on a plane

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.029 
good size so you can bring it on a plane
or<00:01:56.500> something<00:01:57.209> and<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:59.380> forgot<00:01:59.679> to<00:01:59.830> tell<00:01:59.979> you

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
or something and I forgot to tell you

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.160 
or something and I forgot to tell you
but<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:00.340> probably<00:02:00.550> already<00:02:00.759> know<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.720> these

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
but you probably already know that these

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.999 
but you probably already know that these
earpieces<00:02:03.840> rotate<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:05.619> way<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.160> this<00:02:07.030> way

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
earpieces rotate that way and this way

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.000 
earpieces rotate that way and this way
so<00:02:09.009> that's<00:02:09.190> pretty<00:02:09.369> good<00:02:09.580> okay<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.470> let's<00:02:11.800> test

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
so that's pretty good okay so let's test

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.979
