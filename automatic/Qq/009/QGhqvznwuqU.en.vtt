00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
of on Bradley side at the start um when

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.670 
of on Bradley side at the start um when
I<00:02:10.170> heard<00:02:10.500> about<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.009> fight

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
I heard about this fight

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.250 
I heard about this fight
made<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.219> hadn't<00:02:12.489> been<00:02:12.519> made<00:02:12.909> yet<00:02:12.939> but<00:02:13.750> just

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
made it hadn't been made yet but just

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.759 
made it hadn't been made yet but just
early<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:14.739> i<00:02:14.769> favored<00:02:15.519> Bradley<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.900> believe

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
early on i favored Bradley I believe

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.709 
early on i favored Bradley I believe
being<00:02:18.069> too<00:02:18.370> aggressive<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:19.090> coming<00:02:19.420> forward

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
being too aggressive and coming forward

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.740 
being too aggressive and coming forward
style<00:02:20.280> he<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.459> do<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.879> but<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.299> don't<00:02:22.540> think

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
style he can do it but I don't think

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.229 
style he can do it but I don't think
that's<00:02:22.870> his<00:02:23.170> style<00:02:23.640> he<00:02:24.640> was<00:02:24.760> also<00:02:24.939> going

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
that's his style he was also going

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.809 
that's his style he was also going
Willie<00:02:25.540> bland<00:02:25.870> was<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.370> was<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> good<00:02:27.640> amateur

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
Willie bland was a was a good amateur

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.530 
Willie bland was a was a good amateur
and<00:02:28.269> he<00:02:29.230> was<00:02:29.379> a<00:02:29.409> defensive<00:02:30.159> fighter<00:02:30.459> so<00:02:30.939> it<00:02:31.420> was

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and he was a defensive fighter so it was

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.929 
and he was a defensive fighter so it was
harder<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:31.900> him<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.379> go<00:02:32.889> and<00:02:33.099> hunt<00:02:33.370> someone

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
harder for him to go and hunt someone

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.240 
harder for him to go and hunt someone
down<00:02:34.090> when<00:02:34.540> they're<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.230> move<00:02:35.409> and<00:02:35.709> looked

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
down when they're on the move and looked

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.580 
down when they're on the move and looked
good<00:02:36.519> like<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.090> said<00:02:37.420> he's<00:02:37.780> got<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.989> really<00:02:38.290> solid

was things that impressed me but like I
said<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:36.669> think<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:38.040> he's<00:03:39.040> not<00:03:39.280> busy<00:03:39.669> enough

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
said I think that he's not busy enough

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.390 
said I think that he's not busy enough
in<00:03:40.449> that<00:03:40.509> aggressive<00:03:41.379> style<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.040> that's<00:03:42.189> why

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
in that aggressive style and that's why

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.520 
in that aggressive style and that's why
I<00:03:42.430> think<00:03:42.579> against<00:03:43.239> Bradley<00:03:43.659> I'm<00:03:43.810> gonna<00:03:44.109> go<00:03:44.349> of

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
comes to him I just think that a lot of

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.580 
comes to him I just think that a lot of
times<00:03:51.759> a<00:03:51.970> lot<00:03:52.120> when<00:03:52.599> he<00:03:52.629> was<00:03:52.720> coming<00:03:53.049> into<00:03:53.379> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
times a lot when he was coming into the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.110 
times a lot when he was coming into the
pocket<00:03:54.040> he<00:03:54.189> had<00:03:54.370> his<00:03:54.519> hands<00:03:54.819> up<00:03:54.909> nice<00:03:55.090> and

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
pocket he had his hands up nice and

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.599 
pocket he had his hands up nice and
tight<00:03:55.479> but<00:03:55.720> he<00:03:55.810> wasn't<00:03:56.049> letting<00:03:56.439> go<00:03:56.739> with<00:03:57.579> a

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
tight but he wasn't letting go with a

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.670 
tight but he wasn't letting go with a
nut<00:03:57.909> enough<00:03:58.449> punches<00:03:58.959> he<00:03:59.169> his<00:03:59.349> work-rate

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
nut enough punches he his work-rate

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.530 
nut enough punches he his work-rate
wasn't<00:04:00.459> good<00:04:00.609> enough<00:04:00.639> considering<00:04:01.329> he<00:04:01.509> was

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
wasn't good enough considering he was

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.050 
wasn't good enough considering he was
going<00:04:02.019> against<00:04:02.349> a<00:04:02.500> guy<00:04:02.709> that<00:04:03.069> I<00:04:03.310> don't<00:04:03.819> think

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
going against a guy that I don't think

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.050 
going against a guy that I don't think
is<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.329> Bradley's<00:04:04.870> level<00:04:05.729> but<00:04:06.729> i<00:04:06.759> do<00:04:06.879> think

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
is on Bradley's level but i do think

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.509 
is on Bradley's level but i do think
Bradley<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.900> there<00:04:08.139> to<00:04:08.259> be<00:04:08.290> hit<00:04:08.650> too<00:04:08.859> much<00:04:09.099> and

Bradley is there to be hit too much and

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.939 
Bradley is there to be hit too much and

guys can punch that they have a pop in
their<00:04:29.020> punch<00:04:29.290> but<00:04:29.919> they're<00:04:30.070> definitely<00:04:30.250> not

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
their punch but they're definitely not

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.159 
their punch but they're definitely not
knockout<00:04:31.180> punchers<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:33.820> know<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.270> see

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
knockout punchers and you know so I see

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.590 
knockout punchers and you know so I see
a<00:04:35.199> lot<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.620> punches<00:04:36.100> thrown<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.639> see<00:04:36.880> Bradley<00:04:37.449> if

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
a lot of punches thrown I see Bradley if

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.930 
a lot of punches thrown I see Bradley if
he<00:04:37.720> is<00:04:37.870> getting<00:04:38.259> outboxed<00:04:38.889> being<00:04:39.520> even<00:04:39.910> more

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
he is getting outboxed being even more

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.529 
he is getting outboxed being even more
aggressive<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:40.750> just<00:04:41.050> going<00:04:41.440> for<00:04:41.710> it<00:04:41.770> um<00:04:42.539> and

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
aggressive and just going for it um and

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.270 
aggressive and just going for it um and
that's<00:04:43.660> what<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:43.930> think<00:04:44.259> the<00:04:44.380> aggressive<00:04:44.889> style

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
that's what I think the aggressive style

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.120 
that's what I think the aggressive style
of<00:04:45.490> Bradley<00:04:46.210> will<00:04:46.360> catch<00:04:46.570> up<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.810> him<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.350> can

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
of Bradley will catch up to him I can

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.980 
of Bradley will catch up to him I can
see<00:04:48.370> him<00:04:48.520> being<00:04:48.729> down<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.479> fight<00:04:49.780> and

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
see him being down in the fight and

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.930 
see him being down in the fight and
having<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.710> get<00:04:50.860> too<00:04:51.070> aggressive<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.759> so<00:04:51.910> I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
having to get too aggressive and so I

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.210 
having to get too aggressive and so I
could<00:04:52.210> see<00:04:52.360> knockdowns<00:04:52.870> there<00:04:53.289> but<00:04:53.979> I<00:04:54.009> am
