00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.899
 Yeah 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.450
 Where the boiler chimney was operating 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.929
 Because I was the owner of the house 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.669
 Because it connects directly under Paris 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.670
 It was decided to have eco-vila work on it 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 The FTC is wrecked 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.499
 We will get assistance 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.499
 You will receive 3,000 yen in general 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.610
 For this model 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.560
 Even compared to setting up a seat up to that much, Honda also 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.450
 Because it is not high 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.450
 It seems that the burden on the landlord is small. 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.400
 Here you can see the chimney and the air intake as you see 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.140
 It is separate from the meeting 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.130
 af 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.250
 Part of monitoring through this event 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.170
 I was surprised 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.100
 It means that there is no play in front 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.000
 Finally it's a bit expensive 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.050
 This is also young 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.590
 City with few concerns 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 Lol For good combustion efficiency 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.920
 There are also good things with fuel efficiency 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.660
 Because there is little to register as a member, the demand is further expanded 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.250
 When 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.580
 It seems 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.040
 Anti-yen 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.440
 Lol 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.680
 gol. 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 I think 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.240
 ap 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.870
 on the other hand 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.900
 Coverage statement 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 The real thing is the opening at the beginning 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
 All ecb uses stainless steel 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.310
 For conventional piping 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.240
 Because it is a serious month 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 There is also a game facility 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.870
 more than 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.789
 Plumbing work as it is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.789
 I used the previous piping 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:13.729
 It is both
