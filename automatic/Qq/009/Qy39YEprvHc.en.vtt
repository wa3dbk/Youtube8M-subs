the whole reason i decided to to do this

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770

m4 for my dad who built it and he was a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.860 
m4 for my dad who built it and he was a
United<00:00:56.670> States<00:00:56.879> soldier<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.390> went<00:00:57.570> overseas

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
in Iraq he did use an m4 and so i'm

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.060 
in Iraq he did use an m4 and so i'm
using<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> attachments<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.229> he<00:01:04.559> had<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.040> it

using the attachments that he had on it
um<00:01:05.510> which<00:01:06.510> aren't<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.439> best<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.460> the

attachments<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.090> weapon<00:01:18.360> r<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
attachments for this weapon r and the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.679 
attachments for this weapon r and the
downside<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.909> thing<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
downside of this thing which I was a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
downside of this thing which I was a
little<00:01:21.930> disappointed<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.189> only<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
little disappointed in is it is only a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.350 
little disappointed in is it is only a
burst<00:01:24.000> fire<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.770> semi-automatic<00:01:25.770> rifle<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
burst fire and semi-automatic rifle I I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.270 
burst fire and semi-automatic rifle I I
don't<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> wish<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.799> fully

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
don't like that I wish it was fully

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.010 
don't like that I wish it was fully
automatic<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.060> more<00:01:30.240> people<00:01:30.390> would<00:01:30.720> use

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
automatic I think more people would use

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380 
automatic I think more people would use
it<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.040> battlefield<00:01:32.640> 4<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.150> pretty

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it because in battlefield 4 and pretty

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.740 
it because in battlefield 4 and pretty
much<00:01:33.450> any<00:01:34.189> first<00:01:35.189> person<00:01:35.520> shooter<00:01:35.759> burst<00:01:36.479> fire

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
much any first person shooter burst fire

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
much any first person shooter burst fire
weapons<00:01:37.229> are<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:38.100> underpowered

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
weapons are a little underpowered

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
weapons are a little underpowered
compared<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> fully<00:01:39.720> automatic<00:01:40.409> there's

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
compared to fully automatic there's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.280 
compared to fully automatic there's
almost<00:01:40.890> no<00:01:41.189> reason<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.880> use<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.570> did<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
almost no reason to use it I did have a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.170 
almost no reason to use it I did have a
lot<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.500> fun<00:01:43.680> playing<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.399> gun<00:01:44.610> but

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
lot of fun playing with this gun but

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.810 
lot of fun playing with this gun but
it's<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.549> its

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it's just not as good as some of its

it's just not as good as some of its
counterparts<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.869> start<00:01:49.200> damage<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.799> 25<00:01:50.729> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
higher than most but you have to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.859 
higher than most but you have to

remember it is a burst fire weapon so

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.300

a little hesitant to do this video I was
just<00:02:50.489> doing<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.820> because<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:51.000> know<00:02:51.150> how

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270

things about using burst fire weapons is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.430 
things about using burst fire weapons is
controlling<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.910> recoil<00:03:15.480> because<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:16.230> not

it's<00:03:20.910> its<00:03:21.540> burst<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.590> have<00:03:22.769> to

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
it's its burst and so you have to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.970 
it's its burst and so you have to
continually<00:03:23.580> click<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.450> get<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:25.049> higher<00:03:25.739> rate

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980

continually click to get the higher rate
of<00:03:26.010> fire<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.299> I<00:03:27.600> saw<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.890> was<00:03:29.130> I

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
of fire and so I saw this and I was I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.240 
of fire and so I saw this and I was I
was<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.549> little<00:03:29.910> surprised<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.560> decided

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
was a little surprised and so I decided

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.759 
was a little surprised and so I decided

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
surprised I'm so thankful that I did

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.789 
surprised I'm so thankful that I did
this<00:03:42.030> gun<00:03:42.239> review<00:03:42.510> because<00:03:42.690> now<00:03:43.019> i<00:03:43.260> feel<00:03:43.739> that

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
this gun review because now i feel that

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.580 
this gun review because now i feel that
burst<00:03:44.250> fire<00:03:44.519> weapons<00:03:44.910> actually<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.260> used

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
burst fire weapons actually can be used

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.190 
burst fire weapons actually can be used
effectively<00:03:47.209> having<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.360> muzzle<00:03:48.750> brake<00:03:48.959> and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
effectively having that muzzle brake and

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.530 
effectively having that muzzle brake and
the<00:03:49.410> angled<00:03:49.769> foregrip<00:03:50.190> on<00:03:50.370> there<00:03:50.549> has

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
the angled foregrip on there has

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.920 
the angled foregrip on there has
improved<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.620> weapon<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.760> much<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.420> now<00:03:54.870> do

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
improved this weapon so much I now do

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.590 
improved this weapon so much I now do
see<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.440> reason<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.950> use<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.459> m4<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.150> any<00:03:57.360> other

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
see a reason to use the m4 and any other

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.210 
see a reason to use the m4 and any other
first<00:03:57.870> fire<00:03:58.140> weapon<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.709> game<00:03:58.890> and

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
first fire weapon in the game and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.729 
first fire weapon in the game and
because<00:03:59.880> this<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.329> burst<00:04:00.870> fire<00:04:01.140> weapon<00:04:01.620> I

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
because this is a burst fire weapon I

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.020 
because this is a burst fire weapon I
think<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.280> would<00:04:02.340> probably<00:04:02.640> be<00:04:02.820> better

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
think that it would probably be better

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.509 
think that it would probably be better
for<00:04:03.420> medium<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.810> longer<00:04:04.200> ranges<00:04:04.769> after<00:04:05.400> you

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
for medium to longer ranges after you

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.860 
for medium to longer ranges after you
put<00:04:05.700> on<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.910> muscle<00:04:06.209> break<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.570> angled

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
put on the muscle break and angled

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.180 
put on the muscle break and angled
foregrip<00:04:07.260> because<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.890> much<00:04:08.040> more

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
foregrip because it's so much more

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.710 
foregrip because it's so much more
stable<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.760> would<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.060> better<00:04:09.269> than<00:04:09.510> other

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
stable and would be better than other

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.750 
stable and would be better than other
carbines<00:04:10.170> at<00:04:10.410> longer<00:04:10.739> ranges<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.340> definitely

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
carbines at longer ranges I definitely

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.970 
carbines at longer ranges I definitely
recommend<00:04:12.060> trying<00:04:12.630> out<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.019> load<00:04:13.320> out<00:04:13.350> with

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
recommend trying out this load out with

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.460 
recommend trying out this load out with
with<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.489> burst<00:04:14.700> fire<00:04:14.970> weapon<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:16.169> think<00:04:16.380> you

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
with a burst fire weapon and I think you

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.080 
with a burst fire weapon and I think you
guys<00:04:16.590> would<00:04:16.709> be<00:04:16.769> pleasantly<00:04:17.280> surprised<00:04:17.729> how

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
guys would be pleasantly surprised how

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.060 
guys would be pleasantly surprised how
well<00:04:18.450> these<00:04:18.720> things<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.169> perform<00:04:19.620> if<00:04:19.829> you

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
well these things can perform if you

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.650 
well these things can perform if you
know<00:04:20.220> how<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.400> put<00:04:20.609> on<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.850> right<00:04:21.000> attachments

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
know how to put on the right attachments

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.600 
know how to put on the right attachments
I<00:04:21.810> will<00:04:22.470> definitely<00:04:22.620> be<00:04:23.010> playing<00:04:23.280> with<00:04:23.400> some

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
I will definitely be playing with some

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.279 
I will definitely be playing with some
more<00:04:23.760> burst<00:04:23.970> fire<00:04:24.150> weapons<00:04:24.539> in<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.870> future

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
more burst fire weapons in the future

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.320 
more burst fire weapons in the future
and<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:26.160> really<00:04:26.460> hope<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.669> they<00:04:26.789> add<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
and I really hope that they add the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.980 
and I really hope that they add the
a-and<00:04:27.889> 94<00:04:28.889> in<00:04:29.159> a<00:04:29.610> future<00:04:30.120> DLC<00:04:30.599> because<00:04:30.870> that

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
a-and 94 in a future DLC because that

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.029 
a-and 94 in a future DLC because that
was<00:04:31.080> when<00:04:31.199> my<00:04:31.259> favorite<00:04:31.560> weapons<00:04:31.860> in

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039

don't<00:04:34.710> know<00:04:34.830> about<00:04:34.949> that<00:04:35.099> it<00:04:35.520> had<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.210> two-round

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
don't know about that it had a two-round
