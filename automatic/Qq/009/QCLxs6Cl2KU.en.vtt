00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 or the camera less how to set 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.910
 welcome a mind to my channel in this 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.160
 I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.170
 share on the internet of your alcatel one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.049
 touch 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.580
 c3 this procedure is very general is 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.119
 very likely that it will also serve 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.130
 c1 and the rest of this version that has 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.270
 the same operating system is very 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.300
 important that if you want 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.430
 Internet sharing should have data in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.340
 your phone or else you will not have to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.269
 share and for that we follow the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.309
 Next steps 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 we just enter here by 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.480
 configuration and we are here by the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.239
 the caritas and the 345 points we go to the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.550
 configuration that the card and here is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.820
 the option where it says + we enter by 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.720
 she 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.250
 and here where it says usb modem and wifi zone 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.340
 is that we can share our 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.860
 internet and immediately enter by 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.079
 here in the peru of the wifi that has the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.000
 cellular will work as if it were a 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.949
 small router and our phone 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.100
 basically converts a router 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.540
 share our internet that is a 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.630
 through data with other devices 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.360
 that makes other tablets or their phones 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.290
 laptop so we give it good usb and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.100
 wifi zone 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.880
 we activate access to your wifi 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.400
 ready being already activated we see here 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.369
 this new new notification that 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.680
 the Wi-Fi signal appears 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.229
 it is usually here to the right happens 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.170
 to the left which indicates that it is the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.750
 Wi-Fi zone has already been activated is very 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.280
 also set it as important 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.860
 how will the cell phone work as a 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.170
 router is going to have a key in which 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.549
 you have to provide it and give it to the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.649
 another person who is going to connect to 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.720
 our cell phone so we 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:56.539
 we click on wifi access and here 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.460
 where it says here we're going to have the 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.590
 configuration options set 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.929
 a wifi the more click here in this option 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.690
 and this is where we can change the 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.490
 name is on the network that the others 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.860
 devices are watching I'm going to 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.090
 show with that everything I have here to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.380
 my side 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.300
 I assumed 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.180
 we are going to enter through the options 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.599
 configuration of this I assumed 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.140
 with this so that you can see that 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.930
 that Wi-Fi network already exists that is a network 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.090
 wifi that is creating the alcatel as 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.090
 You can see in the second option 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.670
 alcatel one touch has 3 and if I 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.150
 I would like to connect to this should enter 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.799
 the password that obviously must be 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.340
 set in the alcatel in this case 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.950
 there is an established connection 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.379
 we are going to cancel because the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.410
 configuration options of this 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.730
 moment in the poster are not 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.250
 established that is is allowing 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.200
 that any phone connects to it 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.780
 so you have to change the options 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.099
 of security from here open it 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.410
 select WPA2 PSK which obliges 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.030
 generate a password and here you 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.769
 we enter the password that we 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.310
 we want in this case can be a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.489
 very easy password 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.010
 for example hello world or anything 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.080
 with any variant at the end 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.080
 hello example 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:34.040
 also show or the 123 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.549
 the fact that it is more than 8 characters 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.980
 as one two three four five six and 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.450
 save that especially by study 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.430
