00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
something so we can get in there and let

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.059 
something so we can get in there and let
the<00:01:38.509> horse<00:01:38.720> realize<00:01:39.050> that<00:01:39.289> we<00:01:39.440> control<00:01:39.830> the

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:40.069 
the horse realize that we control the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.309 
the horse realize that we control the
environment<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.850> makes<00:01:41.509> catching<00:01:41.990> our<00:01:42.110> horse

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
environment and makes catching our horse

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.800 
environment and makes catching our horse
much<00:01:42.619> easier<00:01:43.179> there's<00:01:44.179> nothing<00:01:44.600> wrong<00:01:44.750> with

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
much easier there's nothing wrong with

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.450 
much easier there's nothing wrong with
putting<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.319> horse<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.770> round<00:01:46.009> pan<00:01:46.280> and

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
putting a horse in a round pan and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.010 
putting a horse in a round pan and
teaching<00:01:46.759> out<00:01:46.850> how<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.000> hook<00:01:47.179> on<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:47.929> and

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
teaching out how to hook on to you and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.169 
teaching out how to hook on to you and
how<00:01:48.319> to<00:01:48.380> get<00:01:48.619> caught<00:01:48.890> easier<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.550> think<00:01:50.090> a

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
how to get caught easier and I think a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.940 
how to get caught easier and I think a
lot<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:50.960> do<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.319> lot<00:01:51.500> on<00:01:51.649> my<00:01:51.679> own

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
lot of that and I do it a lot on my own

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.730 
lot of that and I do it a lot on my own
but<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.640> do<00:01:52.759> think<00:01:53.060> there's<00:01:53.149> a<00:01:53.330> misconception

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
but I do think there's a misconception

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.430 
but I do think there's a misconception
all<00:01:54.740> people<00:01:55.429> see<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.720> put<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:56.929> horse<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.350> a

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
all people see is you put a horse in a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.589 
all people see is you put a horse in a
round<00:01:57.649> pin<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.250> you're<00:01:58.819> running<00:01:59.209> and<00:01:59.420> running

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
and running and running until he's so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.699

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
missed so many opportunities that that

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.419 
missed so many opportunities that that
horse<00:02:06.080> had<00:02:06.289> shown<00:02:06.560> them<00:02:06.860> because<00:02:07.220> they<00:02:07.340> were

be<00:02:27.110> caught<00:02:27.819> now<00:02:28.819> if<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.150> notice<00:02:29.450> catching

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
be caught now if you notice catching

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.350 
be caught now if you notice catching
this<00:02:30.440> paint<00:02:30.860> he's<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.519> little<00:02:31.730> harder<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.180> catch

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
this paint he's a little harder to catch

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.240 
this paint he's a little harder to catch
he's<00:02:33.140> pretty<00:02:33.349> sure<00:02:33.560> he<00:02:33.650> doesn't<00:02:33.769> want<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.129> be

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
he's pretty sure he doesn't want to be

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.670 
he's pretty sure he doesn't want to be
caught<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.879> we<00:02:35.150> put<00:02:35.450> him<00:02:35.660> into<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:36.170> smaller

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
caught so we put him into a smaller

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.729 
caught so we put him into a smaller
Corral<00:02:37.190> which<00:02:38.180> then<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.959> put<00:02:39.200> him<00:02:39.379> into<00:02:39.560> a

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
Corral which then we put him into a

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.970 
Corral which then we put him into a
smaller<00:02:40.190> alleyway<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:41.599> have<00:02:41.840> our<00:02:42.110> environment

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
smaller alleyway to have our environment

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.460 
smaller alleyway to have our environment
become<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.849> better<00:02:44.090> situation<00:02:44.450> for<00:02:44.930> him<00:02:45.319> to

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
become a better situation for him to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.500 
become a better situation for him to
want<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.739> be<00:02:45.769> caught<00:02:46.069> but<00:02:46.819> notice<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.269> I'm
