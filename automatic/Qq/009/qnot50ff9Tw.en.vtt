00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
how I look from behind oh I just broke a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.080 
how I look from behind oh I just broke a
block<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.290> smart<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:41.340> yeah<00:00:41.520> let's<00:00:41.879> go

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
block that was smart but yeah let's go

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.250 
block that was smart but yeah let's go
to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.329> trick<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:44.180> as<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.450> see<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.200> just

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to the trick so as you can see this just

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.540 
to the trick so as you can see this just
wraps<00:00:46.770> around<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:49.129> what<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:51.350> go<00:00:52.350> back<00:00:52.559> yeah

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
wraps around but what I go back yeah

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.080 
how did I do this this is the first
thing<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.400> oh<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.939> don't

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
exactly have to do it like I did this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.920 
exactly have to do it like I did this
was<00:01:44.490> also<00:01:44.700> something<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.360> saw<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.689> video

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
was also something I saw on that video

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.260 
was also something I saw on that video
and<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.409> thought<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.890> very<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.430> nice<00:01:47.670> this

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and I thought it was very very nice this

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.859 
and I thought it was very very nice this
is<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.439> very<00:01:49.770> fast<00:01:50.100> clock<00:01:50.869> that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
is actually a very very fast clock that

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.380 
is actually a very very fast clock that
only<00:01:52.189> commandblocks<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.909> place

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
only commandblocks can see if you place

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359 
only commandblocks can see if you place
and<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.229> try<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> place<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> redstone

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and we can just try to place a redstone

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.760 
and we can just try to place a redstone
torch<00:01:57.619> whetstone<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.860> Western<00:01:59.340> torch<00:02:00.770> yeah

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
torch whetstone and Western torch yeah

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.660 
torch whetstone and Western torch yeah
it<00:02:02.399> doesn't<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.149> pause<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.890> command

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it doesn't see it as a pause but command

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.050 
it doesn't see it as a pause but command

temptation work yeah as you can see here

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.640 
temptation work yeah as you can see here
it's<00:03:10.490> teleport<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.910> knee<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.240> player<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.810> the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it's teleport the knee is player and the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.270 
it's teleport the knee is player and the
newest<00:03:13.890> players<00:03:14.100> from<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.700> colonnade<00:03:15.210> X<00:03:15.480> -

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
newest players from the colonnade X -

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.910 
newest players from the colonnade X -
839<00:03:18.590> y56

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
839 y56

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.260 
839 y56
and<00:03:20.040> set<00:03:20.370> -<00:03:21.560> 1880<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.860> that's<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.700> radius<00:03:24.090> of

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
and set - 1880 and that's in a radius of

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.350 
and set - 1880 and that's in a radius of
two<00:03:24.510> blocks<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.940> it's<00:03:26.940> from<00:03:27.180> these

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
two blocks so it's from these

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.420 
two blocks so it's from these
coordinates<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.080> think<00:03:28.350> this<00:03:28.620> one<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:28.890> for<00:03:29.310> this

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
coordinates I think this one is for this

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.420 
coordinates I think this one is for this
one<00:03:29.490> I<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.510> just<00:03:30.720> click<00:03:30.900> yeah<00:03:31.890> that's<00:03:32.250> this

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
one I can just click yeah that's this

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.430 
one I can just click yeah that's this
one<00:03:32.670> down<00:03:32.850> here<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.420> if<00:03:33.810> you're<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
one down here and if you're in the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.590 
one down here and if you're in the
radius<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:35.010> two<00:03:35.250> blocks<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.090> block<00:03:36.420> right

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
radius of two blocks of this block right

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.600 
radius of two blocks of this block right
here<00:03:36.660> you<00:03:37.320> get<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.620> tell<00:03:37.800> about<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.100> over<00:03:38.460> to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
here you get to tell about it over to

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.040 
here you get to tell about it over to
there<00:03:38.960> so<00:03:39.960> it's<00:03:40.200> very<00:03:40.440> very<00:03:40.890> simple<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.050> yeah

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
there so it's very very simple and yeah

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.030 
there so it's very very simple and yeah
as<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:43.830> see<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:44.850> teleported<00:03:45.440> -<00:03:46.440> 26

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
as you can see you get teleported - 26

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.580 
as you can see you get teleported - 26
blocks<00:03:47.400> oh<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.660> not<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.960> right<00:03:49.050> one<00:03:49.260> this

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
blocks oh this is not the right one this

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.410 
blocks oh this is not the right one this
one<00:03:49.800> down<00:03:49.920> here<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.640> could<00:03:50.850> tell<00:03:51.090> about<00:03:51.210> the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
one down here you could tell about the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.190 
one down here you could tell about the
25<00:03:51.930> six<00:03:52.440> blocks<00:03:52.820> on<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.210> positive<00:03:54.780> side<00:03:54.810> of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
25 six blocks on the positive side of

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.890 
25 six blocks on the positive side of
the<00:03:55.320> exponent<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.010> let's<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.430> take<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> look

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
the exponent so let's just take a look

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.860 
the exponent so let's just take a look
right<00:03:57.900> here<00:03:57.960> it's<00:03:58.530> -<00:03:59.190> 840<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.330> if<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.690> cut

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
right here it's - 840 and if you cut

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.760 
right here it's - 840 and if you cut
down<00:04:00.900> here<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:01.740> -<00:04:03.290> 815<00:04:04.290> it's<00:04:04.620> yeah<00:04:05.400> nearly<00:04:06.390> 60

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
down here it's - 815 it's yeah nearly 60

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.750 
down here it's - 815 it's yeah nearly 60
26<00:04:07.770> blocks<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.490> it's<00:04:09.140> pretty<00:04:10.140> good<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.760> let's

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
26 blocks so it's pretty good and let's

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.100 
26 blocks so it's pretty good and let's
just<00:04:11.940> take<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.240> look<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.660> one

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
just take a look on this one

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.420 
just take a look on this one
no<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:14.130> one<00:04:14.340> won't<00:04:14.580> work<00:04:14.850> this<00:04:15.480> one<00:04:16.370> this<00:04:17.370> one

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
no that one won't work this one this one

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.470 
no that one won't work this one this one
here<00:04:17.880> here<00:04:18.060> we<00:04:18.150> go

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
here here we go

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.310 
here here we go
this<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.049> -<00:04:19.470> 26<00:04:20.040> blocks<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:21.210> this<00:04:21.960> one<00:04:22.169> right

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
this is - 26 blocks so this one right

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.700 
this is - 26 blocks so this one right
here<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:22.830> probably<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.850> one<00:04:24.060> over<00:04:24.090> there<00:04:24.590> so

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
here is probably that one over there so

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.550 
here is probably that one over there so
if<00:04:26.130> we<00:04:26.310> just<00:04:26.729> take<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.000> look<00:04:27.210> which<00:04:28.169> one<00:04:28.380> was<00:04:28.530> it

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
if we just take a look which one was it

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.210 
if we just take a look which one was it
this<00:04:28.770> one<00:04:29.009> you<00:04:29.430> get<00:04:29.580> teleported<00:04:30.320> -<00:04:31.320> 26<00:04:31.860> block

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
this one you get teleported - 26 block

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.850 
this one you get teleported - 26 block
and<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:33.389> negative<00:04:33.990> side<00:04:34.259> on<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.680> eggs

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
and the negative side on the eggs

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.810 
and the negative side on the eggs
colonnade<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.169> will<00:04:37.350> be<00:04:37.530> bigger<00:04:38.400> over<00:04:38.610> here

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
colonnade so it will be bigger over here

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.870 
colonnade so it will be bigger over here
and<00:04:39.259> minus<00:04:40.259> 18<00:04:40.830> blocks<00:04:41.130> in<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.669> set

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
and minus 18 blocks in the set

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.330 
and minus 18 blocks in the set
coordinate<00:04:42.590> so<00:04:43.590> let's<00:04:43.740> take<00:04:43.949> a<00:04:43.979> look

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.590 

why<00:04:47.340> now<00:04:47.580> we<00:04:48.000> are<00:04:48.030> on<00:04:48.240> minus<00:04:48.780> 800<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.620> ya<00:04:50.250> 60<00:04:50.910> 80

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
why now we are on minus 800 and ya 60 80

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.969 
why now we are on minus 800 and ya 60 80
it<00:04:52.259> will<00:04:52.500> be<00:04:52.620> n<00:04:52.800> minus<00:04:53.720> 1066<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:54.960> now<00:04:55.530> we<00:04:55.590> had

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
it will be n minus 1066 and now we had

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.040 
it will be n minus 1066 and now we had
teleported<00:04:56.669> yeah<00:04:56.820> those<00:04:57.210> blocks<00:04:57.570> over<00:04:57.780> here

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
teleported yeah those blocks over here

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.400 
teleported yeah those blocks over here
so<00:04:58.349> it's<00:04:59.160> very<00:04:59.430> simple<00:04:59.910> you<00:04:59.970> just<00:05:00.030> have<00:05:00.330> to<00:05:00.690> try

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
so it's very simple you just have to try

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.830 
so it's very simple you just have to try
it<00:05:01.470> out<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.889> time<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:02.370> correctly<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:03.120> it's<00:05:03.479> a

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
it out and time it correctly and it's a

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.200 
it out and time it correctly and it's a
very<00:05:04.410> very<00:05:04.680> cool<00:05:04.889> together<00:05:05.340> like<00:05:05.849> it<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.060> lot

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
very very cool together like it a lot

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.480 
very very cool together like it a lot
because<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:07.830> can't<00:05:08.070> really<00:05:08.190> see<00:05:08.310> it

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
because you can't really see it

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.029 
because you can't really see it
sometimes<00:05:09.240> it's<00:05:09.630> available<00:05:09.960> flicking<00:05:10.860> with

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
sometimes it's available flicking with

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.150 
sometimes it's available flicking with
your<00:05:11.190> arm<00:05:11.430> but<00:05:11.990> but<00:05:12.990> all<00:05:13.229> in<00:05:13.410> all<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.590> think<00:05:13.800> it's

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
your arm but but all in all I think it's

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.820 
your arm but but all in all I think it's
a<00:05:14.310> very<00:05:14.520> very<00:05:14.759> nice<00:05:14.940> tweaking<00:05:15.419> it's<00:05:16.139> very<00:05:16.590> very

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830
