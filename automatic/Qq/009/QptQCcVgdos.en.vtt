designers<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.670> important<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> really

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
designers so it was important to really

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.810 
designers so it was important to really
create<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.659> workflow<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.820> consistent

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
create a workflow that was consistent

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.530 
create a workflow that was consistent

and easily managed in one central

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260 
and easily managed in one central
