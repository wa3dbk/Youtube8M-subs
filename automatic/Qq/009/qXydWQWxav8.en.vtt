least semi did well I can still hear
their<00:01:11.790> way<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.689> did<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.110> filled<00:01:13.740> up

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
their way so what I did was I filled up

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.429 
their way so what I did was I filled up
this<00:01:13.979> layer<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.760> single<00:01:15.119> layer<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:16.200> in

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this layer the single layer and then in

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
this layer the single layer and then in
a<00:01:16.500> diagonal<00:01:16.740> across<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:18.890> put<00:01:19.890> water<00:01:20.119> well<00:01:21.119> first

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
a diagonal across I put water well first

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
a diagonal across I put water well first
i<00:01:21.600> made<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:21.840> infinite<00:01:22.290> water<00:01:22.470> pool<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.920> here

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
i made an infinite water pool up here

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
i made an infinite water pool up here
like<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> corner<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.560> over

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
like in in one of the corner it was over

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.030 
like in in one of the corner it was over
there<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:27.470> went<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> cross<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
there but I went to cross on the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.450 
there but I went to cross on the
diagonal<00:01:29.840> putting<00:01:30.840> water<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.560> then

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
diagonal putting water down and then

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.399 
diagonal putting water down and then
just<00:01:33.180> kind<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.360> filled<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.140> needed

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
just kind of filled it in as I needed

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.800 
just kind of filled it in as I needed
actually<00:01:34.799> made<00:01:34.950> an<00:01:35.040> X<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:36.299> made<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> into

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
actually made an X and it made it into

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.460 
actually made an X and it made it into
an<00:01:36.930> infinite<00:01:37.170> water<00:01:37.409> pool<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.240> then<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.540> went

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
an infinite water pool and then I went

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.679 
an infinite water pool and then I went
over<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> edge<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.030> started<00:01:42.329> removing

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
over to the edge and I started removing

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
over to the edge and I started removing
this<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.290> killed<00:01:43.729> because<00:01:46.579> monsters

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
this but I got killed because monsters

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.080 
this but I got killed because monsters
float<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.159> remove<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
float all you do is remove this and the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.860 
float all you do is remove this and the
water<00:01:51.270> flows<00:01:51.570> down

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.370 

making<00:01:54.620> a<00:01:54.680> fairly<00:01:55.220> deep<00:01:57.100> area<00:01:58.100> for<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:59.380> do

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
making a fairly deep area for you to do

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.890 
making a fairly deep area for you to do
fishing<00:02:00.710> in<00:02:00.980> so<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.060> guy<00:02:02.150> might<00:02:02.420> even<00:02:02.630> spawn

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
fishing in so the guy might even spawn

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.270 
fishing in so the guy might even spawn
squid<00:02:03.290> because<00:02:03.500> as<00:02:03.620> far<00:02:03.680> as<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.950> know<00:02:04.010> they

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
squid because as far as I know they

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.200 
squid because as far as I know they
actually<00:02:04.580> don't<00:02:04.700> have<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:07.119> requirements<00:02:08.119> as

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
actually don't have the requirements as

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.470 
actually don't have the requirements as
far<00:02:08.450> as<00:02:08.630> water<00:02:08.900> depth<00:02:09.260> and<00:02:09.970> having<00:02:10.970> flowing

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
far as water depth and having flowing

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.810 
far as water depth and having flowing
water<00:02:11.690> still<00:02:12.080> water<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:12.620> fish<00:02:13.190> are<00:02:13.460> supposed

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
water still water and fish are supposed

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.890 
water still water and fish are supposed
to<00:02:13.910> spawn<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:16.180> stillwater<00:02:17.180> that's<00:02:17.450> one<00:02:17.660> deep

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
to spawn in stillwater that's one deep

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.340 
to spawn in stillwater that's one deep
so<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:19.220> should<00:02:20.290> qualify<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:23.170> see<00:02:24.170> they're

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
so this should qualify that see they're

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.520 
so this should qualify that see they're
still<00:02:24.560> monsters<00:02:24.920> down<00:02:25.070> there<00:02:26.530> unfortunately

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
still monsters down there unfortunately

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.400 
still monsters down there unfortunately
with<00:02:27.680> 1.9<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.730> cover<00:02:28.910> any<00:02:29.210> water<00:02:29.510> and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
with 1.9 you have to cover any water and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.920 
with 1.9 you have to cover any water and
that<00:02:30.620> means<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:30.920> light<00:02:31.910> probably<00:02:32.690> not<00:02:32.810> going

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
that means that light probably not going

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.000 
that means that light probably not going
to<00:02:32.990> get<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:35.230> which<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.260> actually<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.770> major

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
to get in which is actually a major

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.640 
to get in which is actually a major
problem<00:02:37.520> when<00:02:38.020> building<00:02:39.020> stuff<00:02:39.440> like

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
problem when building stuff like

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.270 
problem when building stuff like
artificial<00:02:40.040> Lakes<00:02:41.950> because<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.070> get<00:02:43.220> a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
artificial Lakes because you get a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.390 
artificial Lakes because you get a
monster<00:02:44.030> infestation<00:02:46.480> as<00:02:47.480> soon<00:02:47.720> as<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:48.400> turns

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400

you're using as your temporary bottom
and<00:04:36.820> your<00:04:37.820> water<00:04:38.000> will<00:04:38.240> go<00:04:38.420> down<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.190> it

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
and your water will go down and it

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
actually makes a lake the odd thing is

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.710 
actually makes a lake the odd thing is
if<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.460> if<00:04:46.730> you<00:04:46.850> care<00:04:47.030> about<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:47.300> being<00:04:47.330> still

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
if you if you care about it being still

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.060 
if you if you care about it being still
all<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.960> way<00:04:48.050> through<00:04:48.320> like<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.650> think<00:04:48.860> mine

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
all the way through like I think mine

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.090 
all the way through like I think mine
has<00:04:49.100> currents<00:04:49.730> probably<00:04:50.500> as<00:04:51.500> soon<00:04:51.740> as<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:51.950> go

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
has currents probably as soon as you go

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:13.100 
has currents probably as soon as you go
below<00:04:52.310> like<00:04:52.670> like<00:04:53.000> two<00:04:53.210> or<00:04:53.360> three<00:04:54.220> and

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.980 

and<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.610> mean<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.300> only<00:05:16.630> things<00:05:16.840> that

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
and but I mean the only things that

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.080 
and but I mean the only things that
spawn<00:05:17.200> of<00:05:17.230> water<00:05:17.500> fish<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:18.340> squid<00:05:18.550> anyways

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
spawn of water fish and squid anyways

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.510 
spawn of water fish and squid anyways
and<00:05:19.330> fish<00:05:19.930> only<00:05:20.260> need<00:05:20.440> one<00:05:20.680> deep<00:05:20.889> apparently

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
and fish only need one deep apparently

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.730 
and fish only need one deep apparently
that's<00:05:22.150> what<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.810> works<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.350> then

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
that's what that works and then

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.040 
that's what that works and then
delicious<00:05:26.740> fish<00:05:26.980> and<00:05:27.430> squid<00:05:28.240> don't<00:05:28.570> actually

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
delicious fish and squid don't actually

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.020 
delicious fish and squid don't actually
have<00:05:29.560> any<00:05:29.800> requirements<00:05:30.460> they'll<00:05:30.610> spawn<00:05:30.850> in

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
have any requirements they'll spawn in

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.070 
have any requirements they'll spawn in

that are supposed to work with it and

that are supposed to work with it and
hopefully<00:06:32.590> make<00:06:32.860> for<00:06:33.070> a<00:06:33.100> more<00:06:33.280> interesting

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550

kind<00:06:34.240> of<00:06:34.330> player<00:06:34.539> and<00:06:34.960> something<00:06:35.770> a<00:06:35.830> little

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
kind of player and something a little

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.159 
kind of player and something a little
bit<00:06:36.130> more<00:06:36.310> open-ended<00:06:36.700> than<00:06:37.060> Skyblock<00:06:37.990> was

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
bit more open-ended than Skyblock was

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.050 
bit more open-ended than Skyblock was
because<00:06:38.590> on<00:06:38.860> here<00:06:39.100> once<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.520> do<00:06:39.729> everything

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
because on here once you do everything

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.860 
because on here once you do everything
just<00:06:40.900> like<00:06:41.110> on<00:06:41.289> survivor<00:06:41.680> island<00:06:42.870> there's

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
just like on survivor island there's

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.230 
just like on survivor island there's
nothing<00:06:43.990> else<00:06:44.289> to<00:06:44.380> do<00:06:44.590> really<00:06:45.120> because<00:06:46.120> you're

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
nothing else to do really because you're

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.779 
nothing else to do really because you're
stuck<00:06:46.510> out<00:06:46.660> in<00:06:46.690> the<00:06:46.750> middle<00:06:46.840> of<00:06:47.020> nowhere<00:06:47.789> you

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:48.789 
stuck out in the middle of nowhere you

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.590 
stuck out in the middle of nowhere you
basically<00:06:49.060> have<00:06:50.070> no<00:06:51.070> metal<00:06:51.490> at<00:06:52.000> all<00:06:52.060> you<00:06:52.510> know

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
basically have no metal at all you know

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.219 
basically have no metal at all you know
that<00:06:52.750> kind<00:06:52.900> of<00:06:52.960> stuff<00:06:54.840> one<00:06:55.840> thing<00:06:55.990> I<00:06:56.050> was

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229 
that kind of stuff one thing I was

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.330 
that kind of stuff one thing I was
thinking<00:06:56.289> about<00:06:56.560> doing<00:06:56.680> that<00:06:56.950> I<00:06:57.039> heard<00:06:57.250> about

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
thinking about doing that I heard about

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.390 
thinking about doing that I heard about
was<00:06:57.669> that<00:06:57.700> if<00:06:57.940> you<00:06:57.970> go<00:06:58.240> off<00:06:58.450> far<00:06:58.780> enough<00:06:58.810> on

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
was that if you go off far enough on

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.190 
was that if you go off far enough on
here<00:07:01.110> you'll<00:07:02.110> find<00:07:02.169> land<00:07:02.590> and<00:07:03.270> can<00:07:04.270> play<00:07:05.080> it

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
here you'll find land and can play it

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.500 
here you'll find land and can play it
like<00:07:05.320> a<00:07:05.350> normal<00:07:05.560> map<00:07:05.919> and<00:07:06.490> then<00:07:06.700> just<00:07:07.240> kind<00:07:07.389> of

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
like a normal map and then just kind of

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.710 
like a normal map and then just kind of
connect<00:07:08.070> your<00:07:09.070> sky<00:07:09.340> block<00:07:09.580> area<00:07:09.820> either<00:07:10.300> be

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
connect your sky block area either be

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.719 
connect your sky block area either be
like<00:07:10.960> a<00:07:11.050> real<00:07:11.260> card<00:07:11.560> or<00:07:11.830> you<00:07:12.100> install<00:07:12.430> a<00:07:12.460> mod

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729 
like a real card or you install a mod

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:15.420
