for<00:01:51.040> me<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.280> huge<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:53.440> be<00:01:53.560> able<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.830> go<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.010> 164

so I believe in terms of light so that

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.600 
so I believe in terms of light so that
you<00:01:57.550> can<00:01:57.700> use<00:01:57.880> your<00:01:58.030> EF<00:01:58.750> lenses<00:01:59.170> and<00:02:00.040> not<00:02:00.430> have

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the wider version in the world but it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.550 
the wider version in the world but it
