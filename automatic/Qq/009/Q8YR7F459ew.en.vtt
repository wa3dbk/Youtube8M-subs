Q is 27 in the way x cube is 100 1000
and<00:01:08.560> in<00:01:09.560> table<00:01:10.009> number<00:01:10.280> 2<00:01:11.200> we<00:01:12.200> will<00:01:12.350> write

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
and in table number 2 we will write

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.609 
and in table number 2 we will write
units<00:01:13.960> place<00:01:15.429> units<00:01:16.429> digit<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.420> all<00:01:18.110> these

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
units place units digit of all these

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.469 
units place units digit of all these
cubes<00:01:19.429> okay

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
cubes okay

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.399 
cubes okay
so<00:01:21.170> let's<00:01:21.560> find<00:01:21.740> out<00:01:21.860> for<00:01:22.430> one<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:24.140> unit's

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
so let's find out for one the unit's

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.219 
so let's find out for one the unit's
place<00:01:24.590> will<00:01:24.979> be<00:01:25.130> 1<00:01:25.670> only<00:01:26.000> because<00:01:26.390> it's<00:01:26.990> a

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
place will be 1 only because it's a

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.280 
place will be 1 only because it's a
single<00:01:27.409> digit<00:01:27.820> for<00:01:28.820> two<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.299> will<00:01:29.570> be<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.020> same

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
single digit for two it will be the same

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.149 
single digit for two it will be the same
eight

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
eight

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.980 
eight
now<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.360> three<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:35.039> cube<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> 27<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
now for three the cube is 27 but the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
nine here and for Chan it will be zero

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.570 
nine here and for Chan it will be zero
now<00:02:10.000> let's<00:02:10.420> take<00:02:10.869> an<00:02:10.989> example<00:02:11.370> suppose<00:02:12.370> we

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
now let's take an example suppose we

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.440 
now let's take an example suppose we
need<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.150> find<00:02:13.420> out<00:02:14.459> 6,000<00:02:15.459> cube<00:02:15.880> root<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.180> six

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
need to find out 6,000 cube root of six

need to find out 6,000 cube root of six
thousand<00:02:16.780> eight<00:02:16.930> hundred<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.319> fifty<00:02:17.590> nine

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
thousand eight hundred and fifty nine

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.190 
thousand eight hundred and fifty nine
remember<00:02:18.819> one<00:02:19.000> thing<00:02:19.180> does<00:02:19.720> matter<00:02:19.930> only

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
remember one thing does matter only

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.280 
remember one thing does matter only
words<00:02:20.560> were<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:21.190> perfect<00:02:22.030> cube<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:23.050> number

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
words were a perfect cube the number

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.250 
words were a perfect cube the number
which<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.739> perfect<00:02:24.130> cube

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
which is a perfect cube

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.140 
which is a perfect cube
okay<00:02:27.299> now<00:02:29.580> six<00:02:30.580> thousand<00:02:30.880> eight<00:02:31.030> hundred

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
okay now six thousand eight hundred

okay now six thousand eight hundred
fifty<00:02:31.450> nine<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.980> have<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.280> find<00:02:33.459> out<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.730> cube

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
fifty nine is we have to find out a cube

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.520 
fifty nine is we have to find out a cube
root<00:02:34.209> for<00:02:34.510> this<00:02:34.660> number<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.370> method<00:02:36.730> is

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
root for this number so the method is

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.119 
root for this number so the method is
divide<00:02:38.530> this<00:02:39.459> number<00:02:39.519> into<00:02:40.360> two<00:02:40.540> parts

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
divide this number into two parts

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.449 
divide this number into two parts
okay

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
okay

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.149 
okay
the<00:02:44.970> left<00:02:45.209> hand<00:02:45.390> side<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.950> right<00:02:46.980> hand

side
the<00:02:49.710> right-hand<00:02:50.190> side<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:52.680> line<00:02:53.010> will

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
the right-hand side of this line will

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.880 
the right-hand side of this line will
always<00:02:53.580> contain<00:02:54.270> three<00:02:54.810> digits<00:02:56.990> so<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.590> three

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
always contain three digits so the three

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.650 
always contain three digits so the three
digits

so nine seven T lies between 729 and one

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.709 
so nine seven T lies between 729 and one
thousand<00:05:23.800> right<00:05:24.099> so<00:05:24.759> it<00:05:24.849> lies<00:05:25.029> between<00:05:25.210> nine

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
thousand right so it lies between nine

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:28.619 
thousand right so it lies between nine
Intel<00:05:26.110> right<00:05:26.680> but<00:05:27.430> we'll<00:05:27.759> take<00:05:27.969> the<00:05:28.300> minimum

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:28.629 
Intel right but we'll take the minimum

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.249 
Intel right but we'll take the minimum
one<00:05:28.810> that<00:05:29.259> is<00:05:29.379> nine<00:05:29.710> will<00:05:30.279> write<00:05:30.490> nine<00:05:30.909> here

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
one that is nine will write nine here

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.890 
one that is nine will write nine here

so<00:05:42.990> our<00:05:43.230> answer<00:05:43.710> is<00:05:44.420> 99<00:05:45.420> this<00:05:46.050> is<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:47.400> number

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
so our answer is 99 this is the number

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.310 
so our answer is 99 this is the number
so<00:05:47.940> if<00:05:48.390> you<00:05:48.420> multiply<00:05:49.020> 99<00:05:49.830> by<00:05:50.070> 99<00:05:50.550> by<00:05:50.760> 99<00:05:51.270> so<00:05:52.170> it

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
so if you multiply 99 by 99 by 99 so it

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.119 
so if you multiply 99 by 99 by 99 so it
will<00:05:52.530> come

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.269 

yes

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:57.279
