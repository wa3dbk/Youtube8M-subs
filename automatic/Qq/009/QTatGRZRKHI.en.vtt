00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
I did that about two times but I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.859 
I did that about two times but I
probably<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.350> three<00:01:07.560> times<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.890> make<00:01:08.869> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
probably do it three times just make so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.920 
probably do it three times just make so
that<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> make<00:01:10.710> sure<00:01:14.360> teaspoon<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> this

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
that just to make sure teaspoon of this

00:01:15.930 --> 00:02:02.239 
that just to make sure teaspoon of this
you<00:01:16.439> need<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> this

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:16.949 

yes<00:02:03.249> poon

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.410 

so<00:02:17.560> once<00:02:17.739> you've<00:02:17.890> done<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:19.000> leave<00:02:19.239> them

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
so once you've done that just leave them

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.720 
so once you've done that just leave them
to<00:02:19.450> dry<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:20.860> just<00:02:21.069> wash<00:02:21.190> out<00:02:21.370> like<00:02:21.640> you

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
do Rick to shampoo if you don't think it

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.680 
do Rick to shampoo if you don't think it
strong<00:02:23.170> enough<00:02:23.349> just<00:02:23.830> do<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.040> again<00:02:24.129> but<00:02:25.090> it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
strong enough just do it again but it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.479 
strong enough just do it again but it
works<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.230> really<00:02:26.260> does<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.069> doesn't<00:02:27.250> kill

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
works it really does and it doesn't kill

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.649 
works it really does and it doesn't kill
you<00:02:27.580> Harry<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.330> use<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.599> on

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
you Harry that you can use it on

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.080 
you Harry that you can use it on
extensions<00:02:29.310> by<00:02:30.310> don't--if<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.730> work<00:02:30.940> on

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
extensions by don't--if it work on

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.699

permanent<00:02:31.540> diaper<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.900> know<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.170> works<00:02:32.349> on<00:02:32.470> semi

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
permanent diaper I know it works on semi

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.440 
permanent diaper I know it works on semi
I<00:02:33.010> suppose<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.640> might<00:02:33.730> work<00:02:33.940> on<00:02:34.000> permanent<00:02:34.360> but

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
I suppose it might work on permanent but

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.640 
I suppose it might work on permanent but
you<00:02:34.510> might<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:34.989> do<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.230> for<00:02:35.620> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you might just have to do it for a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.199 
you might just have to do it for a
couple<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:35.980> time<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.670> do<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:36.940> for<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> bit

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
couple of time just do it for a bit

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.330 
couple of time just do it for a bit
longer<00:02:37.299> really<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.830> yeah<00:02:38.980> that's<00:02:39.190> how<00:02:39.250> you
