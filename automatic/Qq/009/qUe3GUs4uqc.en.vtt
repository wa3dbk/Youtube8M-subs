situation<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.460> would<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.500> set<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.769> chart

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
situation I would first set up a chart

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.410 
situation I would first set up a chart
that<00:00:32.750> we<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:34.079> use<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.850> organize<00:00:35.850> our

that will be plugging into the equation

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.350 
that will be plugging into the equation
down<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.410> side<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> chart<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:51.090> have

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
down the right side of the chart we have

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.160 
down the right side of the chart we have
our<00:00:51.780> different<00:00:52.500> values<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.280> y<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.960> end

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
our different values for y that we end

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.880 
our different values for y that we end
up<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> middle<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.680> have<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
up with and in the middle we have the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.340

in<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.430> case<00:01:02.570> 2x<00:01:04.189> plus<00:01:05.189> 3<00:01:07.070> since<00:01:08.070> our<00:01:08.220> domain

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
in this case 2x plus 3 since our domain

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.080 
in this case 2x plus 3 since our domain
is<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:09.420> real<00:01:09.750> numbers<00:01:10.250> we<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.460> choose<00:01:11.760> any

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
is all real numbers we can choose any

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.020 
is all real numbers we can choose any
values<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.930> want<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:14.369> plug<00:01:14.640> into<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
values we want to to plug into the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.320 
values we want to to plug into the
equation<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.840> x<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.640> let's<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.939> with<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
equation for x so let's go with the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.310 
equation for x so let's go with the
values<00:01:19.970> 10<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.920> negative<00:01:22.920> 1<00:01:24.080> just<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> keep

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
values 10 and negative 1 just to keep

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
values 10 and negative 1 just to keep
things<00:01:25.380> simple<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> plugging<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.500> 1<00:01:28.909> into<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
things simple so plugging a 1 into the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.700 
things simple so plugging a 1 into the
equation<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.750> x<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:32.210> 2<00:01:33.210> times<00:01:33.810> 1<00:01:34.590> plus<00:01:35.450> 3

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
equation for x we have 2 times 1 plus 3

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.450 
equation for x we have 2 times 1 plus 3
or<00:01:37.710> 2<00:01:38.130> plus<00:01:38.490> 3<00:01:39.200> which<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.820> five<00:01:43.009> plugging<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.100> 0

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
or 2 plus 3 which is five plugging a 0

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.660 
or 2 plus 3 which is five plugging a 0
into<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> equation<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.570> x<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.409> 2<00:01:47.250> times

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
into the equation for x we have 2 times

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
into the equation for x we have 2 times
0<00:01:48.350> plus<00:01:49.350> 3<00:01:50.040> which<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.090> 0<00:01:51.659> plus<00:01:51.960> 3<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:53.100> 3<00:01:54.860> plugging

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
0 plus 3 which is 0 plus 3 or 3 plugging

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.039 
0 plus 3 which is 0 plus 3 or 3 plugging
a<00:01:55.920> negative<00:01:56.340> 1<00:01:56.579> into<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> equation<00:01:57.450> for<00:01:57.659> x<00:01:57.750> we

a negative 1 into the equation for x we

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.480 
a negative 1 into the equation for x we
have<00:01:58.200> 2<00:01:58.500> times<00:01:58.860> negative<00:01:59.850> 1<00:02:00.509> plus<00:02:00.780> 3<00:02:01.430> which<00:02:02.430> is

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.670 
negative 1 we would have ended up with a
different<00:03:17.250> point<00:03:17.870> but<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.079> point<00:03:19.380> would

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
different point but that point would

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.340 
different point but that point would
also<00:03:19.889> lie<00:03:20.480> along<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.750> line<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.720> graph<00:03:24.959> of

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
also lie along this line so the graph of

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.720 
also lie along this line so the graph of
this<00:03:25.620> equation<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:27.480> line<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:29.430> contains

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
this equation is the line that contains

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.319 
this equation is the line that contains
these<00:03:30.359> three<00:03:30.840> points
