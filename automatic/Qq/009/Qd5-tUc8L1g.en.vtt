00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello together today I'll show you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.259
 our family recipe for breaded 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.870
 schnitzel the schnitzel will not only 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.380
 fried but then still in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:20.189
 the pan cooked as an ingredient I have 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:25.560
 here eggs breadcrumb turkey salt 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.109
 pepper mustard oil for frying and something 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.269
 water first I will 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.000
 schnitzel then season the panade 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.460
 to prepare 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.989
 I have turkey here you can 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.110
 but also calf or pork schnitzel 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.149
 the preparation is the same 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.460
 cooking time can be a bit longer 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.930
 The turkey schnitzel becomes light 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.930
 salted then a little pepper 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.520
 turn now and the other side 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.520
 also season with salt again 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 Use the pepper a bit more sparingly 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.920
 rather little on the sharp mustard 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 to brush 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.840
 that's what it looks like now I am preparing the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.970
 panade ahead 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.030
 For this amount of turkey I will 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.920
 need about two medium sized eggs 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.659
 if it's not enough, you have to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.490
 one more egg to take the eggs 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.040
 hit and the hailstorm 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.909
 remove 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.369
 the same with the second now the eggs 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.920
 Mix with a fork and carefully 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.479
 hit 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.710
 from my homemade breadcrumbs 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.360
 I'll put a few spoons on the plate 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.180
 At first the schnitzel gets generous 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.970
 The egg should turn everywhere 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.189
 good then stick the schnitzel in the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.579
 Breadcrumbs are still a few 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.439
 spoon over it the panade 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.600
 will only be happy with fingers on 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.850
 then pressed with your hand and then 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.979
 with the knuckles through it I can 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 the pieces of meat depending on their structure 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.149
 easier or stronger edit 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 that has the advantage that the schnitzel 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.020
 not to be smashed 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.530
 ever knock iron with the platinum iron 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.870
 in front 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.920
 Can the panade of both sides 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.720
 Press as smoothly as possible 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.910
 the schnitzel is now breaded once 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.890
 and could already be fried us 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.440
 It tastes especially good if it is 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.450
 a second panel situation therefore gets 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.790
 This breaded schnitzel is still 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.010
 once in may then reported as before 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.160
 again sprinkled with the crumbs and 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.319
 everything pressed down mind that 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.739
 the surface as evenly as possible 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.760
 smooth is everything that is not liable 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.800
 shaken off yet 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.739
 with the next schnitzel as well 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.690
 proceed carefully in then apply 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.440
 sprinkle breadcrumbs on and good 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.310
 Press and breadcrumbs are almost 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.739
 used up 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.890
 the schnitzel are ready to roast 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.660
 It goes on to herd on 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.420
 I have a banner here in which I have the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.400
 Fry the schnitzel on both sides well afterwards 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.680
 I give her in a little roasting pan 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.620
 Cover the pan is getting hot 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.450
 Now I'll put in some oil if you 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.930
 take the smallest possible flag 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.030
 you do not need so much oil 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.769
 when sizzling on a wooden spoon is hot 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.660
 enough 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.000
 Now the schnitzel can be inserted 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.910
 it should not fry too much with it 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.220
 the panade does not burn with two 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.370
 You can see if you can save it 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.160
 walls already have to look good 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.780
 and the other side has to turn 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.060
 sautÃ© too 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.489
 it should be a relatively solid one 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.180
 Crust thus cause the panade 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.730
 do not cook on the floor so it looks 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.540
 Delicious from the schnitzel comes in now 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.040
 the flat roaster and is covered 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.590
 the second schnitzel on the same 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.859
 wise roast the trainer on the smallest 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.910
 flame heat the second schnitzel is 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.980
 finished and is also first laid the 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.530
 pan is good hot and I enter 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.510
 little boiling water adds to the water 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.109
 prevents picking up the schnitzel 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.120
 and in the steam they finished cooking but 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.340
 really just the pan bottom just like that 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.080
 cover immediately then hang up the lid 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.419
 and reduce the heat 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.770
 The water should always be so hot 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.729
 that bubbles form 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.259
 Now the meat just has to cook 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.530
 in between always check if 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.539
 enough water is available 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.300
 even lift it so that nothing sticks 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.050
 Dots needs about eight to ten 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.909
 minutes 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.139
 veal and pork can 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:47.550
 take a little longer 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.770
 depending on the thickness of the schnitzel you can 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.280
 Then turn the schnitzel over to cook 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.830
 they are even and even now 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.150
 can be served 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.120
 and so see my breaded 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.520
 turkey schnitzel ready to go with it 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.979
 very good a lamb's lettuce to whom the panade 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.539
 as a side dish is not enough, too 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.699
 potato salad or french fries 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.889
