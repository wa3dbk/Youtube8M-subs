00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.230
 Well I though you will find a Hello everybody Ohori 123 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:16.249
 This kind of person is going to do it this time, but during this Gibson class 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:17.119
 Matter is I think that I want to talk about that is to be as dead, but over Well the last time 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.160
 I moving 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 Want the right knee by say Datte What does that mean Hara is dead 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.170
 I can see it all means together because we also paste links by related videos I think 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:33.210
 The Tteyuu between want and think you are Kedomo We die is has become Pokopoko between also is 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.989
 The impression that it is not a beautiful sound that the glare of the time of the cut was completely gone 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.150
 I say something I would like to bring, but after all with my Namako stick guitar 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.710
 It's a glittering thing or it's glaring 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:49.750
 It is not that it has become like this, but it is this to form as glaring 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.250
 Because there is a body volume, it sounds good because it overlaps 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 Give me not a do it though Nee 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.630
 I 'm stuffed, but this Gibson especially this gibson j 45 but good things die 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.380
 But what estuary 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.380
 I don't care at all or this original drawing already has already died but 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.680

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:35.250
 No increase 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:44.420
 canel 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:46.659
 Bubbu And that Gibson forte of this 5-string and 6-string because'm out well what I hardness 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.659
 you know 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.550
 ni 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:08.549
 But I think I wish or only of it is the good that came after all and become arpeggio 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.200
 If you put on these three picks, you will see how it 's regular coordination between Bokoboko and Gibson 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.700
 As Ya amazing because it is 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.510

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.220
 ni 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:42.440
 I would like to make a sound that sounds like something even if the original picture is dead 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.460
 There are quite a few people who say that Gibson likes to say this dead old man 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.140
 I think but 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.930
 I also feel that the place that the regular schedule is going back has returned 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.189
 of course 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.379
 It will be good does it best throw Te Alter there laid the remains candid advice to live really 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:04:00.329
