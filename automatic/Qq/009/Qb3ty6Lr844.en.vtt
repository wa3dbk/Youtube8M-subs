I<00:00:00.570> guess<00:00:00.870> you<00:00:00.989> could<00:00:01.140> call<00:00:01.260> it<00:00:01.380> at<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.589> point

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
I guess you could call it at this point

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.800 
I guess you could call it at this point

Pacific Coast Highway but you know

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.450 
Pacific Coast Highway but you know
looking<00:00:16.410> at<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> map<00:00:16.770> he<00:00:16.890> says<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.310> said

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
looking at the map he says we said

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.680 
looking at the map he says we said
earlier<00:00:17.699> he's<00:00:17.820> gonna<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> point<00:00:18.449> here

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
earlier he's gonna get to a point here

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.939 
earlier he's gonna get to a point here
where<00:00:18.840> he's<00:00:18.960> not<00:00:19.050> gonna<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.320> any<00:00:19.500> rows<00:00:19.770> he

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
where he's not gonna have any rows he

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.410 
where he's not gonna have any rows he
could<00:00:20.070> turn<00:00:20.220> off<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.029> point<00:00:21.210> they

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
could turn off on at that point they

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.509 
could turn off on at that point they
could<00:00:21.480> probably<00:00:21.890> lay<00:00:22.890> down<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> spike<00:00:23.490> strip

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
could probably lay down a spike strip

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.460 
could probably lay down a spike strip
they<00:00:24.029> probably<00:00:24.300> won't<00:00:24.630> do<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> pit<00:00:25.050> maneuver

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
they probably won't do a pit maneuver

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
they probably won't do a pit maneuver
that<00:00:26.039> close<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> ocean<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.029> it's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
that close to the ocean because it's

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 
that close to the ocean because it's
true<00:00:27.510> because<00:00:28.019> about<00:00:28.380> their<00:00:28.590> car<00:00:28.859> yeah<00:00:29.070> they

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
true because about their car yeah they

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.890 
true because about their car yeah they
don't<00:00:29.310> want<00:00:29.400> him<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:30.000> into<00:00:30.150> another<00:00:30.390> car<00:00:30.660> or

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
don't want him going into another car or

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.080 
don't want him going into another car or
possibly<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.219> know<00:00:32.250> spilling<00:00:32.700> over<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> rail

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
possibly you know spilling over the rail

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
possibly you know spilling over the rail
and<00:00:33.120> head<00:00:33.660> down<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> rocks<00:00:34.140> toward<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and head down the rocks toward the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.160 
and head down the rocks toward the
Pacific<00:00:34.620> Ocean<00:00:35.270> but<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> writing<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
Pacific Ocean but that writing of the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.049 
Pacific Ocean but that writing of the
the<00:00:37.590> middle<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.980> mean<00:00:38.129> everything<00:00:38.579> else<00:00:38.760> seems

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the middle I mean everything else seems

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.229 
the middle I mean everything else seems
to<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.530> normal<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.920> far<00:00:41.070> as<00:00:41.160> speed<00:00:41.489> goes<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.090> he

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to be normal as far as speed goes but he

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.569 
to be normal as far as speed goes but he
continues<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.320> ride<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.800> middle<00:00:44.430> line

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
continues to just ride that middle line

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.340 
continues to just ride that middle line
not<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.329> incredibly<00:00:45.719> dangerous<00:00:46.020> for

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
not just it's incredibly dangerous for

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.690 
not just it's incredibly dangerous for
people<00:00:46.440> coming<00:00:46.710> around<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> curve<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.489> don't

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
people coming around the curve and don't

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
people coming around the curve and don't
see<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.149> yeah<00:00:48.510> Tim<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.960> haven't<00:00:49.170> talked<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
see that yeah Tim we haven't talked to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.290 
see that yeah Tim we haven't talked to
you<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.950> spike<00:00:50.219> strip<00:00:50.550> situation<00:00:51.180> but

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you about the spike strip situation but

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
you about the spike strip situation but
I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> certain<00:00:52.320> point<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:52.920> there's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
I think at a certain point here there's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.459 
I think at a certain point here there's
gonna<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> long<00:00:54.239> stretch<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> PCH<00:00:55.170> where

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
gonna be a long stretch of PCH where

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.189 
gonna be a long stretch of PCH where
they<00:00:55.620> could<00:00:55.829> clear<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> traffic<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.360> they

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
they could clear the traffic and they

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.540 
they could clear the traffic and they
could<00:00:58.350> easily<00:00:58.500> lay<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> spike<00:00:59.100> strip<00:00:59.129> down<00:00:59.489> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
could easily lay a spike strip down and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.799 
could easily lay a spike strip down and
because<00:00:59.940> he'd<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.210> no<00:01:00.359> place<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> turn

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
because he'd have no place to turn

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
because he'd have no place to turn
before<00:01:00.989> he<00:01:01.170> gets<00:01:01.350> there<00:01:01.670> well<00:01:02.670> yeah<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> thought

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
before he gets there well yeah I thought

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.340 
before he gets there well yeah I thought
they<00:01:03.270> had<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.320> saw

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
they had one right there because I saw

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
they had one right there because I saw
in<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> blind<00:01:05.100> turn<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:05.970> made<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
in a blind turn that we just made the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.590 
in a blind turn that we just made the
turn<00:01:06.600> into<00:01:07.369> Point<00:01:08.369> Mugu<00:01:08.490> area<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.479> was

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
turn into Point Mugu area here there was

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.050 
turn into Point Mugu area here there was
two<00:01:09.780> CHP<00:01:10.350> cruisers<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> side<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> road

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
two CHP cruisers on the side of the road

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.719 
two CHP cruisers on the side of the road
and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.860> thought<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.220> were<00:01:14.280> gonna<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and I thought they were gonna do it

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.420 
and I thought they were gonna do it
right<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.570> apparently<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
right there but it's apparently not so

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.310 
right there but it's apparently not so
we<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:18.030> heard<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.479> talk<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.049> I'm

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
we have heard them talk about it I'm

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.289 
we have heard them talk about it I'm
really<00:01:19.590> leery<00:01:20.040> about<00:01:20.280> seeing<00:01:20.610> where<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> see<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
really leery about seeing where I see it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.120 
really leery about seeing where I see it
because<00:01:21.570> I've<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.930> guys<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.259> cars<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.830> this
