00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
see how this looks like the color master

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.200 
see how this looks like the color master
as<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.629> see<00:00:42.809> fits<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.340> case<00:00:44.550> nicely

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
as you can see fits in this case nicely

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.529 
as you can see fits in this case nicely
um<00:00:46.520> got<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> decent<00:00:47.879> amount<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.239> room<00:00:48.360> right

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
to get quick overview of the entire case

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.100 
to get quick overview of the entire case
for<00:01:07.980> those<00:01:08.160> that<00:01:08.520> saw<00:01:08.820> my<00:01:09.000> previous<00:01:09.390> video<00:01:09.660> and

for those that saw my previous video and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
for those that saw my previous video and
I<00:01:10.320> said<00:01:10.650> let's<00:01:11.550> talk<00:01:11.670> about<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.910> cable

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
I said let's talk about the cable

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.760 
I said let's talk about the cable
management<00:01:12.360> cable<00:01:13.230> management<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
management cable management is

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.190 
management cable management is
definitely<00:01:14.340> an<00:01:14.430> issue<00:01:14.550> on<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.000> old<00:01:15.150> case<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.700 

spent<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.290> extra<00:01:19.620> time<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:20.100> time<00:01:20.280> putting

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
spent some extra time this time putting

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
spent some extra time this time putting
all<00:01:22.710> routing<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.460> cables<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.060> even<00:01:24.570> tried

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
all routing the cables and even tried

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.469 
all routing the cables and even tried
removing<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.410> far<00:01:25.710> side<00:01:26.010> panel<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:28.100> there<00:01:29.100> is

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
removing the far side panel and there is

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.120 
removing the far side panel and there is
hardly<00:01:30.479> enough<00:01:30.660> room<00:01:30.990> between<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
hardly enough room between the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.180 
hardly enough room between the
motherboard<00:01:32.670> tray<00:01:32.940> in<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.710> side<00:01:34.710> panel<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
motherboard tray in the side panel to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.810 
motherboard tray in the side panel to
even<00:01:35.460> put<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.530> molex<00:01:37.530> plug<00:01:37.830> for<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.190> fans<00:01:38.400> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
even put the molex plug for the fans so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.900 
even put the molex plug for the fans so
very<00:01:39.259> minimal<00:01:40.259> room<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.399> did<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:41.759> extra

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
very minimal room but I did some extra

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.850 
very minimal room but I did some extra
work<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.479> can<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.660> this<00:01:43.050> cabling

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
work and as you can see this cabling

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.050 
work and as you can see this cabling
looks<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.640> better<00:01:44.880> than<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.710> previous

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
looks a little better than the previous

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.910 
looks a little better than the previous
so

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.210 
so
anyway<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.000> go<00:01:51.150> yeah<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.590> hyper

anyway there you go yeah that's a hyper

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.490 
anyway there you go yeah that's a hyper
212<00:01:53.570> plus<00:01:55.070> it's<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.220> very<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.640> nicely<00:01:57.500> works

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
212 plus it's in very very nicely works

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.820 
212 plus it's in very very nicely works
good<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.250> have<00:01:59.430> as<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.540> see<00:02:00.830> still
