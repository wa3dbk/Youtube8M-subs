up<00:02:33.960> like<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> first<00:02:34.380> pack<00:02:34.620> my<00:02:35.070> guess<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.640> we're

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
up like the first pack my guess is we're

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.570 
up like the first pack my guess is we're
going<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.420> finish<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.960> first<00:02:37.140> pack

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
going to finish up like the first pack

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.340 
going to finish up like the first pack
because<00:02:38.580> for<00:02:38.880> some<00:02:39.030> reason<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.420> always<00:02:39.450> seem<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
because for some reason I always seem to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.720 
because for some reason I always seem to
start<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> rare<00:02:41.580> end<00:02:41.940> with<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> rare<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.690> so

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
start with a rare end with a rare and so

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.210 
start with a rare end with a rare and so
