00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.799
 an e-mail 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.799
 Hey 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.130
 the rain 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.929
 we had that a year ago 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.869
 I do have after that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 three matches 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 an umbrella for refugee families through the Queen's Night 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.590
 to keep that 21 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.590
 forgive the cbs 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.940
 time 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.150
 the tieleman fall 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.240
 what a life that 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.910
 after the deed 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.220
 in the meantime 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.220
 but what 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.530
 the only one where I kept a record 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.259
 the job is put them aside and on 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 from minute one year and for an unknown reason 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.210
 and also not too long 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 and always in the fourth quarter 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.970
 there were made that i connect a winner now in a strong field drum too 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.840
 to have 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.930
 groningen 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.440
 for each of the 55 after which they ride a free kick from a horse 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.380
 in the banner and beyond and a decreasing trend 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.900
 young and old 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.900
 Canada 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
 Ardennes 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.640
 therefore we want to be older 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.430
 unless you call it the national team 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.270
 before and after the ek with radiohead but you feel it is a let it go
