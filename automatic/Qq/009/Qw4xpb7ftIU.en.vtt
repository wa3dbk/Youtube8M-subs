00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
take the sign that's rough the gun seems

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.020 
take the sign that's rough the gun seems
to<00:04:48.949> play<00:04:49.159> a<00:04:49.189> lot<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.610> different<00:04:49.669> without

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
to play a lot of different without

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.559 
to play a lot of different without
without<00:04:50.629> a<00:04:50.689> silencer<00:04:51.349> less<00:04:52.039> less<00:04:52.789> recoil<00:04:53.060> I

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
without a silencer less less recoil I

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.490 
without a silencer less less recoil I
think<00:04:54.939> I'm<00:04:55.939> not<00:04:56.180> sure<00:04:56.330> if<00:04:56.509> I'm<00:04:56.659> using<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:57.169> grip

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
think I'm not sure if I'm using a grip

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.409 
think I'm not sure if I'm using a grip
on<00:04:57.710> both<00:04:58.069> glasses<00:04:58.340> or<00:04:58.699> not<00:04:58.819> but<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.210> definitely

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
on both glasses or not but it definitely

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.390 
on both glasses or not but it definitely
has<00:04:59.689> less<00:05:00.229> recoil<00:05:00.469> and<00:05:02.259> yeah<00:05:03.259> more<00:05:03.469> range<00:05:03.710> like

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
has less recoil and yeah more range like

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.339 
has less recoil and yeah more range like
like<00:05:04.849> any<00:05:05.000> old<00:05:05.180> snipe<00:05:05.449> and<00:05:05.659> that<00:05:05.780> was<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.900> bit

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
like any old snipe and that was a bit

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.140 
like any old snipe and that was a bit
close<00:05:06.530> for<00:05:06.650> comfort<00:05:06.860> there<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:09.969> didn't<00:05:10.969> expect

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
close for comfort there I didn't expect

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.309 
close for comfort there I didn't expect
to<00:05:11.240> get<00:05:11.360> both<00:05:11.509> of<00:05:11.690> them<00:05:11.780> I<00:05:11.900> didn't<00:05:12.110> even<00:05:12.169> expect

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
to get both of them I didn't even expect

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.320 
to get both of them I didn't even expect
one<00:05:12.710> person<00:05:13.129> to<00:05:13.219> drop<00:05:13.460> from<00:05:13.639> a<00:05:13.729> window<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.120> be

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
one person to drop from a window to be

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.870 
one person to drop from a window to be
honest

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880

I don't tend to use this gun March i've
i've<00:05:21.130> used<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.910> try<00:05:22.210> out<00:05:22.510> i<00:05:22.870> think<00:05:23.410> i've

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
i've used it to try out i think i've

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.330 
i've used it to try out i think i've
used<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.830> prestige<00:05:24.340> token<00:05:25.090> on<00:05:25.210> it<00:05:25.390> to<00:05:25.570> unlock<00:05:25.870> it

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
used a prestige token on it to unlock it

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.740 
used a prestige token on it to unlock it
but<00:05:27.340> other<00:05:27.490> than<00:05:27.700> that<00:05:27.760> I<00:05:27.880> don't<00:05:27.970> really<00:05:28.540> use
