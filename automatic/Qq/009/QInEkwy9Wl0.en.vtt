00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.700 
it's now the grandeur Reynolds minibike
but<00:00:09.179> I'm<00:00:09.540> not<00:00:09.660> sure<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.200> don't<00:00:10.260> know<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
but I'm not sure and I don't know the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.150 
but I'm not sure and I don't know the
model<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.429> don't<00:00:12.179> know<00:00:12.330> you're<00:00:12.599> here<00:00:12.809> because

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
model and don't know you're here because

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.430 
model and don't know you're here because
to<00:00:14.160> come<00:00:14.400> see<00:00:14.610> engines<00:00:15.059> are<00:00:15.330> really<00:00:15.839> hard<00:00:16.199> to

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
to come see engines are really hard to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.590 
to come see engines are really hard to
figure<00:00:16.680> out<00:00:16.980> new<00:00:17.430> year<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.240> don't<00:00:18.449> feel

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
figure out new year on and I don't feel

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200 
figure out new year on and I don't feel
like<00:00:18.720> dealing<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.080> their<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.279> yeah

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
like dealing with their so yeah

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
like dealing with their so yeah
but<00:00:21.480> I'm<00:00:21.600> guessing<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.140> by<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.560> styling<00:00:23.160> of

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
but I'm guessing just by the styling of

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.060 
but I'm guessing just by the styling of
this<00:00:23.340> engine<00:00:23.760> because<00:00:23.939> I've<00:00:24.150> I've<00:00:24.510> had<00:00:24.539> about

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
five of these three and a half horse to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.320
