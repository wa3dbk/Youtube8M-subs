00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.439
 tales. 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.640
 Things are great, I have such a team 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.750
 since we are not a pelvis. organizations 5 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.300
 tell me that this is you new sponsor 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 multi gaming m5 is a multi giving and 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.410
 accordingly, their sponsors will be 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.559
 support them as an organization and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.840
 our composition in particular is therefore already 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.420
 I start in principle with these finals 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.170
 Starladdera we will speak I hope 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.910
 long time under this tag 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.420
 tell me why you chose m5 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.899
 there were some other suggestions you should 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.300
 understand that we choose no one of this 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.409
 It does not give a chance I mean yes there 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.170
 offer from some organizations but 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.000
 not so say let's profitable for us that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.409
 somewhere you have to give the prize 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.549
 somewhere incomplete payment and so on well 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.670
 organizations 5 on very profitable 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.320
 conditions agreed to support us 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.549
 actually shook hands and now we 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.820
 will protect 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.770
 this fact tell about politics 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 teams something has changed not changed 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.820
 will be who was or was not so that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.500
 this season we spent 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.119
 the fact that you are relaxed but rather a model 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 myself a little rest just after 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.520
 the world after him when started 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.040
 began a series of official games 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.710
 Starladdera we understood that we in principle 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.689
 We cope without team training 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.530
 continue to train 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.119
 individuality of sleep therefore 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.549
 stayed in the top for all 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.950
 games that we had to rank this 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.840
 Tell season when the team already in 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.579
 Moscow gathered that is you had time 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.329
 practice or no water Respect 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.649

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.899
 so frit came on monday xii 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.910
 Wednesday minced Thursday respectively 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.000
 the team did not play but we played with 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.760

 Napier problems you are here for all 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.870

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.450
 not new environment and everything will be with us not 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.280
 tell me quite well about everything 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.790
 leagues where you participate as there is a team 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.790
 Kamaz yesterday succumbed to you yes yesterday 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.130
 played with in general I don't remember at all 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.690
 actually the name of all the words and put on but 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.510
 Most of this mixes on your own 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.739
 We mix 3 + house that is cut again became 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.780
 When John replacement plus friend Sasha Bora but 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.100
 played before this wake of which drive 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.840
 whether war was the dorado's insulting and 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.900
 games for this game in principle all games 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.360
 very light because you have to understand 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.760
 the level of the game is Moscow mixes 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.680
 which we basically win with 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.010
 dry ksanka clamp the same cube 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.269
 beautiful madrasah about the rest of the face 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.970
 we also participate 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.620
 here now comes now it will be the third 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.000
 stage of the championship of Russia well there did not know 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.650
 name anabolic because in general we 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.330
 with mix 3 + 2 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.400
 but we have instead randy who eyes us 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.330
 The first two rounds will play zip so 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.160
 what can already be said 44 plus 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.380
 handel from the current bright that's what else 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.480
 kick starladder play like everything in 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.530
 this year, nothing much better is no longer 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.850
 I have to tell you whether I have already managed 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.709
 someone to talk to from other teams 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.930
 practicing is possible online 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.959
 succeeded 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.070
 what does it mean to talk to us periodically 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.120
 it’s like we ’re online 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.829
 about rights there for 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.850
 and someone is texting but not me personally 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:19.380
 my teammates do about it 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.810
 such business communication with precisely procs 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.389
 joint training we played by 1 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.900
 training with each team of teams 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.250
 finalists last week in 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.740
 Basically nothing terrible for us 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.139
 happened down in them again completely 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.210
 filed on well, so it was probably 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:41.740
 Hermann did not have time for a huge raw material 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.070
 play there all three cards because 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.330
 that mission igor went to bed at nine 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.669
 pm and about 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.440
 flight played four or five cards tom 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.970
 that they apparently did not want to play and 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.430
 cards that are not actually against 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.080
 to draw us happy with the results 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.700
 Let's see what will be exactly on Lana 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.320
 here today 4 best of 3 how are you 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.270
 plan on top of her mesh to break through 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.860
 Of course you want to go on top not all the same 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.930
 why do we fall down is more games 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.400
 more voltage but despite the fact that 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.229
 in principle, we are not afraid to play but 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.510
 there is an error here an error is then given a map then 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.900
 Further the game and you already begin to live from 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.340
 nobody needs this lower grid 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.410
 tell me a little about the event itself 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.260
 tomorrow will be the show match you take there 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.450
 participation like there what if I'm honest 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.510
 really not really in the know here 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.580
 exactly 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.080
 schedule tomorrow because 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.410
 something there i read some show match 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.370
 rox.kis we don't understand who you are with 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.850
 pentathlon 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.530
 this does not concern me 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.570
 said we should play means we will 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.960
 play a knife like this all will go off 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.870
 I no longer care what to do with the fence 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.590
 point blank ready to eat cake no i'm not 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.979
 eat ends 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.370
 why is this my mode 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.970
 power somehow and take about sports 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.280
 Russian hall perfectly passes the phrase 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.930
 Now for straining at school constantly 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.160
 evening you have to drive very little time 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.200
 stays on private space and on 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.350
 bird time while free 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.780
 quietly before we spent on the openwork 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.390
 recently very few 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:30.640
 time has to be compressed and a little bit 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:34.090
 even to the detriment of this business give so well 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.160
 Your prediction for this than you know that I 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.710
 do not answer this question, I will never 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.120
 always ask it and that's great 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.090
 bridge tradition is now necessary 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.620
 say goodbye and go get ready for the first 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.760
