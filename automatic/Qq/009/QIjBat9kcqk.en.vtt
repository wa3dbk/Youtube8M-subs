 fabian and the freddy of course yes we 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.309
 So tonight, so to speak, are empty now 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.230
 this article we are now with 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.440
 günther jauch in the studio at who will 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.539
 millionaire, however, not as a candidate 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.510
 but as a spectator and we thought 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.740
 us what is closer than that to about 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.109
 buy and install 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.930
 so to speak how do you survive the word that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 frederik as the first questions with 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.750
 his qualified expertise 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.940
 may answer I persuaded me then 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.200
 after that again turns on the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.620
 ill complicated here 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.480
 the leaning tower of pisa, of course, man 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.680
 Just click on the answer 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.899
 after seven, of course, whether it's right or wrong 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.940
 wrong is we have won 50 euros 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.350
 not bad in which country 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 you probably speak africa 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.870
 probably in South Africa the comscore 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.180
 pay on it so still relatively 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.370
 easy 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.620
 what is the name of the Japanese currency mr 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.660
 euro to the not yet now where the yen 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.830
 but maybe they are also in the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 euro rescue package 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.000
 i may really believe a country 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.720
 what is the name of the art of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.049
 Papierfaltens of course how can I 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.659
 not at all but there madonna 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.350
 Twelve stars he does not hate 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.759
 let make 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.930
 No, I did a gift there 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.720
 I know how that works 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.759
 States, I have to think that already 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.150
 meanwhile this is correct 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.220
 because I had to like 52 for myself 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.400
 but make this funny gift 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.470
 only 250 I would say so this 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.970
 woman currently if it is 62 now 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.049
 So that's not true 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.850
 the jammer point deduction 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.729
 what one can say in general is that of 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.840
 level of difficulty of the questions very much 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.060
 is developed so you can sometimes 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.640
 now, for example, little enough napoleon 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.250
 1815 at waterloo yes no idea 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.970
 either probably that 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.440
 then I would know now fall 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.520
 why years of history if I am now 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.020
 not that bang 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.640
 use case openly advertise in Europe 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.240
 so be to the election makes no sense 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.280
 and chestnut you can hear it like that 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.280
 Reacting could fit the context 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.360
 there is no audience addition 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.770
 stocker is the heart of schuckmann yes 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.020
 say that when I return here this 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.750
 exchange question 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.310
 So I am as kunstbanausen the victim 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.170
 you already have the inner artist 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.420
 but belongs where he lives or where he lives 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.230
 Growing up died was already 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.510
 to bury 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:51.750
 you 've got it was almost only 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:53.760
 I'm sure that weird players 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.350
 suspect yes the father could have been 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.120
 yes, that's what it is to do with turkey 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.130
 right 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.360
 either as father king emperor or for 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.769
 höfels yes what does that mean? 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.690
 I 've heard that way on the street 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.280
 these shares should this terrorist 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.549
 he has nothing to do with it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.060
 do that to me yes so was the audience 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.420
 take 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.810
 So I guess so 80 percent 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.790
 be sure 70 but intuition the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.970
 yes, yes , we'll take it for granted 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.200
 one could already mean the father 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.040
 we were lucky here 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.040
 had 2000 euro 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.440
 If you guernica the image that is today 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.390
 so that's a question when i watch tv 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.470
 look is easy to 16,000 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.349
 employees 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.129
 since heard but no idea where I 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.959
 You can not live there somehow 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.159
 rhyme or derive ego together and 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.690
 also does not exclude because me 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.220
 the customer flash magath i know on 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.670
 every case but every year i have 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.079
 heard it all before so I would okay 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.349
 say here phone number 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.629
 the fdp brings nothing because of it here 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.040
 to select yes the countries 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.000
 Although the brothers does not have any 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.049
 Guide the judge twice fooled 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.880
 Ireland or Brown said no prejudices 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:25.449
 okay, they do not even show a percentage 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.789
 As you can not hear the 60 places 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.820
 in kitas under 60 and then yes too 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.710
 Not much, so I'm the chain 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.680
 picasso said because I'm after 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.960
 then painted such a picasso picture 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.370

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.919
 a message we are I have 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.930

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.550
 ask because I want to say we could 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.539
 our monday was full here again 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:58.240
 the right good to fall but would peters 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:05:01.240
 I also say that my 701 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.870
 Luca gives away many official languages there 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:09.360
 it in Switzerland 3 3 or 4 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.240
 so french 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.240
 one could say clearly German 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.240
 Italian 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.610
 more would master german language am 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.510
 2 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.540
 active already some earlier 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.990
 official language have yes the game is yes 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.180
 also at the very back start the usa 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.170
 So it's true for 3sat because we are yes 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:39.000
 not to give up here he comes 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:42.790
 Tip 3 Let's lure a few 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.250
 ask telefonjoker I have to yes 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.560
 you are always told if so uses 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.230
 If I did that now I would say 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.970
 freddy google after and have the 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.830
 It may not be very clear 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.930
 but on the other hand, but demand the same 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.430
 we that similar so questions of knowledge only 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.620
 as if there was a certain word in it 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.950
 what attitude has then you can 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.420
 In 30 seconds I can see the situation 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:10.780
 so we're going to do three four more soon 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.580
 sad things 25 euro the advanced 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.710
 Certain now advised against the yes 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.930
 but the gentleman , too, is here in 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.790
 the version equal to contain more what 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.840
 of course, the charm of me will 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.790
 actually matters because the candidate 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.980
 but yes that's right we throw 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.390
 to have a look here 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.880
 we have the attitudes there you can 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.010
 again, for example, these tasks 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.270
 to start doing what I am right 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.870
 you can always find the depressing 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:39.580
 computer fast otherwise it would be 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:42.760
 will not come back because we must 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.230
 but again you can not come back 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.820
 if you are in the selection round 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.250
 you're in us dollar like you and 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.560
 what a pity only 500 ask the 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.930
 played relatively fit you can 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.180
 buy a question but the cost 52 new 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.480
 ask the loud answer the right answer 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.480
 is yes 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.100
 In this sense, let's see if we 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.450
 today as an audience safe into 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.160
 have come far and if that is the 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.060
 case then we say you on each 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.120
 case years 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.990
 priced shortly 239 iphone 93 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.030
 ipad and maybe a little better too 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.410
 recommend the knowledge training what 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.300
 we also linked you in the article 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.540
 but overall i will be millionaire 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.160
 is natural 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.420
 the name of the maz exceptions that's it 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.420
 from the sense an
