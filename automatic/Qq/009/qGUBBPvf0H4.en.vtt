mounted<00:00:28.400> we<00:00:29.400> also<00:00:29.550> came<00:00:29.910> down<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.619> we

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
mounted we also came down here and we

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.720 
mounted we also came down here and we
removed<00:00:32.130> our<00:00:32.399> primary<00:00:33.680> chain<00:00:34.680> case<00:00:34.730> drain

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
removed our primary chain case drain

removed our primary chain case drain
plug<00:00:36.620> not<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> lot<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:37.980> fluid<00:00:38.370> came<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.790> but

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
plug not a lot of fluid came out but

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
plug not a lot of fluid came out but
there<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.270> some<00:00:39.540> oil<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
there was some oil in there so that's a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.840 
there was some oil in there so that's a
good<00:00:40.890> thing<00:00:42.260> we<00:00:43.260> went<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.710> adjust<00:00:44.190> our

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
good thing we went in to adjust our

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.779 
good thing we went in to adjust our
primary<00:00:45.450> chain<00:00:45.750> tensioner<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.489> when<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.610> did

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
primary chain tensioner and when we did

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.760 
primary chain tensioner and when we did
that<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.539> found<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.469> was<00:00:49.590> no

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that we found out there was no

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.450 
that we found out there was no
adjustment<00:00:50.309> screw<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.730> there<00:00:55.039> so<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.219> next

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
adjustment screw in there so the next

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
adjustment screw in there so the next
step<00:00:56.670> when<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.210> there<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.510> find<00:00:57.870> no

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
step when we go in there and find no

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.529 
step when we go in there and find no
adjustment<00:00:58.590> screw<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.100> well<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> pull

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
adjustment screw is well we have to pull

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.399 
adjustment screw is well we have to pull
the<00:01:00.629> primary<00:01:01.050> chain<00:01:01.350> case<00:01:01.640> cover<00:01:02.640> off<00:01:03.409> see

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the primary chain case cover off see

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.390 
the primary chain case cover off see
what<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> problem<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:06.920> I<00:01:07.920> went<00:01:08.130> ahead<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
what the problem is so I went ahead and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700 
what the problem is so I went ahead and
remove<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> cover<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.360> pulled<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
remove the cover I pulled out the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.030 
remove the cover I pulled out the
primary<00:01:10.950> chain<00:01:11.369> case<00:01:11.400> cover<00:01:11.970> mounting<00:01:12.210> bolts

with<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.280> primary<00:01:14.880> chain<00:01:15.119> case<00:01:15.150> cover

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.190 

and<00:01:20.270> when<00:01:20.570> I<00:01:20.600> removed<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.200> cover<00:01:21.440> I<00:01:23.200> found

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
and when I removed the cover I found

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.020 
and when I removed the cover I found
this<00:01:24.380> little<00:01:24.590> piece<00:01:25.160> layin<00:01:25.460> in<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.640> bottom

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
this little piece layin in the bottom

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.590 
this little piece layin in the bottom
and<00:01:26.150> this<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.540> tensioning<00:01:26.990> sleeve<00:01:28.600> goes

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and this is the tensioning sleeve goes

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.350 
and this is the tensioning sleeve goes
on<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.960> tie<00:01:30.170> rod<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.370> part<00:01:31.700> of<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.850> tie<00:01:32.060> rod

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
on the tie rod and part of the tie rod

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.100 
on the tie rod and part of the tie rod
is<00:01:33.020> still<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.590> tensioning<00:01:34.040> sleeve<00:01:35.110> what

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
is still in the tensioning sleeve what

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.290 
is still in the tensioning sleeve what
this<00:01:36.260> tie<00:01:36.470> rod<00:01:36.740> do<00:01:36.979> does<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.729> amount<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:38.090> this

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
this tie rod do does it amount to this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.980 
this tie rod do does it amount to this
chain<00:01:38.860> tensioning<00:01:39.860> blade<00:01:40.600> as<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.750> tighten

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
chain tensioning blade as you tighten

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.270 
chain tensioning blade as you tighten
this<00:01:42.260> up<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:44.360> comes<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.560> flexes<00:01:46.010> disc

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
this up it comes in and it flexes disc

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.960 
this up it comes in and it flexes disc
tensioning<00:01:46.729> plate<00:01:48.280> which<00:01:49.280> is<00:01:49.310> what<00:01:49.610> adjusts

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
tensioning plate which is what adjusts

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.810 
tensioning plate which is what adjusts
your<00:01:50.030> chain<00:01:50.330> tension<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.610> probably

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
your chain tension so it probably

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.510 
your chain tension so it probably
happened<00:01:53.330> was<00:01:53.360> this<00:01:53.660> was<00:01:53.899> never<00:01:54.080> adjusted<00:01:54.649> as

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
happened was this was never adjusted as

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.249 
happened was this was never adjusted as
the<00:01:55.670> chain<00:01:55.910> started<00:01:56.330> flapping<00:01:56.600> around

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
the chain started flapping around

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.150 
the chain started flapping around
I<00:01:58.630> work<00:01:59.630> hard<00:01:59.869> in<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.140> end<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:00.410> this<00:02:00.500> rod<00:02:00.800> and

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
I work hard in the end of this rod and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.219 
I work hard in the end of this rod and
it<00:02:02.090> broke<00:02:02.270> off<00:02:04.300> so<00:02:05.300> what<00:02:05.450> our<00:02:05.479> customer<00:02:05.990> told

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
it broke off so what our customer told

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.320 
it broke off so what our customer told
us<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.979> there<00:02:07.130> wasn't<00:02:07.280> any<00:02:07.430> abnormal<00:02:08.119> noises

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
us that there wasn't any abnormal noises

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.460 
us that there wasn't any abnormal noises
was<00:02:09.289> probably<00:02:09.770> incorrect<00:02:10.959> he<00:02:11.959> probably<00:02:12.200> just

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
was probably incorrect he probably just

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.530 
was probably incorrect he probably just
didn't<00:02:12.980> know<00:02:13.100> what<00:02:13.250> normal<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.790> abnormal<00:02:13.910> was

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
didn't know what normal and abnormal was

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.720 
didn't know what normal and abnormal was
but<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.590> would<00:02:15.770> have<00:02:15.860> made<00:02:16.010> quite<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.430> bit<00:02:16.640> of

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
but this would have made quite a bit of

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.790 
but this would have made quite a bit of
racket<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.450> chain<00:02:17.750> flopping<00:02:18.230> around<00:02:18.320> and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
racket this chain flopping around and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.039 
racket this chain flopping around and
this<00:02:19.489> tensioner<00:02:20.000> blade<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.810> when<00:02:23.930> that

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
this tensioner blade so when that

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.660 
this tensioner blade so when that
happened<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> push<00:02:24.769> this<00:02:24.950> tensioner<00:02:25.459> blade

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
happened to push this tensioner blade

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.880 
happened to push this tensioner blade
this<00:02:26.030> way<00:02:26.239> in<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> case<00:02:26.810> cover<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.410> it's<00:02:27.560> bent

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
this way in the case cover so it's bent

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.920 
this way in the case cover so it's bent
the<00:02:28.519> tensioner<00:02:29.000> blade<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:31.940> next<00:02:32.269> step<00:02:32.480> is

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
the tensioner blade so the next step is

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.650 
the tensioner blade so the next step is
to<00:02:33.080> get<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.320> tensioner<00:02:33.709> blade<00:02:33.950> out<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> what<00:02:35.630> I

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
to get the tensioner blade out so what I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.770 
to get the tensioner blade out so what I
have<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.870> do<00:02:36.019> on<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.470> remove<00:02:36.739> our<00:02:36.920> stator

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
have to do on that is remove our stator

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.870 
have to do on that is remove our stator
so<00:02:38.780> I'll<00:02:38.840> remove<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.350> three<00:02:39.590> nuts<00:02:39.880> holding

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
so I'll remove the three nuts holding

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.270 
so I'll remove the three nuts holding
the<00:02:41.120> stator<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.780> I'm<00:02:42.680> going<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.920> take<00:02:43.130> the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the stator and I'm going to take the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.870 
the stator and I'm going to take the
stator<00:02:43.549> off<00:02:43.850> I've<00:02:44.540> also<00:02:45.430> pushed<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.610> stator

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
stator off I've also pushed the stator

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.880 
stator off I've also pushed the stator
wire<00:02:47.150> back<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:47.690> from<00:02:47.900> underneath<00:02:48.170> goes<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.799> the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
wire back in from underneath goes to the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.530 
wire back in from underneath goes to the
back<00:02:49.070> of<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.280> case<00:02:49.489> here<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:50.239> give<00:02:50.390> me<00:02:50.510> a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
back of the case here to give me a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.030 
back of the case here to give me a
little<00:02:50.720> slack<00:02:51.079> enough<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> get<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.739> stator

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
little slack enough to get the stator

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.270 
little slack enough to get the stator
off<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:53.299> I'm<00:02:53.390> going<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.600> Jen

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
off so I'm going to Jen

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:06.270 
off so I'm going to Jen
remove<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.430> stator

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.250 

try<00:03:06.850> not<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.180> hurt<00:03:07.300> those<00:03:07.540> wires<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:07.990> when<00:03:08.170> I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
try not to hurt those wires and when I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.290 
try not to hurt those wires and when I
take<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.620> off<00:03:09.810> I'm<00:03:10.810> going<00:03:11.020> to<00:03:11.110> very<00:03:11.350> gently

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.380 

that's<00:03:15.900> data<00:03:16.200> right<00:03:16.590> there<00:03:19.910> okay<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:20.940> we're

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
that's data right there okay now we're

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.640 
that's data right there okay now we're
going<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.570> we're<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.110> take<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.410> tie

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
going to we're going to take this tie

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:57.470 
going to we're going to take this tie
rod<00:03:22.950> out<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.220> little<00:03:23.730> slide<00:03:24.120> out

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.660 

/<00:03:58.050> like<00:03:58.319> here<00:03:58.500> she<00:03:58.650> would<00:03:58.830> figure<00:03:59.340> out<00:03:59.459> what's

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
/ like here she would figure out what's

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:25.370 
/ like here she would figure out what's
going<00:04:00.000> on

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.710 

it<00:04:26.380> looks<00:04:26.560> like<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:26.860> slides<00:04:27.250> out<00:04:27.600> mm-hmm

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
it looks like that slides out mm-hmm

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.689 
it looks like that slides out mm-hmm
with<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.229> tensioning<00:04:29.680> blade<00:04:29.889> so<00:04:30.400> what<00:04:30.580> we're

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
with the tensioning blade so what we're

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.909 
with the tensioning blade so what we're
going<00:04:30.789> to<00:04:30.850> do<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.210> buy<00:04:31.990> this<00:04:32.050> tensioning<00:04:32.710> blade

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
going to do is buy this tensioning blade

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:49.840 
going to do is buy this tensioning blade
out

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:05:00.290 

all<00:04:50.850> right<00:04:51.030> there<00:04:51.390> we<00:04:51.510> go

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.720 

alright<00:05:00.990> there's<00:05:01.200> our<00:05:01.320> tensioning<00:05:01.770> blade<00:05:02.010> and

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
alright there's our tensioning blade and

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.690 
alright there's our tensioning blade and
if<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.940> can<00:05:03.090> see<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.390> bend<00:05:03.600> in<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:04.580> see<00:05:05.580> the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
if you can see the bend in that see the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.600 
if you can see the bend in that see the
wear<00:05:05.880> marks<00:05:06.740> should<00:05:07.740> be<00:05:07.920> parallel<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.580> that

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
wear marks should be parallel to that

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.990 
wear marks should be parallel to that
going<00:05:09.300> on<00:05:09.420> angle<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:10.400> don't<00:05:11.400> know<00:05:11.490> how<00:05:11.640> long<00:05:11.790> it

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
going on angle I don't know how long it

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.220 
going on angle I don't know how long it
was<00:05:12.120> like<00:05:12.300> that<00:05:12.510> but<00:05:12.630> that's<00:05:12.810> not<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.050> good

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
was like that but that's not a good

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.220 
was like that but that's not a good
thing

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
thing

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:28.010 
thing
hey<00:05:16.230> we<00:05:16.380> got<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:16.740> out<00:05:21.020> stay<00:05:22.020> pin<00:05:22.320> there

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.410 

got<00:05:28.200> somewhere<00:05:28.560> on<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:29.430> looks<00:05:29.670> intact

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
got somewhere on it that looks intact

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.730 
got somewhere on it that looks intact
look<00:05:30.720> usable<00:05:32.870> so<00:05:33.870> we're<00:05:34.200> going<00:05:34.290> to<00:05:34.350> have<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.620> do

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
look usable so we're going to have to do

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.340 
look usable so we're going to have to do
now

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
now

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.460 
now
to<00:05:37.350> order<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.980> new<00:05:38.040> tensioning<00:05:38.640> blade<00:05:39.200> your<00:05:40.200> tie

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
to order a new tensioning blade your tie

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.290 
to order a new tensioning blade your tie
rod<00:05:42.500> adjusting<00:05:43.500> sleeve<00:05:44.750> get<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:45.810> new<00:05:45.990> gasket

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
rod adjusting sleeve get a new gasket

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.700 
rod adjusting sleeve get a new gasket
put<00:05:48.300> all<00:05:48.450> that<00:05:48.600> back<00:05:48.810> in<00:05:49.110> there<00:05:49.260> so<00:05:49.470> we<00:05:49.590> can

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
put all that back in there so we can

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.610 
put all that back in there so we can
adjust<00:05:49.800> our<00:05:50.160> primary<00:05:50.640> chain<00:05:51.080> but<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.200> primary

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
adjust our primary chain but the primary

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.260 
adjust our primary chain but the primary
cover<00:05:52.890> on<00:05:53.100> we'll<00:05:53.220> put<00:05:53.370> our<00:05:53.460> stator<00:05:53.730> back<00:05:54.000> on

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
cover on we'll put our stator back on

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.200 
cover on we'll put our stator back on
and<00:05:55.340> hopefully<00:05:56.340> we'll<00:05:56.640> be<00:05:56.760> good<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.030> go<00:05:57.180> on

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
and hopefully we'll be good to go on

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.080 
and hopefully we'll be good to go on
this<00:05:57.480> side<00:05:57.720> of<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.870> motor
