00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hermann from here is everything again 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.130
 lucassen today I show you as you 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.750
 I could improve eyes for that 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.880
 I gained a few tips and tricks 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.200
 and even got me some photoshop 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.849
 tutorials again looked at 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.099
 this I pack times the description 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.980
 because I do not use all the tips 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.210
 and tricks because I have my own 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.590
 and I prefer to turn that but then 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.269
 I want to say we are going to start now 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 so first of all, of course, could 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.619
 picture I just got this eye 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000
 I even chose this one 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.880
 ever used for the photo 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 manipulation so far as I know anyway 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.350
 Let's start with that first 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.390
 neighborly vote for it 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.850
 complicated first the level if 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.230
 but you never know what happens eighth 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.690
 by a relative I was in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.800
 I have brush and yes exposure 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.180
 to about 15 percent 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.530
 8 even as I first shine 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.530
 increasing a prohibited image personals pure 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.890
 and go over all the bright in the area of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:12.140
 picture over it again so only become 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.140
 the glanzlichter gets some 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.259
 however, something goes wrong 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.880
 lost 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.570
 the whole thing was not in the memo 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.420
 There are already photoshop for it 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.850
 a tool or a box which one 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.829
 so the whole thing can not be marked 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.210
 Anyway, let's go now 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.159
 on the middle of the middle doors 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.240
 district says and will do so 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.340
 a little lighter so and last on winner 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.579
 the shadows and then we have to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.229
 of course choose at will 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.030
 reduced what the brush and go only 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:54.320
 over the outer edge over here 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.320
 so that only the slightly darker 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.750
 So approach brushes a bit bigger 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.890
 then generously over her over the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:09.599
 iris over the pupil over it so now see 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.129
 her before that is already one 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.900
 small differences as I said here 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:18.060
 go something the color as I said here 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.260
 something is lost color so that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.209
 Whole becomes a little more unsaturated 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.920
 However, I have a small one 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:32.459
 trick and should polizzi me now 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:35.790
 lower level pull up and 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.000
 create a plane mask so even 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.239
 Add mask full black 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.130
 transparency so now he goes to the 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.849
 image plane so he clicked it on 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.450
 picture goes on color saturation final destination 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.069
 the whole thing at 100 so the whole time 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.590
 animal not there we a black one 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.769
 level have completely transparent 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.519
 now, however, who our white brush 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.030
 and just go over the iris 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.470
 and the pupil over it and you see it 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.470
 the whole something a little bit better ticker 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.300
 so 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:25.730
 Now we just have to open 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.849
 the just what clique next to norsker 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.019
 apply and how you see but the whole 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.700
 on when no longer the whole 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.499
 of course, again below the other level 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.499
 because there we have exposed as a whole 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.400
 so now we have to open it all up 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.799
 superimpose or provide soft edges 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.209
 and already the eye is saturated again 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.459
 but a bit too much 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.459
 that wishes that someone on 60 50 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.200
 percent how you will you see has 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.510
 a very nice effect and though that 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.889
 eye something colored again so now 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.079
 let's play some more light and 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.510
 shadow conditions around for it 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.879
 I create a new level and fill 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.949
 that means with a 50 percent 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.659
 Here you put the whole thing that way 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:17.930
 one will experience the html notation 8 08 00 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:21.229
 gb hockey and fill the plain simple 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.020
 with the movie tool so now we go 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.539
 on colors curves and pull the curve 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.479
 something up so that the whole thing is something 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.349
 brighter is click on ok goes on 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.650
 overlay 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.639
 we see that the whole picture is brighter 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.409
 however, we only want a few 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.120
 areas helga have that's why we go 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:42.500
 to add something black full 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.860
 transparency back into a forehead 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.190
 driver from the kist and wlan relative 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.759
 a brush out for those of the 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.590
 bigger ones for that way and then go over 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:57.620
 the white areas of the picture again 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.820
 over it and the lighter areas me 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.449
 Let's see it all again 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.449
 lightened 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.320
 However, we will now on the 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.659
 iron parts of the eyeball go there 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.659
 we have something to brighten up 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:25.009
 so wonderful now we introduce a new one 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.009
 level again very close to the 50 the woman 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:31.110
 four color curves pull the curves 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.840
 again after a bit and so the whole thing 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.169
 gets a little darker and then go 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.360
 again put on superimpose again 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.349
 even mask black forest and indeed whole 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.240
 much just the success and was 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.330
 again knows and then go naturally 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.580
 Over the darker area of ​​the picture 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.680
 This means areas after one 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.000
 short interruption I can now here 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.330
 sometimes again you go then 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.669
 again as I mentioned earlier 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.550
 darker area picture above 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:06.389
 these outdoor areas this was on 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.529
 black so now we have a nice one 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.789
 contrast in it 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:14.610
 create light and dark tones 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.279
 a level and indeed newly visible 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.560
 it means a level all the levels 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:25.409
 united and the whole as a picture 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.509
 make the reform unwilling and leave 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.680
 overlay or soft edges you see 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.259
 it creates a higher one 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.039
 Contrast then pull the opacity 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:37.289
 for 50 percent and do it again 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:41.539
 a plane mask black of transparency 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:45.210
 and how we have training time 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:48.870
 we only have the iris and the pupil 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.460
 white on the level mask is whole 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.069
 Make sure you're on the 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.409
 plane is but consensus is one 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:07:00.509
 it goes from the beginning then about it 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:02.939
 and so we have a beautiful eye 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:04.500
 now if you have the whole with before 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:05.399
 that's why I draw the whole thing 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.460
 go up 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:12.199
 before after is already a small one 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.520
 to recognize difference and wants to say 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.169
 it will be enough that there you can 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.199
 actually a lot you can do that 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.189
 sharpening your whole eyes 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:22.289
 but I have one for example 

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:23.519
 Illusion makes details highlight that 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.680
 can you just look at me 

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:27.330
 practice in the video description times there 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.409
 Do you see how you can do it ? 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.729
 you can do it all 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:31.500
 Of course, again only with the eye 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:34.379
 just by doing it 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.270
 a plane mask turns off and the whole 

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:40.490
 then on the pupil and iris peter 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.490
 butcher nor the eyelashes so entrains
