you've shot fireworks from the ground
you<00:00:59.460> simply<00:00:59.850> don't<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.300> time<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.900> do

anything<00:01:01.290> fancy<00:01:02.090> usually<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> would<00:01:03.390> use<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
anything fancy usually I would use the

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.499 
anything fancy usually I would use the
HDR<00:01:04.290> feature<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.009> camera<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.060> wanted<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
HDR feature on the camera if I wanted to

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.350 
HDR feature on the camera if I wanted to
make<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.930> photos<00:01:07.290> pop<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.340> fireworks<00:01:08.909> change

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
make my photos pop but fireworks change

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.940 
make my photos pop but fireworks change
in<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> fraction<00:01:10.079> of<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.259> second<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.770> that's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
in a fraction of a second and that's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
in a fraction of a second and that's
just<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.399> enough<00:01:11.670> time<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.210> use<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.570> feature

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
just not enough time to use this feature

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.930 
just not enough time to use this feature
so<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:14.010> I'm<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> do<00:01:14.490> instead<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
so what I'm going to do instead of

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.360 
so what I'm going to do instead of
creating<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.659> HDR<00:01:16.020> image<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:16.680> combining<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
creating an HDR image by combining the

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.880 
creating an HDR image by combining the
best<00:01:17.610> attributes<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.600> multiple<00:01:19.020> exposures<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
best attributes of multiple exposures is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.390 
best attributes of multiple exposures is
use<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.729> photo<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.630> added<00:01:21.990> layers<00:01:22.400> each

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
use one photo with added layers each

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
use one photo with added layers each
layer<00:01:23.820> will<00:01:23.940> add<00:01:24.150> depth<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> color<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.350> will

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
layer will add depth and color and will

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.789 
layer will add depth and color and will
merge<00:01:25.650> them<00:01:25.920> into<00:01:26.010> one<00:01:26.190> spectacular<00:01:26.670> result

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
merge them into one spectacular result

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.740 
merge them into one spectacular result
so<00:01:28.799> let's<00:01:29.010> get<00:01:29.159> started<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:30.240> want<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.600> our

you<00:02:23.130> don't<00:02:23.310> need<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.580> be<00:02:23.700> shy<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.240> gonna<00:02:24.420> use

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
you don't need to be shy I'm gonna use

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:34.270 
you don't need to be shy I'm gonna use
both<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.260> give<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.620> real<00:02:26.040> burst<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.610> color

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.580 

now<00:02:35.280> I'll<00:02:35.459> go<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> adjust<00:02:36.239> blur<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.230> Gaussian

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
now I'll go to adjust blur and Gaussian

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.150 
now I'll go to adjust blur and Gaussian
blur<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.959> amount<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.380> blur<00:02:40.620> needed<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.130> really

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
blur the amount of blur needed is really

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.370 
blur the amount of blur needed is really
going<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.760> depend<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.420> size<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.110> photo

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
going to depend on the size of the photo

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.800 
going to depend on the size of the photo
so<00:02:44.010> there's<00:02:44.250> no<00:02:44.400> real<00:02:44.640> right<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.060> wrong<00:02:45.239> number

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
so there's no real right or wrong number

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.930 
so there's no real right or wrong number
here<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.650> drag<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.100> slider<00:02:47.430> until<00:02:47.670> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
here just drag the slider until the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.070 
here just drag the slider until the
image<00:02:48.150> looks<00:02:48.420> about<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.840> now<00:02:52.019> we

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
image looks about like this so now we

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.809 
image looks about like this so now we
have<00:02:52.290> an<00:02:52.380> additional<00:02:52.800> two<00:02:53.069> layers<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.610> top<00:02:53.640> of

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
have an additional two layers on top of

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.150 
have an additional two layers on top of
our<00:02:54.120> background<00:02:54.600> why<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:55.110> three<00:02:55.530> I'll

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
our background why not three I'll

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.920 
our background why not three I'll
duplicate<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.910> one<00:02:57.090> more<00:02:57.300> copy<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
duplicate it one more copy of the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.470 
duplicate it one more copy of the

background name this one soft light and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.449

drag<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.410> very<00:03:01.680> top<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.250> layers

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
drag it to the very top of the layers

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.250 
drag it to the very top of the layers
palette<00:03:05.269> I'm<00:03:06.269> going<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.690> soften<00:03:06.930> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
palette I'm going to soften the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.840 
palette I'm going to soften the
differences<00:03:07.830> between<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.370> three<00:03:08.400> layers

with this blend mode called soft light

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.729 
with this blend mode called soft light
to<00:03:11.580> really<00:03:11.910> show<00:03:12.150> off<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.390> amazing<00:03:13.170> contrast

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
to really show off that amazing contrast

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.900 
to really show off that amazing contrast
of<00:03:13.920> light<00:03:14.130> against<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.610> black<00:03:14.880> background

of light against the black background

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.690 
of light against the black background
and<00:03:15.660> if<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.709> find<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.250> image<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.670> a

and if you find that the image is a
little<00:03:17.790> too<00:03:18.180> blurry<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.989> can<00:03:19.170> always<00:03:19.350> go<00:03:19.709> back

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
little too blurry you can always go back

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.150 
little too blurry you can always go back
to<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.400> layer<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.060> change<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.780> opacity<00:03:22.170> do

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
to that layer and change the opacity do

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.039 
to that layer and change the opacity do
this<00:03:23.370> by<00:03:23.549> dragging<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.150> gauge<00:03:24.360> over<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.340 
left and in this case it looks like 75%
is<00:03:28.470> about<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.920> magic<00:03:29.250> number<00:03:30.200> when<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.320> have
