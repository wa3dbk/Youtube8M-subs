00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
comparison so here was the original

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.190 
comparison so here was the original
Nintendo<00:01:03.019> yes<00:01:04.939> game<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.210> here<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> new

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
Nintendo yes game and here is the new

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.820 
Nintendo yes game and here is the new
3ds<00:01:07.619> game<00:01:07.979> first<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.299> locals<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.680> is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
3ds game first of all the locals this is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
3ds game first of all the locals this is
on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.700> side<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
on the right side and this is on the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.340 
on the right side and this is on the
left<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:13.340> same<00:01:14.340> rating<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.930> box<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:18.350> thinner

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
left side same rating the box is thinner

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.859 
left side same rating the box is thinner
I<00:01:20.030> guess<00:01:21.030> that's<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.360> better<00:01:21.509> comparison

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
I guess that's a better comparison

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.580 
I guess that's a better comparison
slightly<00:01:22.500> thinner<00:01:22.710> ever<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.880> slightly<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
slightly thinner ever so slightly and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
slightly thinner ever so slightly and
the<00:01:25.590> size<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.860> approximately<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.060> same<00:01:27.390> in

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the size is approximately the same in

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990 
the size is approximately the same in
terms<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.140> length<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.500> width<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.670> let's<00:01:29.850> open

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
terms of length and width so let's open

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
terms of length and width so let's open
