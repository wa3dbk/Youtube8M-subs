to really get a tuned in to understand
it<00:01:12.930> having<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> continuous<00:01:13.740> cranking<00:01:14.190> system

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
it having a continuous cranking system

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
it having a continuous cranking system
it's<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.210> nice<00:01:15.510> feature<00:01:15.950> when<00:01:16.950> we

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it's going to be nice feature when we

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.720 
it's going to be nice feature when we
get<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.430> point

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
get to that point

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.150 
get to that point
without<00:01:19.330> run<00:01:19.570> out<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.780> time<00:01:20.050> clear<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.890> I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
without run out of time clear that I

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.400 
without run out of time clear that I
think<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:22.030> so<00:01:22.210> we<00:01:22.330> cover<00:01:22.600> all<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.020> important

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
think that so we cover all the important

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.260 
think that so we cover all the important
issues<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:24.130> think<00:01:24.370> we're<00:01:24.700> just<00:01:25.180> about

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
issues I think we're just about

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.700 
issues I think we're just about
everything<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.930> hope<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:28.710> satisfies

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
everything I hope that satisfies

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.680 
everything I hope that satisfies

a ball valve on the end of that because

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.559 
a ball valve on the end of that because
we<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:57.489> seem<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.700> collect<00:02:58.030> quite<00:02:58.299> a<00:02:58.329> bit<00:02:58.480> of

we do seem to collect quite a bit of

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.000 
we do seem to collect quite a bit of
fluid<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:58.989> here<00:02:59.230> particularly<00:02:59.590> when<00:02:59.799> we're

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
fluid in here particularly when we're

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:23.000
