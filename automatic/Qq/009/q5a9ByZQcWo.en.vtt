three<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.570> presets<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:37.740> works<00:01:38.070> very

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
three will be presets and it works very

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.980 
three will be presets and it works very
well<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.590> gig<00:01:40.590> live<00:01:40.829> situation<00:01:44.990> could

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
well in a gig live situation could

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.370 
well in a gig live situation could
probably<00:01:46.310> be<00:01:47.310> built<00:01:47.549> even<00:01:48.180> nicer<00:01:48.360> using<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
probably be built even nicer using the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.639 
probably be built even nicer using the
same<00:01:49.619> red<00:01:49.829> color<00:01:50.159> or<00:01:51.619> build<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.770> wider<00:01:53.009> set<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
same red color or build a wider set and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.380 
same red color or build a wider set and
perhaps<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:56.009> four<00:01:56.520> sets<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.939> draw<00:01:57.149> boss

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
perhaps have four sets of draw boss

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.850 
perhaps have four sets of draw boss
would<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.869> possible<00:01:58.320> inside<00:01:58.829> as<00:02:00.439> BD<00:02:01.439> cards

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
would be possible inside as BD cards

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.700 
would be possible inside as BD cards
from<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.399> doctor<00:02:03.020> they're<00:02:04.020> already<00:02:04.380> it's

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
from the doctor they're already it's

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.150 
from the doctor they're already it's
it's<00:02:05.570> quite<00:02:06.570> easy<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.899> actually<00:02:07.649> hook<00:02:07.770> them<00:02:08.039> up

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it's quite easy to actually hook them up

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.759 
it's quite easy to actually hook them up
all<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.580> need<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.940> put<00:02:09.179> us

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
all you need to put us

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.660 
all you need to put us
now<00:02:11.769> lot<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:13.260> resistors<00:02:14.260> inside<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.250> your

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
now lot of resistors inside and your

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.800 
now lot of resistors inside and your
Europe<00:02:16.090> will<00:02:16.239> run<00:02:16.420> again<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> couple<00:02:16.989> of<00:02:17.170> hours

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
Europe will run again a couple of hours

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.199 
Europe will run again a couple of hours
so<00:02:19.810> hope<00:02:20.650> hope<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.580> demonstration
