add it to a piece like this like with

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.359 
add it to a piece like this like with
using<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.360> horn<00:00:52.629> this<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.440> what<00:00:53.589> this<00:00:53.830> line<00:00:54.129> is

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
using the horn this is what this line is

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:56.070 
using the horn this is what this line is
for<00:00:54.400> right<00:00:54.820> here<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.299> add<00:00:55.449> that<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:55.930> that

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
for right here to add that so that

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.450 
for right here to add that so that
there's<00:00:56.290> not<00:00:56.440> so<00:00:56.619> much<00:00:56.739> fullness<00:00:57.190> at<00:00:57.339> the

there's not so much fullness at the

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.490 
there's not so much fullness at the
bottom<00:00:57.760> so<00:00:58.299> you<00:00:58.360> would<00:00:58.600> cut<00:00:58.839> that<00:00:59.019> out<00:00:59.080> of<00:00:59.440> the
