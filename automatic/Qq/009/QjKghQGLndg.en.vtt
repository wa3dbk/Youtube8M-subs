00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.760
 Today shows by a simple 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.769
 biscuit role and that is really 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.559
 With what recipe as I own a suite 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.730
 told wheelchair that is so 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.970
 That's fast if you are 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.390
 In the morning visit announces and hungary 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.890
 ball then he does just that and that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.300
 you really only need it for that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.099
 normal games are the same and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.270
 Immediately show that it really is a hero 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.559
 and even just jar and jam 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.630
 need to come brother and in the end 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:35.059
 was that it? 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.059
 and if you just feel like it too 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:47.339
 for the s &amp; p participate yes and indeed 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:50.300
 we take here five eggs and egg yolks, the 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.300
 we'll start frothy 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:01.969
 because he lives from his biscuit role 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.969
 volume can also be so 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.350
 wonderful role of bisignani 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.600
 Now it was sugar 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.439
 vanilla sugar until sugar 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.439
 has dissolved 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.910
 now the sugar has dissolved that we 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.220
 together much text no sugar 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.560
 feel crystalline 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.370
 give now but again and lift 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.370
 all this briefly below 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:24.930
 logitech finished and we turn then 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:37.740
 now that we solve the lech 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:41.160
 can and we take here then the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.890
 second baking tray on top 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.040
 we have that as concluded between 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.740
 hurry us a bit and although cold 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:56.280
 the two are not called and spin 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:59.240
 Now that's just hot 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.240
 baking sheet is up 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.560
 we can just take off 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:11.330
 fastest and it is more important you 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.500
 we have to do the baking sheet paper what the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.550
 politics and also with that now have one 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.480
 has become smaller now 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.950
 can carefully remove my pages 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.650
 not tear me is already 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:30.650
 happens 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:34.440
 the simple reason so can because the dough 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.420
 better off and better we will thinner 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.670
 now have our sponge it here 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.820
 cooled down and now uses the hand 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.620
 the jam is but you do not care 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.540
 grunde take any jam 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.040
 you may like strawberries 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.959
 conversions the apple computer in 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.959
 the 40 in the 40th 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.060
 no matter what is pretty cool if you are 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.090
 the round two will share one here 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.020
 strips made with wise two games 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.250
 cherry jam and landesbergen and 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.380
 For example, he did one here 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.180
 other computers let's say lemons 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.519
 jam or 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.390
 the head was today you have 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.519
 once these strawberry layers and 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.680
 lemon or strawberry and johannisberg 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.850
 and if they are very distracting it 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.280
 Pretty much a pretty cool one 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.600
 effect would be very cool then with the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.830
 time different colored jam 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.820
 Or I would like to comment 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.729
 not I take here is my gage of 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.410
 Jam and I'll open it now 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.580
 my discrete state and allow a 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.580
 centimeter at the edge free 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.669
 so and now comes the fummelt part 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.810
 Now we want to open everything up and look 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.810
 just that it does not break 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.379
 now have a nice role-a 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:55.150
 a bit like a towel and me 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.830
 am going to go and I'll be there 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.039
 see 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:03.099
 You better just get the end 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:06.909
 a little cut off nevertheless beautiful 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:09.789
 form of them then but also looks because 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.879
 Sometimes you tear down the ends 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.080
 see here and also not so nice 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.330
 we sometimes see the brown ones 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.849
 little roundish less hop old 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:25.870
 uni and as here have a few 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:29.099
 things that have come to the fore now everything is coming 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.099
 a very nice bottle 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.740
 that 's all I've been doing for a minute 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.740
 now also cold and tomorrow 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:49.030
