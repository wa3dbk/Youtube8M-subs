00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.870
 So what we do now is vegetarian 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.240
 Dear vegetarian, look forward to her work 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.730
 So first, I have one here 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.640
 beautiful plate serra resp 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.039
 by lattice also accordingly it is 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.350
 good for little things for example now 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.240
 beans or chopped carrots 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.730
 it is for a all-rounder for vegetables 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.800
 it is actually very very smart so 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.930
 I think it's beautiful parts I'll 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.540
 now I make a cauliflower out of it 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.210
 Do a few for you now 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 simple vegetarian stories 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.860
 I only need a small one here 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.719
 I need a little bit of mineral water 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.789
 now a little butter and set 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.820
 desktop of the alu form or in superform 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.070
 here on the list on it and take 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.120
 I like my cauliflower and tricks 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.270
 very light and gentle, yes, everything else 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.330
 this is just a little salt and then 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:11.220
 it comes slowly on the grill and me 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.290
 have my slow with about 150 to 170 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.040
 grad maybe one and a half to two 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.130
 hours 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.049
 you have never had such a cauliflower 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:26.100
 eaten provides time on it and of course 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.799
 the clever story here is I do 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.250
 not just a cauliflower uses the whole 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.340
 grill 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.079
 I have a lot of fun here too 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.079
 is now a tray as you can see 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.700
 potatoes back and forth 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.170
 in this met sweet potato is 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.939
 a little spies and yes I have to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.820
 admit so I 've never had something like that 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.530
 used for a potato but the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.899
 one or the other does not like the check 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.509
 a potato guard is the ideal 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.119
 because if it is possible is this small 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.360
 part here shoots out and one 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.090
 Potato is ready so much for one 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.659
 But I also do this without just this 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.239
 met 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.530
 I 'm doing this beautiful purple 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.720
 just a little butter now 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.410
 take care a little 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.660
 flirt a bit and get that done 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.240
 wrap up and dentsu me now without 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.320
 feel and that's how it is 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.200
 this holder is clear it is not only 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.120
 thought this is now for 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.940
 Potato is but you could go here 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.010
 Zucchini or I think how 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.810
 which looks to the charges creates a 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.630
 Artichokes on the whole like that 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.880
 because france nice hat but there simply 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.100
 stew and then pearl down and 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.870
 slip out now it will be just like that 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:54.260
 on it the potatoes like cauliflower 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.030
 said need a bit 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.530
 for the tense from this spits ob 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.530
 these are already finished and doubled 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.159
 according to this potato thermometer or 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.329
 I do not know what that means 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:14.829
 double therefore perfect that's it 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:18.920
 went out clearly and the double 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:23.299
 feels even after all even at 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:27.530
 it looks it get out that's cool the 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.140
 is really cool around and hot or so 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.500
 but you can already see the potato here 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.420
 And the advantage is the color is already 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.299
 this potato alone and they are 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.250
 properly channeled because the very very 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.290
 are cute to be called the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.450
 sweet potatoes, we smell it like that 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.150
 that is really a dream 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.150
 now put mazda on the plate and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.889
 I have a little surprise 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:04.660
 bit of tiryaki asia on it 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:07.989
 everywhere and a little watercress 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:14.750
 Sprinkle a little watercress on it 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:17.840
 walla little bit of stress in 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.709
 outside a bit spice mix from me 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.320
 on it and already I have the first choice 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.550
 It's possible to say that because of ours 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.600
 potatoes with tiryaki sauce bowling 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.160
 press finished 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.620
 so and now I'll go mine 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.980
 cauliflower alone what advantage of this 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.870
 Sheet metal definitely has my method 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.990
 to see if that's all or not 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.740
 simply stick through knives yes 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:51.300
 beautiful through and smooth out now 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:54.120
 i take it away from the main of all form and 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.060
 I had one in here 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.740
 beautiful sud and certainly is the 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.180
 Fund also accordingly juice of 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.430
 Cauliflower arrived here 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.770
 I would normally do that too 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.900
 bit reduce its not assemble 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.530
 With butter you have my nice sauce 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.130
 but that cauliflower would be me now 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:18.150
 just cut in half 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:23.670
