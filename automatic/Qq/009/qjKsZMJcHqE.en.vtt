45.1 and he's not as hard as the air in

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.460 
45.1 and he's not as hard as the air in
my<00:00:19.170> opinion<00:00:20.539> he<00:00:21.539> basically<00:00:21.779> he's<00:00:22.260> going<00:00:22.410> to

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
my opinion he basically he's going to

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
my opinion he basically he's going to
use<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.740> elemental<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.460> beast<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.119> critter

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
use an elemental a beast and a critter

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.540 
use an elemental a beast and a critter
and<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.990> personally<00:00:25.529> don't<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> mechanical

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
and I personally don't have a mechanical

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.599 
and I personally don't have a mechanical
anymore<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.510> sold<00:00:27.900> mine<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.099> I'm<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
anymore I sold mine and so I'm going to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.950 
anymore I sold mine and so I'm going to
beat<00:00:29.820> him<00:00:30.000> without<00:00:30.119> using<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.810> mechanical

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
beat him without using a mechanical

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.530 
beat him without using a mechanical
against<00:00:31.710> his<00:00:31.920> beast<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.030> course<00:00:33.059> would

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
against his beast which of course would

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
against his beast which of course would
be<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> much<00:00:34.050> better<00:00:34.110> strategy<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.100> would

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
be a much better strategy and would

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.910 
be a much better strategy and would
probably<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> kill<00:00:36.210> even<00:00:36.780> easier<00:00:36.930> so

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
probably get you the kill even easier so

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560 
probably get you the kill even easier so
if<00:00:38.280> you're<00:00:38.430> wondering<00:00:38.610> how<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.910> get<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.329> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
if you're wondering how to get here it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.590 
if you're wondering how to get here it's
basically<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> mountain<00:00:41.129> between

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
basically up on the mountain between

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.420 
basically up on the mountain between
kunle<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.930> vale<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.350> eternal<00:00:43.559> blossoms<00:00:44.010> if

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
kunle and vale of eternal blossoms if

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.180 
kunle and vale of eternal blossoms if
you<00:00:45.120> come<00:00:45.870> over<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.860> Horde

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
you come over here you can see the Horde

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.830 
you come over here you can see the Horde
city<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:47.700> there<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.390> horde<00:00:48.660> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
city right there so if your horde you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.450 
city right there so if your horde you
can<00:00:49.020> literally<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.590> fly<00:00:49.980> right<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.219> this

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
can literally just fly right up this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
can literally just fly right up this
mountain<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.090> he's<00:00:51.329> right<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.809> if<00:00:51.960> your

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
mountain and he's right here if your

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
mountain and he's right here if your
lines<00:00:52.829> however<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.399> got<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> fly<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.480> way

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
lines however you got to fly all the way

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
lines however you got to fly all the way
across<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:55.350> obviously<00:00:55.500> pick<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> wrong

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
across we obviously pick the wrong

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.270 
across we obviously pick the wrong
faction<00:00:57.090> again<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.739> come<00:00:58.739> all<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.250> way

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
faction again and come all the way

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
faction again and come all the way
across<00:00:59.460> over<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.420> die<00:01:00.690> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
across over here and if you die you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.439 
across over here and if you die you
gotta<00:01:01.140> run<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.710> stable<00:01:02.640> masters<00:01:03.030> over<00:01:03.270> there

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
gotta run back stable masters over there

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.119 
gotta run back stable masters over there
whereas<00:01:03.899> Horde<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.739> right<00:01:04.890> there

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
whereas Horde can just go right there

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.359 
whereas Horde can just go right there
which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.659> absolutely<00:01:06.659> ridiculous<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.369> we're

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
which is absolutely ridiculous but we're

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
which is absolutely ridiculous but we're
going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> start<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.720> guy<00:01:09.900> up

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
going to just going to start this guy up

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.929 
going to just going to start this guy up
and<00:01:10.320> we're<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:10.979> try<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.670> his

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and we're going to try to get his

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.950 
and we're going to try to get his
elemental<00:01:12.689> first<00:01:13.080> always<00:01:14.270> there<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.540> nice

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
elemental first always there we go nice

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
elemental first always there we go nice
and<00:01:16.020> easy<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.340> strategy<00:01:17.580> basically<00:01:18.299> his

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and easy so the strategy basically his

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570 
and easy so the strategy basically his
elemental<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.290> always<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> use<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> stun

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
elemental is always going to use a stun

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760 
elemental is always going to use a stun
first<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:21.930> important<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
first and so it's really important to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.010 
first and so it's really important to
dodge<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.130> first<00:01:23.850> done<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.450> else<00:01:24.570> he's<00:01:24.780> just

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
dodge that first done or else he's just

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
dodge that first done or else he's just
going<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> get<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:25.680> too<00:01:25.740> far<00:01:26.070> behind<00:01:26.250> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
going to get you way too far behind so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.020 
going to get you way too far behind so
because<00:01:28.140> i'm<00:01:28.320> using<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.650> sprite<00:01:29.159> darker<00:01:29.490> sprite

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
because i'm using a sprite darker sprite

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.640 
because i'm using a sprite darker sprite

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
here like I said just keep your guy

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.789 
here like I said just keep your guy
really<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.100> only<00:03:31.250> chance<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.760> have<00:03:31.790> here<00:03:32.299> of

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
really the only chance I have here of

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.009 
really the only chance I have here of
hitting<00:03:33.799> him<00:03:33.920> as<00:03:34.070> if<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.549> dodge<00:03:35.330> or<00:03:35.780> if<00:03:35.900> he

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
hitting him as if I dodge or if he

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.860 
hitting him as if I dodge or if he
misses<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.709> let's<00:03:37.340> try<00:03:37.580> 40<00:03:38.000> or<00:03:38.239> if<00:03:38.510> he<00:03:38.600> doesn't

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
misses so let's try 40 or if he doesn't

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.150 
misses so let's try 40 or if he doesn't
attack<00:03:39.110> there<00:03:39.350> we<00:03:39.440> go<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:41.330> really<00:03:41.690> uh

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
attack there we go so it's really uh

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.620 
attack there we go so it's really uh
touch<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.370> go<00:03:43.489> maybe<00:03:43.880> he<00:03:44.090> might<00:03:44.209> miss<00:03:44.420> this

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
touch and go maybe he might miss this

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.289 
touch and go maybe he might miss this
even<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.170> who<00:03:45.860> knows<00:03:48.370> alright<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:49.670> now<00:03:50.090> we've

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
even and who knows alright so now we've

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.630 
even and who knows alright so now we've
just<00:03:50.329> got<00:03:50.600> our<00:03:50.900> Marsh<00:03:51.290> fitter<00:03:51.650> against<00:03:52.400> his

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
just got our Marsh fitter against his

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.690 
just got our Marsh fitter against his
dernak<00:03:53.239> tunneler<00:03:53.720> which<00:03:54.410> he's<00:03:54.920> actually<00:03:55.160> his

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
dernak tunneler which he's actually his

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.630 
dernak tunneler which he's actually his
tunnel<00:03:56.360> ability<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.410> only<00:03:57.620> be<00:03:58.130> stability

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
tunnel ability is the only be stability

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.840 
tunnel ability is the only be stability
that<00:03:58.790> he<00:03:59.000> has<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.570> so<00:04:00.320> his<00:04:00.799> be<00:04:01.190> stability<00:04:01.700> is

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
that he has and so his be stability is

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.490 
that he has and so his be stability is
not<00:04:02.150> going<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.420> be<00:04:02.570> doing<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:03.110> much<00:04:03.260> damage

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
not going to be doing that much damage

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.920 
not going to be doing that much damage
to<00:04:03.920> my<00:04:04.040> critter<00:04:04.340> because<00:04:05.269> I'm<00:04:05.660> going<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.840> be

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
to my critter because I'm going to be

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.380 
to my critter because I'm going to be
making<00:04:06.200> cocoon<00:04:06.920> strike<00:04:07.280> every<00:04:07.730> time<00:04:07.970> he<00:04:08.209> tries

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
making cocoon strike every time he tries

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.009 
making cocoon strike every time he tries
to<00:04:08.690> do<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:11.209> idea<00:04:11.329> is<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.660> I'm<00:04:11.900> going

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
to do that so the idea is that I'm going

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.250 
to do that so the idea is that I'm going
to<00:04:12.079> try<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.440> anticipate<00:04:12.829> his<00:04:13.239> his<00:04:14.260> underground

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
to try to anticipate his his underground

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.349 
to try to anticipate his his underground
so<00:04:15.620> he<00:04:15.920> had<00:04:16.010> already<00:04:16.250> done<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:16.640> a<00:04:16.820> turn<00:04:17.120> before

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
so he had already done it a turn before

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.880 
so he had already done it a turn before
I<00:04:17.510> brought<00:04:17.750> this<00:04:17.870> guy<00:04:18.049> out<00:04:18.200> so<00:04:18.410> he<00:04:18.500> should<00:04:18.739> have

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
I brought this guy out so he should have

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.430 
I brought this guy out so he should have
one<00:04:19.070> more<00:04:19.280> cool<00:04:19.519> down<00:04:19.700> on<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.349> here<00:04:21.349> it

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
one more cool down on it and here it

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.140 
one more cool down on it and here it
probably<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.950> so<00:04:22.160> I'm<00:04:22.250> going<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.460> try<00:04:22.669> cocoon

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
probably is so I'm going to try cocoon

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.500 
probably is so I'm going to try cocoon
striking<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:24.640> hopefully<00:04:25.640> he'll<00:04:25.820> use<00:04:26.030> his

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
striking and hopefully he'll use his

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.680 
striking and hopefully he'll use his
dig<00:04:27.230> right<00:04:27.560> here<00:04:29.800> nope<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:31.760> became<00:04:32.300> strike<00:04:32.570> I

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
dig right here nope so I became strike I

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.300 
dig right here nope so I became strike I
mean<00:04:32.840> it's<00:04:33.020> hard<00:04:33.260> when<00:04:33.530> you're<00:04:33.650> not<00:04:33.860> first

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
mean it's hard when you're not first

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.510 
mean it's hard when you're not first
simply<00:04:35.270> because<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.860> have<00:04:36.980> no<00:04:37.190> way<00:04:37.370> of

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
simply because you have no way of

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.550 
simply because you have no way of
anticipating<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.420> have<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.870> be<00:04:38.960> first<00:04:39.260> in

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
anticipating it you have to be first in

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.030 
anticipating it you have to be first in
order<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:40.100> use<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.270> cocoon<00:04:41.570> strike<00:04:42.040> extremely

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
order to use the cocoon strike extremely

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.240 
order to use the cocoon strike extremely
effectively<00:04:43.540> so<00:04:44.540> he<00:04:45.380> hit<00:04:45.470> me<00:04:45.560> for<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:45.770> thousand

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
effectively so he hit me for a thousand

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.950 
effectively so he hit me for a thousand
there<00:04:46.370> that's<00:04:46.580> pretty<00:04:47.090> devastating<00:04:47.780> it's

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
there that's pretty devastating it's

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.210 
there that's pretty devastating it's
going<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.140> be<00:04:48.200> really<00:04:48.410> hard<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.770> get<00:04:48.860> back<00:04:49.070> from

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
going to be really hard to get back from

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.580 
going to be really hard to get back from
this<00:04:49.370> one<00:04:50.080> basically<00:04:51.080> he's<00:04:51.230> going<00:04:51.380> to<00:04:51.440> have<00:04:51.560> to

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
this one basically he's going to have to

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.720 
this one basically he's going to have to
I'm<00:04:51.920> gonna<00:04:52.040> have<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.310> dodge<00:04:52.460> him<00:04:52.700> here<00:04:54.370> or<00:04:55.370> get

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
I'm gonna have to dodge him here or get

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.250 
I'm gonna have to dodge him here or get
a<00:04:55.790> free<00:04:56.000> attack<00:04:56.270> that<00:04:56.930> works<00:04:57.170> as<00:04:57.320> well<00:04:57.350> and<00:04:57.760> I

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
a free attack that works as well and I

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.110 
a free attack that works as well and I
don't<00:05:00.260> know<00:05:00.380> usually<00:05:00.680> usually<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:01.940> guy

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
don't know usually usually this guy

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.780 
don't know usually usually this guy
doesn't<00:05:02.330> give<00:05:02.570> me<00:05:02.660> as<00:05:02.750> much<00:05:02.930> trouble<00:05:03.200> but<00:05:03.790> he's

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
doesn't give me as much trouble but he's

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.760 
doesn't give me as much trouble but he's
gotten<00:05:05.030> really<00:05:05.540> close<00:05:05.780> right<00:05:06.260> now<00:05:06.320> this<00:05:06.650> is

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
gotten really close right now this is

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.410 
gotten really close right now this is
getting<00:05:06.920> really<00:05:07.250> down<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.730> the<00:05:07.760> line<00:05:08.030> who's

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
gonna win the rat or the grasshopper

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.120 
gonna win the rat or the grasshopper
seems<00:05:14.210> like<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.390> silly<00:05:14.660> Co<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.410> grasshopper

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
seems like a silly Co the grasshopper

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.510 
seems like a silly Co the grasshopper
wins<00:05:17.170> that<00:05:18.170> was<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.440> little<00:05:18.620> unexpected<00:05:18.890> but

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
wins that was a little unexpected but

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
four battles and I personally pick the

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.910 
four battles and I personally pick the
earth<00:05:38.510> just<00:05:39.050> because<00:05:39.410> I<00:05:40.180> didn't<00:05:41.180> have<00:05:41.390> any

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
earth just because I didn't have any

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.950 
earth just because I didn't have any
elemental<00:05:42.920> strong<00:05:43.280> elemental<00:05:43.820> pets<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.630> the

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
elemental strong elemental pets and the

elemental strong elemental pets and the
fire<00:05:45.230> one<00:05:45.500> didn't<00:05:45.830> seem<00:05:46.070> that<00:05:46.100> interesting<00:05:46.790> to

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
fire one didn't seem that interesting to

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.080 
fire one didn't seem that interesting to
me<00:05:47.030> in<00:05:47.570> PvP<00:05:48.140> if<00:05:48.470> you<00:05:48.650> get<00:05:48.860> hit<00:05:49.430> with<00:05:49.580> a<00:05:49.610> burn<00:05:49.880> you

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
me in PvP if you get hit with a burn you

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.660 
me in PvP if you get hit with a burn you
could<00:05:50.240> easily<00:05:50.540> just<00:05:50.660> switch<00:05:50.930> out<00:05:51.170> and<00:05:51.670> the

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
could easily just switch out and the

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.400 
could easily just switch out and the
earth<00:05:52.850> seemed<00:05:53.240> really<00:05:53.510> interesting<00:05:54.140> with<00:05:54.290> all

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
earth seemed really interesting with all

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.290 
earth seemed really interesting with all
his<00:05:54.560> stuns<00:05:54.830> that<00:05:55.070> he<00:05:55.160> has<00:05:55.340> and<00:05:55.670> the<00:05:55.880> ability<00:05:56.210> to

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
his stuns that he has and the ability to

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.180 
his stuns that he has and the ability to
keep<00:05:56.480> people<00:05:56.600> down<00:05:56.870> so<00:05:57.080> that's<00:05:57.200> my<00:05:57.470> choice<00:05:57.680> if

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
keep people down so that's my choice if

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.910 
keep people down so that's my choice if
you<00:05:58.400> don't<00:05:58.640> have<00:05:58.820> a<00:05:58.850> water<00:05:59.120> or<00:05:59.240> an<00:05:59.540> air

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
you don't have a water or an air

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.140 
you don't have a water or an air

those<00:06:02.420> two<00:06:03.130> simply<00:06:04.130> because<00:06:04.400> those<00:06:04.580> are

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
those two simply because those are

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.550 
those two simply because those are
really<00:06:04.970> strong<00:06:05.360> pads<00:06:05.690> especially<00:06:06.200> that<00:06:06.320> air
