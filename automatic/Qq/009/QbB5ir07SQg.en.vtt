00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the reason I didn't was because I just I

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.930 
the reason I didn't was because I just I
don't<00:00:13.769> know<00:00:14.040> how<00:00:14.190> much<00:00:14.340> time<00:00:14.580> I'm<00:00:14.790> actually

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
because I just didn't think it would be

because I just didn't think it would be
like<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.870> very<00:00:46.079> good<00:00:46.289> video<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.710> upload<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.910> it's

easier<00:03:43.230> after<00:03:44.099> a<00:03:44.129> while<00:03:44.370> like<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.030> still<00:03:45.690> now

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
easier after a while like I still now

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.780

feel more confident in English than I do

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.110 
feel more confident in English than I do
in<00:03:48.680> German<00:03:49.680> because<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.220> never<00:03:50.549> really<00:03:50.730> had

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
in German because I never really had

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.539 
in German because I never really had
schooling<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:51.840> German<00:03:52.169> like<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.440> think<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.400> went

to like first and second grade in
Germany<00:03:55.379> so<00:03:56.159> I<00:03:56.639> didn't<00:03:56.879> really<00:03:57.060> learn<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.599> a

up there pretty much went to high school
there<00:04:07.889> and<00:04:07.919> everything<00:04:08.930> but<00:04:09.930> yeah<00:04:10.229> just<00:04:10.470> that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
there and everything but yeah just that

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.530 
there and everything but yeah just that
we<00:04:11.160> had<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.340> speak<00:04:11.490> German<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.060> stuff<00:04:12.300> with

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
we had to speak German and stuff with

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.720 
we had to speak German and stuff with
our<00:04:12.570> parents<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.470> so<00:04:13.830> that's<00:04:14.040> how<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.310> kept

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
our parents and so that's how we kept

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.080 
our parents and so that's how we kept
the<00:04:14.850> language<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:16.100> yeah<00:04:17.100> that's<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.850> think

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
the language so yeah that's I think

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.539 
the language so yeah that's I think
that's<00:04:18.299> really<00:04:18.510> important<00:04:18.989> because<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:20.430> know

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
that's really important because you know

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.580 
that's really important because you know
we<00:04:20.670> had<00:04:20.820> some<00:04:21.030> friends<00:04:21.299> there<00:04:21.600> who<00:04:21.870> who<00:04:22.440> were

originally<00:04:23.160> from<00:04:23.280> Germany<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.820> their<00:04:23.970> kids

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.330 
originally from Germany and their kids
were<00:04:24.870> older<00:04:25.200> than<00:04:25.380> us<00:04:25.500> when<00:04:25.710> they<00:04:25.830> came<00:04:26.070> to

Canada and they totally lost the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.990 
Canada and they totally lost the
language<00:04:28.440> because<00:04:28.800> they<00:04:29.040> weren't<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.970> know

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
language because they weren't you know

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.790

their<00:04:30.180> parents<00:04:30.390> didn't<00:04:30.900> make<00:04:31.350> them<00:04:31.590> speak

their parents didn't make them speak
German<00:04:32.130> at<00:04:32.250> home<00:04:32.430> work<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:33.420> know<00:04:33.540> whatever

language<00:04:34.500> you're<00:04:34.920> speaking<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.400> think<00:04:35.490> it's

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
language you're speaking I think it's

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.870 
language you're speaking I think it's
just<00:04:35.820> important<00:04:36.330> that<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:37.590> try<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.130> like

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
just important that you you try and like

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.940 
just important that you you try and like
if<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.720> you<00:04:39.900> do<00:04:40.080> have<00:04:40.320> that<00:04:40.350> advantage

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
if you if you do have that advantage

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.100 
if you if you do have that advantage
that<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:41.460> try<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:41.880> keep<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.780> language

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
that you try and keep the language

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.870 
that you try and keep the language
somehow<00:04:43.410> so<00:04:43.980> like<00:04:44.760> I<00:04:44.940> am<00:04:45.090> bilingual<00:04:45.510> now<00:04:46.170> and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
somehow so like I am bilingual now and

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.150 
somehow so like I am bilingual now and
so<00:04:47.880> you<00:04:48.000> go<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.240> French<00:04:48.480> too<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:49.710> really
