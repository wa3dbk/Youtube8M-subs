so<00:00:00.359> one<00:00:00.599> of<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.780> most<00:00:00.960> important<00:00:01.410> things<00:00:01.620> you

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
so one of the most important things you

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.889 
so one of the most important things you
need<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:02.070> do<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.429> make<00:00:02.580> your<00:00:02.730> multi-rotor<00:00:03.419> fly

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
need to do to make your multi-rotor fly

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.340 
need to do to make your multi-rotor fly
right<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:05.339> get<00:00:05.490> smooth<00:00:05.940> jello<00:00:06.480> free<00:00:06.960> video

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
right and to get smooth jello free video

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.919 
right and to get smooth jello free video
is<00:00:08.300> to<00:00:09.300> balance<00:00:09.599> your<00:00:10.019> props<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:11.719> this<00:00:12.719> is

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
is to balance your props and this is

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.129 
is to balance your props and this is
much<00:00:13.410> more<00:00:13.620> critical<00:00:13.920> than<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:15.450> do<00:00:15.630> off<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.109> a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
much more critical than to do off for a

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.830 
much more critical than to do off for a
multi<00:00:16.529> rotor<00:00:16.770> than<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> for<00:00:18.000> an<00:00:18.240> airplane

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
multi rotor than it is for an airplane

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290 
multi rotor than it is for an airplane
because<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:20.279> only<00:00:20.310> do<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.119> balance

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
because not only do you have to balance

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.500 
because not only do you have to balance
the<00:00:21.630> blades<00:00:22.189> but<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.460> multi<00:00:23.789> rotor<00:00:24.000> use<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the blades but for multi rotor use you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.070 
the blades but for multi rotor use you
also<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.170> balance<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.830> hub

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.450 

a<00:00:29.170> couple<00:00:30.039> of<00:00:30.130> tools<00:00:30.280> you'll<00:00:30.610> need<00:00:31.950> one<00:00:32.950> is<00:00:33.250> a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
a couple of tools you'll need one is a

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.800 
a couple of tools you'll need one is a
propeller<00:00:33.970> balancer

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
propeller balancer

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.160 
propeller balancer
I<00:00:34.840> like<00:00:35.380> the<00:00:35.530> Dubrow

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.510 

I<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:39.399> use<00:00:39.579> regular<00:00:39.879> scotch<00:00:40.570> tape

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.420 

to<00:00:44.060> balance<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.630> hub<00:00:44.810> you'll<00:00:45.110> need<00:00:45.320> some<00:00:45.590> CA<00:00:45.920> I

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
to balance the hub you'll need some CA I

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.930 
to balance the hub you'll need some CA I
use<00:00:46.880> extra<00:00:47.480> thick<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.670> some<00:00:49.670> CA<00:00:49.970> accelerator

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.000 

so<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:56.060> just<00:00:56.300> mount<00:00:56.990> the<00:00:57.200> prop<00:00:57.440> on<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.770> prop

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
so you just mount the prop on the prop

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.800 
so you just mount the prop on the prop
balancer<00:00:58.640> and<00:01:00.610> check<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.790> side<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.240> side<00:01:02.480> to

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
balancer and check the side to side to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.590 
balancer and check the side to side to
see<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.739> blade<00:01:03.950> balance<00:01:04.460> we're<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.360> little

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
see the blade balance we're a little

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.080 
see the blade balance we're a little
heavy<00:01:05.870> on<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.170> side<00:01:08.050> flip<00:01:09.050> it<00:01:09.170> over<00:01:12.640> yep<00:01:13.640> this

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
heavy on this side flip it over yep this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:26.380 
heavy on this side flip it over yep this
is<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.330> heavy<00:01:14.630> side<00:01:22.330> so<00:01:23.330> we<00:01:23.810> start<00:01:24.140> like<00:01:25.390> put

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
is the heavy side so we start like put

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.730 
is the heavy side so we start like put
the<00:01:26.540> piece<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.899> tape<00:01:27.110> on<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.560> lighter<00:01:27.830> side

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
the piece of tape on the lighter side

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.710 
the piece of tape on the lighter side
and<00:01:30.740> I<00:01:30.860> just<00:01:31.130> put<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:31.460> on<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:31.729> back<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:32.630> the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
and I just put it on the back of the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.219 
and I just put it on the back of the
blade<00:01:36.850> some<00:01:37.850> people<00:01:38.119> like<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.300> fold<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:38.930> over

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
blade some people like to fold it over

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:50.440 
blade some people like to fold it over
the<00:01:39.380> leading<00:01:39.740> edge<00:01:49.000> well<00:01:50.000> what<00:01:50.180> do<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.330> know

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
the leading edge well what do you know

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.170 
the leading edge well what do you know
first<00:01:51.229> try

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.219 

sometimes<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:56.360> takes<00:01:56.509> more<00:01:57.350> or<00:01:57.410> less<00:01:57.770> tape

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
sometimes it takes more or less tape

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.480 
sometimes it takes more or less tape
maybe<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.380> have<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.619> do<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.770> couple<00:02:01.010> of<00:02:01.280> layers

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
maybe you have to do a couple of layers

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.969 
maybe you have to do a couple of layers
but<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.780> trick<00:02:03.080> is<00:02:03.260> just<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.680> get<00:02:03.799> it<00:02:03.860> to

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
but the trick is just to get it to

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.910 
but the trick is just to get it to
balance<00:02:04.220> nicely<00:02:04.880> like<00:02:05.090> this

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.070 

now<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> blades<00:02:11.700> are<00:02:11.940> balanced<00:02:12.450> we'll

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
now that the blades are balanced we'll

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.670 
now that the blades are balanced we'll
move<00:02:13.260> ahead<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.970> balance<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.150> hub<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.750> do

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
move ahead and balance the hub to do

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.470 
move ahead and balance the hub to do
this<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.069> put<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.430> prop<00:02:18.090> upright<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.880> it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
this you put the prop upright and it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:31.640 
this you put the prop upright and it
falls<00:02:22.790> put<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.910> other<00:02:24.060> side<00:02:24.330> upright<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.500> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
falls put the other side upright so the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.230 
falls put the other side upright so the
top<00:02:32.610> side<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:34.140> light<00:02:34.380> side<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.820> bottom

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
top side is the light side the bottom

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.500 
top side is the light side the bottom
side<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.810> heavy<00:02:37.020> side<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:42.330> light

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
side is the heavy side so on the light

00:02:42.510 --> 00:03:05.540 
side is the heavy side so on the light
side<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.610> put<00:02:44.850> some<00:02:44.880> see<00:02:45.360> a<00:03:04.550> quick

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
side we just put some see a quick

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:16.190 
side we just put some see a quick
accelerator<00:03:09.560> would<00:03:10.560> try<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.010> again<00:03:15.200> look

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
accelerator would try it again look

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.800 
accelerator would try it again look
still<00:03:17.070> looks<00:03:17.340> light<00:03:17.640> on<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:18.030> side<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:21.720> is

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
still looks light on that side this is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.750 
still looks light on that side this is
sort<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.290> trial<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.829> error<00:03:22.980> process<00:03:23.340> you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
sort of a trial and error process you

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.890 
sort of a trial and error process you
just<00:03:23.790> keep<00:03:24.209> going<00:03:24.690> until<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:26.750> try<00:03:27.750> and

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
just keep going until you get it try and

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.199 
just keep going until you get it try and
keep<00:03:28.019> your<00:03:28.230> CA<00:03:28.560> on<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.190> side

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.140 

so<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:33.049> doesn't<00:03:33.379> interfere<00:03:33.439> with<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.700> seating

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
so it doesn't interfere with the seating

00:03:35.150 --> 00:04:07.990 
so it doesn't interfere with the seating
of<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.450> prop<00:03:35.719> a<00:03:45.189> little<00:03:46.189> more<00:04:06.939> you<00:04:07.939> know

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
of the prop a little more you know

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.879 
of the prop a little more you know
you're<00:04:08.269> making<00:04:08.389> headway<00:04:08.750> when<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:09.200> slows<00:04:09.829> down

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
you're making headway when it slows down

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:24.060 
you're making headway when it slows down
and<00:04:10.639> it's<00:04:10.849> fall

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.890 

and<00:04:25.070> it's<00:04:25.280> best<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.700> do<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.150> little<00:04:26.330> bit<00:04:26.630> at<00:04:26.810> a

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
and it's best to do it a little bit at a

00:04:26.900 --> 00:05:18.420 
and it's best to do it a little bit at a
time

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:06:03.210 

we're<00:05:19.430> almost<00:05:19.669> there

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:29.690 

so<00:06:04.220> it<00:06:04.370> looks<00:06:04.580> like<00:06:04.760> that's<00:06:04.940> it

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.050 

sometimes<00:06:30.700> you<00:06:30.880> have<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.120> go<00:06:31.270> back<00:06:31.570> and

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.820 

balance<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.270> blades<00:06:37.630> again<00:06:38.140> once<00:06:38.440> you've<00:06:38.590> got

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
balance the blades again once you've got

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.780 
balance the blades again once you've got
the<00:06:39.760> hub<00:06:40.060> balanced<00:06:42.180> just<00:06:43.180> a<00:06:43.420> little<00:06:43.720> bit<00:06:44.790> so

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
the hub balanced just a little bit so

00:06:45.790 --> 00:07:00.690 
the hub balanced just a little bit so
put<00:06:46.270> a<00:06:46.300> piece<00:06:46.510> of<00:06:46.660> tape<00:06:46.900> on<00:06:47.080> the<00:06:47.140> back<00:06:59.700> and

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
put a piece of tape on the back and

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.080 
put a piece of tape on the back and
that's<00:07:01.360> a<00:07:01.570> nicely<00:07:01.990> balanced<00:07:02.670> jello<00:07:03.670> free

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:04.090 
that's a nicely balanced jello free

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.630 
that's a nicely balanced jello free
propeller<00:07:07.200> should<00:07:08.200> stay<00:07:08.740> just<00:07:09.340> about

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:09.640 
propeller should stay just about

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.990 
propeller should stay just about
wherever<00:07:10.180> you<00:07:10.540> put<00:07:10.930> it
