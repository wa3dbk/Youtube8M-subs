synergy very nice I really like both of
these<00:03:12.150> cards<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.599> think<00:03:12.780> private<00:03:12.930> fusion<00:03:13.380> will

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
these cards I think private fusion will

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.199 
these cards I think private fusion will
be<00:03:13.590> played<00:03:13.769> probably<00:03:13.950> at<00:03:14.130> two<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.489> three<00:03:14.760> at

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
be played probably at two or three at

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.509 
be played probably at two or three at
least<00:03:15.420> two<00:03:15.720> definitely<00:03:16.260> faux<00:03:16.709> fur<00:03:16.890> factory<00:03:17.130> I

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
least two definitely faux fur factory I

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.580 
least two definitely faux fur factory I
think<00:03:17.910> will<00:03:18.239> replace<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.470> other

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
think will replace the the other

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.890 
think will replace the the other
continuous<00:03:20.489> one<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.000> we<00:03:21.090> have<00:03:21.239> now<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.480> can't

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
continuous one that we have now I can't

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.630 
continuous one that we have now I can't
men<00:03:22.019> what<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.320> but<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.620> awful<00:03:22.980> private

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
card Pfeiffer fusion is a brilliant part

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.099 
card Pfeiffer fusion is a brilliant part
for<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.180> deck<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.569> would<00:03:27.630> have<00:03:27.780> been<00:03:27.870> nice<00:03:28.079> if

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
for the deck it would have been nice if

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.930 
for the deck it would have been nice if
it<00:03:28.350> was<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.650> copy<00:03:28.859> optional<00:03:29.519> fusion

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
it was just a copy optional fusion

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.870 
it was just a copy optional fusion
because<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:31.140> think<00:03:31.560> that's<00:03:32.190> what<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.489> kind<00:03:32.700> of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
because I think that's what it kind of

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.759 
because I think that's what it kind of
needed<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.720> don't<00:03:33.930> really<00:03:34.200> need<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.500> put<00:03:34.650> the

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
needed you don't really need to put the

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.559 
needed you don't really need to put the
same<00:03:34.920> restrictions<00:03:35.489> on<00:03:35.700> because<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.269> this

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
same restrictions on because this this

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.680 
same restrictions on because this this
this<00:03:37.019> is<00:03:37.250> not<00:03:38.250> exactly<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:39.030> most<00:03:39.150> broken<00:03:39.480> of

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
this is not exactly the most broken of

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.289 
this is not exactly the most broken of
decks<00:03:39.930> like<00:03:40.230> shuttles<00:03:40.650> were<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.579> kind<00:03:42.209> of

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
decks like shuttles were and kind of

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.090 
decks like shuttles were and kind of
maybe<00:03:42.510> still<00:03:42.870> are<00:03:43.019> but<00:03:43.230> that's<00:03:43.530> another<00:03:43.799> video

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
maybe still are but that's another video

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
maybe still are but that's another video
for<00:03:44.250> another<00:03:44.430> time<00:03:44.670> being<00:03:45.150> able<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:45.540> fusion

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
for another time being able to fusion

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.970 
for another time being able to fusion
summon<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:47.489> much<00:03:48.030> quicker<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.840> imperative<00:03:49.799> for

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
summon so much quicker is imperative for

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.699 
summon so much quicker is imperative for
this<00:03:50.310> deck<00:03:50.579> we<00:03:51.540> all<00:03:51.690> knew<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.350> when<00:03:52.560> the
