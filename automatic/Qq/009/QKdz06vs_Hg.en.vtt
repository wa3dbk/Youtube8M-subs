00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
the the motor skills of plucking and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.830 
the the motor skills of plucking and
fretting<00:02:48.849> strings<00:02:49.209> because<00:02:49.359> as<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.599> can<00:02:49.720> see

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
fretting strings because as you can see

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.690 
fretting strings because as you can see
the<00:02:49.959> guitar<00:02:50.230> actually<00:02:50.680> has<00:02:50.859> strings<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.459> can

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
the guitar actually has strings that can

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.509 
the guitar actually has strings that can
be<00:02:51.879> plucked<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.590> fretted<00:02:53.590> which<00:02:54.280> is

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
be plucked and fretted which is

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.250 
be plucked and fretted which is
something<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:55.090> no<00:02:55.450> other<00:02:55.480> guitar<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.109> this

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
something that no other guitar of this

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.539 
something that no other guitar of this
while<00:02:56.440> there<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.680> no<00:02:56.799> other<00:02:56.859> guitar<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.340> kind

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
while there is no other guitar this kind

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.440 
while there is no other guitar this kind
so<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.730> guess<00:02:57.909> there's<00:02:58.060> nothing<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.329> can

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
so I guess there's nothing you can

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.289 
so I guess there's nothing you can
really<00:02:58.480> compare<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.319> but<00:03:00.299> definitely
