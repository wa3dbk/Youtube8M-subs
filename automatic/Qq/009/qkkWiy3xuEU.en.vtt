everything<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.360> my<00:00:57.510> students<00:00:58.020> make<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
everything I have my students make a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
everything I have my students make a
little<00:00:58.530> gridded<00:00:59.190> piece<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.699> aluminum<00:01:00.210> like

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
little gridded piece of aluminum like

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.960 
little gridded piece of aluminum like
this<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.770> use<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.190> L<00:01:02.969> square<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
this and I just use my L square and a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
this and I just use my L square and a
sharpie<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.439> make<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> grid<00:01:07.970> that's

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
sharpie and make a grid that's

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.010 
sharpie and make a grid that's
approximately<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> size<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.720> head<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
approximately the size of the head of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.640 
approximately the size of the head of
the<00:01:13.049> stamp<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.350> across

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the stamp so that you can just go across

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
the stamp so that you can just go across
and<00:01:17.840> basically<00:01:18.840> position<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:20.420> beard

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
designs this is having gridlines is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.310 
designs this is having gridlines is
critically<00:01:24.570> important<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.049> you're<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.229> to

the metal you want them on a straight
line<00:01:32.450> for<00:01:34.340> stamping<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
line for stamping you want to use a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.870 
line for stamping you want to use a
kneeled<00:01:36.869> metal<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.560> soft<00:01:38.159> metal<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.850> copper

kneeled metal or soft metal like copper

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.380 
kneeled metal or soft metal like copper
or<00:01:39.450> aluminum<00:01:39.990> brass<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.340> fight<00:01:41.729> back

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
or aluminum brass will fight back

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.530 
or aluminum brass will fight back
you'll<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.840> maybe<00:01:43.380> one<00:01:44.060> one<00:01:45.060> round<00:01:45.390> of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you'll get maybe one one round of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240 
you'll get maybe one one round of
stamping<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.649> it'll<00:01:46.979> start

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
stamping out of it and then it'll start

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
stamping out of it and then it'll start
to<00:01:47.340> buckle<00:01:47.640> or<00:01:48.030> curve<00:01:48.420> or<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.960> hard<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.439> stamp

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
to buckle or curve or be hard to stamp

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.830 
to buckle or curve or be hard to stamp
and<00:01:49.979> you'll<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.399> anneal<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.689> is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and you'll have to anneal so this is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.940 
and you'll have to anneal so this is
aluminum<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.960> want<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.229> keep<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:55.560> stamp

vertical and strike it once with the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.749 
vertical and strike it once with the
hammer<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.430> stand

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
hammer so to do this I'm going to stand

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.330 
hammer so to do this I'm going to stand
up<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.119> put<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.540> my<00:02:03.659> safety<00:02:03.869> glasses<00:02:05.570> and

you're<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.539> position<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.170> verify<00:02:11.009> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you're going to position and verify that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.190 
you're going to position and verify that
your<00:02:11.370> stamp<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.180> place

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that it once check that you got a good

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.050 
that it once check that you got a good
impression<00:02:16.250> then<00:02:17.250> move<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.940> next
