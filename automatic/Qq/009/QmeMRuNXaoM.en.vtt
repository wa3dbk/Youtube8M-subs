 retrospective of all these years under 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.440
 the iv street fighter license and 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.239
 especially our top 3 infinities 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:53.650
 possible in the game and all versions 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:55.030
 confused and number 3 at the time when he 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.530
 was still considered terror 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.239
 console tournaments then halls 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.129
 Japanese arcade during the release of 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.080
 super street fighter iv is long 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.610
 to have an infinity that was stopped 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.500
 during an update from June 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:12.580
 2010 which added at the same time 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.830
 tournament mode number 2 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.300
 we are far here from infinity the most 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.729
 complicated of the earth to realize and 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.289
 yet capcom has made it infinitely nicknamed 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.000
 the death button as his name 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:29.190
 the indicated one button is enough for 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.210
 kill see this by yourself number one 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.830
 discovered in the first version of 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.660
 street fighter iv is always present 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.460
 today at bell and his infinite of 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.140
 blow of surgical savage is certainly 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.210
 become more complicated over time 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.189
 achieve but still enjoyable when 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.479
 this one is placed by a human or a 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.479
 bot as in this video 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:02:01.100
 yes added the radio 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.390
 three sailboats and time 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.859
 January 31, 2015 and the date to remember 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.939
 indeed it is through sony that 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.489
 we learned that four like 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.200
 will occupy the tap and game show 2015 the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.879
 stage for a duration of one hour at 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.650
 program the presentation of his future 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.389
 games but also a session of 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.519
 unpublished demonstration around his 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.900
 next street fighter 5 and for that 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.670
 the publisher appealed to ego and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.290
 gamer be for an exhibition on the game 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.659
 to be held on the fourth day 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.919
 of living room it is likely that 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.450
 the title is different from what we 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.669
 had seen during the capcom finals 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.230
 pro tour but to compare that it we 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:53.629
 will have to wait a few more 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.909
 days and 2.2 hoped that this event 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:59.199
