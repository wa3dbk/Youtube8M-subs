 well the pandoro is advanced a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 Christmas bag and at the time of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.119

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.279
 video with the recipe I made myself 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 to search when I see it as a category 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.570
 click here to access the recipe 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.279
 classic credit what you do 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.780
 I propose today is a tiramisu recipe 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.420
 particular also because it is not me 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.090
 I will do the video object should I do 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 often cite the fact namely rice 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.190
 with a variation the use of cream 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.350
 mounted 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.600
 so i hope you will like it i like it 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.960
 a lot would be kangoo tiramisu by now 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.559
 and now nothing has come to a head in 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.600
 ingredient of need 500 grams of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.949
 mascarpone 125 g of sugar plus 6 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:08.460
 spoons to play the cream 500 ml of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:14.760
 fresh cream for whipping coffee parties i 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.530
 egg yolks and 5 more balls when in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.799
 this case I realize the elasticity 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.580
 why are you politini a bit hungry on 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:28.380
 what closed playing together the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.799
 tiramisu and recycle the pan or blackmail it 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.799
 recycling 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.090
 because if we go to vote and vote 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.740
 first the egg whites because you can 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.050
 go quietly to montali shift 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.150
 because the compound that the egg whites 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.150
 let's say that the neutral even if dirty 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.130
 a little mind the two genes also the desire 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.960
 well 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.430
 after counting them 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:02.250
 but we put them in the fridge while we do 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:08.520
 the rest now take the horns there 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.770
 put the sugar and whip it all together 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.020
 until the mixture does not cut 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:20.810
 it was invaded after having assembled the yolks 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:29.580
 with the sugar take the mascarpone 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 join the yolks and go to the mother from 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.010
 always manipulate with electric whips 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.989
 now take the ball put it not 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.030
 it will continue high enough because otherwise 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:03:00.000
 this knows everything and you put 6 tablespoons 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:03:01.710
 of sugar and 6 and now let's go to 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.200
 whip the cream 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:13.160
 ok well after replacing the cream 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.160
 add to the mixture of egg yolks and mascarpone 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:25.350
 and mix everything from the councilor e 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.120
 then add the egg whites a little at a time from the 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.630
 low upwards so as not to make them 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.090
 unmount and here is the cream at 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.660
 mascarpone with a wand now 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.140
 take the league as usual 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.230
 hit of the fairies but they get us in 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.230
 myself 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.430
 and soiled her 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:07.070
 then you see the pandoro 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.970
 I arrived in slices not too thick 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.970
 not even the last fight 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.840
 take the slice of wet pandoro e 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.960
 slightly slightly breaking 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.670
 the son and then put him here then 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.590
 now let's go create it 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.640
 however, slices should only be wetted by one 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.850
 side because the panel is measured a lot 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.710
 more so than sauro iardo 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.230
 quickly once and only once 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.480
 side and put it deviates as you have seen 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.480
 do now we are the cream 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.219
 and now another state 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.300
 to merge 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.229
 10 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.219
 be nice 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:32.430
 django and now let's do another story 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.140
 so now I haven't told you that if you 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.850
 you want every layer of cream you can 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.320
 put a layer of cocoa 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.320
 I see the end 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.229
 ok 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:57.509
 here is the tiramisu with the ball 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.099
 I hope centralized liked presence 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.860
 all my writings because where you are 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:05.159
 increasing I invite you to Trento 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.849
 be useful and see you there 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.639
 recipe personality to I have to hole all the 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.229
 Monday so at least you know 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.710
 in short, when to go and watch gods 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:19.189
 video 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.189
 if you are interested in a big kiss hello 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:24.719
 then as you can see from the picture with these 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.460
 doses 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:28.560
 two trays came to me so if you 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.889
 you only want to make one half the doses 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.889
 of everything and then I wanted to tell you that if 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.779
 you want to avoid getting too wet 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.759
 Pandoro saw that it absorbs much more 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:41.279
 of ladyfingers 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.979
 put the slices directly into the 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:46.400
 pan and peculato to wet them with a 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.400
 spoon
