for and you can see my class here and I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
for and you can see my class here and I
got<00:00:29.640> an<00:00:29.730> elite<00:00:29.939> variant<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.199> day<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
got an elite variant of it the day of

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740

the<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:32.430> actually<00:00:32.759> released<00:00:33.090> Varian's<00:00:33.570> did

the they actually released Varian's did
you<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.130> pretty<00:00:35.250> cool<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you get so that was pretty cool and I

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.650 
you get so that was pretty cool and I
thought<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.880> would<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.030> make<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.450> video

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
thought I would just make a little video

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.319 
thought I would just make a little video
on<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.320> don't<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:37.860> enjoy<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:39.030> weapon

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
on it I don't really enjoy this weapon

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.709 
on it I don't really enjoy this weapon

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
very much but you know you might and as

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
very much but you know you might and as
you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> gameplay<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:44.489> you've

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you can see in the gameplay if you've

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.310 
you can see in the gameplay if you've
seen<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> iron<00:00:45.239> sights<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.280> normal<00:00:47.280> 84

with the elite variant here it is a lot

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.709

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
different right there you can see it's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.490 
different right there you can see it's
kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.320> Half<00:00:55.500> Dome<00:00:55.530> thing<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.140> it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
kind of like a Half Dome thing and it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.290 
kind of like a Half Dome thing and it's
just<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.770> don't<00:00:58.859> really<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.820> personally

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300

like<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.119> said<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> make<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.750> video

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
like I said I'm going to make this video

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.550 
like I said I'm going to make this video
just<00:01:26.610> showing<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.330> if<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.960> haven't<00:01:28.200> seen<00:01:28.350> any

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
just showing you if you haven't seen any

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.390 
just showing you if you haven't seen any
elite<00:01:28.799> variants<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.390> them<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
elite variants this is one of them and

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.800 
elite variants this is one of them and
you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.520> found<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> time<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> kill

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you know I found that the time to kill

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.140 
you know I found that the time to kill
with<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.680> slow<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.640> takes<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.000> lot

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
with it is very slow and it takes a lot

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.310 
with it is very slow and it takes a lot
of<00:01:36.180> hit<00:01:36.390> markers<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.790> it's<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.329> don't

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
of hit markers and it's just I don't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.020 
of hit markers and it's just I don't
know<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> seems<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.400> needs<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.790> buffed

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
know it seems like it needs to be buffed

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
know it seems like it needs to be buffed
a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.750> mean<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.290> probably<00:01:43.439> won't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
a little bit I mean they probably won't

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.020 
a little bit I mean they probably won't
because<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.610> want<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.790> make<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
because they don't want to make it

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.560 
because they don't want to make it
overpowered<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:47.490> again<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.210> needs<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
overpowered but then again it needs a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
overpowered but then again it needs a
little<00:01:48.750> something<00:01:49.020> maybe<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.130> one

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
little something maybe like just up one

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
little something maybe like just up one
damage<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:52.140> pretty<00:01:52.439> much<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.590> that's<00:01:52.920> all

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
damage that's pretty much it that's all

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.969 
damage that's pretty much it that's all
I<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.189> need<00:01:53.540> but<00:01:54.619> this<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
I really need but this is just going to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.310 
I really need but this is just going to
be<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.130> short<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.610> video<00:01:57.140> I'll<00:01:58.140> just

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
be a short little video I'll just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770 
be a short little video I'll just
explaining<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.000> does<00:02:00.210> how<00:02:00.719> it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
explaining like what it does how it
