00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.210
 old Portuguese with who already has

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.250
 until today it competes and good 20 are not many 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.500

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.130
 I have and the original petition games that I 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.050
 have 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.960
 when I was able to find the games 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.430
 regional he put my little heart 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 we know that the great success that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
 are in Brazil ask the coast author of the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
 game was due to piracy, right? 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.110
 it stands out for the ease of you 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.390
 to hack a game right? 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 but nothing like you could have some 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.180
 original games and here are some 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.860
 and I'm going to show you a little 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.809
 soon as is the case of each one of them 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 It is not the first time that dispenses 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.460
 nigga tourism presentations and this one 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.789
 it's satisfying playstation 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.070
 it's a cd only in that big box that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.010
 you have beautiful have some manuals 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.809
 she only has an engraving with a manual as well 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.369
 I will not take it because I 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.990
 I want to make a video very fast, I'm going 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.229
 comment with you here right? 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.140
 the other side has another manual and if the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.880
 Such a good person that you do not do 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.420
 day there is little shame looks like I want 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.100
 but not at the time we 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.920
 interesting information a lot 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.960
 lots of content in the game box right? 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 and today we pay a fortune in gold 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.450
 or it is a short course of shame 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.460
 but great reduced cost reduction 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.900
 cost to them does not represent an increase 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.720
 of the price instead of it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.159
 A little shame, people are the record for 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.380
 who has never seen original games of 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.590
 playstation are so black beers 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.470
 almost new skin perfect little cute 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.210
 here o big tourism game I think the game 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.630
 of the playstation was the great 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.100
 risk for sure right? 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.659
 second here it looks only as classic as 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.369
 This is what people do the second time because 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.750
 It's the person who has never played better. 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.260
 playstation with the cast and who never 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.840
 played a lot of fucking in two teams 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.880
 already made tremendous success until today he 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.470
 this game he is known and loved 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.290
 acclaimed by the fans 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.970
 It's a shame the deep medal franchise has 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.280
 worn out over time and have been 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.980
 Abandoned by the producer of 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.750
 game is a pity even because it's a game 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.000
 and opened the doors of 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.770
 video games like that for that style of play 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.440
 to get there he opened the doors if 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.660
 popularized in a fantastic game after 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.060
 had the sequence of a form a step 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.680
 on playstation plus after several 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.930
 playstation 2 versions 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.200
 there was arriving in the generation playstation 3 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.020
 xbox 360 and unfortunately it fell like this 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.730
 grief right in limbo right is a shame 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.470
 fantastic series the fantastic game 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.680
 maicon life of many people same agent 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:53.310
 spectacular game even here in the capital 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.170
 an engraving the disc is a very good game 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.510
 same and is very fond of 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.400
 my collection of crichton né 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.150
 then I go after some classics 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.770
 how techno crisis on the workers right? 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.410
 short games that marked the childhood only 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.870
 pick up the games I already played that I 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.489
 I know the good games that marked my 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.260
 fringe I'm not a collector is 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.239
 keep looking at everything that came out 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.920
 video game only what I really 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.290
 I like that I care in the console that I 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.390
 I collect for example 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.459
 that nuclear trike our face 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.959
 Too weird I met all the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.510
 pastors all secrets all 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.820
 stages of this game it a spectacular game 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.790
 a game that really struck me is 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.550
 a lot of people, the very cool helicopter 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.800
 electronic arts also looks at you 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.900
 review some of the game nobody remembers 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.890
 and the star is not 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.170
 fuck I played there's one more than this 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.810
 Here's how I say games I know 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.330
 however it was very cheap I got it 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.790
 together a package of games there I met 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.300
 to be in charge of both the best 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.100
 playstation 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.720
 the most interesting is a game in style 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.320
 tower defense né 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.610
 so that we're not even started the game 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.820
 Comes along with the package I can not 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.820
 complain 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:12.470
 I played a lot at the time and it 's not 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.990
 this does not have much here then the game 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.940
 which was not even marked in some way 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.000
 city propaganda said today that 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:32.870
 I also played a lot there arriving at Christmas. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:35.840
 of 98 plus 114 is what plus five 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.230
 I think he's not so 100% but she 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:48.590
 It is not broken off with just only 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:52.420
 find cool zinho here now think 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.420
 one of the three right bands that 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.690
 below also now have one of the 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.660
 most economical playstation series 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.240
 home of his time without always talking to him 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.400

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.170
 law on playstation never played in life 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.950
 losing one of the best series of 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.510
 adventure 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.190
 at that time many outside was a copy of 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.800
 Indian jones like this but I think all 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.590

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.900

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.590
