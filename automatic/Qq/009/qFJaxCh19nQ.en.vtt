00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the that's basically it and I let's turn

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.460 
the that's basically it and I let's turn
I'll<00:02:29.010> do<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.300> basically<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.050> pluck<00:02:31.320> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
I'll do it so basically you pluck the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:40.160 
I'll do it so basically you pluck the
string<00:02:37.130> that's<00:02:38.130> basically<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:39.870> quite

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
string that's basically it it's quite

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.750 
string that's basically it it's quite
simple<00:02:40.230> just<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> last<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.460> but<00:02:41.580> a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
simple just like the last one but a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.120 
simple just like the last one but a
little<00:02:42.120> bit<00:02:42.240> more<00:02:42.450> complex<00:02:42.990> like<00:02:43.410> with<00:02:43.650> extra

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
little bit more complex like with extra

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.000 
little bit more complex like with extra
steps<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:45.060> I'll<00:02:45.660> do<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.840> again<00:02:46.170> so

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
steps and that's it I'll do it again so

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:56.680 
steps and that's it I'll do it again so
cut<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.340> strain<00:02:53.360> that's<00:02:54.360> basically<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.990> and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
cut the strain that's basically it and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.660 
cut the strain that's basically it and
you<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.840> add<00:02:57.990> some<00:02:58.230> extra<00:02:58.530> stuff<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.340> like

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
you can add some extra stuff to it like

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.440 
you can add some extra stuff to it like
I<00:02:59.940> do<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.800> for<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.160> first<00:03:02.340> lesson<00:03:02.850> so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
I do so like for the first lesson so

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:20.690 
I do so like for the first lesson so
he'll<00:03:03.959> be<00:03:03.990> something<00:03:04.380> like<00:03:04.440> this

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.090 

and<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:22.180> that's<00:03:22.360> basically<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.590> for<00:03:23.740> a<00:03:23.950> time

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100
