on the fifth fret with my index finger

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.109 
on the fifth fret with my index finger
on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.359> B<00:01:12.539> string<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:14.759> E<00:01:14.789> string

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:26.529 

so<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:17.780> first<00:01:17.990> part<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:24.549> and<00:01:25.549> in<00:01:25.670> fact<00:01:25.939> these

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
so the first part is and in fact these

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.630 
so the first part is and in fact these
three<00:01:26.719> notes<00:01:28.600> they<00:01:29.600> make<00:01:29.990> up<00:01:30.200> an<00:01:30.439> a<00:01:31.280> major

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
three notes they make up an a major

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.120 
three notes they make up an a major
triad<00:01:32.770> these<00:01:33.770> first<00:01:34.159> four<00:01:34.490> notes<00:01:35.350> or<00:01:36.350> leading

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
triad these first four notes or leading

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.380 
triad these first four notes or leading
notes<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.819> that<00:01:38.030> note<00:01:38.539> here<00:01:39.909> which<00:01:40.909> is<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.299> the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
notes to that note here which is on the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.559 
notes to that note here which is on the
one<00:01:41.659> of<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.319> beat<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.789> is<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.539> E

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
one of the beat and this is on the E

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:50.949 
one of the beat and this is on the E
string<00:01:44.979> on<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.909> eighth<00:01:47.149> fret<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:49.130> note<00:01:49.159> C<00:01:49.959> so

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
string on the eighth fret the note C so

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:57.240 
string on the eighth fret the note C so
it<00:01:51.229> becomes<00:01:51.619> like<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:52.209> one<00:01:53.209> two<00:01:53.989> three

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.600

meaning that this note is on the one of

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.929 
meaning that this note is on the one of
the<00:02:01.700> beat<00:02:02.439> one<00:02:03.439> two<00:02:04.129> three<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:07.549> then<00:02:07.729> we'll<00:02:07.849> go

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
the beat one two three and then we'll go

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.380 
the beat one two three and then we'll go
back<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:09.769> fifth<00:02:10.009> fret<00:02:10.129> on<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.399> e-string

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.550 

there<00:02:14.769> switch<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> B<00:02:16.129> string<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
there switch to the B string on the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.949 
there switch to the B string on the
fifth<00:02:18.709> fret<00:02:18.940> now<00:02:19.940> up<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.299> 8th<00:02:20.450> fret<00:02:20.629> on<00:02:20.900> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:40.030 

so<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:29.550> we<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.560> far<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:39.330> next<00:02:39.630> part<00:02:39.840> is
