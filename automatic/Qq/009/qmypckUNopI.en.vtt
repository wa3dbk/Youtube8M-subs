i'm<00:00:02.610> going<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.850> guess<00:00:03.000> we<00:00:03.179> all<00:00:03.300> know<00:00:03.449> where

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
i'm going to guess we all know where

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.410 
i'm going to guess we all know where
this<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.840> going<00:00:04.200> at<00:00:04.470> this<00:00:04.650> point<00:00:08.030> this<00:00:09.030> will<00:00:09.269> be

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
this is going at this point this will be

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.320 
this is going at this point this will be
another<00:00:09.710> constitution<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.980> don't<00:00:11.940> know<00:00:12.120> which

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
another constitution I don't know which

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:31.009 
another constitution I don't know which
one<00:00:12.630> yet<00:00:29.449> probably<00:00:30.449> build<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.960> thing

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
one yet probably build this thing

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.430 
one yet probably build this thing
blindfold<00:00:31.859> at<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.250> point<00:00:33.860> but<00:00:36.440> everything

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
blindfold at this point but everything

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.490 
blindfold at this point but everything
I've<00:00:37.559> learned<00:00:37.590> down<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> last<00:00:38.370> two<00:00:39.890> plus

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
I've learned down the last two plus

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.630 
I've learned down the last two plus
everything<00:00:43.500> i'm<00:00:43.770> picking<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
everything i'm picking up from the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.229 
everything i'm picking up from the
forums<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.410> definitely<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.239> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
forums this one will definitely be the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:59.290 
forums this one will definitely be the
best<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.690> them<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.289> far

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:11.349 

you

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:53.020 

these<00:01:12.359> I<00:01:12.539> will<00:01:12.719> slice<00:01:13.020> off

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.749 

now<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.270> case<00:01:55.009> I'll<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.280> gluing<00:01:56.520> this

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
now in this case I'll be gluing this

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.669 
now in this case I'll be gluing this
side<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.890> actually<00:01:59.959> the<00:02:00.959> best<00:02:01.140> insights

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
side on actually the best insights

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.490 
side on actually the best insights
gained<00:02:02.069> do<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.030> side<00:02:03.299> first<00:02:03.630> I'm<00:02:04.289> going<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
gained do this side first I'm going to

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.429 
gained do this side first I'm going to
cut<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.709> little<00:02:04.920> piece<00:02:05.039> of<00:02:05.250> styrene<00:02:06.229> glue<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
cut a little piece of styrene glue that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.630 
cut a little piece of styrene glue that
to<00:02:08.280> either<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.700> side<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.269> other<00:02:10.340> then<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
to either one side or the other then the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.500 
to either one side or the other then the
seam<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:11.940> happens<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.870> all<00:02:13.230> these<00:02:13.440> kits<00:02:13.860> I

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
seam that happens on all these kits I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.390 
seam that happens on all these kits I
should<00:02:15.510> be<00:02:15.660> able<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.959> completely<00:02:16.379> minimize<00:02:17.010> by

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
should be able to completely minimize by

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.199 
should be able to completely minimize by
creating<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.940> false<00:02:18.209> back<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.640> I'll<00:02:20.760> glue<00:02:21.000> this

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
creating a false back so I'll glue this

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.119 
creating a false back so I'll glue this
one<00:02:21.420> down<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.640> then<00:02:23.790> theoretically<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.769> that

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
one down and then theoretically and that

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.770 
one down and then theoretically and that
makes<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.519> tough<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:29.000> was<00:02:30.000> thinking<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.510> bend

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
makes it tough I was thinking I can bend

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.100 
makes it tough I was thinking I can bend
it<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.079> of<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.319> way<00:02:31.470> however<00:02:32.750> don't<00:02:33.750> want<00:02:34.019> to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
it out of the way however don't want to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.520 
it out of the way however don't want to
bend<00:02:34.319> this<00:02:34.500> side<00:02:34.769> out<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> way<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:37.170> doing

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
bend this side out of the way but doing

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.770 
bend this side out of the way but doing
this<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:37.920> first<00:02:38.220> will<00:02:38.519> block<00:02:38.760> that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.360 

that'll<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> tough<00:02:46.770> call<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.980> I'll<00:02:50.040> get<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
that'll be a tough call so I'll get to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.400 
that'll be a tough call so I'll get to
that<00:02:50.400> when<00:02:50.640> i<00:02:50.700> get<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:57.120> these<00:02:57.410> i'll

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
that when i get to it as for these i'll

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.630 
that when i get to it as for these i'll
slap<00:02:58.709> them<00:02:58.890> together<00:02:59.250> real<00:02:59.550> quick<00:03:01.280> file<00:03:02.280> all

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
slap them together real quick file all

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.550 
slap them together real quick file all
this<00:03:02.880> stuff<00:03:03.180> off<00:03:03.420> which<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:03.989> see<00:03:04.200> i<00:03:04.230> think

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
this stuff off which you can see i think

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.500 
this stuff off which you can see i think
in<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.830> Republic<00:03:05.370> thread<00:03:08.180> don't<00:03:09.180> know<00:03:09.330> that

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
in the Republic thread don't know that

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.949 
in the Republic thread don't know that
there<00:03:09.690> will<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:09.810> any<00:03:10.050> backing<00:03:10.380> for<00:03:10.800> this<00:03:11.010> but

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.630 

maybe<00:03:15.959> I'll<00:03:16.200> try<00:03:16.410> an<00:03:16.530> experiment<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
maybe I'll try an experiment on the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.880 
maybe I'll try an experiment on the
angle<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.150> fix<00:03:18.420> not

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:36.790 

steeper<00:03:25.850> by<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> couple<00:03:26.480> degrees<00:03:35.800> definitely

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
steeper by a couple degrees definitely

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.400 
steeper by a couple degrees definitely
have<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.040> back<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.280> up<00:03:37.550> with<00:03:37.730> something<00:03:38.410> though

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
have to back it up with something though

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.290 
have to back it up with something though
maybe<00:03:39.740> not<00:03:39.890> for<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.370> time<00:03:40.670> but<00:03:40.940> next<00:03:40.970> time

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
maybe not for this time but next time

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.940 
maybe not for this time but next time
conversion<00:03:44.300> kits<00:03:44.750> out<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.290> make<00:03:45.470> this<00:03:45.650> more

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
conversion kits out to make this more

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.870 
conversion kits out to make this more
accurate<00:03:46.630> I'll<00:03:47.630> save<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:47.930> for<00:03:48.500> later<00:03:48.650> on

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.170 

that<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.830> next<00:03:55.130> time<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.400> see<00:03:55.580> this<00:03:55.790> it'll<00:03:56.120> be

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
that the next time you see this it'll be

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.020 
that the next time you see this it'll be
pretty<00:03:56.600> far<00:03:56.900> along
