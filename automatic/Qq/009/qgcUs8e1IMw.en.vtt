00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.513
Okay so, we tried to
make pizza last week.

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:03.935
Let me tell you the story.

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:10.286
[enchanting sting music]

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.210
We were going to make pizza and then
someone actually Googled a recipe

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.118
and it turned out it was going
to take three hours to rise.

00:00:16.298 --> 00:00:19.859
So, we ended up ordering pizza.
Whoo! A true teenage effort.

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:21.620
Since none of the girls
trusted any of the guys

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.722
not to eat all the pizza
on the way back

00:00:23.772 --> 00:00:27.107
Claudio didn't trust anyone with looking
after Hero apart from himself

00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:29.220
As though there were dragons
that were going to swoop down and

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.078
and carry her away like a
take-away pizza.

00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:32.834
and no one trusted Robbie
with any of it.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:33.954
The money or the pizza.

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.174
Most of us just ended up
walking down together.

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:37.629
Except Benedick.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.966
Pedro was coming late so
someone had to hold the fort.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.486
And Benedick drew the short straw.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:43.280
Yeah, so, Ben was there
which isn't super weird

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.587
because if he's not following
Claudio around like the plague,

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:48.414
he latches himself onto Pedro's side
and spouts bad jokes

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.978
Like a leaky tap. I'm surprised
that Hero and Claudio get

00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:53.263
any time together
just by themselves

00:00:53.463 --> 00:00:57.700
without Ben suddenly J.I.ing
cockblocking. BeneDick blocking.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.321
And when he first arrived
on the doorstep, bang on time,

00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:02.130
He was all like, "Beatrice!"

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.586
"How are you, it's so good
to see you! Here I am,"

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:08.386
"life of the party. Have you
missed me? Oh, hi Hero."

00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:11.747
What? Why would I miss him? Ew!

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:14.966
I mean I saw him last
period on Friday in English.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:15.970
Get a grip.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.197
And then I was all like,
"Hey Benedick,

00:01:18.297 --> 00:01:20.561
"did you get to bed last night
or are you still drunk from Friday?"

00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:23.000
And then he tried to make
a wisecrack about beds

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.282
but failed miserably.

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:26.692
Because he's Ben.
And he's not funny.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.324
So, I haven't seen or heard
from my cell phone in about a week.

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:32.924
Which is worrying, if
not to mention annoying.

00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:35.444
My phone just doesn't
usually go missing like this.

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:36.796
It does make me think
about how important

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:38.818
these little gadgets
are to our life.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.084
How lost we'd be without them.

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:43.334
I feel like Benedick would
agree with me there.

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:44.534
He's always on his phone.

00:01:44.844 --> 00:01:47.462
You know, that's probably
why he doesn't want a girlfriend.

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:50.417
He's already married to
the modern world. Ha ha!

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:53.713
Personally, I feel that face-to-face
communication is the best.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.565
All this technology does is
encourage people to say things

00:01:56.665 --> 00:01:58.130
in writing that they
don't have the balls

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.523
to say to people in real life.

00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:01.760
Quite frankly, if you can't
say it in person,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.900
then it shouldn't leave your head.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.541
I mean, I say what I
think all the time but

00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:06.741
that's because I'm mostly right.

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:09.290
I'm not saying, "Down
with technology."

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.834
It's just that when you're
arguing with someone

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.057
it's so much more fun

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.595
and so much more satisfying

00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:18.955
when it's in person.
I see the use and

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.691
the attraction of all
this technology

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.683
without having to be
caught up in the need

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:25.375
that is created by 
media and society.

00:02:25.752 --> 00:02:29.016
I mean, if your phone walks
off and disappears like

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:30.658
mine has, what are
you going to do?

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.754
You should never be so
reliant on anything.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:36.169
That you feel completely
lost when you don't have it.
