00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 Hi everyone, I just paula, I'm rafa. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.010
 agent of training and sea eating and today we 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.779
 Let's make a homemade tomato sauce is 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.789
 a joker's recipe always has in the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.070
 refrigerator or frozen portions 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.199
 Because it goes well with everything and we are 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.230
 teaching this recipe today because the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:42.210
 next we will use 12 tomatoes 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.140
 chopped two chopped onions three cloves 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.150
 chopped garlic 3 tablespoons 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.830
 chopped olives salpicinha as 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.750
 Single victories are optional that 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.480
 We like going quite place but 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 you only make the onion and the tomato 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
 garlic will work the same way 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.960
 including the parsley you can put 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.790
 Basil place I love to draw 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.790
 put the seasonings that you like 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.380
 way of preparation was very felt that the 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.979
 We will put everything in place pot 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.780
 the tomato the onion and the garlic all together 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.000
 You'll notice that I will not brail. 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.369
 nor the onion and the garlic with a little 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.770
 Oil, because it does not need me. 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.329
 and goes face-to-face and goes dancing percent 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.429
 same way you do not use the time 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.079
 the tomatoes loose enough water and that 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.789
 will cause the cpi the oil of 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.189
 cook that water and then I go 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.189
 put olive and lastly the parsley 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.440
 put everything in the pan 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.530
 then stir a little and put it on fire 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.810
 Do not put it on the fire. 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.400
 people will cover and let cook a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.410
 little wants to be and after a 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.660
 Time takes a look 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.660
 it's okay and now I'm going to put 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.660
 olive 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.840
 the lid and leave the fire here for me 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.840
 it's in the medium term 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.300
 Look when it's at this point for me already. 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:36.940
 Okay, I'll hang up then I'll spend about 30 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:38.860
 that stayed here after 30 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.650
 minutes and a stove they 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.480
 this way if you want and with more 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.220
 water to get a posture a little more 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.350
 liquid you can leave a little less 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.150
 time to not dry so much I did here 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.840
 two options is from here that gives you 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.210
 see the pieces and this one from here that I 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.690
 I used the blender for him to stay 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.960
 but without the pieces 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.630
 I particularly like this one more. 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.640
 which has onion tomato pieces or 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.470
 if you felt the small pieces 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.930
 but you can do both ways and 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.940
 People did not use it here. 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.370
 Likewise the same because it has onion 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.990
 has the option of natural seasonings during 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.930
 Eight years he's a little salty 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.080
 also the parsley the special download 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.970
 institution abolished the sun if you 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.600
 I wish you could just put it without problem 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.670
 none 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.530
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.570
 tomato sauce here at home success 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.490
 everybody likes it is a card up its sleeve 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.500
 you have in the refrigerator can make great 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.710
 quantities and leave it in the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.260
 refrigerator freeze in small portions and 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.420
 using as you go cooking in 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.100
 Look at several American options . 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.080
 eat a chicken without goals that he chicken 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.400
 shredded nothing plays this sauce 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.410
 Tomatoes look good 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.330
 in the egg is also good and that goes 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.430
 to win the best of everything I think more 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.470
 important is that this is a very 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.350
 healthier than industrialized 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.320
 do not even speak because right have 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.360
