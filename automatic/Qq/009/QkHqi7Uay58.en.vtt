where<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.750> thought<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.020> could<00:00:55.410> fly<00:00:55.649> like<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.219> bird

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.080 
and go off a cliff and it didn't end
well<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:02.070> doesn't<00:01:02.399> use<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> whole<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:02.969> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
well so it doesn't use a whole lot of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
well so it doesn't use a whole lot of
magic<00:01:03.559> doesn't<00:01:04.559> drain<00:01:04.739> him<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> whole<00:01:05.070> bunch
