getting<00:03:40.120> late<00:03:40.810> things<00:03:41.290> were<00:03:41.440> kind<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.709> slow

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
getting late things were kind of slow

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.740 
getting late things were kind of slow
had<00:03:44.290> one<00:03:44.530> bear<00:03:44.769> take<00:03:45.099> often<00:03:45.610> was<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.480> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
had one bear take often was that the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.789 
had one bear take often was that the
bait<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.590> was<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.769> probably<00:03:48.640> 175<00:03:49.390> pounder

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
bait it was a probably 175 pounder

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.309 
bait it was a probably 175 pounder
we<00:03:51.280> kind<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.730> suspected<00:03:51.959> there<00:03:52.959> could<00:03:53.170> be<00:03:53.200> a

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
we kind of suspected there could be a

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.619 
we kind of suspected there could be a
bigger<00:03:53.560> bear<00:03:53.769> coming<00:03:54.099> in<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.400> was<00:03:55.330> probably

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
bigger bear coming in and was probably

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.890 
bigger bear coming in and was probably
what<00:03:55.959> two<00:03:56.380> minutes<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:57.430> he<00:03:57.940> come<00:03:58.180> strolling

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
what two minutes and he come strolling

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.440 
what two minutes and he come strolling
right<00:03:59.079> in<00:03:59.790> probably<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.819> biggest<00:04:01.000> was<00:04:01.269> about

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
right in probably the biggest was about

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.819 
right in probably the biggest was about
200<00:04:01.989> pounds<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:04.989> weaved<00:04:05.200> in<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.380> stand<00:04:05.620> we

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
200 pounds and it weaved in the stand we

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.850 
200 pounds and it weaved in the stand we
still<00:04:06.040> had<00:04:06.130> bear<00:04:06.370> on<00:04:06.519> bait<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.680> they<00:04:08.799> were

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
still had bear on bait so they were

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.520 
still had bear on bait so they were
hitting<00:04:09.129> it<00:04:09.190> real<00:04:09.370> hard<00:04:10.140> today<00:04:11.140> we<00:04:11.260> got<00:04:11.379> in

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
hitting it real hard today we got in

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.979 
hitting it real hard today we got in
here<00:04:11.590> was<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.860> little<00:04:12.010> bit<00:04:12.099> windier<00:04:12.989> things

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
here was a little bit windier things

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.210 
here was a little bit windier things
were<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.200> little<00:04:14.349> slow

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
were a little slow

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.000 
were a little slow
I<00:04:15.250> had<00:04:15.640> one<00:04:15.819> come<00:04:16.000> in<00:04:16.150> right<00:04:16.329> away<00:04:17.500> looked<00:04:17.979> like

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
I had one come in right away looked like

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.690 
I had one come in right away looked like
a<00:04:18.100> big<00:04:18.190> sell<00:04:18.810> about<00:04:19.810> 200<00:04:20.680> pounds<00:04:21.220> roughly<00:04:21.579> in

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
a big sell about 200 pounds roughly in

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.260 
a big sell about 200 pounds roughly in
there<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:23.320> we<00:04:23.949> had<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.130> bear<00:04:24.370> come<00:04:24.550> in<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:25.000> was

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
there and we had a bear come in that was

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.090 
there and we had a bear come in that was
that<00:04:25.630> had<00:04:26.380> come<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.889> first<00:04:27.039> day<00:04:28.770> ate<00:04:29.770> most

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
that had come in the first day ate most

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.390 
that had come in the first day ate most
of<00:04:30.250> our<00:04:30.370> bait<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.580> think<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:32.039> he<00:04:33.039> ended<00:04:33.250> up

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
of our bait I think and he ended up

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.640 
of our bait I think and he ended up
leaving<00:04:33.610> out<00:04:33.910> here<00:04:34.229> just<00:04:35.229> a<00:04:35.320> little<00:04:35.410> while<00:04:35.620> ago

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
leaving out here just a little while ago

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.460 
leaving out here just a little while ago
and<00:04:36.160> ended<00:04:37.150> up<00:04:37.389> scooting<00:04:37.780> across<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.229> marsh

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
and ended up scooting across the marsh

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.159 
and ended up scooting across the marsh
so<00:04:39.190> we<00:04:39.340> kind<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.360> figured<00:04:40.599> something<00:04:40.870> might<00:04:41.050> be

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
so we kind of figured something might be

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.420 
so we kind of figured something might be
up<00:04:41.200> there<00:04:41.380> might<00:04:41.560> be<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.710> bigger<00:04:41.950> bear<00:04:42.190> coming

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
up there might be a bigger bear coming

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.629 
up there might be a bigger bear coming
in<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:43.169> sure<00:04:44.169> enough<00:04:44.410> was<00:04:44.650> probably<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.370> minute

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
in and sure enough was probably a minute

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.980 
in and sure enough was probably a minute
or<00:04:45.760> two<00:04:45.880> later<00:04:46.320> when<00:04:47.320> he<00:04:47.620> shows<00:04:47.860> up<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.990> all

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
or two later when he shows up and all

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.510 
or two later when he shows up and all
kinds<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.320> crack<00:04:50.530> and<00:04:50.740> brush<00:04:50.950> he<00:04:51.190> didn't<00:04:51.400> come

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
kinds of crack and brush he didn't come

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.510 
kinds of crack and brush he didn't come
