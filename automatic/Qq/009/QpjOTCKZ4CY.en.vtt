00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:13.799
 good evening Julia Latynina access code 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:15.960
 985 970 45 45 985 970 45 45 I'll start with 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.060
 I have several questions about Armenia 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.949
 questions about what happened in Armenia 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 will remind 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.060
 There is such a country Armenia our Russian 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.670
 sati years we have in total the number of ours 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.730
 five years of can be counted on the fingers 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.200
 and without removing the boots and even without removing 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 glove with his left hand is South Ossetia 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.420
 which we turned into hamas abkhazia in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.790
 which situation is narrowed catastrophic 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.100
 transdniestria also with trophic 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.170
 situation Nolad Donbas you that you 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.120
 just turned a very big hamas 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.309
 where are quite irresponsible lumpen 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.770
 shoot and family and squeeze 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.440
 apartments and cars and everything is natural 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.690
 under the pretext of protecting the executed from 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.370
 damned Ukrainian fascists but incidentally 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.960
 shot and naturally everyone whom 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.430
 upset too it becomes steal 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.500
 kirpa life and feeds armenia to dress 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.560
 from us armenia the country has entered 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.180
 what is possible union unlike c all there 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.930
 Azerbaijan, unlike the same 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.110
 Ukraine understand why because next 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.659
 with small and poor armenia there 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.280
 powerful and rich azerbaijan 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.470
 noticeable by the way how roles have changed 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.500
 for literally 20 years yet 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.930
 20 years ago and of course Armenia turned out to be 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.470
 more advanced more developed country 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.820
 for these 20 years and eclipses left 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.200
 significant amount 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.400
 significantly part productive 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.140
 creative population of Azerbaijan 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.899
 fight thanks to oil thanks to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.689
 quite reasonable policy very 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.220
 greatly evolved and rose and since 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.320
 the army was not in the pen 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.899
 the only thing that keeps Azerbaijan 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.600
 from grabbing a corner of a karabakh this 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.600
 Naturally Russian assistance clearance 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.250
 this country is in all of us 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.900
 dutifully follows us so here 's the dog 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.840
 January 12, soldier-conscript Valery 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.700
 Perm who serve on Russian 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.270
 military base in henry not so new us 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.820
 stayed military bases abroad waist he 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.940
 I decided to escape from the base or whether he simply 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.710
 went for a walk whether he asked 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.840
 in family house knight she wanted him 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.540
 water and water did not reach he was strong 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.020
 stoned whether at all on the basis of such 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.090
 mess 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.840
 it seems like they are pretty strong 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.760
 mess and if the soldier was under 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.680
 buzzed then apparently it's an obscure buzz 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.870
 which is sold at the base 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.270
 shorter larian shot the whole family but 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.260
 since 2 year old by 2 year old 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.150
 the child did not have his horn tone of his 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.580
 stabbed with a machine as he subsequently 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.500
 explained that there was afraid that these people his 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.340
 will give out but here's a two-year child too 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.920
 recognizes him 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.980
 but the horn was not enough then I had to 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.550
 cut 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.920
 there were his shoes and clothes in his house and 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.910
 weapons and on both of you are you all 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.940
 Perm surnames detained with 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.180
 Permian day near the border with 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.800
 Turkey and beyond 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.930
 comes full finish because instead 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.660
 order to transfer it to the armenian authorities 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:34.480
 for the court it is passed on to the same 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.739
 command in 102 bases but after 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.500
 this armenia 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.470
 apparently just someone in the Kremlin decided 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.390
 evict all legs about armenian people and i 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.480
 by the way I will remind you that in a similar 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.380
 situations but remember Podolsk was 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.720
 accident who is the driver of the Armenian who is there 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.090
 Hall dragged here in a women's robe too 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.040
 many people died but then 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.870
 you know, you didn't give it away 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.670
 Armenian who committed crimes on 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.230
 territory of russia armenia so that there 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.120
 judges but it is not clear why we decided 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.130
 protect all honor of one separately 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.290
 taken by a soldier permyakova household 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.430
 choice to judge in Russia 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.109
 but draw attention to the fact that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.609
 the territory of a foreign country we behaved 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:24.070
 not even on the territory of the colony and 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:27.190
 most offensive to armenian 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.800
 people way and not why just 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.600
 because it is possible but because such 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.440
 idea of ​​the greatness of kremlin in international 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.100
 Politics, I often think that 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.600
 know our in our village understands that 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.060
 majesty the greatness of the country you know everyone 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.610
 convene on big out on big 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.729
 meeting and here in the middle meeting then 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.720
 all there one make a speech other 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.759
 eat food but the bully gets up 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.740
 throws out his pants and a member of all 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.570
 present tormented and all 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.729
 present hides her eyes because 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.190
 he didn’t seem to have shot him just 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.500
 did some strange thing yes here's how 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.710
 trees and respond to such actions 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.440
 everyone does not hide his eyes 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.500
 I see you all cool hide their eyes 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.449
 no one gave me in the face 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.110
 that is why i will do the same from 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.010
 Armenia, the result was not very not 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.860
 apparently 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.139
 enjoyable for about a novel base for dovaniya 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.090
 direct because they began to gather 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.620
 Armenians, thousands of demonstrations have become 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.870
 surround yourself with this base 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.880
 became a demonstration before the Russian 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.430
 Embassy with but not wipe the requirements 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.940
 about the armenian people blog and 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.889
 accordingly I have two questions and 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.440
 it is clear that nothing critical armenia 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.080
 it is unlikely to happen there 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.280
 Maidan who throws Sargsyan 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.690
 but here there is a practical it for us 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.280
 it seems that Armenia is very far 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.229
 indeed she is far from there not 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.409
 damn pindos with which we catch 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.349
 our some kind of Transcaucasia 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:04.720
 quite hot and he is near Azerbaijan 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.280
 with which respect we are also important to him 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.500
 now the people of Azerbaijan 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.900
 happily watching everything that happens 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.070
 in Armenia, joyfully shows all this 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.409
 and says you see how with you 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.730
 are turning those that are yours 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:19.960
 secondary colonies for 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:22.800
 and of course the second thing is this 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.790
 be a russian network or there 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.860
 looking at what happens to everyone 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.720
 Russian high rhythm of South Ossetia and 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:35.320
 Abkhazia was at Donbas lax but 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.360
 amazing thing treated differently 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.100
 countries with their colonies by the way 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.080
 Russia has applied differently with its own 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.070
 the colonies of the Soviet Union a lot of their 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.230
 He gave the colonies but now we have this 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.360
 such a unique situation when a country 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.850
 which got into orbit our influence a 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.530
 or the territory that fell wards then 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.960
 our influence cannot expect anything 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.320
 except without brought humiliation and 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.540
 unparalleled crap and nothing like that 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.360
 don't compensate for that just 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.050
 everything will be done to the inhabitants of this 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.460
 countries felt as bad as possible 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.900
 people who do it sincerely 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.380
 This is believed to increase 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.380
 yusi
