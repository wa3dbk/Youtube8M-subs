00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.970
 i 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.710
 Y 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.040
 ah 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.770
 they tell that when a silence 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.690
 appeared between 2 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:34.490
 look what happens an angel that robbed them of 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:39.260
 voice 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:44.600
 I am silent the day it touches us 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:47.980
 forget that in such a way I still do not 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.980
 finish silent 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.239
 everything started in surprise in a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 casual meeting but the night is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.750
 naughty 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.050
 when it is fat 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.550
 unintentionally an offering is made 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:16.360
 that enough pain does not happen an angel 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.360
 already this legend and it becomes love 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:25.040
 now I understand when the angel that 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.330
 among the other steps 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.050
 the master 1000 the implacable the most 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.390
 fast 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:41.370
 now I fully understand this silence 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.810
 deadly someone who happened to think hugs me 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.810
 peacock angel 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.850
 final 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.140
 everything started in the surprise of a 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.410
 casual meeting 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.230
 but the night is old 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.940
 when the salt is woven 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.380
 without you being an offering 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:28.430
 that pacts with pain does not happen an angel 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:32.070
 it settles and the love becomes now 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:37.680
 I understand for the angel that enters 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:41.810
 we false was the most terrible the 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:47.360
 implacable the fiercest 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:52.330
 now I fully understand this silence 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:56.140
 mortal angel that passes from that alliance 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.140
 although the páramo 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.730
 final 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.160
 hello friends how were you welcome to 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.660
 how to play to play guitar and 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.550
 good on this occasion we made the subject of 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.209
 silvio rodríguez angel for a final 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.270
 last very nice this good one has about 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.440
 chords 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.470
 singles in the first part and after 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.570
 he is a bit complex in the chorus and 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.220
 they saw all the progression of chords the 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.180
 arpeggios and the rhythm more or less we're going 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.180
 leading in this way 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.660
 so we start from the sixth day in the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.090
 if we were playing a 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.040
 sharp chord as we started 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.840
 if we pass to a degree we can go down to 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.600
 the lowest ones but for example if 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.540
 we start from the sixth the bass of the sixth 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.430
 what we are going to do is touch the sixth 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.640
 third second first second second 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.200
 and then we go back more or less in all 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.200
 the song we are helping to that rhythm 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.950
 well in the introduction let's make a 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.110
 chord of F sharp minor and we're going to 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.700
 use the little finger to work on the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.430
 first string what is the fifth 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.949
 fret and the fourth fret and then with 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.209
 the second the fret with what we are 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.410
 stepping on the sharp F sharp 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.410
 then we do like this 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.840
 let's see it there 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.930
 now we go to the dre 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.780
 let's go what would be finger 2 in the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.780
 fret 2 the first string 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:49.230
 then we go to 2 minor sharp 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.560
 we see again 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.830
 we ask for the min and we do with the basses 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.830
 here 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.980
 and we stayed in the sharp f 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.600
 and there we started the song 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.590
 and well this has been all I hope that you 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.000
 like the song see you next 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.000
 good luck
