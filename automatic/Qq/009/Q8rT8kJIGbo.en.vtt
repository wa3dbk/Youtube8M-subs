00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.350
 product specialist idea at coolblue and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.350
 in this review we look at the asus cg 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.350
 8250 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.670
 the asus and show scg 8250 becomes standard 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.270
 delivered as you see it on the table 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.250
 lie 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.800
 that is with a wired keyboard one 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.060
 wired optical mouse and power cable 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.690
 to of course turn on the computer and power 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.399
 can provide 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.980
 software is also included with nero 9 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.660
 essentials natural desktop itself and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.370
 finally you also get 2 years 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.370
 pick-up and return guarantee 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.620
 well a beast of a computer then 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.449
 it of course interesting to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 know what connections there are 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.639
 sit on it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.170
 go take a look at the 

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:51.899
 front the top flap you if we have it 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 open up then we see that behind it 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.870
 a number of connections are a few 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.389
 photo card locks 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.489
 MS cards as SD cards and compact 

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:01.679
 flash cards also in the headphones 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.949
 connection and for a microphone a 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.049
 input then a USB2 name 4 times 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.480
 connection, these valves close 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.070
 when we look down we see 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.290
 the yes dvd player and burner are and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.030
 below that we see another lock where you 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.380
 possibly even a hard drive 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.760
 could build 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.230
 well and rear that still quite a bit 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.180
 connection let's get there just as quickly 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.860
 walking through it is still nice to know what 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 you can all connect to it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.420
 After two colors usb 2 0 point you again 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.520
 then we see connection for the mouse and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.860
 the keyboard that is included 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.590
 below see my hdmi connection and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.080
 a connection for digital sound 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.390
 yes if you like gaming wood or with 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.770
 If you are editing a movie then this is anyway 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.650
 very nice that you have finished that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.810
 this is a dvi connection and a vga 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.320
 connection to connect an external monitor 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.750
 Close 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.730
 below that we find twice USB 3 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.610
 port that is faster data transfer 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.930
 a usb 2 point 0 so that it therefore 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.120
 also on below 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.370
 again a usb2 twice so the 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.840
 USB connections there is a lot on you 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.350
 another ethernet connection for wired 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 internet 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.310
 below that we find connecting some audio 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.140
 closure and why 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.159
 among other things, for example 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.750
 instrument or other equipment 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.819
 connect to the computer and again 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.159
 an audio outputs 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.540
 among other things, find a microphone underneath 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.540
 we have another dv 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.549
 another HDMI and another VGA connection 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.189
 so enough options for it 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.139
 connecting HD screens or monitors 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.969
 and then the top we still find the on 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.650
 and off button and what is also good to 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.780
 report is among will be such a big one 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.430
 he beast is not weighing as much as you 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.969
 would think even though of course there is 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.010
 what actually is it just a whole 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:43.099
 simple story because this asus essentio 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.139
 cg 8250 is as you can see and 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.980
 where bakbeest is on the inside as well as from 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.269
 Outside 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.980
 and if talking about the outside still 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.930
 so has a sloping slope 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.699
 front in a sleek design 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.290
 the connections are therefore hidden 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.639
 a kind behind various flaps 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.750
 wire brush look you also have the 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.879
 front all looks very neat 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.500
 from mouse and keyboard become common 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.310
 included so you can go to the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.230
 stroke 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.449
 yes and what is it really suitable for 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.840
 yes of course for that multimedia from 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:11.810
 data game freaks or if you like 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.150
 video editing or photo editing it 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.980
 only minor downside this a6 is that 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.709
 he does not have wi-fi 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.569
 watch it on the other side with one 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.900
 what goal is the problem of course 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.900
 solved 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.419
 yes a clear story and i7 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:31.519
 processor and nvidia geforce gt 630 video 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.079
 card of up to 2 gigabytes much 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.459
 connection to other multimedia 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.379
 to connect equipment to or 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.030
 even hd monitors and 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.549
 and mouse and keyboard become common 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.269
 included 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.819
 the asus essentio cg 8250 is a monster 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.169
 of an angina literally and figuratively 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.569
 because you can do a video editing with it 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.389
 but also just play heavy games 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.579
 well you want this asus and show cg 8250 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.620
 purchase or do you still want to go 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.069
 calmly read the specifications then you can 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.840
