this<00:00:00.989> song<00:00:01.319> was<00:00:01.500> written<00:00:01.770> at<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.669> time<00:00:03.030> when

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.270 

when<00:00:07.820> my<00:00:08.820> son<00:00:09.150> was<00:00:10.110> not<00:00:10.379> walking<00:00:10.860> where<00:00:11.099> he's

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
when my son was not walking where he's

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.329 
when my son was not walking where he's
walking<00:00:11.519> tonight<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.840> because<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.919> I

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
walking tonight and because of that I

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:20.050 
walking tonight and because of that I
felt<00:00:15.120> like<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:16.340> almost<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.669> a<00:00:18.289> father<00:00:19.289> that

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
felt like a almost like a father that

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.560 
felt like a almost like a father that
had<00:00:21.650> made<00:00:22.650> too<00:00:23.189> many<00:00:23.310> mistakes<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:24.180> far<00:00:24.480> as
