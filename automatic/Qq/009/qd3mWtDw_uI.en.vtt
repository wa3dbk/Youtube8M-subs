00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.690
 edition 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.279
 after several years of resignation 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.560
 turned into despair the mortal 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.750
 definitive kombat known as mortal 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.520
 kombat 9 comes to sting for joy of 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.439
 all players who only own one 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.420
 pc to be able to play this version is 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.160
 identical to the original version of xbox 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.050
 360 and playstation3 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.239
 but includes as the edition of it 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.220
 name released on consoles last year 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.110
 all the downloadable content created at 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.400
 little time since the launch given that 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.050
 our own fichines that has been 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.269
 In charge of talking about wonders 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.220
 of game appeared two years ago and as 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.470
 he knew how to implant himself again in the chest 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.449
 of all the fans the game is known 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.790
 fantastic recovers that spirit that 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.739
 both caught us during the 90s and 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.049
 overflow of content highlighting its 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.850
 interestingly so story why in 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:59.739
 this time we are going to focus on the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.659
 technical aspects is what a 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.699
 fundamentalist gaming in pc 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.590
 mortal kombat complete edition is at 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.030
 height of circumstances first thing 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.490
 that draws attention is that the image 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.900
 of the game does not occupy all the monitor but 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.790
 which maintains the proportion of 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.520
 versions of consoles used to 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.140
 interpreted on screens 16 to 9 when 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.060
 the vast majority of computers that 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.950
 exist in the world they must accommodate themselves to 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.869
 certainly strange 16 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.610
 there is no other option but to adapt to a game 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.320
 with black bands present all the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.539
 time situation that can not be attributed 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.039
 to something other than laziness 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.439
 part of the study responsible for this 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.240
 version but maybe that's not the detail 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.860
 most shocking of all the greatest of 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.899
 problems is found during 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 cinematic of the campaign that like 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.189
 we highlight finally manages to add a 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.060
 respectable narrative around so many 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.530
 pineapples and kicks 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.840
 the videos between each of the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.520
 battles are pre-processed to a 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.140
 very inferior quality than expected 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.549
 when they could calmly have 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.619
 been interpreted by the engine 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.420
 graphic real - time game 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.340
 all ways it is understood that leaving 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.259
 videos in that quality and not overdo the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.270
 sizes of the textures in the levels 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.009
 they are sacrifices made in favor of 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.170
 performance to get the game 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.539
 work properly on computers 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.340
 not so powerful and with it reach a 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.680
 greater amount of public aside 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.510
 let's accept it is a fighting game and not 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.340
 they modify us nothing if the soil of any 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.620
 of the levels it looks like it's from a 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.540
 title of playstation 2 probably the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.980
 worst of our nightmares that nothing 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.049
 it has to do with freddy krueger 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.670
 character included in the game be the 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.650
 online mode that at the time of writing 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.760
 this note still does not work like 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.280
 should limit 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.079
 to games only with strangers and 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.540
 doing everything possible to leave it wrong 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.459
 stopped to the great steamworks system that 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.680
 It does not usually fail but not everything is blood and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.780
 darkness in mortal kombat the single fact 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.730
 of having reached that little corner that 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.290
 many gamers treasure and defend 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.209
 steadily as is that of the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.340
 computers is reason enough to 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.659
 celebrate and support the conversion can 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.060
 that does not conform to standards 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.709
 technicians demanded by the most obsessive 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.780
 but the reality is that it is 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.909
 exactly the same game as so many 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.859
 Saturday nights together friends made us 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:06.989
