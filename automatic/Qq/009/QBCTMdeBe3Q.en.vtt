00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
for end and I think it was like 170 175
dollars<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.520> pretty<00:01:08.790> chunk<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.299> change

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

equipment<00:04:31.640> on<00:04:31.850> here<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.360> think<00:04:33.050> about<00:04:33.140> like

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
equipment on here I think about like

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.260 
equipment on here I think about like
this<00:04:33.650> right<00:04:33.980> up<00:04:34.160> here<00:04:34.370> would<00:04:34.730> be<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.880> great

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
this right up here would be a great

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.470 
this right up here would be a great
place<00:04:35.630> for<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.680> laser<00:04:37.070> and<00:04:37.640> then<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.090> course<00:04:38.300> you

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
place for a laser and then of course you

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.510 
place for a laser and then of course you
could<00:04:38.660> have<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.900> big<00:04:39.650> button<00:04:39.980> on<00:04:40.070> here<00:04:40.340> where

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
could have a big button on here where

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.730 
could have a big button on here where
you<00:04:40.610> could<00:04:40.760> grasp<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.360> laser<00:04:41.570> or<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.650> know

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
you could grasp the laser or you know

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.710 
you could grasp the laser or you know
with<00:04:42.890> your<00:04:43.010> thumb<00:04:43.310> be<00:04:43.490> able<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.420> hit<00:04:44.570> that

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
with your thumb be able to to hit that

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.020 
with your thumb be able to to hit that
at<00:04:44.930> whatever<00:04:45.140> position<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:46.070> is<00:04:46.460> comfortable

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
at whatever position that is comfortable

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.220 
at whatever position that is comfortable
for<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:48.830> think<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.610> just<00:04:49.640> kind<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.230> kind

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
for you and I think it just kind of kind

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.500 
for you and I think it just kind of kind
of<00:04:51.380> makes<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.650> look<00:04:51.830> at<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:52.040> Tavor<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.940> little

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
of makes a look at the Tavor a little

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.660 
of makes a look at the Tavor a little
bit<00:04:53.630> more<00:04:53.780> menacing<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.890> say<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.190> least<00:04:55.220> and

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
bit more menacing to say the least and

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.100 
bit more menacing to say the least and
you<00:04:55.820> don't<00:04:56.030> like<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.300> said<00:04:56.540> you've<00:04:56.720> got<00:04:56.750> a<00:04:56.900> lot

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
you don't like I said you've got a lot

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.570 
you don't like I said you've got a lot
more<00:04:57.140> real<00:04:58.070> estate<00:04:58.100> to<00:04:58.880> get<00:04:59.570> here<00:04:59.840> so<00:05:00.580> for

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
more real estate to get here so for

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.130 
more real estate to get here so for
those<00:05:01.730> of<00:05:01.790> us<00:05:01.970> who<00:05:02.150> have<00:05:02.270> real<00:05:02.480> long<00:05:02.690> arms

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
those of us who have real long arms

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.100 
those of us who have real long arms
you've<00:05:03.740> got<00:05:04.010> some<00:05:04.640> more<00:05:04.790> movement<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.480> again

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
you've got some more movement and again

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.390 
you've got some more movement and again
just<00:05:07.010> kind<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:08.140> profiles<00:05:09.140> that<00:05:09.380> cuts<00:05:09.920> that<00:05:10.190> off

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
just kind of profiles that cuts that off

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.880 
just kind of profiles that cuts that off
right<00:05:10.610> there<00:05:11.000> I<00:05:11.210> like<00:05:12.200> that<00:05:12.350> kind<00:05:12.590> of<00:05:12.740> look

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
right there I like that kind of look

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.490 
right there I like that kind of look
there<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:13.400> looks<00:05:13.610> kind<00:05:13.820> of<00:05:13.880> sharp<00:05:14.200> so<00:05:15.200> anyway

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
there that looks kind of sharp so anyway

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.790 
there that looks kind of sharp so anyway
that's<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:16.010> that<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:17.530> manticore<00:05:18.530> arms<00:05:20.800> XTL

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
that's it that is the manticore arms XTL

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.000 
that's it that is the manticore arms XTL
for<00:05:22.160> end<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:23.020> i<00:05:24.020> think<00:05:24.290> it's<00:05:24.440> kind<00:05:24.650> of<00:05:24.680> workout

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
for end and i think it's kind of workout

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.610 
for end and i think it's kind of workout
kind<00:05:25.250> of<00:05:25.340> good<00:05:25.490> I<00:05:25.730> also<00:05:26.330> like<00:05:26.600> the<00:05:26.630> fact<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:27.170> I

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
kind of good I also like the fact that I

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.640 
kind of good I also like the fact that I
got<00:05:27.980> this<00:05:28.280> in<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.610> black<00:05:29.000> color<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.630> so<00:05:29.900> kind

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
got this in the black color and so kind

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.730 
got this in the black color and so kind
of<00:05:30.800> accents<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:31.580> OD<00:05:32.060> green<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.780> other<00:05:32.810> black

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
of accents the OD green the other black

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.100 
of accents the OD green the other black
portions<00:05:34.310> of<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.670> firearm<00:05:35.090> as<00:05:35.240> well<00:05:35.420> so<00:05:36.020> it

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
portions of the firearm as well so it

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.650 
portions of the firearm as well so it
kind<00:05:36.290> of<00:05:36.350> balances<00:05:36.530> out<00:05:37.040> a<00:05:37.100> little<00:05:37.370> bit<00:05:37.660> but

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
kind of balances out a little bit but

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.770 
kind of balances out a little bit but
other<00:05:38.960> than<00:05:39.410> being<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:39.920> fashionista<00:05:40.850> I<00:05:41.150> think

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
other than being the fashionista I think

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.650 
other than being the fashionista I think
madacorp<00:05:42.170> arms<00:05:42.730> did<00:05:43.730> a<00:05:43.760> pretty<00:05:44.030> good<00:05:44.210> job<00:05:44.270> on

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
madacorp arms did a pretty good job on

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.070 
madacorp arms did a pretty good job on
this<00:05:44.840> and<00:05:45.260> again<00:05:45.980> giving<00:05:46.850> flexibility<00:05:47.600> for

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
this and again giving flexibility for

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.220 
this and again giving flexibility for
shooters<00:05:48.530> to<00:05:49.520> put<00:05:49.760> any<00:05:50.420> and<00:05:50.690> all<00:05:50.780> kinds<00:05:51.170> of

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
shooters to put any and all kinds of

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.270

stuff onto their rigs and

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.370 
stuff onto their rigs and
have<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:53.730> work<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.240> course<00:05:54.660> we'll<00:05:54.990> take<00:05:55.020> this

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
have it work of course we'll take this

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.800 
have it work of course we'll take this
out<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.830> range<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:56.460> as<00:05:56.700> we<00:05:56.940> continue<00:05:57.720> to

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
equipment stands up to the test okay

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.890 
equipment stands up to the test okay
looks<00:06:07.560> pretty<00:06:07.770> sharp<00:06:08.010> so<00:06:08.610> until<00:06:09.450> we<00:06:09.600> hit<00:06:09.720> the
