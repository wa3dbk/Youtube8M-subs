00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:06.863
 We're in Madrid at the Prado Museum 

00:00:06.863 --> 00:00:09.284
 and we look at Velazquez's canvas. 

00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:12.386
 This is a picture called Vulcan's Forge. Some art historians 

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:15.146
 they describe it as a bit burlesque, mocking. 

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:18.187
 Here we see Apollo, the sun god and poets 

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:21.365
 with halo overhead 

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:26.527
 how to have fun with the Vulcan who forges armor 

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.554
 and working hard all day. 

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:30.345
 Apollo came to him to tell him 

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:33.820
 that his wife Venus has a romance with Mars 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.469
 God of War. 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.939
 Let's see how they both face. 

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:40.529
 They seemed to forget everything for a while. 

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:45.844
 Apollo's back is taut, his head erect. He is mainly interested in himself, 

00:00:45.844 --> 00:00:49.819
 because he needs Vulcan to communicate his scandalous news. 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:54.267
 The volcano looks angry and dangerous. 

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:58.485
 In one hand he keeps a red-hot piece of metal and a hammer. 

00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:02.306
 He looks as if he is not afraid to strike anyone or anything that gets in his way. 

00:01:02.306 --> 00:01:04.257
 And look at his body. 

00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:08.603
 He has a hull, belly and muscles on his hands. 

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:13.435
 But his face is like Caravaggio's image. 

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:15.785
 He's not an ideal handsome man. (On our terms.) 

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:17.342
 Well, besides the beautiful body. 

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:20.716
 Actually, all male characters have beautiful, ideal bodies. 

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:24.349
 As if Velazquez was inspired by the art of ancient Greece and Rome. 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:28.221
 Or Renaissance artists like Michelangelo. 

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.262
 Or canvases from Caravaggio. 

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:32.104
 But the faces of the characters look different, don't they? 

00:01:32.104 --> 00:01:34.202
 Yes. They are no longer so beautiful, idealized. 

00:01:34.202 --> 00:01:36.330
 Actually, they look pretty realistic, 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.019
 even if they are not painted with clear prestige. 

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:41.421
 All this creates some tension in the image 

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:45.612
 between the realistic, earthy way of painting, the character of the characters 

00:01:45.612 --> 00:01:46.751
 and what they do 

00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:49.283
 and with what gestures they express their emotions. 

00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:53.113
 And also how these characters resemble classic statues in their appearance, 

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.470
 their bodies look like classic antique sculptures. 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.306
 But at the same time, there is not something else. I doubt French or Italians 

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.980
 they have shown this important mythological story by this one, 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.368
 almost comical way? What do you think? - Exactly. 

00:02:05.368 --> 00:02:08.361
 Look at the man standing like the other from the right. 

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:11.191
 It looks so astonished that it makes it ridiculous. 

00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:16.710
 There is such a human sense of joke, skirmish. 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.512
 It seems too daring to approach this classic fabric 

00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:23.969
 without respect and respect, as is customary. 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.033
 At the same time, this painting works lightly as a painter's practice. 

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:31.101
 In the middle we have three male characters 

00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:33.079
 shown from three different angles. 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.985
 The man on the right is Vulcan, facing us, 

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.664
 the other is turned back 

00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:39.726
 and the last is in profile. 

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:43.129
 And there is another character who comes to the group of three others. 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.351
 The three men almost resemble another trio, 

00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:47.033
 and three of the three women - Three Graces. 

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.515
 - Really! The group looks very arranged and arranged. 

00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:55.627
 It is as if this image should be an advertisement for potential patron artists. 

00:02:55.627 --> 00:02:58.661
 Velazquez painted this picture when he was still quite young. 

00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:01.673
 At that time he went to Rome on Rubens' impulse 

00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:06.175
 and maybe he tried to show what he could do. Including painting of naked male bodies. 

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:09.906
 In any case, he was able to demonstrate that he was an artist capable of fresh approach, 

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:13.400
 who can push the boundaries of how an old familiar story can be conceived.
