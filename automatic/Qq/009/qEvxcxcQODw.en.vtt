00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
sucked because one of our teams a lot

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.290 
sucked because one of our teams a lot
one<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.100> our<00:00:59.280> alliance<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.820> what's<00:01:00.149> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
one of our alliance is what's it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.200 
one of our alliance is what's it's
called<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> their<00:01:00.899> robots<00:01:01.320> broke<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
called one of their robots broke so it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.579 
called one of their robots broke so it
was<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.809> disappointing<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.500> us

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
was just kind of disappointing for us

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.560 
was just kind of disappointing for us
because<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> had<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> try<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> carry

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
because we kind of had to try to carry

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
because we kind of had to try to carry
our<00:01:06.780> team<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> didn't<00:01:07.860> wait<00:01:07.979> doesn't<00:01:08.220> work

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
our team and it didn't wait doesn't work

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.550 
our team and it didn't wait doesn't work
very<00:01:08.460> well<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.150> two<00:01:09.299> versus<00:01:09.689> three<00:01:09.720> but

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
very well when it's two versus three but

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.469 
very well when it's two versus three but
yeah<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.979> being<00:01:11.189> said<00:01:11.340> um<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:12.240> why<00:01:12.450> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
yeah that being said um that's why I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
yeah that being said um that's why I
wasn't<00:01:12.840> uploading<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.799> was<00:01:13.979> gone<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
wasn't uploading because I was gone I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
wasn't uploading because I was gone I
was<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> state<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> there<00:01:16.170> wasn't<00:01:16.380> really

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
was out of state and there wasn't really

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.100 
was out of state and there wasn't really
much<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.119> me<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> contact<00:01:18.509> anyone

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
much of a way for me to contact anyone

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.980

tried<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.320> tried<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> save<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> video

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
tried to I tried to save the video
because<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.939> record<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.899> needs

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
because like when I record it it needs

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
because like when I record it it needs
to<00:01:49.320> process<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.950> video<00:01:50.189> through<00:01:50.610> reflector

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
to process the video through reflector

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.850 
to process the video through reflector
which<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.689> my<00:01:51.810> program<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.380> i<00:01:52.409> use<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
which is my program that i use and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.830 
which is my program that i use and
sometimes<00:01:53.640> reflectors<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.420> dumb<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
sometimes reflectors just dumb and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.709 
sometimes reflectors just dumb and
doesn't<00:01:55.110> work<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:57.000> whole<00:01:57.149> video<00:01:57.390> just

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
doesn't work and your whole video just

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.359 
doesn't work and your whole video just
completely<00:01:58.079> gets<00:01:58.380> destroyed<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.100> doesn't

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
completely gets destroyed and it doesn't

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.120 
completely gets destroyed and it doesn't
work<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.270> basically<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> went<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> save<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
work so basically when I went to save it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
work so basically when I went to save it
completely<00:02:02.670> deleted<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:03.180> video<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.110> went

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
completely deleted my video so I went

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.010 
completely deleted my video so I went
back<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.649> redo<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.219> again

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
back to redo it again

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.440 
back to redo it again
and<00:02:06.140> when<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.799> redid<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.549> had<00:02:07.670> basically<00:02:08.149> like
