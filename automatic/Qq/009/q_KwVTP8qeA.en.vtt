00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
ink and water in you're also going to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.160 
ink and water in you're also going to
need<00:00:44.040> something<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.700> measure<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.450> ink<00:00:45.690> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
need something to measure your ink you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
need something to measure your ink you
can<00:00:46.320> use<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> brush<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.160> use<00:00:47.370> put<00:00:48.239> drops

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
can use a brush and just use put drops

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.970 
can use a brush and just use put drops
and<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.960> use<00:00:49.079> an<00:00:49.200> eyedropper<00:00:49.379> I'm

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and you can use an eyedropper I'm

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.150 
and you can use an eyedropper I'm
actually<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.670> use<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.239> dull<00:00:51.600> syringe<00:00:52.160> for

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
actually going to use a dull syringe for

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.529 
actually going to use a dull syringe for
this<00:00:53.370> technique<00:00:53.699> you're<00:00:53.820> also<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.360> need

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this technique you're also going to need

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.520 
this technique you're also going to need
some<00:00:55.170> water

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
some water

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.910 
some water
and<00:00:56.210> I'm<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> measure<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:58.140> into<00:00:58.739> each

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and I'm going to measure out into each

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.990 
and I'm going to measure out into each
one<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> these<00:01:00.289> containers<00:01:02.000> three

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
one of these containers three

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.990 
one of these containers three
milliliters<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> water<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:05.580> amount<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
milliliters of water now the amount of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.260 
milliliters of water now the amount of
water<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.530> important<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
water is not that important as it is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
water is not that important as it is
that<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> same<00:01:10.380> amount<00:01:10.530> into<00:01:10.920> each

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that you get the same amount into each

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.469 
that you get the same amount into each
container<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.720> know<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:12.990> each

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
container so that you know that each

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.320 
container so that you know that each
level<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.049> wash<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:20.119> stronger<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.150> weaker

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
level of your wash is stronger or weaker

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.460 
level of your wash is stronger or weaker
than<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> last

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
than the last

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.820 
than the last
so<00:01:22.619> put<00:01:23.250> three<00:01:23.460> milliliters<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.830> clean

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so put three milliliters in of clean

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100 
so put three milliliters in of clean
water<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.820> possible<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.540> could<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.930> should

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
water if possible you could you should

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
water if possible you could you should
use<00:01:28.229> distilled<00:01:28.710> water<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.030> using

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
use distilled water but I'm just using

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.420 
use distilled water but I'm just using
filtered<00:01:31.079> tap<00:01:31.259> water<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:34.320> 100%

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.640 

ink<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.659> I'm<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.229> pull<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
ink and then I'm going to just pull a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.420 
ink and then I'm going to just pull a
little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.250> ink<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.950> my<00:01:44.100> syringe

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
little bit of ink up in to my syringe

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.649 
little bit of ink up in to my syringe
and<00:01:45.060> I'm<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> start<00:01:45.780> by<00:01:46.140> putting<00:01:46.409> drops

of what of ink into my lowest level of

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.290

test<00:02:44.590> each<00:02:44.800> one<00:02:44.830> out<00:02:48.090> I'm<00:02:49.090> going<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.270> use<00:02:49.330> a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
test each one out I'm going to use a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.780 
test each one out I'm going to use a
watercolor<00:02:52.180> brush<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:59.790> lowest

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
watercolor brush and this is the lowest

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:11.730 
watercolor brush and this is the lowest
level

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:21.699 

this<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.640> next<00:03:13.000> highest<00:03:13.210> level

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.890 

and<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.760> good<00:03:22.939> thing<00:03:23.120> about<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.599> is<00:03:23.840> that

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
and the good thing about this is that

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.410 
and the good thing about this is that
you<00:03:24.319> can<00:03:24.620> tweak<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.159> so<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.790> get<00:03:25.939> just

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
you can tweak it so that you get just

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:34.119 
you can tweak it so that you get just
the<00:03:26.659> right<00:03:28.299> amount<00:03:29.299> of<00:03:30.340> color<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:32.260> so<00:03:33.260> one

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
the right amount of color in it so one

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.380 
the right amount of color in it so one
of<00:03:34.159> the<00:03:34.310> things<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.610> I'm<00:03:34.700> noticing<00:03:34.730> here<00:03:35.150> is

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
of the things that I'm noticing here is

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.380 
of the things that I'm noticing here is
that<00:03:36.400> there's<00:03:37.400> not<00:03:37.549> enough<00:03:37.610> difference

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
that there's not enough difference

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.259 
that there's not enough difference
between<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.140> first<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:40.000> second<00:03:41.000> level

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
between the first and the second level

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.289 
between the first and the second level
so<00:03:41.540> I'm<00:03:41.750> going<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.049> add<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.670> couple<00:03:43.670> more<00:03:43.819> drops

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
so I'm going to add a couple more drops

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.410 
so I'm going to add a couple more drops
of<00:03:44.950> ink<00:03:45.950> it's<00:03:46.430> still<00:03:46.640> going<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.819> be<00:03:46.879> number<00:03:47.209> two

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
of ink it's still going to be number two

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.190 
of ink it's still going to be number two
I<00:03:47.659> just<00:03:48.049> got<00:03:48.230> into<00:03:48.439> a<00:03:48.620> let<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.579> mix<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.959> got<00:03:51.109> to
