 medically 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.609
 a variety of items our home 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:23.690

 you are covered with the program how to choose 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.219
 blender bring us a blender in the studio 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.170
 blender is a mixer or mix 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 body shredder stir il 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.219
 mixer bare for that mix it 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.799
 blender mixes it mix for 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.500
 mixing is true english word 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.500
 module how to choose the right blender 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.590
 the choice is constructed as follows of course 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.409
 do you have to choose brandon 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.920
 this top part is this here or 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.770
 glass as we call it glass from 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.979
 whole glass special which on 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.659
 sturdy which is inert as it is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.940
 glass that is, it is not chemically 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.030
 contacts with products that 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.350
 get there and accordingly it can 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.530
 handle in many ways you on 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.440
 homemade 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.710
 the importance of the glass hood here 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.590
 hot soup and pour boiling water and makes 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.409
 of which are puree soups which is also very important 2 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.570
 these are the powers that is those blenders that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.960
 imply and this is separately indicated 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.549
 in the shark instructions up are the most 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.740
 powerful most durable and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.860
 accordingly 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.890
 grind these whole vegetables and fruits 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.850
 not cleaning not cutting them which is very important 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.540
 to save 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.560
 no pass in their mo fibers and all 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.910
 nutrient now which is usually 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.590
 contained in all kozhurka jumpers 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.980
 pitted and so on this is an important thing and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.880
 finally he must be steady for 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.519
 so that you don't need 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.400
 control because there is a blender and 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.860
 such know the root is no cartridges 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.840
 surrounded here it is necessary to keep 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.959
 watch carefully so as not to fly 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.870
 nothing you got hurt close 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.000
 this thing we love them less stable 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.910
 powerful force laying close 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.950
 push the button and watching the absolute 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.410
 there are many superiorities with those around you 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.239
 we are all producing means this is the first but 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.750
 and for becoming it was glass 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.030
 we love powerful blenders to not 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.540
 memorizing power figures is simple 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.870
 the mark is breaking the ice and from the crasher it 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.540
 called that is smasher yes we are two 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.930
 sloth me and shopping can throw there 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.070
 whole apple analysis and enjoy 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.280
 like this one 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.100
 and crumbled like ice destroys this apple 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.590
 and the third course here is such submersible 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.019
 blenders we love a little less because 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.030
 they spray rush with them harder 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.030
 treat though for housewives is good 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.060
 of course not ice they crush no vegetables 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:35.079
 tournament runs away and so on we do everything 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.079
 how to choose understood how to use 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.360
 very difficult to use you can 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.329
 add any product you want 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.360
 chop or it will be vegetables or 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.640
 fruit or the same court to order 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.739
 to pro how to cook rubbed 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.829
 It is recommended despite the fact that 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.000
 and from the crusher can cut an apple pause 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.310
 still if you want 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.280
 process speed up need to cut 100 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.180
 making up the product you want 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:17.190
 chop into small pieces and then 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:18.959
 the process will go faster so now 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.760
 just if you turn on the sound we will 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.970
 interfere and so here this mix the liquid 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.680
 dagger with a little before adding if you 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.850
 want a holiday to cook rubbed 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.100
 soup games clean bone soup because 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.500
 that so you mess up the blender 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.020
 this one wo n't spoil die crashes there 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.460
 but the way you want and you may climb 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:47.160
 into small pieces and tried anyone 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.100
 recommend to anyone that it is very powerful 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.830
 devices and since use we understood 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.830
 the most important thing is how to care for a blender 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.470
 it is very important not to leave organic 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.350
 residues in it in general therefore it is necessary 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.470
 we are after every nose use 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.250
 by washing there is a trick and these are the same from 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.840
 roofs are washed in two ways first is 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.000
 self-cleaning element 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.330
 that is, when you washed just this one 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.610
 here's a glass you poured water into it and after 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.890
 this set to self-cleaning mode 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.080
 in no case recommended there 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.170
 add detergent 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.330
 so don't wipe it 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.820
 some kind of cotton buds that 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.730
 recommended to remove this 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.860
 glass and on the advice to put 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.570
 dishwasher well every year now 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.180
 it can be easily removed 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.490
 this is removed before the principle is not even necessary 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.080
 shoot on live just turned upside down 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.630
 put in the dishwasher 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.390
 and there he passed the cycle is already after 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.060
 this clean and ok waterfront 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:58.110
 the outer panel is opened 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.590
 dirty and all without household chemicals it's time 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.590
 end
