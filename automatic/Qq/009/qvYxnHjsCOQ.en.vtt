way<00:00:30.329> to<00:00:30.390> create<00:00:30.869> beautiful<00:00:31.320> watercolors<00:00:31.949> I

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
way to create beautiful watercolors I

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.439 
way to create beautiful watercolors I
began<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.170> row<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.680> trees<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.460> little<00:00:35.879> ways<00:00:36.180> up

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
began this row of trees a little ways up

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.689 
began this row of trees a little ways up
on<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.900> painting<00:00:37.440> rather<00:00:37.800> than<00:00:38.070> starting<00:00:38.550> at

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
on the painting rather than starting at

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.220 
on the painting rather than starting at
the<00:00:38.790> bottom<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.269> I<00:00:39.510> want<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> show<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the bottom because I want to show the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.530 
the bottom because I want to show the
trees<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.829> off<00:00:41.129> into<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> distance<00:00:43.370> okay

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
trees going off into the distance okay

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.689 
trees going off into the distance okay
there's<00:00:45.540> my<00:00:45.780> first<00:00:45.989> layer<00:00:46.309> now<00:00:47.309> I'd<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.610> to

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
there's my first layer now I'd like to

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.490 
there's my first layer now I'd like to
show<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.909> how<00:00:48.239> I'll<00:00:48.420> progress<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.199> page

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500

working into the back to develop the
layers<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.170> trees<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.829> move<00:00:53.010> into<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
layers of trees as we move into the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
layers of trees as we move into the
forest<00:00:53.609> to<00:00:54.270> suggest<00:00:54.690> distance<00:00:55.260> or<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> deep

consider<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> pitcher<00:01:02.129> plane<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
consider that the pitcher plane is a

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
consider that the pitcher plane is a
shallow<00:01:03.000> stage<00:01:03.449> each<00:01:04.050> layer<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> flat

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
shallow stage each layer is a flat

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.790 
shallow stage each layer is a flat
screen<00:01:05.339> laying<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.420> behind<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.050> other<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
screen laying one behind the other you

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.350 
screen laying one behind the other you
can<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.160> that<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> layers<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> trees

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
can see that the layers of the trees

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.389 
can see that the layers of the trees
move<00:01:09.720> further<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> distance<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.190> they

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
move further into the distance and they

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.700 
move further into the distance and they
rise<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.300> much<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.229> climbing<00:01:13.649> a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
rise up and back much like climbing a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.130 
rise up and back much like climbing a
set<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.009> stairs<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.300> next<00:01:15.509> layer<00:01:15.780> will

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
set of stairs so the next layer will

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.279 
set of stairs so the next layer will
begin<00:01:16.530> by<00:01:16.860> stepping<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.420> page<00:01:18.690> so<00:01:19.140> it

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
begin by stepping up the page so it

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.740 
begin by stepping up the page so it
appears<00:01:19.649> to<00:01:19.800> be<00:01:19.890> back<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> distance<00:01:20.880> I'll

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
appears to be back in the distance I'll

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.020 
appears to be back in the distance I'll
use<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> same<00:01:22.229> colors<00:01:22.680> again<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.310> start<00:01:23.850> my

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
use the same colors again and start my

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.450 
use the same colors again and start my
next<00:01:24.329> layer<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.720> trees<00:01:25.130> it's<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
next layer of trees it's going to be a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.120 
next layer of trees it's going to be a
little<00:01:26.640> darker<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.560> move<00:01:28.740> into<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
little darker so we move into the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.300 
little darker so we move into the
distance<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.270> I'll<00:01:30.570> paint<00:01:30.869> out<00:01:31.189> carving<00:01:32.189> out

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
distance and I'll paint out carving out

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.600 
distance and I'll paint out carving out
the<00:01:32.490> next<00:01:32.790> tree<00:01:33.950> want<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.100> make<00:01:35.250> sure<00:01:35.280> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the next tree want to make sure you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.270 
the next tree want to make sure you
include<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.210> lot<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.479> different<00:01:36.860> widths<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
include a lot of different widths of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.700 
include a lot of different widths of
your<00:01:38.460> trees<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.450> also<00:01:39.659> want<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.140> focus<00:01:40.350> on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
your trees and you also want to focus on

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.010 
your trees and you also want to focus on
having<00:01:40.979> different<00:01:41.460> spacing<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.720> point

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
having different spacing at this point

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440 
having different spacing at this point
these<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> same<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.909> I'll<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.329> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
these are all the same so I'll have to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:58.670 
these are all the same so I'll have to
keep<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.020> mind<00:01:46.290> when<00:01:47.219> I'm<00:01:47.340> working

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.760 

this<00:01:59.310> limb<00:01:59.670> goes<00:02:00.210> behind<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.840> tree<00:02:01.230> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
this limb goes behind this tree and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:12.160 
this limb goes behind this tree and
it'll<00:02:02.040> pull<00:02:02.220> up<00:02:02.250> here

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:34.880 

you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.619 

to<00:02:35.890> just<00:02:36.129> use<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> little<00:02:36.519> bit<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.909> this<00:02:37.269> blue

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
to just use a little bit of this blue

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.860 
to just use a little bit of this blue
just<00:02:38.439> to<00:02:38.560> catch<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.159> bit<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.459> color<00:02:39.760> along<00:02:40.659> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
just to catch a bit of color along the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.099 
just to catch a bit of color along the
rim<00:02:41.459> I'll<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.700> scratch<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.989> the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
rim I'll just scratch it on to the

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.839 
rim I'll just scratch it on to the
surface<00:02:46.319> working<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.469> watercolor<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.370> pastel
