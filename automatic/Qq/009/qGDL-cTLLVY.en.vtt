so pretty much as strategy all I really
do<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.610> kind<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.910> run<00:00:36.059> around<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.420> map<00:00:36.630> um<00:00:37.100> just

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
do is kind of run around the map um just

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.280 
do is kind of run around the map um just
kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> goats<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:39.210> point<00:00:39.570> I'm<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.050> gonna

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
kind of goats like point I'm just gonna

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.860 
kind of goats like point I'm just gonna
go<00:00:40.379> from<00:00:40.620> points<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.309> mainframe<00:00:41.940> trench

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
go from points here so mainframe trench

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.360 
go from points here so mainframe trench
gun<00:00:43.050> area<00:00:44.510> across<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.840> bridge<00:00:46.100> down<00:00:47.100> through

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
gun area across the bridge down through

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.639 
gun area across the bridge down through
Thompson<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.149> repeat<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.719> pretty<00:00:49.590> much

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
Thompson and repeat and pretty much

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.930 
Thompson and repeat and pretty much
that's<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.250> you'll<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that's it and you'll see it in the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.750 
that's it and you'll see it in the
background<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.110> um<00:00:52.559> yeah<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> strategy<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
background so um yeah the strategy is

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.979 
background so um yeah the strategy is
really<00:00:54.059> good<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.270> can<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.750> high<00:00:54.930> as

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
really good you can get as high as

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.310 
really good you can get as high as
around<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> want<00:00:55.770> i<00:00:56.039> mean<00:00:56.550> i<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:57.329> i<00:00:57.660> like

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to have the Wunderwaffe and the thompson

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
to have the Wunderwaffe and the thompson
the<00:01:00.149> only<00:01:00.510> reason<00:01:00.960> i<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> thompson<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the only reason i have the thompson is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.130 
the only reason i have the thompson is
to<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.370> points<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.120> Wunderwaffe<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.960> i

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to get points and the Wunderwaffe if i

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
to get points and the Wunderwaffe if i
get<00:01:04.290> stuck<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> sticky<00:01:05.040> situation<00:01:05.510> but

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
get stuck in a sticky situation but

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.570 
get stuck in a sticky situation but
mostly<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.080> kill<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> zombies<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:08.159> use<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
mostly to kill the zombies i use the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
mostly to kill the zombies i use the
traps<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> traps<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.500> nice

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
traps and the traps are really nice

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.590 
traps and the traps are really nice
because<00:01:10.860> there's<00:01:11.100> three<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.670> throughout

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
because there's three of them throughout

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.679 
because there's three of them throughout
the<00:01:12.780> map<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.420> spot

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the map and if you do get in a spot

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
the map and if you do get in a spot
where<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.040> trapped<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> corner<00:01:17.820> you

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
where you get trapped in a corner you

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.030 
where you get trapped in a corner you
can<00:01:18.030> use<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.299> Wunderwaffe<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.200> say<00:01:19.500> zombies

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
can use your Wunderwaffe and say zombies

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.890 
can use your Wunderwaffe and say zombies
are<00:01:20.159> blocking<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> pathway<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
are blocking you to get to a pathway you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.749 
are blocking you to get to a pathway you
can<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.259> run<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.619> through<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> teleporter<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
can just run in through a teleporter and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.120 
can just run in through a teleporter and
this<00:01:24.360> map<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.930> kind<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.590> kind<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> tight

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
this map it's kind it's kind of tight

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
this map it's kind it's kind of tight
but<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.420> hard<00:01:28.080> i<00:01:28.409> guess<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:30.380> yeah

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
but it's not that hard i guess and yeah

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.860 
but it's not that hard i guess and yeah
so<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.280> whatever<00:01:33.060> round<00:01:33.630> you

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
so you can just go whatever round you

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.760 
so you can just go whatever round you
I<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.560> got<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.940> messed<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.630> end<00:01:36.810> but

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
I just got I just messed up the end but

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.880 
I just got I just messed up the end but
um<00:01:37.950> yeah<00:01:38.550> me<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.880> my<00:01:38.970> friends<00:01:39.300> Winston<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:40.650> did

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
um yeah me and my friends Winston we did

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
um yeah me and my friends Winston we did
this<00:01:41.010> map<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.660> did<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.900> strategy

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
this map and we did the strategy

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.290 
this map and we did the strategy
together<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.970> pretty<00:01:45.090> much<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
together and so it's pretty much the

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.970 
together and so it's pretty much the
same<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.080> he<00:01:46.410> was<00:01:46.620> running

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
same thing it's just he was running

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.380 
same thing it's just he was running
right<00:01:47.130> next<00:01:47.400> to<00:01:47.490> me<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.610> whole<00:01:47.730> way<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.060> we

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
right next to me the whole way and we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.920

the<00:03:33.000> easiest<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.690> don't<00:03:33.840> know<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:33.990> you<00:03:34.080> guys

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the easiest I don't know if you guys

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.840 
the easiest I don't know if you guys
know<00:03:34.440> how<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.590> run<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:34.950> column<00:03:35.220> room<00:03:35.430> it's

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
know how to run the column room it's

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.590 
know how to run the column room it's
probably<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.750> easiest<00:03:37.200> map<00:03:37.530> ever<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.490> if<00:03:39.450> you

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
probably the easiest map ever and if you

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.300 
probably the easiest map ever and if you
don't<00:03:39.780> know<00:03:39.990> about<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.590> search<00:03:40.830> running

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
don't know about it just search running

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.120 
don't know about it just search running
the<00:03:41.400> comm<00:03:41.580> room<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:41.970> guess<00:03:42.110> but<00:03:43.110> um<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.560> guess<00:03:43.890> I

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
the comm room I guess but um I guess I

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.430 
the comm room I guess but um I guess I
could<00:03:44.490> post<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.880> gameplay<00:03:45.240> of<00:03:45.270> me<00:03:45.570> running<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
could post a gameplay of me running the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.050 
could post a gameplay of me running the
common<00:03:46.680> room<00:03:46.830> it's<00:03:47.010> just<00:03:47.280> there's<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:47.940> many

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
common room it's just there's so many

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.430 
common room it's just there's so many
people<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.450> already<00:03:48.630> have<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.200> out<00:03:49.410> there

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
people that already have that out there

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.300 
people that already have that out there
and<00:03:50.390> they've<00:03:51.390> gotten<00:03:52.200> do<00:03:52.350> like<00:03:52.650> really<00:03:53.160> high

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
and they've gotten do like really high

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.490 
and they've gotten do like really high
rounds<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:53.910> yoteslaya<00:03:54.300> he's<00:03:55.080> gotten<00:03:55.380> to

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
rounds like yoteslaya he's gotten to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.250 
rounds like yoteslaya he's gotten to
round<00:03:56.070> leap<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.760> there's<00:03:57.690> no<00:03:57.900> way<00:03:58.050> I'm<00:03:58.170> gonna

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
round leap and there's no way I'm gonna

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.850 
round leap and there's no way I'm gonna
play<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.560> long<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.820> um<00:04:00.350> I'm<00:04:01.350> gonna<00:04:01.590> try<00:04:01.800> to

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
play that long but um I'm gonna try to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.070 
play that long but um I'm gonna try to
play<00:04:02.040> as<00:04:02.130> much<00:04:02.459> as<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.700> can<00:04:02.760> like<00:04:03.150> my<00:04:03.330> friend<00:04:03.660> DC

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
play as much as I can like my friend DC

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
to get the highest round i can on all

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.159 
to get the highest round i can on all
the<00:04:13.560> maps<00:04:13.770> if<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.459> do<00:04:14.910> add<00:04:15.239> me<00:04:15.450> on<00:04:15.480> xbox<00:04:15.989> and

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
the maps if you do add me on xbox and

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.659 
the maps if you do add me on xbox and
just<00:04:16.320> look<00:04:16.470> at<00:04:16.590> my<00:04:16.680> bio<00:04:16.890> I've<00:04:17.280> got<00:04:17.459> all<00:04:17.640> my

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
just look at my bio I've got all my

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.819 
just look at my bio I've got all my
highest<00:04:18.150> rounds<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.690> don't<00:04:19.290> really<00:04:19.410> have<00:04:19.500> them

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
highest rounds I don't really have them

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.620 
highest rounds I don't really have them
off<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.100> top<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.310> my<00:04:20.459> head<00:04:20.669> right<00:04:20.940> now<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.150> if

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
off the top of my head right now but if

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.450 
off the top of my head right now but if
you<00:04:21.900> really<00:04:22.200> want<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.530> know<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:23.100> look<00:04:23.310> it

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
you really want to know you just look it

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.610 
you really want to know you just look it
up<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:25.220> yeah<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:27.180> moon<00:04:27.390> I'm<00:04:28.200> just<00:04:28.470> going

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
up and yeah so the moon I'm just going

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.130 
up and yeah so the moon I'm just going
to<00:04:28.680> talk<00:04:28.830> about<00:04:28.950> my<00:04:29.070> thoughts<00:04:29.400> on<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.700> moon<00:04:30.140> it

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
to talk about my thoughts on the moon it

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.530 
to talk about my thoughts on the moon it
looks<00:04:31.200> like<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.500> pretty<00:04:31.740> fun<00:04:32.010> map<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.970> low

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
looks like a pretty fun map like the low

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.170 
looks like a pretty fun map like the low
gravity<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.160> don't<00:04:35.790> know<00:04:35.910> what<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.150> think

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
gravity that I don't know what to think

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.610 
gravity that I don't know what to think
about<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:36.600> yet<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.020> think<00:04:37.350> it'll<00:04:37.470> be

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
about that yet I think it'll be

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.520 
about that yet I think it'll be
different<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.580> that's<00:04:39.260> kind<00:04:40.260> of<00:04:40.320> what<00:04:40.410> it

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
different and that's kind of what it

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.140 
different and that's kind of what it
needs<00:04:40.740> because<00:04:41.040> zombies<00:04:41.280> can't<00:04:41.760> get<00:04:41.910> bored

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
needs because zombies can't get bored

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.030 
needs because zombies can't get bored
and<00:04:42.300> repetitive<00:04:42.840> but<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:43.500> don't<00:04:43.710> want<00:04:43.830> them<00:04:43.919> to

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
and repetitive but I don't want them to

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.400 
and repetitive but I don't want them to
screw<00:04:44.310> it<00:04:44.430> up<00:04:44.520> like<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.810> call<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.229> dead<00:04:46.380> i

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
screw it up like and call the dead i

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.690 
screw it up like and call the dead i
feel<00:04:46.740> like<00:04:46.860> they<00:04:46.979> kind<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.220> screwed<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.580> up

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
feel like they kind of screwed it up

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.860 
feel like they kind of screwed it up
like<00:04:48.360> george<00:04:49.290> he's<00:04:50.070> he's<00:04:50.970> kind<00:04:51.240> of<00:04:51.390> really

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
like george he's he's kind of really

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.110 
like george he's he's kind of really
annoying<00:04:52.169> I<00:04:52.470> don't<00:04:53.340> know<00:04:53.460> how<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.640> put<00:04:53.820> that<00:04:53.940> in

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
annoying I don't know how to put that in

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.270 
annoying I don't know how to put that in
any<00:04:54.240> other<00:04:54.419> way<00:04:54.630> he's<00:04:54.840> annoying<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:56.010> I<00:04:56.100> mean

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
any other way he's annoying and I mean

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.920 
any other way he's annoying and I mean
the<00:04:56.400> map<00:04:56.580> wouldn't<00:04:57.060> be<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.270> same<00:04:57.450> without<00:04:57.600> him

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
the map wouldn't be the same without him

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.469 
the map wouldn't be the same without him
but<00:04:58.229> George<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:59.130> think<00:04:59.340> we<00:04:59.430> can<00:04:59.550> all<00:04:59.700> agree<00:04:59.729> he's

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
but George I think we can all agree he's

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.240 
but George I think we can all agree he's
extremely<00:05:00.870> annoying<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.530> play<00:05:01.710> with<00:05:01.919> on<00:05:02.100> call

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
extremely annoying to play with on call

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.200 
extremely annoying to play with on call
of<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.460> dead<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.620> hope<00:05:04.890> that<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:06.000> moon

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
of the dead and so I hope that the moon

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.270 
of the dead and so I hope that the moon
map<00:05:06.419> i<00:05:06.600> hope<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.930> low<00:05:07.080> gravity<00:05:07.320> isn't<00:05:07.979> going

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
map i hope the low gravity isn't going

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.860 
map i hope the low gravity isn't going
to<00:05:08.340> be<00:05:08.490> like<00:05:08.640> that<00:05:08.700> I<00:05:09.150> hope<00:05:09.360> it's<00:05:09.540> not<00:05:09.630> going<00:05:09.810> to

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
to be like that I hope it's not going to

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.409 
to be like that I hope it's not going to
ruin

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
ruin

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.700 
ruin

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.820 
but like I said I hope it doesn't ruin
it<00:05:17.540> because<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:17.900> does<00:05:18.080> look<00:05:18.350> like<00:05:18.380> it'll<00:05:18.680> be<00:05:18.740> a

what people are saying it is is pretty

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.460 
what people are saying it is is pretty
much<00:05:44.919> how<00:05:45.919> I<00:05:45.950> you<00:05:46.700> just<00:05:46.880> get<00:05:47.090> you<00:05:47.690> buy<00:05:48.169> it<00:05:48.229> and

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
much how I you just get you buy it and

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.560 
much how I you just get you buy it and
you<00:05:48.530> can<00:05:48.650> get<00:05:48.740> three<00:05:49.040> guns<00:05:49.280> and<00:05:50.210> then<00:05:50.330> when<00:05:50.479> you

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
you can get three guns and then when you

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.950 
you can get three guns and then when you
go<00:05:50.690> down<00:05:50.990> you<00:05:52.090> lose<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.360> gun<00:05:53.510> that<00:05:53.630> you<00:05:53.690> had

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
go down you lose the gun that you had

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.780 
go down you lose the gun that you had
out<00:05:54.169> but<00:05:54.650> when<00:05:54.889> you<00:05:54.979> buy<00:05:55.130> it<00:05:55.190> again<00:05:55.370> you<00:05:55.669> can

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
out but when you buy it again you can

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.140 
out but when you buy it again you can
get<00:05:55.940> that<00:05:56.090> gun<00:05:56.300> back<00:05:56.479> and<00:05:57.010> that<00:05:58.010> that<00:05:58.940> does

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
get that gun back and that that does

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.909 
get that gun back and that that does
sound<00:05:59.360> like<00:05:59.479> a<00:05:59.540> kind<00:05:59.810> of<00:05:59.900> cool<00:06:00.020> perk<00:06:00.320> because

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
sound like a kind of cool perk because

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.200 
sound like a kind of cool perk because
then<00:06:01.130> you<00:06:01.220> don't<00:06:01.250> have<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.610> do<00:06:01.700> any<00:06:01.850> kind<00:06:02.060> of

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
then you don't have to do any kind of

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.840 
then you don't have to do any kind of
glitches<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:03.139> do<00:06:03.320> that<00:06:03.560> you<00:06:04.310> can<00:06:04.460> just<00:06:04.610> do<00:06:04.729> it

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
glitches to do that you can just do it

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.810 
glitches to do that you can just do it
legit<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:05.389> I<00:06:06.350> think<00:06:06.830> it'd<00:06:06.919> be<00:06:06.950> fun<00:06:07.280> but<00:06:07.760> I
