years it's time for him to turn things

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.960 
years it's time for him to turn things
around<00:01:00.159> quickly<00:01:00.430> because<00:01:01.290> their<00:01:02.290> ranking

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
around quickly because their ranking

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.359 
around quickly because their ranking
falls<00:01:03.970> below<00:01:04.239> 50<00:01:04.780> or<00:01:04.869> 60<00:01:05.229> it<00:01:05.320> becomes<00:01:05.650> tougher

falls below 50 or 60 it becomes tougher

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.679 
falls below 50 or 60 it becomes tougher
and<00:01:06.490> tougher<00:01:06.549> to<00:01:06.850> get<00:01:06.970> into<00:01:07.150> these<00:01:07.240> masters

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689

1000<00:01:08.290> events<00:01:08.590> obviously<00:01:09.580> here<00:01:09.760> in<00:01:09.820> Miami<00:01:10.119> it's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
1000 events obviously here in Miami it's

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.380 
1000 events obviously here in Miami it's
the<00:01:10.360> bigger<00:01:10.600> draw<00:01:10.900> so<00:01:11.200> it's<00:01:11.380> easier<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.040> get<00:01:12.189> in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the bigger draw so it's easier to get in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.179 
the bigger draw so it's easier to get in
but<00:01:13.390> once<00:01:13.570> we<00:01:13.780> swing<00:01:14.439> onto<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.710> hard<00:01:14.920> courts

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
but once we swing onto the hard courts

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.399 
but once we swing onto the hard courts
where<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.759> draw<00:01:16.450> sizes<00:01:17.020> are<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.200> little

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
where the draw sizes are a little

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.710 
where the draw sizes are a little
smaller<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.939> you're<00:01:19.060> not<00:01:19.150> getting<00:01:19.420> into<00:01:19.630> these

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
smaller if you're not getting into these

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.149 
smaller if you're not getting into these
events<00:01:20.080> it's<00:01:20.290> very<00:01:20.470> tough<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.830> come<00:01:20.979> through

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
events it's very tough to come through

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.120 
events it's very tough to come through
qualifying<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:21.970> course<00:01:22.180> sir<00:01:22.920> points<00:01:23.920> all
