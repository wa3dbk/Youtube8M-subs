00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.860 

let's<00:00:05.930> go<00:00:06.140> now<00:00:06.590> to<00:00:06.620> the<00:00:06.950> durian<00:00:07.700> up<00:00:08.000> you'll

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
let's go now to the durian up you'll

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.470 
let's go now to the durian up you'll
notice<00:00:09.260> that<00:00:09.500> these<00:00:10.460> are<00:00:10.820> all<00:00:11.059> the<00:00:11.270> same

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
notice that these are all the same

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.980 
notice that these are all the same
chords<00:00:12.139> and<00:00:12.830> but<00:00:13.760> just<00:00:14.000> starting<00:00:16.180> on<00:00:17.180> a

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
chords and but just starting on a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.470 
chords and but just starting on a
different<00:00:18.710> starting<00:00:19.640> with<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.000> different

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
different starting with a different

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.740 
different starting with a different
degree<00:00:20.770> basically<00:00:21.770> so<00:00:22.250> I<00:00:22.280> started<00:00:23.060> on<00:00:23.270> the

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
degree basically so I started on the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.900 
degree basically so I started on the
second<00:00:24.820> note<00:00:25.820> of<00:00:26.690> the<00:00:26.930> C<00:00:27.140> major<00:00:27.350> scale<00:00:27.910> instead

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
second note of the C major scale instead

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.480 
second note of the C major scale instead
of<00:00:28.940> the<00:00:29.090> first<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:30.020> I'm<00:00:30.110> starting<00:00:30.530> on<00:00:30.680> D<00:00:31.100> minor

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
of the first so I'm starting on D minor

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.229 
of the first so I'm starting on D minor
and<00:00:32.440> of<00:00:33.440> course<00:00:33.680> it's<00:00:33.949> a<00:00:34.129> minor<00:00:34.699> 7<00:00:35.680> 7<00:00:36.680> major<00:00:37.460> 7

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
and of course it's a minor 7 7 major 7

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.639 
and of course it's a minor 7 7 major 7
dominant<00:00:38.750> seven<00:00:39.079> minor<00:00:39.680> 7<00:00:40.130> flat<00:00:40.550> 5<00:00:41.120> minor<00:00:41.630> 7<00:00:42.050> up

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
dominant seven minor 7 flat 5 minor 7 up

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.750 
dominant seven minor 7 flat 5 minor 7 up
to<00:00:42.920> see<00:00:43.220> major<00:00:43.610> 7th<00:00:44.210> in<00:00:44.329> an<00:00:44.600> octave<00:00:45.140> above<00:00:45.320> that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
to see major 7th in an octave above that

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.340 
to see major 7th in an octave above that
d<00:00:46.760> minor<00:00:47.060> seventh<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.600> what<00:00:47.630> you<00:00:47.870> started<00:00:48.290> with

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
d minor seventh of what you started with

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.460 
d minor seventh of what you started with
so<00:00:48.890> that's<00:00:49.160> what<00:00:49.610> a<00:00:49.640> Dorian<00:00:50.329> well<00:00:51.170> it<00:00:51.290> sounds

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
so that's what a Dorian well it sounds

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.380 
so that's what a Dorian well it sounds
like<00:00:51.710> harmonically<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.790> I'm<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.210> course

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
like harmonically and I'm of course

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.580 
like harmonically and I'm of course
using<00:00:53.809> 7th<00:00:54.290> chords<00:00:54.739> because<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:56.290> think<00:00:57.290> they're

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
using 7th chords because I think they're

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.760 
using 7th chords because I think they're
more<00:00:57.739> interesting<00:00:58.370> harmonically<00:00:59.239> that's<00:00:59.570> all

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
more interesting harmonically that's all

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:18.460 
more interesting harmonically that's all
so<00:01:00.770> here's<00:01:01.010> Dorian<00:01:01.579> one<00:01:01.760> more<00:01:01.940> time

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.800 

so<00:01:19.470> let's<00:01:19.680> take<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.980> closer<00:01:20.430> look<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:21.300> at<00:01:21.660> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so let's take a closer look now at the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.710 
so let's take a closer look now at the
left<00:01:22.200> hand<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.730> how<00:01:23.760> I<00:01:24.000> finger

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
left hand so you can see how I finger

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.230 
left hand so you can see how I finger
each<00:01:24.960> chord<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:27.630> Dorian<00:01:28.140> mode<00:01:28.910> from<00:01:29.910> minor

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
each chord the Dorian mode from minor

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.410 
each chord the Dorian mode from minor
chords<00:01:31.230> minor<00:01:31.430> starting<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.550> D<00:01:32.760> minor<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
chords minor starting on D minor and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:02:07.640 
chords minor starting on D minor and
going<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:33.780> knock<00:01:33.930> above<00:02:04.610> now<00:02:05.610> let's<00:02:05.940> go<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
going to knock above now let's go to the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.090 
going to knock above now let's go to the
modes<00:02:07.980> in<00:02:08.340> scaleform<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:10.110> Dorian<00:02:10.590> starting

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
modes in scaleform the Dorian starting

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.780 
modes in scaleform the Dorian starting
on<00:02:11.250> D

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.910 

let's<00:02:19.790> take<00:02:19.969> a<00:02:20.000> real<00:02:20.329> close<00:02:20.510> look<00:02:20.959> at<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.709> left

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
let's take a real close look at the left

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.539 
let's take a real close look at the left
hand<00:02:22.099> I<00:02:22.609> want<00:02:23.329> to<00:02:23.420> show<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.950> exactly<00:02:24.950> how<00:02:25.219> I

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
hand I want to show you exactly how I

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.199 
hand I want to show you exactly how I
approach<00:02:26.269> each<00:02:27.079> mode<00:02:27.709> we're<00:02:28.340> going<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.489> do<00:02:28.640> one

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
approach each mode we're going to do one

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.630 
approach each mode we're going to do one
mode<00:02:29.480> at<00:02:29.659> a<00:02:29.750> time<00:02:30.099> not<00:02:31.099> only<00:02:31.450> will<00:02:32.450> we<00:02:32.480> look<00:02:32.989> at

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
mode at a time not only will we look at

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.140 
mode at a time not only will we look at
the<00:02:34.640> way<00:02:34.879> I<00:02:34.909> played<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.590> scales<00:02:36.939> single<00:02:37.939> note

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the way I played the scales single note

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.190 
the way I played the scales single note
the<00:02:38.959> way<00:02:39.109> you<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.319> heard<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.859> modes<00:02:40.239> but<00:02:41.239> I'm

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
the way you just heard the modes but I'm

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.949 
the way you just heard the modes but I'm
also<00:02:42.470> going<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:42.890> show<00:02:43.159> you<00:02:43.659> variations<00:02:44.659> and

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
also going to show you variations and

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.030 
also going to show you variations and
I'll<00:02:45.620> explain<00:02:45.950> as<00:02:46.250> we<00:02:46.280> go<00:02:47.680> let's<00:02:48.680> do<00:02:48.889> the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
I'll explain as we go let's do the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.229 
I'll explain as we go let's do the
Dorian<00:02:50.560> first<00:02:51.560> single<00:02:51.980> note<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.970> one

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
Dorian first single note and this one

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:03.090 
Dorian first single note and this one
I'm<00:02:53.450> going<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.629> do<00:02:53.870> all<00:02:54.819> with<00:02:55.819> slurs<00:02:56.299> first

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.300 

I

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:21.100 

you

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.000 

now<00:03:22.110> let's<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:24.930> starting<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.710> slurs

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
now let's do just starting with slurs

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:37.900 
now let's do just starting with slurs
and<00:03:26.490> then<00:03:27.230> striking<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.500> strings<00:03:28.860> like<00:03:29.250> this

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.790 

and<00:03:38.910> then<00:03:39.330> on<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.750> first<00:03:40.020> ring<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
and then on the first ring you do the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.530 
and then on the first ring you do the
turnaround<00:03:41.310> with<00:03:41.670> all<00:03:41.910> slurred<00:03:42.240> and<00:03:44.540> striking

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
turnaround with all slurred and striking

00:03:45.540 --> 00:04:11.040 
turnaround with all slurred and striking
the<00:03:45.660> street<00:03:45.930> speech<00:03:53.300> so<00:03:54.300> like<00:03:55.170> this

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.759 

now<00:04:12.050> let's<00:04:12.319> do<00:04:12.620> tues<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.900> this<00:04:14.900> will<00:04:15.200> help<00:04:15.230> you

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
now let's do tues and this will help you

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.710 
now let's do tues and this will help you
give<00:04:16.579> you<00:04:16.699> a<00:04:16.730> little<00:04:18.220> hint<00:04:19.220> here<00:04:19.609> when<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:20.510> do

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
give you a little hint here when you do

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.969 
give you a little hint here when you do
tues<00:04:21.550> try<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.610> think<00:04:23.060> in<00:04:23.389> groups<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.169> two<00:04:24.470> only

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
tues try to think in groups of two only

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:34.570 
tues try to think in groups of two only
like<00:04:25.780> accent<00:04:26.780> basically<00:04:27.380> going<00:04:33.400> so<00:04:34.400> you're

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
like accent basically going so you're

00:04:34.580 --> 00:05:06.810 
like accent basically going so you're
exiting<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.750> boy<00:04:39.220> notice<00:04:40.220> the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:18.990 

let's<00:05:07.820> do<00:05:08.120> three
