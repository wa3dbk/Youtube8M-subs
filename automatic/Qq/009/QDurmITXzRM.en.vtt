00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
explorers still disappear without trace

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.240 
explorers still disappear without trace
this<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> time<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.989> fortune<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.620> change<00:02:43.920> a

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
this is a time of fortune and change a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.210 
this is a time of fortune and change a
time<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> risk<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.629> reward<00:02:45.720> a<00:02:46.200> time<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.129> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
time of risk and reward a time for the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.319 
time of risk and reward a time for the
elite<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:50.069> that's<00:02:50.220> basically<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.700> fiction

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
elite so that's basically the fiction

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.559 
elite so that's basically the fiction
set<00:02:51.599> up<00:02:51.780> from<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.530> start<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:52.920> game<00:02:53.069> and

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
set up from the start of the game and

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.670 
set up from the start of the game and
obviously<00:02:54.569> as<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.900> start<00:02:55.140> playing<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.530> game

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
obviously as you start playing the game

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.410 
obviously as you start playing the game
you'll<00:02:55.950> get<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.489> know<00:02:56.670> more<00:02:56.970> about<00:02:57.090> what's

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
you'll get to know more about what's

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.410 
you'll get to know more about what's
what's<00:02:57.810> going<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.260> detail<00:02:58.409> and<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> now<00:03:00.209> I'm

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
what's going on in detail and so now I'm

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.780 
what's going on in detail and so now I'm
going<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.629> answer<00:03:00.780> three<00:03:01.200> questions<00:03:01.730> put<00:03:02.730> by

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
going to answer three questions put by

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.210 
going to answer three questions put by
the<00:03:02.970> DDF<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.709> first<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.069> from

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the DDF and so the first one is from

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.180 
the DDF and so the first one is from
commandant<00:03:05.909> a<00:03:06.530> approximately<00:03:07.530> how<00:03:07.829> much<00:03:08.010> of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
commandant a approximately how much of

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.740 
commandant a approximately how much of
the<00:03:08.280> unique<00:03:08.489> universe<00:03:08.909> will<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.269> known<00:03:09.480> and

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
the unique universe will be known and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.780 
the unique universe will be known and
match<00:03:09.959> when<00:03:10.349> starting<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.920> game<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.310> how

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
match when starting the game and how

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.259 
match when starting the game and how
much<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.180> unknown<00:03:13.159> well<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.670> easy<00:03:14.819> answer<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
much is unknown well the easy answer is

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.960 
much is unknown well the easy answer is
that<00:03:15.709> humanity<00:03:16.760> occupies<00:03:17.760> less<00:03:17.790> than<00:03:18.359> 1%<00:03:18.930> of

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
that humanity occupies less than 1% of

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.589 
that humanity occupies less than 1% of
known<00:03:20.970> space<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.799> where<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.160> think<00:03:23.430> about<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.639> 215

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
known space so where I think about a 215

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.800 
known space so where I think about a 215
Lightyear<00:03:24.900> bubble<00:03:25.260> will<00:03:26.040> be<00:03:26.130> inhabited<00:03:26.810> we'll

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
Lightyear bubble will be inhabited we'll

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.420 
Lightyear bubble will be inhabited we'll
also<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.290> sort<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.680> border<00:03:28.980> region<00:03:29.310> now

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
also have a sort of border region now

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.490 
also have a sort of border region now
that<00:03:29.700> probably<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.569> 50<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.019> 100<00:03:31.319> light-years

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
that probably of 50 to 100 light-years

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.309 
that probably of 50 to 100 light-years
which<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.609> sort<00:03:32.849> of<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.239> little<00:03:33.720> bit<00:03:33.840> explored

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
which is sort of a little bit explored

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.250 
which is sort of a little bit explored
but<00:03:34.500> not<00:03:34.709> not<00:03:35.549> too<00:03:35.609> in<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.819> great<00:03:36.000> detail<00:03:36.329> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
but not not too in a great detail and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.680 
but not not too in a great detail and
then<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.620> rest<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:37.980> galaxy<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:39.120> available

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
then the rest of the galaxy is available

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.110 
then the rest of the galaxy is available
there<00:03:40.319> will<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.470> some<00:03:40.799> areas<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.430> will<00:03:41.639> keep

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
there will be some areas that will keep

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.869 
there will be some areas that will keep
blocked<00:03:42.389> off<00:03:42.599> for<00:03:42.720> now<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.739> that'll<00:03:44.519> be<00:03:44.609> part

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
blocked off for now and that'll be part

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.729 
blocked off for now and that'll be part
of<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.269> expansions<00:03:45.870> for<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.620> know

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
of the expansions for you know

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:47.930 
of the expansions for you know
encountering<00:03:47.280> new<00:03:47.430> things<00:03:47.639> like<00:03:47.849> the

question is from snow ghost we'll go up
and<00:03:53.280> make<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.430> return<00:03:53.849> after<00:03:54.180> being

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
and make a return after being

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.059 
and make a return after being
effectively<00:03:54.780> wiped<00:03:55.169> out<00:03:55.349> somewhere<00:03:55.799> between

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
effectively wiped out somewhere between

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.449 
effectively wiped out somewhere between
elite<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.699> frontier<00:03:57.799> so<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.069> answer<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.370> that

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
elite and frontier so the answer to that

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.909 
elite and frontier so the answer to that
is<00:03:59.699> I'm<00:03:59.849> afraid<00:04:00.000> gaol<00:04:00.389> copies<00:04:00.870> condensed<00:04:01.709> here

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
is I'm afraid gaol copies condensed here

the last question is from Nicholas van
Rijn<00:04:16.139> are<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.220> going<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.459> enforce<00:04:17.849> more<00:04:18.180> or

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
Rijn are you going to enforce more or

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.000 
Rijn are you going to enforce more or
less<00:04:18.449> strict<00:04:18.870> law<00:04:19.079> consistency<00:04:19.829> between

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
less strict law consistency between

less strict law consistency between

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
narrative products the role-playing game

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.120 
narrative products the role-playing game
and<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.349> game<00:04:22.500> universe<00:04:23.419> yes<00:04:24.419> very<00:04:24.780> much<00:04:24.810> so

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
and the game universe yes very much so

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.900 
and the game universe yes very much so
we're<00:04:26.130> working<00:04:26.250> with<00:04:26.460> the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
we're working with the

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.250 
we're working with the
authors<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.510> make<00:04:27.540> sure<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:28.080> they're<00:04:28.230> using

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
authors to make sure that they're using

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.710 
authors to make sure that they're using
the<00:04:28.590> same<00:04:28.770> guidelines<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.790> same<00:04:30.000> fiction

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
the same guidelines and the same fiction

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.720 
the same guidelines and the same fiction
that<00:04:30.930> we<00:04:30.990> are<00:04:31.290> with<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.560> game<00:04:31.740> obviously

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
that we are with the game obviously

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.070 
that we are with the game obviously
there's<00:04:32.940> some<00:04:33.150> things<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:33.690> can<00:04:33.840> do<00:04:33.960> in

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
there's some things that you can do in

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.410 
there's some things that you can do in
fiction<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.710> can't<00:04:34.920> do<00:04:35.100> in<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.280> game<00:04:35.430> so

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
fiction that you can't do in the game so

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.510 
fiction that you can't do in the game so
a<00:04:36.720> good<00:04:36.930> example<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.560> landing<00:04:38.430> on

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
a good example of that is landing on

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.940 
a good example of that is landing on
planets<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.990> that's<00:04:40.170> not<00:04:40.350> possible<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:40.860> the

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
planets so that's not possible in the

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.320 
planets so that's not possible in the
initial<00:04:41.280> version<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:41.760> game<00:04:41.910> although

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
initial version of the game although

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.900 
initial version of the game although
it's<00:04:42.510> certainly<00:04:42.630> plan<00:04:42.960> for<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.290> future<00:04:43.530> release

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
it's certainly plan for a future release

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.280 
it's certainly plan for a future release
but<00:04:44.910> in<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.150> fiction<00:04:45.510> there's<00:04:45.720> no<00:04:45.840> there's<00:04:46.230> no

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
but in the fiction there's no there's no

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.100 
but in the fiction there's no there's no
such<00:04:46.560> restriction<00:04:47.180> but<00:04:48.180> yes<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.840> worlds

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
such restriction but yes that the worlds

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.580 
such restriction but yes that the worlds
will<00:04:49.260> be<00:04:49.290> consistent<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.020> that's<00:04:52.200> it<00:04:52.410> for

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
will be consistent so that's it for

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.410 
will be consistent so that's it for
today's<00:04:53.100> fiction<00:04:53.670> though<00:04:53.790> I<00:04:54.090> hope<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.300> found

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420

that interesting and I look forward to

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.490 
that interesting and I look forward to
