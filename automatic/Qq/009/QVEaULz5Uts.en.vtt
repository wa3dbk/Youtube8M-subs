painting this will be more of a
refresher<00:00:04.110> I'm<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.190> go<00:00:05.310> over<00:00:05.339> some<00:00:05.759> of

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
refresher I'm going to go over some of

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.299 
refresher I'm going to go over some of
the<00:00:05.910> techniques<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.990> are<00:00:07.410> very<00:00:07.620> useful<00:00:08.189> and

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the techniques that are very useful and

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.330 
the techniques that are very useful and
needed<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:08.880> spray<00:00:09.120> painting<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.889> will<00:00:10.889> be<00:00:11.010> an

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
needed in spray painting this will be an

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.990 
needed in spray painting this will be an
easy<00:00:11.610> painting<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.750> call<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.139> reminder

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
easy painting and I call it a reminder

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.330 
easy painting and I call it a reminder
all<00:00:15.000> right<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:16.170> time<00:00:16.260> using<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.680> stencil<00:00:16.890> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
all right first time using a stencil you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.890 
all right first time using a stencil you
guys<00:00:17.490> remember<00:00:17.730> how<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> use<00:00:18.180> those<00:00:18.390> who<00:00:18.720> use

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
guys remember how to use those who use

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.220 
guys remember how to use those who use
them<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> create<00:00:19.260> our<00:00:19.500> planets<00:00:20.119> I<00:00:21.140> pretty<00:00:22.140> much

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
them to create our planets I pretty much

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
them to create our planets I pretty much
everything<00:00:22.939> now<00:00:23.939> we're<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> create<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
everything now we're going to create a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.109 
everything now we're going to create a
texture<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.519> I'm<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> little

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
texture here I'm going to use a little

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.200 
texture here I'm going to use a little
bit<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.359> red<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.199> blue<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> give

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
bit of red and blue is to going to give

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.299 
bit of red and blue is to going to give
you<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> rundown<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.920> what<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> look

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you a rundown of what it's going to look

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.090 
you a rundown of what it's going to look
like<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> first<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.350> put<00:00:34.469> our<00:00:34.620> bright<00:00:34.800> colors

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
like so first we put our bright colors

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.049 
like so first we put our bright colors
on<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> bottom<00:00:35.579> our<00:00:36.030> dark<00:00:36.329> colors<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.840> top<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
on the bottom our dark colors on top and

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.319 
on the bottom our dark colors on top and
when<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> remove<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:40.850> see<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
when you remove that see you get a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
when you remove that see you get a
texture<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:43.950> use<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
texture like this this is what we use to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.360 
texture like this this is what we use to
create<00:00:44.460> rocks<00:00:44.879> mountains<00:00:46.219> pretty<00:00:47.219> much

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
create rocks mountains pretty much

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.119 
create rocks mountains pretty much
anything<00:00:47.640> that's<00:00:48.200> that<00:00:49.200> requires<00:00:49.559> texture

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
anything that's that requires texture

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.819 
anything that's that requires texture
like<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.530> tap

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
like that see that and the more you tap

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.939 
like that see that and the more you tap
on<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.340> lighter<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> gets<00:00:54.710> all<00:00:55.710> right

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
on it well lighter it gets all right

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.090 
on it well lighter it gets all right
well<00:00:56.550> let's<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.390> ahead<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.570> cover<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.170> i'm

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
well let's go ahead and cover that i'm

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
well let's go ahead and cover that i'm
just<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> tear<00:00:59.699> random<00:01:00.090> pieces<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
just going to tear random pieces of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.799 
just going to tear random pieces of
magazine<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.879> just<00:01:02.879> give<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.600> I

magazine and just give it you know I
rough<00:01:04.500> texture<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.610> cross<00:01:06.830> will<00:01:07.830> put<00:01:08.070> up

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
rough texture to this cross will put up

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.429 
rough texture to this cross will put up
he's<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.630> we're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> add<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
know just bright colors throughout the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
know just bright colors throughout the
cross<00:01:13.040> different<00:01:14.040> pieces<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.490> magazine<00:01:16.369> all

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
cross different pieces of magazine all

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.399 
cross different pieces of magazine all
right<00:01:17.610> make<00:01:17.970> sure<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> spots<00:01:18.960> oh

this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.619> same<00:01:22.799> technique<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.400> use

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
this is the same technique that we use

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.880 
this is the same technique that we use
on<00:01:23.700> pyramids<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.200> remove<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> magazine

on pyramids when you remove the magazine
you<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.430> gives<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.790> pyramid<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.180> texture

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
you know gives a pyramid of texture

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.810 
you know gives a pyramid of texture
whether<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> Mayan<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.579> Egyptian

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
whether it be a Mayan or Egyptian

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
underneath I went ahead and put a light

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.200 
underneath I went ahead and put a light
color<00:01:39.860> green<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.100> light<00:01:41.549> layer<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.970> green

red surrounding this put the yellow on

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.980 
red surrounding this put the yellow on
there<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.439> little<00:01:58.469> bit<00:01:59.420> just<00:02:00.420> enough<00:02:00.600> so
