00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
kind of hard to see because it's really

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:37.040 
kind of hard to see because it's really
dark<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.960> here<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> garage<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.519> uh<00:00:36.050> turn

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
in one for you I mean they're pretty

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330 
in one for you I mean they're pretty
much<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.760> basic<00:00:39.300> headlights<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:41.100> course

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:54.790 
you know with the what the halo rings
this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:45.079> it's<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.469> light<00:00:47.039> shale<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.460> guess

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.369 

they<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> lights<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.539> or

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
they have to be on with the lights on or

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.090 
they have to be on with the lights on or
at<00:00:58.559> least<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> parking<00:00:59.340> lights<00:01:00.949> break<00:01:01.949> them

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
at least the parking lights break them

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:26.539 
at least the parking lights break them
up<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:03.080> toggle<00:01:04.080> switch

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.920 

but<00:01:27.549> yeah<00:01:27.729> that's<00:01:27.939> pretty<00:01:28.090> much<00:01:28.270> about<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.659> I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
but yeah that's pretty much about it I

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.429 
but yeah that's pretty much about it I
mean<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:31.329> can<00:01:31.360> turn<00:01:31.630> on<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.049> radar

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439

headlights

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.290 

it<00:02:46.430> looks<00:02:46.580> pretty<00:02:46.700> cool<00:02:47.000> with<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.270> HIDs<00:02:47.900> on

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
it looks pretty cool with the HIDs on

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:10.150 
it looks pretty cool with the HIDs on
well<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.330> mean<00:02:50.570> it's<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:50.990> fog<00:02:51.230> light<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.590> him<00:03:09.160> but

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
well I mean it's a fog light to him but

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:30.550 
well I mean it's a fog light to him but
yeah

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.440 

but<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.860> think<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.370> some<00:03:32.550> pretty<00:03:33.000> much<00:03:33.180> about

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
but I think that some pretty much about

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:43.780 
but I think that some pretty much about
it<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:38.790> I've<00:03:38.940> got<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.270> get<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.510> new<00:03:39.660> wheels<00:03:39.930> on

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.980 

but<00:03:44.790> that's<00:03:44.910> pretty<00:03:45.150> much<00:03:45.270> beside<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.840> point

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
but that's pretty much beside the point

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.080 
but that's pretty much beside the point
out<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.320> stock<00:03:46.650> wheels<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.430> at<00:03:47.670> wheels
