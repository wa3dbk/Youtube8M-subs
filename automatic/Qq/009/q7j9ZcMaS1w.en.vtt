 be fixed on smooth surfaces 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.899
 primarily on the glass inside the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.100
 discerning 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.920
 we in the midland have thought of three 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.630
 very robust and professional supports 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.939
 to guarantee you the excellent quality of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.130
 your films in collaboration indeed 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.409
 with the American company leader in the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.100
 professional coupling systems; 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.640
 the ram 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:13.530
 we created the run magnetic mount il 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.849
 quad bike run and ram roll bar mount the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.530
 first ram support I want 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.319
 to introduce you is our magnetic hour 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.510
 mount it is a support provided 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.090
 in the lower part of 3 very powerful 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.890
 magnets that allow a very effective 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.440
 and excellent grip on all 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.120
 metal surfaces but still if you want 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.700
 get suggestive shots 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.459
 you could fix your run mount 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.200
 in the side of your car e 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.310
 resume for example the wheel of 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.230
 your vehicle thanks to the membrane 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.690
 underlying that covers the three magnets is 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.879
 You can fix your run mount 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.000
 also on all delicate surfaces to 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.410
 example on painted surfaces the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.079
 second ram hook I want 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.750
 show you is the ram roll bar mount 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.299
 this hook allows to fix the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.239
 camera our xc to all 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.639
 perfect small tubulars 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.849
 therefore for the tubulars from one up to 3 cm 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.099
 and and guarantees an extreme and very good 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.870
 stability is possible for example 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.280
 use this type of support 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.349
 during your bike races 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.000
 or in motion then also in all 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.130
 those more extreme situations 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.260
 also in this case thanks to the double 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.419
 joint therefore thanks to the two spheres that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.370
 they are positioned in the upper part e 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.590
 at the bottom of the arm is 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.519
 possible to direct 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.540
 how you like your camera 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.610
 the last support branches I want 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.709
 to show you was quad bike like that 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.510
 that you see this support shown here 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.090
 lends itself perfectly to all 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.160
 medium and large tubulars 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.099
 then all the tubulars above 3 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.930
 cm this support to make you some 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.790
 example is perfect for applying the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.430
 camera to the tubulars that are found 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.720
 at the top of the off-road vehicles 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.410
 or even the tubulars that are found 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.030
 in the front of your heart 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.590
 this support is also perfect for the 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.510
 shock absorbers on your two wheels 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.310
 or even your quad and 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.760
 always guarantees the excellent quality of 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.760
 but a tram 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.299
 if you copy the basins probably 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.560
 softair hunting enthusiasts know 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.540
 already what he is talking about 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.910
 we in Milan have indeed 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.889
 expected this hook called 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.020
 precisely p catini that allows you to fix 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.990
 directly your camera to 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.090
 shoot all those guns or 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.000
 assault rifles for both hunting and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.270
 soft air that provide the b rail rails 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.970
 or this mounting rail 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.010
 knurled it is possible to fix precisely 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.780
 through our slick applied ni 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.780
 the camera directly on the rifle 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.260
 for all those guns instead of 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.180
 provide a larger diameter barrel 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.370
 or for all double-barreled rifles 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.990
 we can use another of the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.550
 supports that we milan put to 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.130
 available in the packaging of 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.710
 our cameras xc I'm talking about 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.990
 Velcro band always using one 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.570
 fake side 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.770
 a greeting from giulia put your self in
