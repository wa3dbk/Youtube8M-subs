00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.610
 hey people here are always great and me 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.200
 call me back with one again 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.169
 follow buht batman 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.119
 You have not had that for a long time 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.640
 and I want to go about it today as I do 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.910
 a troubled situation, so to speak as 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.010
 Defender if I stand there reasonably 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.449
 can act reasonable movement 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.800
 to save myself and maybe 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.900
 even kill one or the other 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.820
 to dust off and that's what I'm for 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.790
 back in counter-strike and back on 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.530
 my favorite map called inferno like that 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.960
 suppose I stand here for the times 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.610
 make clear in the häs and that 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.399
 over there in the front because it's here 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.629
 Once around the US sport here 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.699
 action is taken by the terrorists 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.480
 come from up here on medium and 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.890
 i am defending here i just stand up 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.050
 sporting means that I just see 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.930
 if there is one here or if you are one 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.180
 goes through and a made by me 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.180
 simply in action in or under the 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.179
 small gazebo so what could happen 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.530
 is that a several people come up and 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.729
 I do not really have the chance to see you 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.590
 to go all that is what I do 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.360
 can proceed is a little ask 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.880
 to draw attention to me and 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.310
 go back so that you can 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.110
 attention is drawn to itself and 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.490
 my make of action in the back pure 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.849
 can push and maybe something 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.030
 pick up 

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:35.239
 meanwhile, I'm running back here and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.190
 Throw a nice flash and that 

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:38.929
 nice thing about this flash is if one 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.099
 he has no chance to look at opponents here 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.929
 to react 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.940
 that means looking away because they are 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.470
 just explodes right here on the edge 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 and you are looking a few since 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.910
 braid they should be able not mind 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.810
 if all this does not help then 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.160
 Let's get to the point I 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.989
 actually wants to address and that is 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.250
 angle reduction that is if you 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.050
 of course you have to defensively move 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.420
 first call back to take your time 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.530
 win and with angle reduction 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.720
 because I stop that for example 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.310
 not so open but here on 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.690
 sporting means the angle 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.319
 It could be taken that way 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.330
 small 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.530
 This is something very simple for now 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.569
 But that is in the flow of the game 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.490
 of course, also apply to complex 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.900
 suppose they come after me 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.220
 the flash and i got myself with the flash 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.360
 Just bought enough time 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.490
 to bring here in the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.160
 library and must urgently now 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.340
 then I can kill myself here in the c 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.500
 go bow and have a good here 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.570
 view of opponents who came by 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.190
 but still relatively covered now 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.570
 I have two options either me 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.640
 stand on this side or on this 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.960
 page depends on it 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.070
 Suppose you made the back in action 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.730
 in there behind it has died and the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.030
 had me that means one comes here 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.780
 from export and one comes from here 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.780
 the middle out 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.459
 and I stand here in the ct arc what many 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.250
 it's going to turn out that way 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.690
 you can do that if you think so 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.590
 also library off and if here one order 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.080
 Maybe I have the corner 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.440
 fast hatcher in there what I but 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.370
 It is like that and that's how it is 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.610
 libraries button 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.440
 why is my angle as possible 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.420
 low that means if now an opponent 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.560
 from here comes and an opponent from here 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.760
 comes then see me both only when he 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.250
 So if the pushes out of action over it 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.840
 and at the edge he sees me 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.850
 if that comes from there, see me 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.550
 but is not even if he recognized 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.200
 but only if he comes around here 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.459
 he sees me here 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.930
 that means that my angle always holds 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.750
 is disguised so I can do several times 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.980
 perhaps push back each one 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:46.480
 a little bit something pure and the whole thing 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.989
 Here again, the whole problem is 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.519
 Of course, that at some point I will be too far in 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.080
 the defcon and therefore no chance 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.430
 But I mean more with angle 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.390
 reduction the advantage of it lies 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.459
 of course, on the hand 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.900
 I have a smaller area of ​​the 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.250
 views can be attacked 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.560
 that means I can not be that fast 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.180
 be surprised and that's good too 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.860
 I have to pay attention to one 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.200
 steer smaller area if I do so 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.820
 play as if I play like this 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.500
 Of course, that also applies to the 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.600
 attacker side in limited dimensions 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.410
 that's why it's so hard center 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.750
 take 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.030
 because if you push on it then you have 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.410
 her an angle of 180 degrees from demir 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.940
 could be attacked namely 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.669
 completely from hess maybe 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.620
 even tempered up here in action 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.740
 Rhine under gazebo even from the door 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.740
 out 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.840
 Of course I can also angle here 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:39.360
 shrink as an attacker and do that 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.490
 I like it best by that 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.349
 that I either have this page here too 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.639
 smoke and not from here anymore 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.610
 At least it can not be attacked 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.740
 more targeted or this side plus door 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.759
 to smoke depending on where I'm bored 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.099
 Of course, it could also act as an attacker 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.930
 to transfer 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.520
 this somehow gets into that at the 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.199
 put that is everything before deducting and 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.330
 meanwhile all go through it 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.749
 bow to ct and then up from behind 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.999
 come 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:04.740
 so could work with net here or 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:07.409
 work with movement to just the 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.729
 attack angle and shrink you 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.060
 to gain an advantage or 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.349
 at least to survive longer I hope 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.610
 I have that a little bit the eyes 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.870
 I'll open one again 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.050
 scene where I play both 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:22.349
 Use a bit and explain it 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.439
 and otherwise yes thanks for listening to 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.599
 The next time Batman so it works 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.520
 So to finkel reduction to clever 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.589
 movement you will now see that me 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.849
 here the banana games and indeed 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:35.699
 really aggressive 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.289
 that means first of all a age champion and 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.389
 the first thing that happens is that I am so 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.699
 otte the at least three people are there 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.050
 and can get away and clever with help 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.689
 from angle reduction backwards 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.919
 call close to the edge along 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.500
 and throw that first the defensive 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.509
 smog and flash behind at time 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.889
 have to reload 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.930
 what's opponent now makes stupid he 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.669
 comes out and that is us 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.229
 have significantly more players than you and 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.879
 so that the advantage we can now 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.009
 take a bit more offensive and you 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.080
 in the banana stairs that makes meter 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.370
 but that means the mails will die 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.560
 get out of there now 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.689
 and I have the luck to turn him on and 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.229
 to push and here only the assists 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.819
 to get 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.589
 I also like that as much as possible 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.389
 close to the edge put to small 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:17.580
 angle and the same applies 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.399
 even here spot first down see nothing 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.770
 and follow suit he is under the 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:24.539
 bow and can be in a small angle 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.589
 between the pillars by one around the 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.589
 fourth also to make money
