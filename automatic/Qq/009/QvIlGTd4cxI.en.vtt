but<00:00:08.970> once<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.900> got<00:00:10.050> her<00:00:10.170> out<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> chair

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
but once we got her out of the chair

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.169 
but once we got her out of the chair
Stefan<00:00:11.309> didn't<00:00:11.519> like<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.849> into<00:00:11.910> her<00:00:12.150> mom's

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
Stefan didn't like and into her mom's

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.200 
Stefan didn't like and into her mom's
arms<00:00:12.900> she<00:00:12.990> actually<00:00:13.650> warmed<00:00:14.009> up<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.880> fair

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
arms she actually warmed up a fair

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
arms she actually warmed up a fair
degree<00:00:24.470> didn't<00:00:25.470> let<00:00:25.859> go<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.220> give<00:00:26.580> us<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
degree didn't let go of it give us a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.900 
degree didn't let go of it give us a
pretty<00:00:26.910> good<00:00:27.029> reading<00:00:27.240> oh<00:00:27.570> my<00:00:28.529> goodness<00:00:29.070> it's

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
pretty good reading oh my goodness it's

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:49.990 
pretty good reading oh my goodness it's
like<00:00:30.000> fishing<00:00:30.300> oh<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:31.349> got<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> read<00:00:32.750> seven<00:00:33.750> nine

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.790 

which<00:00:51.000> means<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.570> time<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.899> ponder<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
which means it's time to ponder the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560 
which means it's time to ponder the
results<00:00:52.850> while<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.000> youngest<00:00:54.270> baby

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
results while the youngest baby

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.450 
results while the youngest baby
registered<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:55.289> grip<00:00:55.469> strength<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.430> older

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
registered more grip strength the older

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.979 
registered more grip strength the older
babies<00:00:56.699> seemed<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:57.360> inclined<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> use

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
babies seemed more inclined to use

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.500 
babies seemed more inclined to use
strategy<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:59.039> resist<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.850> they<00:01:00.090> would<00:01:00.239> even

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
strategy to resist and they would even

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.880 
strategy to resist and they would even
let<00:01:00.660> me<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.960> ahold<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> candy<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
let me get ahold of the candy in the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.289 
let me get ahold of the candy in the
first<00:01:02.160> place<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.309> according<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
first place so what according to the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.600 
first place so what according to the
myth<00:01:06.510> should<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:07.020> been<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> simple<00:01:07.619> task<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
myth should have been a simple task the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.109 
myth should have been a simple task the
easiest<00:01:08.640> possible<00:01:09.540> simply<00:01:10.260> wasn't<00:01:11.119> evasion

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
easiest possible simply wasn't evasion

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.810 
easiest possible simply wasn't evasion
and<00:01:12.360> guilt<00:01:12.659> strategies<00:01:13.290> made<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.979> tricky<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and guilt strategies made it tricky and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.480 
and guilt strategies made it tricky and
at<00:01:15.180> times<00:01:15.540> very<00:01:16.320> difficult<00:01:18.860> but<00:01:19.860> ultimately

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
at times very difficult but ultimately

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.429 
at times very difficult but ultimately
the<00:01:20.790> experiment<00:01:21.150> was<00:01:21.540> designed<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.200> executed

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
the experiment was designed and executed

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.399 
the experiment was designed and executed
to<00:01:23.070> compare<00:01:23.250> grip<00:01:23.520> strength<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> final

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to compare grip strength so the final

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.580 
to compare grip strength so the final
result<00:01:25.740> comes<00:01:25.979> down<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> numbers<00:01:27.590> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
result comes down to the numbers so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.020 
result comes down to the numbers so
where<00:01:28.740> does<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.860> leave<00:01:29.009> us<00:01:29.340> well<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.939> you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
where does that leave us well if you

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.090 
where does that leave us well if you
remember<00:01:30.150> our<00:01:30.390> control<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:31.020> took<00:01:31.079> point<00:01:31.740> zero

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
remember our control it took point zero

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460 
remember our control it took point zero
eight<00:01:32.430> pounds<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.060> force<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.540> lift<00:01:33.780> our

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
eight pounds of force to just lift our

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.710 
eight pounds of force to just lift our
candy<00:01:34.759> when<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:35.880> average<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.509> grip

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
candy when your average the grip

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
candy when your average the grip
strength<00:01:36.869> across<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.619> babies<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:38.100> tested

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
strength across all the babies we tested

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.800 
strength across all the babies we tested
it<00:01:38.640> came<00:01:38.880> in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it came in

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
it came in
other<00:01:39.960> than<00:01:40.140> two<00:01:40.409> pounds<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.920> force<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.399> take

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
other than two pounds of force to take

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.179 
other than two pounds of force to take
the<00:01:41.790> candy<00:01:41.909> from<00:01:42.450> them<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.380> means<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the candy from them that means that it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.730 
the candy from them that means that it
was<00:01:44.280> 25<00:01:44.479> times<00:01:45.479> more<00:01:45.689> difficult<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.530> take

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
was 25 times more difficult to take

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.920 
was 25 times more difficult to take
candy<00:01:46.799> from<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.520> babies<00:01:47.549> than<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.630> was<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
candy from the babies than it was to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.170 
candy from the babies than it was to
just<00:01:48.960> pick<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.130> me<00:01:50.490> says<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
just pick it up and that to me says that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
just pick it up and that to me says that
this<00:01:51.750> myth<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.229> thoroughly<00:01:52.649> busted<00:01:53.180> what<00:01:54.180> do

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
this myth is thoroughly busted what do

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.870 
this myth is thoroughly busted what do
you<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.810> agree<00:01:55.560> now<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.490> out<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
you think I agree now get out of the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.320 
you think I agree now get out of the
stroller<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.360> give<00:01:57.509> my<00:01:57.750> monkey<00:01:58.140> back
