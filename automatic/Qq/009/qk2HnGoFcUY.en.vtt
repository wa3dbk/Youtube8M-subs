come out the rod holders the few things

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.959 
come out the rod holders the few things

though the only comes with one rod

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.609 
though the only comes with one rod
holder<00:01:05.060> that's<00:01:06.060> why<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> added<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
holder that's why I kind of added the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.090 
holder that's why I kind of added the
Mill<00:01:07.830> Creek<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.430> put<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.150> gear<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.100> put

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
Mill Creek to put my gear in and put

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.070 
Mill Creek to put my gear in and put
some<00:01:11.280> more<00:01:11.430> rod<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:12.360> bring<00:01:12.659> some<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:12.900> rods

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
some more rod to bring some more rods

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.149 
some more rod to bring some more rods
fishing<00:01:13.850> also<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.000> plug<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.860> plug<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
fishing also this plug the plug in the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.380 
fishing also this plug the plug in the
back<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:20.310> off<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> side<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
back right here it's off to the side I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.969 
back right here it's off to the side I
know<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.880> most<00:01:23.900> kayaks<00:01:24.900> they're<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.229> top<00:01:25.470> right

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
know on most kayaks they're on top right

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.450 
know on most kayaks they're on top right
here<00:01:27.080> but<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> guess<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.829> put<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> side

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
here but I guess they put on the side

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.170 
here but I guess they put on the side
because<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.880> rudder<00:01:30.150> um<00:01:31.250> thing<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.939> if<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
because this rudder um thing that if you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.719 
because this rudder um thing that if you
want<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> add<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> rudder<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.259> can<00:01:34.729> guess

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
want to add a rudder you can guess

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
want to add a rudder you can guess
that's<00:01:35.909> why<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.119> put<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> side<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:36.900> when

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that's why they put on the side but when

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.100 
that's why they put on the side but when
you<00:01:37.350> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.710> drain<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> water<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.610> hole

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
you want to drain the water out the hole

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.090 
you want to drain the water out the hole
this<00:01:40.110> tends<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.280> shows<00:01:41.579> back<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
this tends to get shows back in to the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.270 
this tends to get shows back in to the
plug<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.210> that's<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.590> thing<00:01:46.770> i<00:01:46.920> found<00:01:47.100> that
