 carbohydrates as they are easier to digest than 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.720
 fat and fat and safely settle in

 in case of fasting he will go to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 power saving mode 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.649
 first he will start to get rid of the muscles and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.670
 only then will begin to use their 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.100
 fat reserves 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.320
 while suffering internal organs and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.690
 metabolism is rapidly slowing and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.520
 as soon as you eat like 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.410

 use a smaller plate 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.210
 eat more often but take a plate less 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.240
 from the usual thereby you cut 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.710
 the amount of food consumed at a time 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.880
 especially use smaller plates 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.170
 volume, thereby you set yourself a hole 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.720
 eat more often but little by little 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.210

 amount of energy consumed 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.970
