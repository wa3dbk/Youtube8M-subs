00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.680
 the eagle that fishes and drowns 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.880
 who with fire plays with fire burns 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.920
 what a simple and logical saying 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.410
 too logical to believe it but the 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.990
 daily experience is telling us with 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.920
 facts how many burned began 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.590
 playing and so was their prudence 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.290
 freedom of spirit and will must 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.020
 be attitudes and virtues that should owe us 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.840
 accompany daily at the buffet of the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.870
 life men easily us 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.600
 we attach things to people and 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.180
 how it costs us to separate once we 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.820
 we take possession of them we have to 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.550
 learn not to depend on the realities 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.860
 human beings those who 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.280
 pretending to be an attractive prey of 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.850
 fishing at the time we can drown 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.730
 by the weight that they carry on me I clung 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.610
 so 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.330
 so much to them that the day I wanted them 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.880
 Drop me to drown myself immersed by 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.310
 that the most healthy thing is to build a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.690
 true freedom and especially the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.750
 self-control to know how to say no 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.880
 the national geographic channel presented a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.540
 program that showed how they do 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.670
 eagles to catch fish in the lakes 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.160
 they fly very high over the lake and its 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.490
 vision is so acute that they locate with 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.550
 easily the fish that they want to fish 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.920
 see it fold its wings back and it 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.980
 they throw directly at him to great 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.580
 speed when reaching the water they extend 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.940
 its wings open claws grab the fish 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.550
 and they go back to the beach in that program 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.210
 they showed a movie that presented a 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.180
 Indeed rare eagle dove 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.090
 to catch the fish but the fish was very 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.840
 big when starting to lift the flight 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.510
 the eagle was making a very big effort 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.570
 the fish was heavy and she could not 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.570
 support your weight realizing that 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.540
 he could not with his prey he tried to release the 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.000
 fish but his claws had penetrated so 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.530
 deep in his flesh that he could not 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.770
 take them out 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.100
 I fight a lot but did not succeed started 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.910
 fall into the lake drowning because he could not 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.709
 get rid of the house you had caught 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.340
 many times we cling to 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.620
 the things that can be dangerous 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.069
 we choose bad friends bad programs 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.050
 television harmful food tickets 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.800
 and undue conversations in the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.020
 internet in order that our choices 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.590
 they end up being too heavy and 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.510
 great for us at the beginning 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.269
 we believe that we have control and that 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.420
 we can turn away from evil when 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.540
 we want but without realizing that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.170
 transforms into a habit or better said in 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.170
 a vice difficult to let go when one day 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.989
 we try to get rid of and leave 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.690
 we discovered that we are too 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.209
 clinging to bad habits 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.519
 we are out of control the same as we 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.090
 happened to the eagle that did not get rid 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.020
 of the fish and drowned can happen to us 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.660
 we 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.820
 and when we want to react it will be 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.420
 too late to leave evil 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.960
 we will certainly perish together 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.300
 he sometimes bad friends take us to 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.850
 do things that we would not do if we did not 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.430
 let's walk with them your life is worth 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.400
 a lot so that you're risking your 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.060
 soul your body are reflection and presence 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.850
 God avoids evil and does good in 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.000
 Hebrews 12 11 we read that we should 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:01.890
 free us from all the weight of sin that 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.650
 harass us in Ephesians 511 we read do not take 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.730
 part in the useless things that they do 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.540
 those who are from the dark so 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.540
 stay awake
