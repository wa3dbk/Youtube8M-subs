see<00:00:27.349> this<00:00:28.189> bracket<00:00:28.670> is<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:29.119> global<00:00:29.689> and<00:00:29.869> once

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
see this bracket is a global and once

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.630 
see this bracket is a global and once
it's<00:00:30.380> a<00:00:30.410> very<00:00:30.590> thin<00:00:30.859> type<00:00:31.099> of<00:00:31.220> metal<00:00:31.429> you<00:00:31.519> can

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
it's a very thin type of metal you can

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.360 
it's a very thin type of metal you can
actually<00:00:32.000> bend<00:00:32.330> it<00:00:32.480> contour<00:00:33.410> it<00:00:33.530> with<00:00:34.070> a<00:00:34.100> vise

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
actually bend it contour it with a vise

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.130 
actually bend it contour it with a vise
and<00:00:34.640> make<00:00:34.880> it<00:00:35.000> any<00:00:35.150> way<00:00:35.300> you<00:00:35.330> want<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:35.720> be<00:00:35.870> so

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
and make it any way you want it to be so

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.110 
and make it any way you want it to be so
these<00:00:36.410> things<00:00:36.650> also<00:00:37.130> all<00:00:37.280> waterproof<00:00:37.640> in<00:00:37.970> the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
these things also all waterproof in the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.990 
these things also all waterproof in the
front<00:00:38.390> in<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.570> rear<00:00:39.460> you<00:00:40.460> can<00:00:40.490> see<00:00:40.610> there's<00:00:40.940> a

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
front in the rear you can see there's a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.820 
front in the rear you can see there's a
rubber<00:00:41.540> proof<00:00:41.840> grommet<00:00:42.260> right<00:00:42.440> there<00:00:42.620> for<00:00:42.770> the

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
rubber proof grommet right there for the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.780 
rubber proof grommet right there for the
rear<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:43.130> you<00:00:43.220> can<00:00:43.340> actually<00:00:43.460> use<00:00:43.610> this

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
rear so you can actually use this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.390 
rear so you can actually use this
infirmary<00:00:44.330> neeeews<00:00:44.660> as<00:00:44.810> well<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:46.010> also<00:00:46.130> have

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
infirmary neeeews as well you also have

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.790 
infirmary neeeews as well you also have
a<00:00:46.610> sliding<00:00:47.120> lock<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.200> that<00:00:48.230> way<00:00:48.440> if<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:48.620> want

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
a sliding lock so that way if you want

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.620 
a sliding lock so that way if you want
to<00:00:48.830> flush<00:00:49.070> mount<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:49.490> you<00:00:50.060> could<00:00:50.240> take<00:00:50.420> off

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
to flush mount it you could take off

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.540 
to flush mount it you could take off
this<00:00:50.990> piece<00:00:51.290> flush<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.950> and<00:00:52.040> this<00:00:52.250> is<00:00:52.430> what

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
this piece flush it and this is what

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.770 
this piece flush it and this is what
you're<00:00:52.640> going<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.790> see<00:00:52.940> in<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.240> front<00:00:53.480> of

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
you're going to see in the front of

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.690 
you're going to see in the front of
course<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:54.140> would<00:00:54.260> remove<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:55.250> waterproof

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
course you would remove the waterproof

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.220 
course you would remove the waterproof
cover<00:00:55.880> unless<00:00:56.240> you<00:00:56.390> like<00:00:56.540> that<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:56.990> kind<00:00:57.170> of

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
cover unless you like that that kind of

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.020 
cover unless you like that that kind of
thing<00:00:57.410> that's<00:00:57.650> okay<00:00:58.010> too<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.520> this<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.880> what

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
thing that's okay too and this is what

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.600 
thing that's okay too and this is what
you<00:00:59.150> see<00:00:59.360> your<00:01:00.260> overall<00:01:00.710> dimension<00:01:01.310> on<00:01:01.460> the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
you see your overall dimension on the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.770 
you see your overall dimension on the
width<00:01:01.820> of<00:01:01.970> this<00:01:02.510> is<00:01:02.720> one<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:03.320> 1/8<00:01:04.780> perfectly

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
width of this is one and 1/8 perfectly

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.520 
width of this is one and 1/8 perfectly
round<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:08.090> protrusion<00:01:08.630> from<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.080> dash<00:01:09.260> is

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
round the protrusion from the dash is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.140 
round the protrusion from the dash is
about<00:01:09.740> 1/8<00:01:09.980> as<00:01:10.160> well<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:10.550> this<00:01:10.700> thing<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.000> super

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
about 1/8 as well so this thing is super

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.240 
about 1/8 as well so this thing is super
small<00:01:11.480> it's<00:01:11.690> tiny

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
small it's tiny

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.650 
small it's tiny
it<00:01:13.250> already<00:01:13.400> comes<00:01:13.640> with<00:01:13.790> 2<00:01:14.030> ring<00:01:14.270> terminals

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
it already comes with 2 ring terminals

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.970 
it already comes with 2 ring terminals
so<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:14.810> can<00:01:14.930> connect<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:15.290> directly<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.740> 12

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
so you can connect it directly to 12

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.200 
so you can connect it directly to 12
volts<00:01:16.220> DC<00:01:16.250> if<00:01:16.730> you<00:01:16.820> have<00:01:16.940> an<00:01:17.030> existing

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
volts DC if you have an existing

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.280 
volts DC if you have an existing
cigarette<00:01:17.660> lighter<00:01:17.810> you're<00:01:17.960> going<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.140> mount

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
cigarette lighter you're going to mount

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.140 
cigarette lighter you're going to mount
it<00:01:18.410> up<00:01:18.500> next<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:18.950> otherwise<00:01:19.670> I'll<00:01:19.940> show<00:01:20.060> you

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
it up next to it otherwise I'll show you

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.240 
it up next to it otherwise I'll show you
something<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:21.200> now<00:01:21.350> powered<00:01:21.710> up<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.950> my<00:01:22.070> power

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
something is now powered up to my power

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.790 
something is now powered up to my power
supply<00:01:22.490> over<00:01:22.820> there<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:22.970> DC<00:01:23.600> power<00:01:23.630> supply<00:01:24.140> when

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
supply over there a DC power supply when

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.440 
supply over there a DC power supply when
it<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.070> on<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:25.430> can<00:01:25.550> see<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.790> has<00:01:25.910> this<00:01:26.060> hyper

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
it is on you can see it has this hyper

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.210 
it is on you can see it has this hyper
