00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.870
 remember that one of the most 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.730
 striking saga the war of the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.340
 galaxies' was when Luke Skywalker 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.679
 left his Tatooine planet and look and 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.740
 you could see two suns in the background and good 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.800
 Notice that on the 13th of this month in 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.480
 Romania for a phenomenon that is still 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.179
 we are waiting for an explanation 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.939
 from the scientific area they say that 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:26.130
 you could spot two suns thing that had 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.679
 happened in the middle of last year also 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.700
 in a pardon in an Asian country I think 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.890
 that the china 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.440
 the numbers of dole or japan that also 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.210
 for a moment you can see two suns 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.270
 that clearly an honor among all 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.640
 two were separated as well the 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.640
 jobs he anticipated there are some that 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.550
 they say that 's what the group would be when 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.680
 you want to show the planet x inhibit and 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.989
 that planet so only the planet 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.090
 where to see them with moles that is the only 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.720
 planet of our solar system that 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.160
 it has an elliptical orbit and it's the 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.530
 only one that is vertical to the 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.930
 rest of the planets and that it takes 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.229
 more than 3600 years to go around 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.670
 complete the last October manipulated 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.060
 the human race and we became what 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.250
 we are now yes the next time is now to 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.800
 late next year and surely 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.479
 they will want to see what these 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.450
 monkeys that they grabbed turned him into 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.270
 intelligent beings and alpha complex for 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.530
 everything that entities for the first 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 listen to the concept any time 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.010
 is the name that the ancient culture 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.070
 Sumerian gave these beings of 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.410
 religious mystic character that according to his 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.150
 own story were responsible 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.310
 and creators of the human race as is 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.160
 we know it is worth to say the human being 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.490
 it was in its natural and slow evolution 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.470
 towards a more intelligent creature and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.570
 this is creatures in the last cycle 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.430
 happening near the earth they came to 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.190
 do a mineral collection and 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.100
 I also work in agriculture and 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.840
 finally in that manipulation we 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.130
 they left with a few capabilities that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.739
 us developing by our 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.890
 own account now is the second quarter 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.600
 that we would have with them and hopefully win 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.030
 good because the last time I was in 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.959
 He divided some wanted us and others like 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.560
 I already drew a venge eliminated in what 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.510
 I told him thank you why 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.860
 they tell me to explain who they were 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.480
 the students here that you learn from 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.670
 quique ni virus 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.470
 it will also take you to the red planet 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.720
 Finally 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.030
 we are seeing the images that all 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.940
 we know 2011 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.710
 those two suns that was applied as 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.950
 crazy but less refractory part 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.540
 of the clouds generated something that is still 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.150
 waiting for a logical explanation of 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.310
 part of the science others claim that 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.160
 clearly and the same as happened in a 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.440
 sky completely clear in up 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.370
 last year it has already been seen in two 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.530
 opportunities this sky with two suns 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.390
 some complaints I do not know how far 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.060
 it can be the logic of something that looks 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.190
 soon not on the planet x nor virus that 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.590
 they are simply not one here that according to 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.910
 Text of the ancient Sumerians culture 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.130
 true with the minus one side also 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.290
 they said that these beings come from 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.020
 space in fact have a here in the 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.030
 translation of those that come from above or 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.250
 those who walk in the stars are the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.800
 sky 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.420
 they would have come and they would have formed us not 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.080
 they would have given an evolutionary blow 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.940
 making us much more superior than 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.730
 rhythm of what nature went but 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.770
 notice that not only the Sumerians 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.620
 they talked about their creators but 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.690
 that also if we treat ourselves we have 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.510
 videos 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.740
 in front of the big star for seven 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.190
 days will burn cloudy for two suns 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.790
 Appear 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.680
 we arrived well every night now 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.220
 when the great pontiff will change 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.220
 ground 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.980
 in fact our let's see I'm going to 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.840
 explain the following numbers what 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.410
 they say this way now because it's 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.660
 for all the numbers because you see the 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.820
 map of the solar system and they were a people 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.980
 so in very primitive states but 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.500
 they knew that he had no forgiveness 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.300
 saturn they had they knew the amount 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.700
 of moons that have planets and 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.640
 they knew how many they were and the most curious thing that 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.560
 we were the planet not third 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.300
 but it was counted from outside 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.970
 inwards then as someone who 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.550
 comes from outside ok says we treat you 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.590
 the planet that is imagined as 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.650
 all shims is the largest in the system 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.660
 solar I look like jupiter a little less and 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.060
 when you reach the earth once again 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.370
 because because when all the planets 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.770
 for example here is the sun mercury 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.810
 venus the earth and everyone wants the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.430
 like this tour this way is going to 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.710
 appear two suns we have another one like me 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.050
 ahead 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:09.530
 we are seeing 15 lenses that would be 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.540
 a movie that shows just the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.750
 subject of the two suns there situation 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.720
 mention and there is that nostradamus 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.650
 referring to the others recreation - 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.620
 on how it would look 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.620
 as we predicted not we lock 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.440
 he does not talk about a strange phenomenon 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.509
 then it clearly says that it is the 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.310
 errant planet unknown from another 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.960
 solar system that when we get back to 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.520
 visit will appear with certain 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.130
 styles version two suns will not be the 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.900
 planet treat here where the 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.900
 black marcelo of several in box pony 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.370
 tomorrow more in extensive how it would work 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.500
 what would happen what are the 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.569
 consequences no such big planet 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.729
 sees us with terms of seriousness 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.849
 and since he sold the volunteers yet 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.849
 plus
