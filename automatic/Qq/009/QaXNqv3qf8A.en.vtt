00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.070
 mini cakes with plums for 6 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.130
 people we need this beautiful 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.430
 quetsches 200 g flour 180 g 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.380
 butter 4 th 180 grams of brown sugar 5 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.330
 centilitres of cold milk 1/2 sachet of 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 yeast and a teaspoon of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.220
 cinnamon first step I put the oven 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.029
 to preheated to 180 Â° and I put the butter 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.029
 to melt 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.390
 I mix the flour with the salt and the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.380
 cinnamon and next I'll separate them 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.380
 egg yolks 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.220
 while I'm there I'm going too 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.220
 add sugar 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.280
 the egg yolks are in the cooked 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.469
 I dug in the flour worth 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.809
 added milk and melted butter 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:00.790
 before amalgamating the whole go go 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.500
 have to mix all that from the center to 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.730
 the edge to amalgamate the flour well and 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.590
 to obtain a homogeneous paste 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.600
 before climbing the whites in snow I 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.159
 will take care of the quetsches that I had 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.159
 pitted and then diced 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.650
 the plums me it is really a trick 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.870
 that I love besides what I prefer 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.880
 it's simply the compote of 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.010
 plums when it is still all 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.590
 lukewarm there she took a color 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.450
 gorgeous red 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.800
 I really love it when I talk about 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.660
 the dian saddle that I like and that I do not like 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.270
 no do you know what is 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.650
 the ingredient that I really do not like 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.979
 no nothing really has one that I do not like 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.869
 but only one will be found if you 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.950
 the case of places in the comments 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.080
 I add the plums we do not have 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.670
 more than just adding the whites to the snow 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.810
 but for that it will have to be mounted in 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.810
 snow go it's gone 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.120
 these loans to incorporate them 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.110
 delicately with maryse I'm already going 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.700
 take leather from the whites and I 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.520
 just incorporate them quickly 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.860
 to relax the dough and then I'm 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.320
 still for the rest is a movement 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.850
 like this one so as not to break the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.000
 whites and incorporate air into the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.000
 dough 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.840
 it's gone for 25 minutes of cooking 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.340
 the little cakes at the quetsche are 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.860
