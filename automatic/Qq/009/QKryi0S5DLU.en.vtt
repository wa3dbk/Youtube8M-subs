00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 first one must take the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.520
 defeat can say even better now that 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.520
 than in the league 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.990
 certainly it was the first game in front 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.990
 in front of our fans 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.150
 yes the team is young but it is not said 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.279
 that a young person must necessarily feel the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:30.300
 game in my opinion is logical 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.960
 we are at Bologna the shirt weighs a little 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.149
 more than the other parts then 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.100
 we must also give time to these 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.890
 guys to settle in and find the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.610
 right pace but we were sorry 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.039
 certainly because official matches 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.039
 however one always keeps doing well 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.820
 in short, one could guess 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.680
 at the beginning of the season we could have a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.480
 bit of difficulty being a new group 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.480
 and all that 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.570
 they had an extra match in the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.030
 legs 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.410
 I think this had also done the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.479
 however, we are sorry 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.570
 so much for the elimination we know fans 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.840
 how much they keep us but our goal 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.500
 is the championship in eleven days yes 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.570
 part we see in my opinion is always 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.899
 difficult that is called in series to that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.810
 let's call series b which is called series c 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:38.250
 every championship to its pitfalls there 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.530
 series b with all his games i think 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:48.360
 maybe it's the toughest championship for 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.040
 here are the professional ones 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.520
 better or worse I don't have this 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.200
 I do not know do not know for sure hearing 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.020
 some of my companions who have 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.209
 participated in the last championship 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.580
 they all say it's hard we are a group 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:08.490
 certainly I did young experts 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.350
 where surely the most experienced will give 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.830
 a younger hand to overcome the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.830
 difficulty
