comfortable it is and you've got the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.179 
comfortable it is and you've got the
zoom<00:01:16.770> pods<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> bottom<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.500> like

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
zoom pods here in the bottom that I like

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.100 
zoom pods here in the bottom that I like
they're<00:01:20.759> okay<00:01:21.060> i<00:01:21.090> prefer<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.540> full-length

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
they're okay i prefer the full-length

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.490 
they're okay i prefer the full-length
the<00:01:22.409> zoom<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:23.659> tailored<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> my<00:01:24.930> game<00:01:25.200> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the zoom it's more tailored to my game I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
the zoom it's more tailored to my game I
try<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.430> explosive<00:01:27.119> for

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
try to be a little more explosive for

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.530 
try to be a little more explosive for
cushioning<00:01:28.530> i<00:01:28.710> actually<00:01:29.220> prefer<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:30.000> set<00:01:30.360> up

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
cushioning i actually prefer this set up

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.350 
cushioning i actually prefer this set up
with<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> zoom<00:01:31.470> pods<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.880> disperses

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
with the zoom pods because it disperses

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
with the zoom pods because it disperses
the<00:01:33.570> weight<00:01:33.930> over<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> different<00:01:35.159> pods

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the weight over all the different pods

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
the weight over all the different pods
instead<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.270> having<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> full-length

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
instead of just having that full-length

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.859 
instead of just having that full-length
zoom<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.070> compresses<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.820> once<00:01:39.090> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
zoom that it all compresses it once so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.410 
zoom that it all compresses it once so
that's<00:01:40.770> pretty<00:01:41.009> cool<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.210> did

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that's pretty cool you know I really did

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.319 
that's pretty cool you know I really did
like<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.869> aspect<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.130> i<00:01:44.369> prefer<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
like that aspect of it but i prefer the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.840 
like that aspect of it but i prefer the
explosiveness<00:01:46.079> over<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> cushioning<00:01:47.670> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
explosiveness over the cushioning so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.700 
explosiveness over the cushioning so
that's<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.299> personal<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.619> if

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that's just personal but you know if

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.620 
that's just personal but you know if
you're<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> little<00:01:50.100> bigger<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.729> you're<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you're a little bigger if you're you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.999 
you're a little bigger if you're you
know<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> high<00:01:52.259> flyer<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.890> you're

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
know more of a high flyer and you're

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
know more of a high flyer and you're
always<00:01:53.130> getting<00:01:53.700> those<00:01:53.939> heavy<00:01:54.180> landings<00:01:54.750> then

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
always getting those heavy landings then

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.609 
always getting those heavy landings then
you<00:01:55.860> might<00:01:56.100> prefer<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.640> LeBron<00:01:57.000> 12<00:01:57.390> /<00:01:58.229> like
