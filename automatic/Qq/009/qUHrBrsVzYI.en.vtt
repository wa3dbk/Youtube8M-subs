that<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.509> need<00:02:01.690> them<00:02:01.840> for<00:02:01.899> that<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:03.600> pump

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
that you need them for that but pump

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.660 
that you need them for that but pump
some<00:02:04.810> serious<00:02:05.200> light<00:02:05.440> into<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.890> tank<00:02:06.250> but<00:02:06.520> some

some serious light into a tank but some

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.729 
some serious light into a tank but some
co2<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.390> they<00:02:07.479> do<00:02:07.960> tend<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.350> grow<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> lot

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
co2 and they do tend to grow a lot

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.860

taller towards the light well good like
I<00:02:13.959> said<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.440> tank<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.860> probably<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> most

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
I said this tank is probably the most
