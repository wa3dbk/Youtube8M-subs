00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.529
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.990
 the kids series about vr next to the treasure 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.400

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.880

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.550
 do you want to die grandpa well idiot aids that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.760
 so become yes 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.430
 think weekly or maybe maybe 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.439
 even two a week but that is normal 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.019
 to fill the gap between the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.630
 dear van vr men it is the episode 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.610
 because it takes a very long time for that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 make episodes because you have 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.390
 all people needed that at the same 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.590
 time must be online 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.149
 he obviously understands that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.170
 difficult to find their time 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.239
 that they are usually on the weekend so yes 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.350
 just shot of feather and in between 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.530
 i do 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.270
 no this series in between 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.910
 just to show what only springs 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.730
 is what we have built and first 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.739
 what i'm going to show here is the mind that 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.680
 has recently been updated 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.950
 made by my most cord mine 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.760
 and this doesn't feel nice though 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.760
 how it used to be 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.180
 you walk here to b to b libya and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.850
 sight 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.640
 beautiful white floor and the crucifixion and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.930
 kill another cross but yes and then you can 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.140
 you walk down here again and then 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.120
 you come in storage 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.210
 Oh 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.720
 the storage is also completely through 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.310
 made me 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.330
 it is possible we also get here 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.220

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.440

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.990

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.630
 you don't have to do that all 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.290
 not to know 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.570
 but yes this was an amber yes 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.550
 we made it last week though 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.270
 among other things we have made much more 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.830
 the city wall and last week 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.570
 works very much against her own 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.920
 show 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.270
 the wall around the city ​​will last a very long time 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.290
 been busy that wall this weekend 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.100
 come off 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.100
 crystal heartache 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.050
 that wall is incredibly large and it is coming 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.360
 today hopefully alfi flag that will be stuck 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.310
 be at work now we go 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.489
 pay a visit 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.530
 and that the is not too far away 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.290
 now super big but we get there 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.370
 well look there he is already the wall and ivo 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.470

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.440
 nice mill 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.540
 looking at sivak he is standing on the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.849
 like to build a wall for the stairs 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.880
 on his many stairs 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.920
 if that level stands but see that 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.200
 we prefer it 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.470
 well I understand that culture to 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.150
 show how fucking great you are richly 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.850
 is he is a 4 block tick and you have 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.280
 then here on my part hour 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.360

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.040

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.870
 ok i apparently sit in my wall this 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.620
 don't you think this is his view that we 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.230
 have here 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.160
 just super nice un night while 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.819
 it's snowing 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.709
 his friend of super beautiful you see there 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.540
 Throne room of Joris must tower 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.459
 I've never been in that tower 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.480
 wait i want north 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.940
 and you only get there once 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.610
 and I don't know how much 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.850
 by now I hope I know 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.560
 not how to get through that for a moment 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.560
 We will see, we shall come 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.239
 I guess we just like the first 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.150
 walk into the throne room and that from 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.750
 from there the tower in children's boys 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.930
 has even gone through it and is 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:13.079
 reasonable for king i have a look 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.079
 in the time she had 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.900

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.500
 well be in tower 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.640
 Apparently he is still not finished 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.530
 I think very few are building on it 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.480
 but we have to, is a staircase 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.520
 come all the way up and that is still 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.290

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.350

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.879

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.770

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:04.199
