in<00:00:04.000> this<00:00:04.240> video<00:00:04.480> lesson<00:00:04.930> we<00:00:05.649> are<00:00:05.680> going<00:00:05.920> to

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.040 
in this video lesson we are going to

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.060 
in this video lesson we are going to
look<00:00:06.160> at<00:00:06.310> how<00:00:06.490> to<00:00:06.549> create<00:00:06.880> an<00:00:07.120> option<00:00:07.690> group<00:00:08.070> on

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
look at how to create an option group on

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.169 
look at how to create an option group on
a<00:00:09.100> Microsoft<00:00:09.670> Access<00:00:10.320> form<00:00:11.969> we've<00:00:12.969> been

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:13.179 
a Microsoft Access form we've been

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.089 
a Microsoft Access form we've been
working<00:00:13.540> with<00:00:13.660> forms<00:00:13.990> for<00:00:14.139> a<00:00:14.200> few<00:00:14.469> videos<00:00:14.830> now

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
working with forms for a few videos now

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.249 
working with forms for a few videos now
and<00:00:16.000> I've<00:00:16.090> got<00:00:16.270> to<00:00:16.360> form<00:00:16.599> here<00:00:16.840> that<00:00:16.990> I'm<00:00:17.050> going

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
and I've got to form here that I'm going

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:23.609 
and I've got to form here that I'm going
to<00:00:17.320> open<00:00:17.380> in<00:00:17.710> design<00:00:18.040> view<00:00:22.170> she's<00:00:23.170> got<00:00:23.380> two

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
to open in design view she's got two

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:24.540 
to open in design view she's got two
fields<00:00:24.130> on<00:00:24.250> it

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
fields on it

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.349 
fields on it
remember<00:00:25.000> these<00:00:25.150> are<00:00:25.180> bound<00:00:25.890> controls

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
remember these are bound controls

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.160 
remember these are bound controls
because<00:00:28.359> they<00:00:28.510> are<00:00:28.599> linked<00:00:28.900> to<00:00:28.960> the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
because they are linked to the

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.549 
because they are linked to the
datasource

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
datasource

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.140 
datasource
we've<00:00:32.559> looked<00:00:32.860> at<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.309> number<00:00:33.550> of<00:00:33.730> ways<00:00:33.940> of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
we've looked at a number of ways of

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.380 
we've looked at a number of ways of
adding<00:00:34.330> data<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.649> the<00:00:35.739> form<00:00:36.210> controls<00:00:37.210> the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
adding data to the form controls the

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.580 
adding data to the form controls the
form<00:00:37.660> one<00:00:38.350> is<00:00:38.469> to<00:00:38.620> simply<00:00:39.010> select<00:00:39.910> a<00:00:40.230> new<00:00:41.230> field

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
form one is to simply select a new field

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.830 
form one is to simply select a new field
from<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.160> field<00:00:42.190> list<00:00:42.550> so<00:00:43.239> we<00:00:43.329> have<00:00:43.420> our<00:00:43.570> field

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
from the field list so we have our field

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.260 
from the field list so we have our field
list<00:00:44.110> button<00:00:44.350> there<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:45.790> we<00:00:45.879> can<00:00:46.000> click<00:00:46.210> and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
list button there and we can click and

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.319 
list button there and we can click and
drag<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:47.079> county<00:00:47.469> field<00:00:47.710> for<00:00:47.980> example<00:00:48.329> onto

drag the county field for example onto
our<00:00:49.480> form<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.940> allows<00:00:52.270> us<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.480> type<00:00:52.930> in<00:00:53.260> on

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
our form that allows us to type in on

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.209 
our form that allows us to type in on
the<00:00:54.940> textbox<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:56.559> information<00:00:57.129> that's

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
the textbox the information that's

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.150 
the textbox the information that's
required<00:00:57.340> and<00:00:57.940> that's<00:00:58.329> linked<00:00:58.829> back<00:00:59.829> to<00:00:59.860> the

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
required and that's linked back to the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.189 
required and that's linked back to the
table<00:01:00.579> that<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:03.340> simply<00:01:03.670> adding<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.720> field<00:01:04.989> by

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
table that was simply adding a field by

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.450 
table that was simply adding a field by
clicking<00:01:05.229> and<00:01:05.770> dragging<00:01:06.180> let's<00:01:07.180> delete<00:01:07.510> that

we<00:01:09.460> also<00:01:09.580> look<00:01:09.970> at<00:01:10.530> using<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.619> control

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
we also look at using the control

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.640 
we also look at using the control
toolbox<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:16.210> add<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.659> number<00:01:17.049> of<00:01:17.229> different

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
toolbox to add a number of different

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.850 
toolbox to add a number of different
controls<00:01:18.009> you<00:01:18.880> first<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.600> all<00:01:19.750> looked<00:01:19.990> at<00:01:20.170> the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
controls you first of all looked at the

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.740 
controls you first of all looked at the
combo<00:01:21.369> box<00:01:21.930> which<00:01:22.930> allowed<00:01:23.290> us<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.710> use<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
combo box which allowed us to use a

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.700 
combo box which allowed us to use a
wizard<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:27.520> either<00:01:28.090> type<00:01:28.630> in<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.049> information

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
wizard to either type in the information

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.300 
wizard to either type in the information
such<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.970> county<00:01:31.420> name<00:01:31.659> or<00:01:32.409> look<00:01:33.040> at<00:01:33.220> the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310

information<00:01:33.549> up<00:01:33.970> in<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.420> table<00:01:34.930> that<00:01:35.049> already

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
information up in a table that already

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.969 
information up in a table that already
existed<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.600> then<00:01:37.720> type<00:01:38.020> that<00:01:38.259> information

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979

in<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:42.250> you<00:01:42.369> go<00:01:42.520> through<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.880> wizard<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.780> can

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
in as you go through the wizard you can

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.830 
in as you go through the wizard you can
choose<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.470> store<00:01:44.829> that<00:01:45.070> information<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:46.540> the

county field delete that one as well

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.690 
county field delete that one as well
we<00:01:53.740> also<00:01:53.920> looked<00:01:54.460> at<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:56.340> option<00:01:57.340> buttons

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
we also looked at the option buttons

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.760 
we also looked at the option buttons
here<00:01:57.880> which<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.299> checkbox<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.409> option

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
here which of the checkbox the option

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.249 
here which of the checkbox the option
button<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.579> toggle<00:02:00.880> button<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:02.110> define

the<00:02:03.040> type<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.420> display<00:02:04.420> there<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.840> yes/no<00:02:05.350> field

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
the type of display there a yes/no field

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.160 
the type of display there a yes/no field
will<00:02:05.950> have<00:02:08.610> because<00:02:09.610> we<00:02:09.759> had<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.299> option

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
will have because we had the option

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.410 
will have because we had the option
button<00:02:11.470> selected<00:02:11.890> first<00:02:12.220> we<00:02:12.819> get<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.150> round

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
button selected first we get the round

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.390 
button selected first we get the round
optional<00:02:14.319> sometimes<00:02:15.010> called<00:02:15.220> radio<00:02:15.640> button

optional sometimes called radio button

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.500 
optional sometimes called radio button
there<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:19.849> lesson<00:02:20.060> we're<00:02:20.299> going<00:02:20.450> to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
there but in this lesson we're going to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.360 
there but in this lesson we're going to
look<00:02:20.659> at<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:22.000> option<00:02:23.000> group<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.980> option

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
look at the option group the option

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.869 
look at the option group the option
groups<00:02:25.640> allows<00:02:26.120> us<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.860> allow<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.920> data<00:02:28.159> entry

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
groups allows us to allow the data entry

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.599 
groups allows us to allow the data entry
person<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.750> make<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:30.489> choice<00:02:32.859> based<00:02:33.859> on<00:02:34.159> what<00:02:34.400> we

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
person to make a choice based on what we

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.490 
person to make a choice based on what we
enter<00:02:35.090> during<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.959> wizard

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
enter during this wizard

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.170 
enter during this wizard
so<00:02:36.980> again<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.250> make<00:02:37.609> sure<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:37.849> your

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
so again just make sure that your

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.750 
so again just make sure that your
control<00:02:38.689> wizards<00:02:39.079> is<00:02:39.230> switched<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:40.340> really

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
control wizards is switched on it really

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.500

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
display is going to look like we got a

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.560 
display is going to look like we got a
preview<00:04:48.500> window<00:04:49.010> here<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.400> sample<00:04:50.090> and

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
preview window here a sample and

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.960 
preview window here a sample and
couldn't<00:04:51.350> be<00:04:51.440> good<00:04:51.590> option<00:04:52.070> button<00:04:52.400> selected

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
couldn't be good option button selected

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.600 
couldn't be good option button selected
and<00:04:53.150> that's<00:04:53.690> what<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.080> would<00:04:54.200> look<00:04:54.350> like<00:04:54.610> we

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
and that's what it would look like we

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.320 
and that's what it would look like we
can<00:04:55.790> choose<00:04:56.030> checkboxes<00:04:56.870> or<00:04:57.940> toggle<00:04:58.940> buttons

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
can choose checkboxes or toggle buttons

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.710 
can choose checkboxes or toggle buttons
and<00:05:00.220> then<00:05:01.220> we<00:05:01.340> can<00:05:01.520> choose<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:01.940> appearance<00:05:02.480> of

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
and then we can choose the appearance of

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.110 
and then we can choose the appearance of
those<00:05:03.260> various<00:05:03.710> options<00:05:04.160> I<00:05:05.740> quite<00:05:06.740> like

or 2 or 3 depending on the button that
we<00:06:28.100> pressed<00:06:29.919> so<00:06:30.919> why<00:06:31.100> would<00:06:31.340> we<00:06:31.490> have<00:06:31.730> this

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
we pressed so why would we have this

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.530 
we pressed so why would we have this
rather<00:06:32.210> than<00:06:32.480> Essex<00:06:32.930> or<00:06:33.200> communal<00:06:33.830> or

rather than Essex or communal or
Lancashire<00:06:35.770> well<00:06:36.770> one<00:06:37.010> of<00:06:37.160> the<00:06:37.250> reasons<00:06:37.639> is<00:06:37.940> to

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
Lancashire well one of the reasons is to

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.850 
Lancashire well one of the reasons is to
save<00:06:38.840> space<00:06:39.520> I've<00:06:40.520> typed<00:06:40.940> Cumbria<00:06:41.810> Essex<00:06:42.620> and

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
save space I've typed Cumbria Essex and

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.730 
save space I've typed Cumbria Essex and
