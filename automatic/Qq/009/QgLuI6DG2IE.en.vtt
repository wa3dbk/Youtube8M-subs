00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.690
 we have to understand that the nba 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.180
 the modern versions of the bible to 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.190
 based on textual criticism 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.890
 that brings us to the reconstruction of 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.800
 text in its originality than it was 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.689
 originally 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 through the study of thousands of 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.130
 manuscripts that we have today when 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.460
 we say remove from the text what we are 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.009
 removing in what I added before 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.770
 not what was originally from the text 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.559
 That means we are seeking 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.960
 the integrity of the text that is such 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.989
 it came out of the pen generally 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 original authors like that the rv and 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.690
 no modern version of the bible that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.220
 parents are accusing us that we are 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.899
 removing the text what we are 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.620
 removing is what it never shows and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.390
 because he will add by copyists that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.809
 they did interpolation is through 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.580
 the centuries and usually these 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.789
 additions are after centuries 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.950
 fourth fifth seventh and aisha forward 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:12.080
 but thank God today we have 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.270
 amounts of documents and manuscripts 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.470
 prior to the fourth and fifth century 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.330
 full bibles of the fourth century 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.050
 and we are testimonial not once but 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.830
 thousands of times those thousands of manuscripts 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.520
 that finished additions to the text 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.080
 game for example to what we call the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.540
 last part of the Lord 's Prayer from which 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.370
 we talked about in this same presentation 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.240
 they were added after the fifth century 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.840
 sixth seventh and up to twelve 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.420
 so that we are not taking anything away 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.149
 of the original text but by removing that 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.729
 that altered the original text with phrases 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.600
 or with words that were never in 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.540
 the original text 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.380
 on the other hand it is not only to remove 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.020
 but add 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.540
 we are accused and condemned sometimes 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.670
 saying using 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.350
 the text of the apocalypse of him 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.240
 last chapter the apocalypse of what 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.150
 if someone adds something 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.610
 sorry that if someone removes words of 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.280
 this book of prophecy God will take away 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.380
 its part of the tree of life and the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.380
 holy city described in this book already 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.630
 I explained we have no conscience 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.450
 of having removed nothing but everything 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.670
 otherwise the text was reinstated and not 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.220
 we see nothing we have taken nothing from the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.790
 original text of the bible but that 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.870
 same passage of the apocalypse of 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.210
 verse 18 says if someone adds you 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.010
 something 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.780
 and that is perhaps what has not happened 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.640
 count many people who are the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.650
 restoration of the integrity of 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.690
 text that the new action has made 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.920
 international and many today almost 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.280
 all modern versions of the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.710
 bible is even add words that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.750
 they were not removed from the 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.790
 text for some other reason no mission 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.120
 involuntary some mistake 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.970
 anything from a copyist also from 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.830
 the later centuries and the bible 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.230
 restored the text in one version 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.960
 international adding those words 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.030
 what if they are 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.770
 in the originals according to the testimony 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.900
 of study and textual criticism of 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.200
 all these oldest manuscripts 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.890
 only wash with an example 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.810
 and it's very interesting in frames 3 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.060
 verse 13 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.160
 to 19 is what is called the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.630
 appointment of the twelve apostles who 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.960
 now very important is what the 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.380
 apostles 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.110
 says that Jesus climbed a mountain and 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.740
 he called those he wanted whom he 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:13.840
 they met with him he appointed twelve and 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.049
 I heard this to those who appointed apostles 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.739
 here in the apostles they gathered shoulder 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.500
 etc. etc. etc. him that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.660
 phrase to those who appointed apostles not 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.449
 they are in the traditional versions of 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.430
 the bible as king james as the mail 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.040
 in Portuguese as the same queen valera 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.010
 in Spanish that phrase to whom he named 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.460
 apostles for some reason disappeared 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.080
 in the handwriting of manuscripts and then 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.680
 does not appear in the expressions 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.380
 traditional but textual criticism 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.180
 that follows the new international version 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.030
 discovered in the thousands and hundreds of 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.770
 manuscripts that we have prior to 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.889
 the centuries that I mentioned that 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.020
 appear the Greek text from their 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.410
 ancient manuscripts whom he named 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.930
 apostles and that somehow in the 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.850
 transfer of the text 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.770
 in the centuries that passed until 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.889
 now we owe it 20 degree got lost that 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.120
 phrase but this one witnessed by the 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.610
 best older manuscripts 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.100
 authoritat and vos that we have of the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.130
 scriptures and the new version what 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.860
 established it restored it that's why there's 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.750
 a side note that says variant no 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.810
 includes who he named apostles 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.789
 some of the manuscripts a criticism 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.560
 textual what it does is 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.960
 restoration of the integrity of 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.620
 text adding what is missing as in the 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.880
 case of frames 3 or removing what is 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.380
 added according to the conscientious study 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.479
 of the thousands of finite hands that 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.789
 we have within our reach that 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.360
 come back much closer to the text 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.820
 original and who have had authority in 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.930
 the church in the study of the bible 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.930
 for centuries
