you no longer need that as long as you
have<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.599> see<00:02:45.840> how<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
have this on you can see how the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.100 
have this on you can see how the
Nintendo<00:02:46.650> 3ds<00:02:46.680> kind<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.730> used<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.120> be<00:02:48.330> like

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
Nintendo 3ds kind of used to be like

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.440 
Nintendo 3ds kind of used to be like
right<00:02:49.290> at<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.470> edge<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.920> right<00:02:50.130> here<00:02:50.489> let<00:02:51.360> me

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
right at the edge of right here let me

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.300 
right at the edge of right here let me
get<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.630> better<00:02:51.959> view<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.440> like<00:02:52.890> right<00:02:53.069> here

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
get a better view of it like right here

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.500 
get a better view of it like right here
that<00:02:53.549> would<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:53.760> be<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:53.880> cover<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.390> back

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
that would just be the cover on the back

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.759 
that would just be the cover on the back
but<00:02:54.690> now<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.900> got<00:02:55.079> another<00:02:55.380> little<00:02:55.620> thing

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
but now we got another little thing

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.470 
but now we got another little thing
sticking<00:02:56.160> out<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.000> see<00:02:57.120> on<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.299> top

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
sticking out and you can see on the top

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.720 
sticking out and you can see on the top
there<00:02:57.720> there's<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.769> thing<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.160> USB<00:02:59.400> cord

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
there there's the thing for the USB cord

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.850 
there there's the thing for the USB cord
that<00:02:59.849> you<00:02:59.910> plug<00:03:00.150> in<00:03:00.299> there<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:01.110> yeah<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.680> think

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
that you plug in there and yeah I think

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.979 
that you plug in there and yeah I think
that<00:03:01.980> should<00:03:02.130> work<00:03:02.430> now<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:02.670> let's<00:03:03.000> go<00:03:03.120> see<00:03:03.360> if

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
that should work now so let's go see if

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.360 
that should work now so let's go see if
I<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.260> actually<00:03:04.470> try<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:04.799> record<00:03:05.160> something

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
I can actually try and record something

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.000 
I can actually try and record something
on<00:03:05.579> there<00:03:05.760> there's<00:03:05.940> my<00:03:06.030> 3ds<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.750> have<00:03:07.590> two<00:03:07.769> games

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
on there there's my 3ds I have two games

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.440 
on there there's my 3ds I have two games

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.080 
did another lock and I'm still doing
that<00:03:49.319> so<00:03:49.650> I'm<00:03:49.950> actually<00:03:50.100> close<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.459> losing<00:03:50.700> so

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.000 
that so I'm actually close to losing so
he'll<00:03:51.239> be<00:03:51.269> good<00:03:51.510> but<00:03:52.470> yeah<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.739> seems<00:03:52.920> to

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
he'll be good but yeah this seems to

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.009 
he'll be good but yeah this seems to
look<00:03:53.160> like<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.639> gonna<00:03:53.730> work<00:03:53.850> really<00:03:54.239> well<00:03:54.450> so

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019
