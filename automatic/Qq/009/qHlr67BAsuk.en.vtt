00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
down is this one to keep it on well I

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.170 
down is this one to keep it on well I
think<00:03:31.609> so<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.030> mean<00:03:32.120> by<00:03:32.900> hitters<00:03:33.049> already

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
think so I mean by hitters already

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.930 
think so I mean by hitters already
proven<00:03:35.180> himself<00:03:35.239> at<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:36.200> track<00:03:36.940> champion

proven himself at the track champion
bumper<00:03:38.239> winner<00:03:38.389> I<00:03:38.690> think<00:03:39.260> by<00:03:39.410> quite<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.680> wide

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
bumper winner I think by quite a wide

margin<00:03:40.040> as<00:03:40.370> well<00:03:40.519> I<00:03:40.549> think<00:03:40.730> about<00:03:41.510> seven

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
margin as well I think about seven

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.159 
margin as well I think about seven
lengths<00:03:42.139> yeah<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:43.519> you<00:03:44.419> know<00:03:44.510> we<00:03:44.690> know<00:03:44.930> he

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
lengths yeah and you know we know he

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.370

likes the course and I feel his

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.190 
likes the course and I feel his
certainly<00:03:49.069> one<00:03:50.060> maybe<00:03:50.480> side<00:03:50.810> within<00:03:50.989> this

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
certainly one maybe side within this

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.309 
certainly one maybe side within this
race<00:03:51.470> yeah<00:03:51.919> i<00:03:51.950> mean<00:03:52.160> i<00:03:52.370> think<00:03:52.700> his<00:03:53.450> three<00:03:54.109> from
