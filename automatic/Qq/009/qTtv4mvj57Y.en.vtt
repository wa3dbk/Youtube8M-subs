out as and what it became kind of

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.339 
out as and what it became kind of
confusing<00:02:45.040> everyone<00:02:45.609> takes<00:02:45.999> it<00:02:46.269> what<00:02:47.260> we're

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
confusing everyone takes it what we're

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.770 
confusing everyone takes it what we're
going<00:02:47.439> to<00:02:47.530> do<00:02:47.620> instead<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:48.040> turn<00:02:48.819> agility<00:02:49.359> into

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
going to do instead is turn agility into

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.089 
going to do instead is turn agility into
the<00:02:49.870> attack<00:02:50.079> power<00:02:50.349> for<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.650> Rogues<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.040> the

the attack power for the Rogues and the

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.189 
the attack power for the Rogues and the

we're<00:03:25.010> going<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.190> implement<00:03:25.610> that<00:03:25.880> more<00:03:26.209> about

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
we're going to implement that more about

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.640 
we're going to implement that more about
survival<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.930> fittest<00:03:26.959> wrong<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:28.400> like

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
survival of the fittest wrong just like

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.059 
survival of the fittest wrong just like
run<00:03:29.829> live<00:03:29.980> right<00:03:30.159> now

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
run live right now

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.840 
run live right now
armor<00:03:33.069> penetration<00:03:33.359> this<00:03:34.359> one<00:03:34.629> actually<00:03:34.870> is

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.630 

it's<00:03:40.420> just<00:03:40.780> calls<00:03:41.050> too<00:03:41.350> many<00:03:41.530> problems<00:03:41.800> most

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
it's just calls too many problems most

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.710 
it's just calls too many problems most
people<00:03:42.940> don't<00:03:43.090> understand<00:03:43.480> how<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.690> works

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
people don't understand how it works

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.170 
people don't understand how it works
since<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.680> doesn't<00:03:45.100> do<00:03:45.400> exactly<00:03:45.880> what<00:03:46.060> you

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
since it doesn't do exactly what you

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.480 
since it doesn't do exactly what you
think<00:03:46.330> it<00:03:46.570> would<00:03:46.720> do<00:03:46.890> we're<00:03:47.890> replacing<00:03:48.130> that

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
think it would do we're replacing that

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.400 
think it would do we're replacing that
with<00:03:48.520> sekilde<00:03:49.120> mastery<00:03:49.660> which<00:03:49.690> will<00:03:50.320> be

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
with sekilde mastery which will be

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.900 
with sekilde mastery which will be
getting<00:03:50.620> into<00:03:50.860> more<00:03:51.070> later<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.430> believe<00:03:51.670> in<00:03:51.820> the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
getting into more later I believe in the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.670 
getting into more later I believe in the
system's<00:03:52.300> panel<00:03:52.660> which<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.840> tomorrow<00:03:53.140> yeah

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
system's panel which is tomorrow yeah

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.360 
system's panel which is tomorrow yeah
okay<00:03:54.210> if<00:03:55.210> you<00:03:55.330> won't<00:03:55.420> know<00:03:55.540> what<00:03:55.630> master<00:03:56.020> does

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
okay if you won't know what master does

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.410 
okay if you won't know what master does
systems<00:03:57.370> panel<00:03:57.670> tomorrow<00:03:57.790> you'll<00:03:58.270> get<00:03:58.390> a

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
systems panel tomorrow you'll get a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.970 
systems panel tomorrow you'll get a
little<00:03:58.690> insight<00:03:58.990> into<00:03:59.290> how<00:03:59.590> that's<00:03:59.800> going<00:03:59.920> to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
little insight into how that's going to

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.340 
little insight into how that's going to
work<00:04:00.040> but<00:04:00.460> basically<00:04:00.910> whatever<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:02.080> like<00:04:02.320> to

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
work but basically whatever you like to

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.010 
work but basically whatever you like to
do<00:04:02.680> mastery<00:04:03.250> makes<00:04:03.460> you<00:04:03.580> better<00:04:03.820> at<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.720> if

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
do mastery makes you better at it so if

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.720 
do mastery makes you better at it so if
you<00:04:05.110> like<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.410> heal<00:04:05.590> if<00:04:05.770> you<00:04:05.890> like<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.130> tank<00:04:06.370> if

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
you like to heal if you like the tank if

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.810 
you like to heal if you like the tank if
you're<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.020> hunter<00:04:08.020> and<00:04:08.170> you<00:04:09.130> like<00:04:09.430> your<00:04:09.610> pet

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
you're a hunter and you like your pet

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.700 
you're a hunter and you like your pet
it'll<00:04:10.360> make<00:04:10.390> your<00:04:10.600> pet<00:04:10.780> better<00:04:11.190> it's<00:04:12.190> magic

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
it'll make your pet better it's magic

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:21.249 
it'll make your pet better it's magic
haste

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.510 

so

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.909 

so<00:04:27.060> we<00:04:27.330> talked<00:04:27.539> a<00:04:27.629> lot<00:04:27.750> about<00:04:27.810> haste<00:04:28.259> and<00:04:28.620> it's

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
so we talked a lot about haste and it's

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.129 
so we talked a lot about haste and it's
been<00:04:29.190> continuously<00:04:30.060> just<00:04:30.389> causing<00:04:30.780> problems

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
been continuously just causing problems

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.110 
been continuously just causing problems
since<00:04:31.319> we<00:04:31.470> implemented<00:04:31.770> mainly<00:04:32.639> because<00:04:32.759> it

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
since we implemented mainly because it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.879 
since we implemented mainly because it
does<00:04:33.270> very<00:04:33.840> different<00:04:34.199> things<00:04:34.379> depending<00:04:34.560> on

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
does very different things depending on

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.490 
does very different things depending on
your<00:04:35.009> class<00:04:35.250> or<00:04:35.280> spec<00:04:36.080> casters<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.229> basically

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
your class or spec casters it basically

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.869 
your class or spec casters it basically
does<00:04:37.740> what<00:04:37.979> we<00:04:38.069> originally<00:04:38.159> intended<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:38.849> to

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
does what we originally intended it to

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.399 
does what we originally intended it to
which<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.599> get<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.840> push<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.139> buttons

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
which is you get to push the buttons

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.399 
which is you get to push the buttons
more<00:04:40.879> melee<00:04:41.879> not<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:42.389> much<00:04:42.569> so<00:04:42.870> we're<00:04:43.229> going<00:04:43.319> to
