of<00:00:18.810> duty<00:00:18.990> character<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.560> instead<00:00:19.890> I've<00:00:20.070> sort

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
of duty character but instead I've sort

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.040 
of duty character but instead I've sort
of<00:00:20.689> edited<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:21.980> made<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.010> into<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.310> female

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
of edited it and made it into a female

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.589

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
way on how to do it which there's only

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.779 
way on how to do it which there's only
one<00:00:50.420> downer<00:00:51.980> actually<00:00:52.980> no<00:00:53.160> that's<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
one downer actually no that's not a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.490 
one downer actually no that's not a
downer<00:00:54.030> actually<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.289> could<00:00:55.440> do

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
downer actually what you you could do

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.729 
downer actually what you you could do
that<00:00:55.530> yourself<00:00:55.890> actually<00:00:56.010> i'll<00:00:56.219> get<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.520> that

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
that yourself actually i'll get to that

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.119 
that yourself actually i'll get to that
obviously<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:59.370> got<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> skeleton<00:00:59.910> rig<00:01:00.059> but

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
obviously it's got the skeleton rig but

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.390 
obviously it's got the skeleton rig but
the<00:01:02.129> arms<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.760> head<00:01:03.260> are<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.680> part<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the arms and head are not part of the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440 
the arms and head are not part of the
actual<00:01:05.670> Rick<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:05.970> I've<00:01:06.060> done<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.360> I've

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
actual Rick what I've done is I've

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.750 
actual Rick what I've done is I've
actually<00:01:06.630> dropped<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> arms<00:01:07.500> into<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> elbow

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
actually dropped the arms into the elbow

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.010 
actually dropped the arms into the elbow
and<00:01:09.409> that<00:01:10.409> way<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.680> i<00:01:10.799> move<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> elbow<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:12.570> will

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and that way if i move the elbow it will

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560 
and that way if i move the elbow it will
still<00:01:13.409> move<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.369> arm<00:01:14.549> itself<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.330> kind

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
still move the arm itself so it's kind

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.730 
still move the arm itself so it's kind
of<00:01:15.659> rigged<00:01:16.729> but<00:01:17.729> yams<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.420> separate<00:01:18.869> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of rigged but yams just separate you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.580 
of rigged but yams just separate you
know<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> arms<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:21.750> be<00:01:21.780> taken<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.259> at<00:01:22.409> any

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
know the arms can be taken out at any

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.050 
know the arms can be taken out at any
time<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.250> it'll<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.640> best<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.000> just

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
time but it'll be best if you just

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.530 
time but it'll be best if you just
didn't<00:01:24.509> even<00:01:24.930> touch<00:01:25.650> them<00:01:26.299> they'll<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.450> all

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
didn't even touch them they'll be all

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.899 
didn't even touch them they'll be all
right<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.930> they<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.430> could<00:01:29.610> if

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
right as they are but if you could if

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.429 
right as they are but if you could if
you<00:01:29.970> wanted<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.329> rig<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> hands<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
you wanted to rig the hands and that you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.899 
you wanted to rig the hands and that you
could<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> yourself<00:01:32.159> but<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> rig

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
could do it yourself but you have to rig

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.649 
could do it yourself but you have to rig
the<00:01:33.030> arm<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> drop<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.579> skeleton<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the arm so drop this the skeleton of the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.569 
the arm so drop this the skeleton of the
hand<00:01:36.960> into<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> army<00:01:37.799> connect<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> delete

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
hand into the army connect and delete

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
hand into the army connect and delete
that<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> then<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.320> fingers

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that and then you can do your fingers

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.789 
that and then you can do your fingers
and<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:42.170> actually<00:01:43.170> didn't<00:01:43.500> even<00:01:43.649> think

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
and I actually didn't even think

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.620

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
and I've just combined it all into one

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.970 
and I've just combined it all into one
and<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.630> various<00:02:31.050> animations<00:02:31.590> again

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and you can do various animations again

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.540 
and you can do various animations again
you<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.370> solve<00:02:32.580> rigged<00:02:33.020> with<00:02:34.020> endorphin<00:02:34.680> but

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
you can solve rigged with endorphin but

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.370 
you can solve rigged with endorphin but
you'd<00:02:36.270> have<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.510> drag<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> arms<00:02:37.140> into<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
you'd have to drag the arms into the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.150 
you'd have to drag the arms into the
elbows<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.220> skeleton<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.920> move<00:02:40.920> them<00:02:41.070> in

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
elbows of that skeleton and move them in

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.380 
elbows of that skeleton and move them in
