still the franchise is looking to make

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.479 
still the franchise is looking to make
some<00:00:37.530> moves<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.870> one<00:00:39.870> has<00:00:40.050> been<00:00:40.230> made<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.739> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
some moves and one has been made and I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.450 
some moves and one has been made and I
think<00:00:41.760> that's<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.710> just<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.129> leads<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
think that's just just just leads to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.180 
think that's just just just leads to
another<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.180> think<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:46.190> something

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
another one I think it's just something

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
another one I think it's just something
for<00:00:47.670> something<00:00:47.969> else<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.180> happen<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:49.230> again

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
sweet moment when you get that first big

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.640

especially<00:03:06.739> from<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:08.209> team<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.599> play

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
especially from the team that you play

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.589 
especially from the team that you play
with<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:11.090> know<00:03:11.180> he's<00:03:11.329> in<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:11.510> great

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
with and you know he's in a great

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.740 
with and you know he's in a great
situation<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.349> think<00:03:13.360> reverses<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.480> right<00:03:14.629> now

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
situation I think reverses it right now

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.390 
situation I think reverses it right now
at<00:03:14.900> a<00:03:15.079> point<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.560> they<00:03:16.010> have<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.250> take

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
at a point that they have to take

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.650 
at a point that they have to take
advantage<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.000> personnel<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.450> they

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
advantage of the personnel that they

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.270 
advantage of the personnel that they
have<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.440> moment<00:03:18.739> they<00:03:18.769> going<00:03:19.069> through

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
have and the moment they going through

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.470 
have and the moment they going through
and<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:19.790> think<00:03:19.940> that's<00:03:20.060> what<00:03:20.180> they're<00:03:20.269> doing

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
and I think that's what they're doing

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.240 
and I think that's what they're doing
they're<00:03:20.569> just<00:03:20.810> keeping<00:03:20.989> their<00:03:21.200> team<00:03:21.440> pretty

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
they're just keeping their team pretty

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.069 
they're just keeping their team pretty
much<00:03:22.340> intact<00:03:22.730> should<00:03:23.239> he<00:03:23.329> throw<00:03:23.569> you<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.750> couple

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
much intact should he throw you a couple

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.870 
much intact should he throw you a couple
bucks<00:03:24.230> because<00:03:24.530> we<00:03:24.889> really<00:03:25.190> don't<00:03:25.489> deal<00:03:25.609> with

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
bucks because we really don't deal with

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.490

you

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500

post and stuff so so I'll be always in
there<00:05:02.700> so<00:05:03.700> what<00:05:04.120> about<00:05:04.240> I<00:05:04.360> think<00:05:04.510> there's

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
there so what about I think there's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.200 
there so what about I think there's
another<00:05:05.169> weapon<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:05.950> think<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.340> can<00:05:06.490> add<00:05:06.610> to

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.000 
another weapon that I think I can add to
my<00:05:07.360> repertoire<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:08.260> I<00:05:08.410> think<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.800> team<00:05:08.979> can

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
my repertoire and I think the team can

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.690 
my repertoire and I think the team can
use<00:05:09.370> if<00:05:10.150> he<00:05:10.300> decides<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:11.070> so<00:05:12.070> I'm<00:05:12.370> really

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
use if he decides to so I'm really

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.279 
use if he decides to so I'm really
comfortable<00:05:13.120> with<00:05:13.210> it

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
season you wanted oh that was I was

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.239 
season you wanted oh that was I was
totally<00:05:30.909> off<00:05:31.089> I<00:05:31.300> mean<00:05:31.899> if<00:05:32.169> you<00:05:32.439> practice<00:05:32.979> shots

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:33.249 
totally off I mean if you practice shots

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.119 
totally off I mean if you practice shots
then<00:05:33.819> I<00:05:34.360> think<00:05:34.869> it's<00:05:35.289> a<00:05:35.409> lot<00:05:35.559> easier<00:05:35.589> more

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
then I think it's a lot easier more

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.989 
then I think it's a lot easier more
comfortable<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.849> apply<00:05:37.719> it<00:05:37.779> and<00:05:38.969> translate<00:05:39.969> it

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:39.999 
comfortable to apply it and translate it

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.179 
comfortable to apply it and translate it
and<00:05:40.240> bring<00:05:40.599> to<00:05:40.779> the<00:05:40.869> game<00:05:40.899> I<00:05:41.289> didn't<00:05:41.860> probably

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:42.189 
and bring to the game I didn't probably

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:44.129 
and bring to the game I didn't probably
never<00:05:42.339> practice<00:05:42.909> that<00:05:43.089> play<00:05:43.119> well<00:05:43.990> I<00:05:44.020> never

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
never practice that play well I never

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.969 
never practice that play well I never
pretty<00:05:44.889> much<00:05:45.129> shot<00:05:45.399> a<00:05:45.460> 3<00:05:46.559> during<00:05:47.559> the<00:05:47.619> season

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
pretty much shot a 3 during the season

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.070 
pretty much shot a 3 during the season
so<00:05:48.309> to<00:05:48.550> win<00:05:48.819> a<00:05:48.849> game<00:05:49.029> or<00:05:49.089> tie<00:05:49.449> game<00:05:49.479> i<00:05:49.779> think<00:05:49.809> was

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
so to win a game or tie game i think was

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.909 
so to win a game or tie game i think was
at<00:05:50.169> that<00:05:50.259> point<00:05:50.639> it<00:05:51.639> was<00:05:51.819> a<00:05:51.879> one<00:05:52.209> of<00:05:52.300> feels<00:05:53.020> you

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
at that point it was a one of feels you

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.499 
at that point it was a one of feels you
know<00:05:53.949> magic<00:05:54.339> moments<00:05:54.999> i<00:05:55.119> guess<00:05:56.249> but<00:05:57.249> if<00:05:57.879> we<00:05:58.389> do

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
know magic moments i guess but if we do

00:05:58.509 --> 00:05:59.869 
know magic moments i guess but if we do
practice<00:05:58.959> them<00:05:59.050> now<00:05:59.229> and<00:05:59.499> I<00:05:59.589> take

00:05:59.869 --> 00:05:59.879 
practice them now and I take

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:03.149 
practice them now and I take
consistently<00:06:00.879> a<00:06:01.209> lot<00:06:01.569> of<00:06:01.659> threes<00:06:01.869> at<00:06:02.649> practice

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
consistently a lot of threes at practice

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.399 
consistently a lot of threes at practice
and<00:06:03.189> stuff<00:06:03.520> I<00:06:03.729> think<00:06:03.969> we<00:06:04.059> can<00:06:04.209> we<00:06:04.959> can<00:06:05.110> get<00:06:05.229> some
