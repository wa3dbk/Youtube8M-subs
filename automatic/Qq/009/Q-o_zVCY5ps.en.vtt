00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.720 

here's<00:00:01.079> how<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.380> Ben<00:00:01.680> controls<00:00:02.220> in<00:00:02.460> slide

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
here's how the Ben controls in slide

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.670 
here's how the Ben controls in slide
laps<00:00:03.000> still<00:00:03.300> work<00:00:03.600> I'll<00:00:03.899> go<00:00:04.350> through<00:00:04.560> each

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
laps still work I'll go through each

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.400 
laps still work I'll go through each
control<00:00:05.160> individually<00:00:05.940> so<00:00:06.720> first<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.080> all<00:00:07.230> we

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
control individually so first of all we

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.280 
control individually so first of all we
have<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.710> bend<00:00:07.919> range<00:00:08.309> control<00:00:08.900> that<00:00:09.900> sets

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
have the bend range control that sets

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.470 
have the bend range control that sets
how<00:00:10.559> many<00:00:10.769> steps<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.429> pitch<00:00:11.639> wheel<00:00:11.910> bends<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
how many steps the pitch wheel bends the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.140 
how many steps the pitch wheel bends the
note<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:13.950> example<00:00:14.370> because<00:00:14.730> I've<00:00:14.880> got<00:00:15.030> it

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
note so for example because I've got it

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.740 
note so for example because I've got it
snapped<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.809> chromatic<00:00:16.529> scale<00:00:17.390> two<00:00:18.390> steps

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
snapped to the chromatic scale two steps

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.380 
snapped to the chromatic scale two steps
would<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.170> whole<00:00:19.650> step<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.820> other<00:00:20.850> scales

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
would be a whole step the other scales

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.330 
would be a whole step the other scales
that<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.779> choose<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.260> include<00:00:22.800> major

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
that you can choose from include major

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.080 
that you can choose from include major
minor<00:00:24.090> diminished<00:00:24.769> melodic<00:00:25.769> minor<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.310> whole

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
minor diminished melodic minor and whole

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.769 
minor diminished melodic minor and whole
tone<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.010> chromatic<00:00:29.550> if<00:00:29.760> I've<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.269> set

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
tone so in chromatic if I've got it set

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
tone so in chromatic if I've got it set
to<00:00:30.960> two<00:00:31.170> steps<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:32.009> would<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.309> whole<00:00:32.640> step

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to two steps that would be a whole step

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.530 
to two steps that would be a whole step
if<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.809> put<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.260> major<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.040> set<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.540> to

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
if I put it in major and set it to to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.680 
if I put it in major and set it to to
bend<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.989> single<00:00:37.380> step<00:00:37.770> whether<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.940> bends<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
bend a single step whether it bends a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.380 
bend a single step whether it bends a
whole<00:00:40.379> step<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.010> half<00:00:41.340> step<00:00:41.700> depends<00:00:42.270> on

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
whole step or a half step depends on

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
whole step or a half step depends on
which<00:00:42.690> note<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.230> play<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.550> example<00:00:44.910> if<00:00:45.000> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
which note you play so for example if I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.779 
which note you play so for example if I
if<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.390> play<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> C<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.350> by<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> way<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> key<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
if I play a C and by the way the key is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.209 
if I play a C and by the way the key is
set<00:00:48.030> using<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.539> snap<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.379> key<00:00:49.649> control<00:00:50.070> right

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
set using this snap to key control right

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
set using this snap to key control right
here<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.670> I've<00:00:50.789> got<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:50.969> set<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> C<00:00:52.079> major

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
here so I've got it set to C major

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.569 
here so I've got it set to C major
essentially<00:00:53.309> right<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:53.899> if<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.079> play<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.280> root

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
essentially right now if I play the root

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.450 
essentially right now if I play the root
which<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.239> C<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.160> Bend<00:01:00.140> it'll<00:01:01.140> Bend<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> D

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
which is C and Bend it'll Bend up to a D

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.440 
which is C and Bend it'll Bend up to a D
or<00:01:02.730> down<00:01:03.650> to<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> B<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.850> half<00:01:06.090> step<00:01:06.420> so

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
or down to a B which is a half step so

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.690 
or down to a B which is a half step so
either<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> whole<00:01:07.110> step<00:01:07.380> upwards<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.100> half<00:01:08.369> step

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
either a whole step upwards or half step

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.570 
either a whole step upwards or half step
downwards<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.900> basically<00:01:10.350> snaps<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.189> range

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
downwards so basically snaps the range

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.270 
downwards so basically snaps the range
of<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> pitch<00:01:12.180> wheel<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> scale<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.010> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
of the pitch wheel to the scale that you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.859 
of the pitch wheel to the scale that you
set

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
set

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.440 
set
lastly<00:01:16.500> I'll<00:01:16.680> go<00:01:16.830> through<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:17.390> these<00:01:18.390> two

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
lastly I'll go through these these two

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
lastly I'll go through these these two
controls<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.320> bend<00:01:19.560> effect<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.340> Bend

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
controls the bend effect and Bend

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.990 
controls the bend effect and Bend
handling<00:01:21.330> controls<00:01:22.400> right<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.880> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
handling controls right now I have it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.140 
handling controls right now I have it
set<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> pitch<00:01:25.830> wheel<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.400> affect<00:01:26.909> all

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
set for the pitch wheel to affect all

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.050 
set for the pitch wheel to affect all
notes<00:01:27.710> but<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.979> use<00:01:29.159> these<00:01:29.310> controls<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
notes but you can use these controls to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.870 
notes but you can use these controls to
limit<00:01:30.540> which<00:01:31.049> notes<00:01:31.409> get<00:01:32.159> affected<00:01:32.640> by<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
limit which notes get affected by the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.690 
limit which notes get affected by the
pitch<00:01:33.420> wheel<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.740> example<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.310> put<00:01:35.340> this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
pitch wheel so for example if I put this

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.450 
pitch wheel so for example if I put this
to<00:01:36.000> low<00:01:36.780> which<00:01:37.259> stands<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.860> lowest<00:01:38.250> note

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
to low which stands for the lowest note

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
to low which stands for the lowest note
and<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.729> play<00:01:38.970> two<00:01:39.240> notes<00:01:39.270> at<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.659> same<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:41.899> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
and I play two notes at the same time it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.999 
and I play two notes at the same time it
will<00:01:43.110> only<00:01:43.350> Bend<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.159> lowest<00:01:44.490> note<00:01:46.009> there's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
will only Bend the lowest note there's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.969 
will only Bend the lowest note there's
also<00:01:47.220> highest<00:01:47.909> note<00:01:48.149> first<00:01:48.930> note<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.500> last

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
also highest note first note and last

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980 
also highest note first note and last
note<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> first<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> last<00:01:51.030> note<00:01:51.360> stand<00:01:51.750> for

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
note the first and last note stand for

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
note the first and last note stand for
which<00:01:52.140> order<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.130> press<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> keys<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:55.460> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
which order you you press the keys in so

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.980 
which order you you press the keys in so
if<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.790> put<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> lowest<00:01:57.479> note<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.960> I

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
if I put it to the lowest note and I

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.469 
if I put it to the lowest note and I
play<00:01:58.259> three<00:01:58.619> notes<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:59.189> only<00:01:59.460> going<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.850> bend

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
play three notes it's only going to bend

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.020 
play three notes it's only going to bend
the<00:02:00.930> very<00:02:01.140> lowest<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.040> those<00:02:02.369> three<00:02:02.700> like

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the very lowest one of those three like

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.770 
the very lowest one of those three like
this<00:02:05.570> now<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.930> want<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.910> Bend<00:02:09.509> all

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
this now if I want to have it Bend all

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.479 
this now if I want to have it Bend all
of<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> lower<00:02:10.229> notes<00:02:10.560> except<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
of the lower notes except for the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.770 
of the lower notes except for the
highest<00:02:11.849> note<00:02:12.090> that's<00:02:12.660> where<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.050> last

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
highest note that's where this last

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.350 
highest note that's where this last
Bend<00:02:14.170> handling<00:02:14.770> control<00:02:15.130> comes<00:02:15.400> in<00:02:15.640> there<00:02:16.240> are

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
Bend handling control comes in there are

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.970 
Bend handling control comes in there are
two<00:02:16.510> settings<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.230> control<00:02:17.590> there's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
two settings for this control there's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.810 
two settings for this control there's
include<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.910> exclude<00:02:19.710> if<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:21.310> put<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
include and exclude if I put it to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.480 
include and exclude if I put it to
exclude<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:23.050> exclude<00:02:23.620> one<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.280> notes

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
exclude I can exclude one of the notes

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.900 
exclude I can exclude one of the notes
from<00:02:24.760> getting<00:02:25.330> affected<00:02:25.420> by<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.080> pitch<00:02:26.560> wheel

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
from getting affected by the pitch wheel

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.000 
from getting affected by the pitch wheel
so<00:02:27.910> if<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.540> want<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.960> hold<00:02:29.260> three<00:02:29.590> notes<00:02:29.800> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
so if I want to hold three notes and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.500 
so if I want to hold three notes and
Bend<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.930> lower<00:02:32.200> two<00:02:33.360> essentially<00:02:34.360> what

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
Bend just the lower two essentially what

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.810 
Bend just the lower two essentially what
I<00:02:34.540> want<00:02:34.780> what<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.990> want<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.290> do<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.770> exclude<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
I want what I want to do is exclude the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.699 
I want what I want to do is exclude the
highest<00:02:37.180> note<00:02:37.390> from<00:02:37.870> being<00:02:38.080> affected<00:02:38.530> by<00:02:38.650> the

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
highest note from being affected by the

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.060 
highest note from being affected by the
pitch<00:02:39.010> wheel<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:40.209> let's<00:02:40.420> try<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.690> I'll<00:02:41.560> play

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
pitch wheel so let's try this I'll play

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.350 
pitch wheel so let's try this I'll play
three<00:02:42.370> notes<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.850> then<00:02:43.240> bend<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.140> lower<00:02:44.320> two

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.150 

similarly<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.540> could<00:02:49.720> put<00:02:50.350> this<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.680> exclude

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
similarly you could put this to exclude

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.310 
similarly you could put this to exclude
only<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.880> lowest<00:02:52.239> note<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:53.020> way<00:02:53.170> the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
only the lowest note and that way the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.710 
only the lowest note and that way the
highest<00:02:53.709> two<00:02:53.980> will<00:02:54.940> be<00:02:55.090> affected<00:02:55.510> by<00:02:55.660> the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
highest two will be affected by the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.930 
highest two will be affected by the
pitch<00:02:55.959> wheel<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:59.430> hope<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.550> enjoyed<00:03:00.820> this

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
pitch wheel I hope you enjoyed this

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.370 
pitch wheel I hope you enjoyed this
video<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.450> hope<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.050> gives<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.350> a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
video and I hope but it gives you a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.710 
video and I hope but it gives you a
better<00:03:02.620> handle<00:03:03.100> on<00:03:03.220> how<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.640> use<00:03:03.970> these<00:03:04.150> pitch

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
better handle on how to use these pitch

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.320 
better handle on how to use these pitch
