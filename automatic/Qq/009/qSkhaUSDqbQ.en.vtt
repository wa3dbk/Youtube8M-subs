00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.970
 the unique fan in the concept of 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.090
 kverneland makes work smarter 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.129
 more efficient and easier 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.379
 starting with a ready offers her 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.080
 equipped with isobus technology 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.449
 machine all the requirements around in 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.059
 combination with an isobus terminal 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.940
 GPS antenna and application geo 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.309
 control to grow a system that 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.580
 They are working on the best of the moment 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.110
 and most accurate way allows in 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.080
 connection with intelligent solutions 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.670
 give sprinkle the fertilizer video spread 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.940
 but we go one step further 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:07.330
 the way of precision farming we 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.700
 call that a smart solution 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.100
 with intelligent hardware for 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.049
 highest accuracy and precision 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.840
 impact force during fertilization 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.010
 You can expect that when you are 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.979
 for example for a smart one 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.630
 isobus fertilizer spreader from kverneland or 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.210
 how can you decide with gero spread 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.130
 So we put on the operation 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.150
 windowing technology 1 in connection with already 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.060
 greedy steering system and since this season 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.980
 a fertilizer spreader a precise piece 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.640
 Sprit also from the company small country 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.640
 this bus 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.440
 Let's see what's in there 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.960
 connection with gps and e control everything 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.550
 equipped with our geo spread 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.680
 fertilizer spreader is possible it was so far 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.930
 difficult at twilight or darkness 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.860
 to see if really even 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.229
 was scattered 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.880
 so it is with geo spread from kverneland 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.100
 no problem anymore 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.860
 easy to fertilize in the dark 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.270
 because the fertilizer distribution thanks to the spread 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.550
 100 percent exactly works on the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.440
 screen of the iso busterminal you have 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.310
 the transverse distribution at any time exactly 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.840
 follow 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.840
 even with total darkness 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.159
 through the unique hard- and 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.109
 software geos board becomes the scatter width 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.689
 through an online adjustment of the 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:39.709
 Task point in two steps 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.810
 automatically adapted to the field contours 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.670
 prepare with this gps-based part 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.650
 Shutdown also tell 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.859
 triangular and irregular 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.780
 cut or bent fields 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.510
 optimal strewing results and avoid 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.129
 overlaps according to the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.389
 In addition, the scatter will be the 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.669
 regulated electricity 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:02.370
 and all at perfect cross 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.260
 Distribution with the thus obtained litter 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.959
 results avoid over-fertilization 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.519
 and save up to five percent precious 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.409
 thinner 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.810
 thanks to this bus technology , the 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:15.269
 spread with every isobus universal 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.189
 terminal are served that the isobus 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.319
 Functionality section control 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.780
 supports 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.700
 ideally the kverneland 1 tel the 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.189
 even two of these bus screens in 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.079
 but it can also offer a device 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.379
 Easily terminals other manufacturers 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.740
 to be used for them too 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.140
 decide how 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.240
 help you get the maximum return 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.070
 your investment and the 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.970
 available agricultural land too 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.950
 earn 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 we call this efficient farming 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.030
 Another big advantage is just with the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.620
 automatic shutdown or too 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.570
 these automatic parts 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.060
 circuit at dettinger technology here 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.280
 to save massive resources in the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.540
 order of magnitude of about seven to ten 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.190
 percent on our farm you want 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.280
 a step further into the world of 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.370
 Precision farming does not matter how 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.020
 you choose kverneland group 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.440
 offers the best solution for everyone 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.250
 Single farmer is getting land 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.250
 farming
