a chin there and for the other side of
the<00:01:05.489> face<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.060> come<00:01:06.240> up<00:01:06.420> level<00:01:07.260> with<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> line

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the face you come up level with the line

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.149 
the face you come up level with the line
you've<00:01:07.890> already<00:01:08.070> done<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.710> only<00:01:10.830> see

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you've already done and you can only see

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.730 
you've already done and you can only see
part<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> ear<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.350> we

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
part of the ear so what we do is we

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.880 
part of the ear so what we do is we
should<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.070> put<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.479> half<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.470> ear<00:01:16.560> shape

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
should just put on half of the ear shape

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
should just put on half of the ear shape
because<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> hair<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.240> there

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
because the hair is going to be there

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.390 
because the hair is going to be there
while<00:01:19.409> we're<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:19.740> would<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> kind<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.250> put<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
while we're here would you kind of put a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.370 
while we're here would you kind of put a
couple<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.700> dots<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> eyes<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:24.259> put<00:01:25.259> on

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
couple of dots for the eyes and put on

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
couple of dots for the eyes and put on
the<00:01:25.530> eyelashes<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.790> are<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.119> straight

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the eyelashes which are just straight

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.480 
the eyelashes which are just straight
lines<00:01:27.920> coming<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.400> top<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.850> eyes

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
lines coming off of the top of the eyes

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.999 
lines coming off of the top of the eyes
for<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.210> hair<00:01:32.420> it's<00:01:33.049> not<00:01:33.290> really<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.860> doesn't

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
for the hair it's not really it doesn't

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.410 
for the hair it's not really it doesn't
matter<00:01:34.280> if<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.549> lines<00:01:34.759> are<00:01:34.970> not<00:01:35.030> exact

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
matter if the lines are not exact

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.030 
matter if the lines are not exact
because<00:01:35.600> it's<00:01:35.899> only<00:01:36.079> like<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.409> sort<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:36.950> a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
because it's only like a sort of a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.679 
because it's only like a sort of a
fluffy<00:01:37.310> looking<00:01:37.700> shape<00:01:37.939> anyway<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:38.390> if<00:01:38.600> you

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
fluffy looking shape anyway so if you

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.359 
fluffy looking shape anyway so if you
start<00:01:38.990> with<00:01:39.049> these<00:01:39.290> inside<00:01:39.710> at<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.040> top<00:01:40.220> of

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
start with these inside at the top of

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.710 
start with these inside at the top of
the<00:01:40.490> ear<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.509> come<00:01:41.720> around<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:42.950> do

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
the ear and you come around you just do

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.289 
the ear and you come around you just do
shapes<00:01:44.720> just<00:01:45.170> like<00:01:45.350> this<00:01:45.909> so<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.000> doesn't

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
shapes just like this so it doesn't

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.899 
shapes just like this so it doesn't
really<00:01:47.509> matter<00:01:47.899> if<00:01:48.110> they're<00:01:48.380> not<00:01:48.580> exact<00:01:49.580> and

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
really matter if they're not exact and

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.419 
really matter if they're not exact and
you<00:01:50.600> come<00:01:50.810> out<00:01:50.840> level<00:01:51.530> with<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.740> eye<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:52.130> which

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
you come out level with the eye of which

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.550 
you come out level with the eye of which
you<00:01:52.549> can<00:01:52.700> just<00:01:52.880> join<00:01:53.090> up<00:01:53.149> there<00:01:53.509> there<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.530> go

some<00:02:18.860> light<00:02:19.190> pencil<00:02:19.459> lines<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.330> join<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.140> back

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
some light pencil lines and join it back

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.570 
some light pencil lines and join it back
up<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.650> one<00:02:21.769> you've<00:02:21.890> already<00:02:22.040> done<00:02:22.250> so

the net you've done just sticking that

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.369 
the net you've done just sticking that
line<00:02:46.430> up<00:02:46.670> there<00:02:46.939> with<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.900> beads<00:02:48.109> so<00:02:48.349> that

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
line up there with the beads so that

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:49.929 
line up there with the beads so that
somewhere<00:02:48.769> in<00:02:48.890> there<00:02:49.069> all<00:02:49.219> you<00:02:49.400> need<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.609> do<00:02:49.790> is

somewhere in there all you need to do is

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.240 
somewhere in there all you need to do is
just<00:02:50.150> do<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.299> few<00:02:50.629> circles<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.890> are<00:02:52.010> touching

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
just do a few circles that are touching

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.940 
just do a few circles that are touching
on<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.730> way<00:02:52.849> around<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:56.599> do<00:02:57.260> because<00:02:57.769> these

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
on the way around and do because these

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.559 
on the way around and do because these
two<00:02:58.189> are<00:02:58.220> going<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.459> be<00:02:58.519> partly<00:02:59.120> fueled<00:02:59.329> by

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
two are going to be partly fueled by

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.610 
two are going to be partly fueled by
neck<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:00.409> just<00:03:00.829> do<00:03:01.099> two<00:03:02.170> little<00:03:03.170> bits<00:03:03.319> like

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
come from the top of the neck and you

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.240 
come from the top of the neck and you
just<00:03:12.109> do<00:03:12.349> like<00:03:13.069> a<00:03:13.430> line<00:03:13.670> coming<00:03:14.000> down<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:16.959> then

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
just do like a line coming down and then

just do like a line coming down and then
might<00:03:19.250> be<00:03:19.459> back<00:03:19.669> it<00:03:19.930> which<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.049> going<00:03:21.139> to<00:03:21.200> be

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
might be back it which is going to be

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.920 
might be back it which is going to be
the<00:03:21.470> arm<00:03:21.709> there<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.849> chest<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.689> come

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
the arm there and for the chest you come

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.670 
the arm there and for the chest you come
down<00:03:24.200> here<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:25.819> out<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:28.959> back<00:03:29.959> in<00:03:29.989> towards

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
down here and out and back in towards

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.890 
down here and out and back in towards
the<00:03:30.709> waist<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.879> going<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.090> form<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.419> arm<00:03:32.569> in

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
the waist it's going to form the arm in

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.619 
the waist it's going to form the arm in
the<00:03:33.139> front<00:03:33.379> of<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> body<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:34.819> dress<00:03:35.060> probably

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
the front of the body the dress probably

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.229 
the front of the body the dress probably
start<00:03:36.319> round<00:03:36.859> about<00:03:37.159> sort<00:03:37.400> of<00:03:37.459> here<00:03:37.819> so<00:03:38.180> you

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
start round about sort of here so you

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.080 
start round about sort of here so you
can<00:03:38.480> come<00:03:38.659> along<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.819> stopping<00:03:40.819> just<00:03:41.000> short

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
can come along and stopping just short

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.670 
can come along and stopping just short
because<00:03:41.599> this<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.870> where<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.169> arm<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.500> going

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
because this is where the arm is going

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.420 
because this is where the arm is going
to<00:03:42.769> go<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:44.389> arm<00:03:44.540> comes<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.680> back<00:03:46.069> of<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.280> arm

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
to go the arm comes the back of the arm

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.990 
to go the arm comes the back of the arm
