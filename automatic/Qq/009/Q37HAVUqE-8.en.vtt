00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.099
 We'll do a little test together: Look at these pictures and tell me what you see 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.679
 Well now these 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.919
 And this 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.320
 And this 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.140
 This is an ink smudge test, similar to the famous Rorschach test, designed by the Swiss psychologist 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.599
 Herman Rorschach in 1920, and used since 1939 to study your personality 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.149
 Given what you can associate with these random spots of ink. 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.360
 When I looked at them I saw ... mask masquerade parties, two people surrounded by evil man and eating fish 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.800
 Paper and face clown. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.390
 But we did not just test this on humans. 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.750
 Google recently introduced these images to four different artificial intelligence systems. 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.660
 They categorized the participants as Krobots 1, 2, 3 and 4. It was for all robots 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.940
 Completely different responses. 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.720
 In the first picture the robots saw hooks, a clip, an art and someone said it was 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.500
 Test the ink smudge for Rorschach. 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.250
 In the second case, Gage saw the mystery and design of the lily flower and the black spot of ink shown. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.940
 The third time, she saw robots: mask, pin, insulation and spot ink test for Rorschach. 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.450
 In the fourth picture, a hook appeared, a ribbon-shaped, printed face painted black. 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.520
 So ... if the machine has been able to absorb the personality test through the images and answered the questions independently 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.040
 Can computers have characters? 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.540
 Czech playwright Karel Kapik created the term 'robot' in Rossum's Universal in 1920. 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.010
 The word robots often makes people think of a metal-encased machine with lights on 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.610
 A mono sound or a modern version of it, but robots include machines that 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.200
 The disintegration of the bombs and the surgical operations are accurate as well as be responsible for the software companies realism, too 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.340
 What we call Artificial Intelligence (AI) 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.970
 Alan Turing proposed in his 1950 research paper, "Calculators and Intelligence," a test 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.569
 Called "simulation game," in which a human being plays the examiner by listening to a conversation 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.409
 Between another human being and a machine. If the examiner can not find out from the person or the machine 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.509
 The machine wins the simulation game. This is artificial intelligence. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.940
 This test is now widely known as the Turing test. 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.020
 The strength of the Turing test is very simple. It does not matter how we know 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.190
 Intelligence, the examiner sits there and decides who is human and who is a machine. 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.530
 This test is still considered a milestone in artificial intelligence. 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.880
 Although in contrast Rorschach test too old, a large part of the test 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.820
 Your explanation includes why you see what you see. 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.600
 The examiner uses the points system to tell you what this result means about your personality. 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.200
 Studies have shown that it is unreliable or valid. 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.599
 In fact, the Rorschach test is described as the best test as an important problem-solving that gives us 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.069
 Some indicators of your past, future or at least some of your thoughts. 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.390
 The fact that mechanical minds can possess unique ideas is sufficient to distinguish between special responses 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.300
 On such a mission is very wonderful. 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.340
 This keeps them somewhat separate, but is this a personality? 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.640
 Personality can be defined as: 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:37.600
 'Unique psychological features of the individual that affect a variety of distinct behavior patterns across different situations and over time' 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.770
 But how does that apply to robots? 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.540
 Isaac Asimov presented in his narrative group I Robot, "The Psychology of Rubatat" 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.269
 As a study of the characters of artificial intelligence machines. 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.330
 Began to appear as fantasy and fantasy but Heather Knight, and mechanics from Carnegie Mellon University, 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.599
 They started arguing that robots need to have their own personality so we can accomplish things with machines that neither of us can 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.599
 Done alone. 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.059
 Earlier this year, Google patented a method that could carry and personalize 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.519
 For the bar. 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.139
 But how does a robot look like? 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.100
 Our personality as human beings represents our personal traits, thoughts, feelings and behavior that distinguish us from each other. 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.880
 The five personality factors model suggests that your personality traits are ranked according to five overall factors. 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.540
 Research suggests that these traits have existed with you since childhood 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.620
 And come through both nature and upbringing, and can change during your life. 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.040
 The principle of flexibility suggests that personality is an open system that can be affected 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.910
 The research suggests that change is highly likely at a certain age or in the stages of life 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.510
 (Think about age 20-40 or when he becomes a father). 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.150
 We tend to think of the robot as we think of a human being 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:02.230
 That each of us is different based on the structure and experience, and finally these machines that rely on artificial intelligence have seen different things in the smudge test. 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.840
 But if one of the artificial intelligence devices, such as Siri's Apple, has millions of interactions every day 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.400
 What does that mean to her character? 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.840
 Siri, do you have a character? 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.660
 I can not answer that. 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.290
 Let me know what you think of the comments. And see you next week.
