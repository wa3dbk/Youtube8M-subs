00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello people welcome to this new 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
 video on our channel at boxer tv 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.089
 today the headphones are boxing and indeed 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 the bose sound rudi are pretty new 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.000
 are about a week or two ago 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.439
 come out 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.230
 we have the now in the apple store for 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.750
 180 euros and I have to say it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.340
 is a reasonable price so though 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.769
 This is not a review, I can only 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.150
 to say that the sound is pretty good 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 so it's really pretty good 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.270
 he is very clear in a lot of detail 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.640
 volume 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.020
 the heights are good the rents are good 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.550
 and the bass is just not too hasty 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.050
 how to get used to it now by the beats 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 is therefore very good headphones for the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.940
 Price but now it is unboxing and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.829
 so I will now times the short 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.629
 So look at the box 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.969
 we'll see for a start 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.370
 Nicely packed with this blue 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.859
 and black design in front we have the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.239
 big lettering in white on it when we are 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.480
 see this flap lan fold up 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.290
 including the foam of the same 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.000
 actually quite unnecessary and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.490
 no real function in here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.780
 then we have the instructions yes me 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.460
 Everyone knows how to use headphones 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.770
 works so stuck and then 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.020
 Let's go and underneath it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 the leather case and you have to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 really say that pretty well too 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.270
 I processed my one knows it so often 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.220
 of any products that one 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.220
 a case has a protective cover 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.689
 protective cover and then just like that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 badly processed that after 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.259
 a short time breaks this really 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.600
 very well processed here you can 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.520
 nothing against saying and the suitcases fit 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.960
 also perfectly pure adapts perfectly 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 the suitcases are actually slipping inside 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 not how to see the finish line 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.960
 can we have the headphones in the with 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.130
 The design bought it out and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.210
 black and in such a light red checkered 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.369
 There is also another 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.549
 design i think that's it outside 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.079
 striped blue or green is here 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.520
 you can see again maybe you can 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.210
 see the photos is very high quality 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.270
 processed and then we look 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.470
 times the headphones announced I find it 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.820
 does not look out of if you continue 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.340
 confesses I think it looks more like 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.560
 from her because they are pretty small 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.680
 are and there are also on ear 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.240
 headphones this day even smaller and yes 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.490
 here you can see is the leather is 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.380
 really pretty soft so 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.790
 not like other headphones but 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 that was really pretty nice 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.670
 to wear 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.340
 and very shortly the cable we have one 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.800
 control panel what we both for samsung 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.390
 devices and android devices as well 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.700
 So you can use iphone devices 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.040
 ios devices you can see louder here 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.820
 quieter and next club previous clip 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.660
 and stop 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.810
 Here we have a 3 5 mm jack plug 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.840
 and very nice by the way it is that one 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.700
 the cable can change that is if 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 we do not like this cable or if 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.300
 it just badly processed or 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.830
 it eventually breaks down then you can 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.560
 we simply exchange ourselves through one 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.000
 cable of our choice so and that was it 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.980
 actually already with this video 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.630
 throw it you liked and then 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.920
 now comes the moderation and 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.920
 then we'll meet at mixery class 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.020
 Yes I hope 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.940
 the video is welcome on the 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.430
 You can kart up here right now 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.170
 the video of what you did now 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.080
 have and the video before with one 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.670
 Colorful and I am sorry the lighting 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.050
 bit scratch bad I turn it 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.090
 right now while I'm still here 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.410
 the lecturers are cutting we are sorry 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.060
 that we have been back for three months 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.550
 have brought out again 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.750
 I know the last time I had a video 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.700
 We definitely said who is now 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.410
 bring videos and still be right 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.020
 But just try it with the tu 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.420
 and I will not do that now 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.950
 More promise that we have many videos 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.330
 I can but I can rausbringen 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.970
 do not say that we do not stop 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.730
 should be next week actually 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.670
 not yet come out a computer world 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.730
 So we all have somehow here 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.370
 things and we built ourselves computers 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.620
 and there will be video I hope 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.599
 you are looking forward to it 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.610
 and that we will still be in the next 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.640
 days film and that's actually synonymous 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.780
 already from me and then we'll meet 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.780
