00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
MOSFETs now taking a look at the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
MOSFETs now taking a look at the
motherboard<00:00:52.080> out<00:00:52.200> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> box<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.250> is

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
motherboard out of the box this thing is

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.210 
motherboard out of the box this thing is
micro<00:00:54.270> ATX<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.140> tiny<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.680> mean<00:00:55.950> if<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
micro ATX so it is tiny I mean if you

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.210 
micro ATX so it is tiny I mean if you
look<00:00:56.460> my<00:00:56.700> hand<00:00:57.030> spans<00:00:57.630> across<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.890> entire

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
look my hand spans across the entire

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.970 
look my hand spans across the entire
size<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.330> board<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
size of this board here and this is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.679 
size of this board here and this is
based<00:01:02.220> off<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.820> AMD<00:01:03.619> 855<00:01:05.210> future<00:01:06.210> controller

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
based off to AMD 855 future controller

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.310 
based off to AMD 855 future controller
so<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> 855<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.810> just<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
so what we get with the 855 is just a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
so what we get with the 855 is just a
little<00:01:10.710> under<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.550> you<00:01:11.790> would<00:01:11.940> get<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
little under what you would get with the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.219 
little under what you would get with the
a<00:01:12.659> 75<00:01:13.700> we<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:16.340> PCI<00:01:17.340> Express<00:01:17.820> slot<00:01:18.270> single
