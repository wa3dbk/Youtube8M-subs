ballroom dancing is good for kids

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.179 
ballroom dancing is good for kids
because<00:01:50.869> some<00:01:51.079> kid<00:01:51.319> can't<00:01:51.649> really<00:01:51.859> afford

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
because some kid can't really afford

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.609 
because some kid can't really afford
harem<00:01:52.609> dancing<00:01:53.060> solely<00:01:53.689> this<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.140> really<00:01:54.439> nice

good for not because they have the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.849 
good for not because they have the
experience<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.899> know<00:01:59.929> what<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:00.350> like<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:00.560> act
