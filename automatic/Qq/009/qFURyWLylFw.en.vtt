lifting an Olympic lifting shoes is

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.869 
lifting an Olympic lifting shoes is
easier<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.710> quads<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.220> get<00:00:41.370> recruitment

easier for the quads to get recruitment

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.020 
easier for the quads to get recruitment
since<00:00:42.150> the<00:00:42.690> heels<00:00:42.960> lifted<00:00:43.670> since<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> heels

since the heels lifted since the heels

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.290 
since the heels lifted since the heels
have

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
have

elevation off the ground that increases

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
elevation off the ground that increases
the<00:00:47.790> knee<00:00:47.970> angle<00:00:48.150> for<00:00:48.540> when<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:48.930> dead

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.840 
the knee angle for when you are dead
lifting<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.890> you're<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.220> to<00:00:50.250> utilize<00:00:50.580> more

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
lifting so you're going to utilize more

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.579 
lifting so you're going to utilize more
quadriceps<00:00:51.540> to<00:00:51.690> pull<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> weight<00:00:52.229> off<00:00:52.409> the

time or dealt in a flat sole two is for

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.219 
time or dealt in a flat sole two is for
two<00:01:07.049> main<00:01:07.200> reasons<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:08.040> easier<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:09.229> co-teach

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
two main reasons it's easier to co-teach

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
two main reasons it's easier to co-teach
the<00:01:10.500> queue<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.010> back<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.460> heels<00:01:11.729> and

the queue of get back on your heels and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
the queue of get back on your heels and
it<00:01:12.510> also<00:01:12.690> makes<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> lifter<00:01:13.950> just

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it also makes the lifter just

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.789 
it also makes the lifter just
psychologically<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.299> hey<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:16.020> pulling

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
psychologically like hey I'm not pulling

so whenever you are dead incorrect and
the<00:02:00.259> barbell<00:02:00.560> or<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.920> middle<00:02:01.159> of<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.280> foot

the barbell or the middle of the foot

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.569 
the barbell or the middle of the foot
you're<00:02:03.110> really<00:02:03.380> only<00:02:03.500> pulling<00:02:03.890> if<00:02:04.429> you're

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
you're really only pulling if you're

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:05.979 
you're really only pulling if you're
wearing<00:02:04.759> Olympic<00:02:05.119> shoes<00:02:05.299> you're<00:02:05.689> really<00:02:05.869> only

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:05.989 
wearing Olympic shoes you're really only

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:07.749 
wearing Olympic shoes you're really only
pulling<00:02:06.289> that<00:02:06.679> much<00:02:06.950> over<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.429> rail<00:02:07.610> your

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
pulling that much over the rail your

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.910 
pulling that much over the rail your
foot<00:02:07.939> extra<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:08.929> think<00:02:09.349> it's<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.590> reasonable

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
foot extra so I think it's a reasonable

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.569 
foot extra so I think it's a reasonable
compromise<00:02:10.750> between<00:02:12.129> only<00:02:13.129> pulling<00:02:13.459> that

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
compromise between only pulling that

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.619 
compromise between only pulling that
much<00:02:13.819> extra<00:02:14.180> or<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.790> benefit<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.239> using

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
much extra or the benefit of using

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.839 
much extra or the benefit of using
utilizing<00:02:18.410> your<00:02:18.530> muscle<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.040> quadriceps<00:02:19.700> and

utilizing your muscle in quadriceps and

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.850 
utilizing your muscle in quadriceps and
the<00:02:19.940> debt<00:02:20.480> one<00:02:20.660> last<00:02:20.840> benefit<00:02:21.260> I<00:02:21.379> want<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.709> say

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
the debt one last benefit I want to say

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.619 
the debt one last benefit I want to say
about<00:02:22.069> developing<00:02:22.849> an<00:02:23.000> Olympic<00:02:23.329> lifting

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
about developing an Olympic lifting

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.660 
about developing an Olympic lifting
shoes<00:02:23.720> because<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.560> makes<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:24.860> much<00:02:25.099> easier<00:02:25.160> to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670
