he's<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.579> decent<00:01:21.540> age<00:01:21.869> think<00:01:22.170> he's<00:01:22.290> 27<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:24.200> he's

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.340 
got a point to prove in the Premier
League<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.969> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.810> think<00:01:28.049> that's<00:01:28.200> exactly

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
League and I think think that's exactly

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
League and I think think that's exactly
what<00:01:28.680> Villa<00:01:28.920> need<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.399> we<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
what Villa need to do we all know the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.359 
what Villa need to do we all know the
the<00:01:30.869> budgetary<00:01:31.409> restraints<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.009> I've<00:01:32.189> got

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the budgetary restraints that I've got

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.590 
the budgetary restraints that I've got
and<00:01:32.610> while<00:01:32.820> they're<00:01:32.939> trying<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.180> overcome

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and while they're trying to overcome

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
and while they're trying to overcome
these<00:01:33.810> these<00:01:34.110> record<00:01:34.530> losses<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.969> think

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
these these record losses so I think

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.870 
these these record losses so I think
it's<00:01:36.360> important<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.829> players<00:01:38.130> who<00:01:38.670> don't

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's important to get players who don't

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
it's important to get players who don't
cost<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.390> earth<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.049> pliers<00:01:40.320> or

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
cost the earth but to get pliers or

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.959 
cost the earth but to get pliers or
hungry<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.039> try<00:01:41.219> and<00:01:41.310> achieve<00:01:41.369> things<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
hungry to try and achieve things of the

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.700 
hungry to try and achieve things of the
club<00:01:42.149> how<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.990> think<00:01:43.079> that's<00:01:43.320> kind<00:01:43.680> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
club how do you think that's kind of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
club how do you think that's kind of
might<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.039> passed<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.460> further<00:01:44.670> down<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> line

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
might be passed on further down the line

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.609 
might be passed on further down the line
to<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.570> players<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> squad<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:46.439> put<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
to other players of the squad that put a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.139 
to other players of the squad that put a
bit<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> pressure<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:47.520> them<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> start

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
bit of pressure on them to start

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
bit of pressure on them to start
performing<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.689> well<00:01:48.719> and<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.229> bit<00:01:49.649> more

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
performing as well and a bit more

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.340 
performing as well and a bit more
competition<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> squad<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.229> in

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
competition in the squad I think so in

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679 
competition in the squad I think so in
obviously<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.799> lad<00:01:52.979> con<00:01:53.219> can't<00:01:53.700> arise<00:01:54.420> until

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
obviously this lad con can't arise until

obviously<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:07.649> players<00:02:08.360> attacking

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
obviously these players attacking

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900 
obviously these players attacking
players<00:02:09.950> currently<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.100> club<00:02:11.340> through<00:02:11.610> whom

I<00:02:12.030> think<00:02:12.300> well<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.450> got<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> minute<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.230> don't<00:02:13.650> want

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I think well I got a minute I don't want

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.670 
I think well I got a minute I don't want
to<00:02:14.010> take<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.370> my<00:02:14.520> place<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.500> likes

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
to take you my place and but the likes

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.010 
to take you my place and but the likes
of<00:02:16.770> Steven<00:02:17.160> I'll<00:02:17.280> do<00:02:17.690> surprising<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.810> in

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
of Steven I'll do surprising that in

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.020 
of Steven I'll do surprising that in
that<00:02:19.140> second<00:02:19.590> striker<00:02:19.860> role<00:02:20.100> at<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> moment

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
that second striker role at the moment

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.020 
that second striker role at the moment
and<00:02:21.180> even<00:02:21.840> people<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.650> Charles<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.130> Zambia

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and even people like Charles in Zambia

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.870 
and even people like Charles in Zambia
and<00:02:24.900> Marc<00:02:25.140> Albrighton<00:02:25.350> whose<00:02:26.040> place<00:02:26.340> he<00:02:26.580> might

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and Marc Albrighton whose place he might

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.230 
and Marc Albrighton whose place he might
join<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.750> don't<00:02:28.200> think<00:02:28.290> he<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:29.010> only<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:30.150> a

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
join so I don't think he can only have a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
join so I don't think he can only have a
bad<00:02:30.450> effect<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:33.090> as<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.020> just

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
bad effect and then it's it's as I just

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.290 
bad effect and then it's it's as I just
think<00:02:34.470> he<00:02:34.530> adds<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.490> corner<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:36.180> bit

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
think he adds to corner of a little bit

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.510 
think he adds to corner of a little bit
of<00:02:36.450> not<00:02:37.080> not<00:02:37.260> necessarily<00:02:37.380> feel-good<00:02:38.070> factors

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
of not not necessarily feel-good factors

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.310 
of not not necessarily feel-good factors
I<00:02:38.640> think<00:02:38.850> we<00:02:38.910> still<00:02:39.180> need<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.570> little<00:02:40.050> bit<00:02:40.170> more

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
I think we still need a little bit more

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.750 
I think we still need a little bit more
all<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.650> happens<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.400> stood<00:02:41.580> after

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
all that happens but I stood after

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.150 
all that happens but I stood after
winning<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.240> game<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.930> Saturday<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.650> then<00:02:43.830> then

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
winning a game on Saturday and then then

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160 
winning a game on Saturday and then then
striking<00:02:45.090> very<00:02:45.270> early<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> transfer

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
striking very early in the transfer

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.860 
striking very early in the transfer
market<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.770> saying<00:02:47.580> getting<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.330> plans<00:02:48.570> up

finale<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.740> season<00:03:44.160> rather<00:03:44.400> than

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
finale to the season rather than

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.070 
finale to the season rather than
worrying<00:03:44.910> about<00:03:44.970> looking<00:03:45.720> over<00:03:45.840> their

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
worrying about looking over their

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.290 
worrying about looking over their
shoulders<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:47.340> Baltic<00:03:47.790> game<00:03:47.940> could<00:03:48.180> be

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
shoulders that Baltic game could be

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.670 
shoulders that Baltic game could be
fairly<00:03:48.480> crucial<00:03:48.750> for<00:03:49.020> that<00:03:49.110> as<00:03:49.200> well<00:03:49.350> three

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
fairly crucial for that as well three

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.530 
fairly crucial for that as well three
points<00:03:50.010> are<00:03:50.130> bowls<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:50.520> things<00:03:50.700> might<00:03:51.330> be<00:03:51.360> a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
points are bowls and things might be a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.720 
points are bowls and things might be a
little<00:03:51.690> bit<00:03:51.870> easier<00:03:52.230> for<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.280> squad<00:03:53.580> of

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
little bit easier for for the squad of

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.040 
little bit easier for for the squad of
the<00:03:53.760> manager<00:03:54.120> for<00:03:54.390> them<00:03:54.480> for<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.780> rest<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.989> the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
the manager for them for the rest of the

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.140 
the manager for them for the rest of the
season<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.380> think<00:03:55.650> yeah<00:03:56.580> I<00:03:56.610> think<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.120> mean

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
season you think yeah I think so I mean

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.300 
season you think yeah I think so I mean
what<00:03:57.570> they<00:03:57.720> know<00:03:57.900> thirty<00:03:58.200> three<00:03:58.500> points<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.220> I

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
what they know thirty three points and I

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.550 
what they know thirty three points and I
think<00:03:59.550> when<00:03:59.820> other<00:03:59.970> three<00:04:00.239> would<00:04:00.660> get<00:04:00.810> into<00:04:01.020> 36

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
think when other three would get into 36

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.949 
think when other three would get into 36
and<00:04:01.830> 40<00:04:02.580> points<00:04:02.940> tends<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.390> be<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.600> kind<00:04:03.810> of

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
and 40 points tends to be the kind of

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.960 
and 40 points tends to be the kind of
traditional<00:04:04.140> kind<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.010> cutoff<00:04:05.370> line<00:04:05.550> doesn't

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
traditional kind of cutoff line doesn't

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.440 
traditional kind of cutoff line doesn't
it<00:04:06.060> but<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.480> think<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:08.070> think<00:04:08.310> 36<00:04:08.970> points<00:04:09.270> might

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
it but I think I think 36 points might

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.670 
it but I think I think 36 points might
be<00:04:09.600> enough<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.930> see<00:04:10.110> them<00:04:10.290> safe<00:04:10.500> side<00:04:11.010> pieces<00:04:11.510> I

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
be enough to see them safe side pieces I

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.080 
be enough to see them safe side pieces I
think<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.739> fact<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.190> think<00:04:14.489> Villarreal

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
think the fact that I think Villarreal

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.479 
think the fact that I think Villarreal
and<00:04:15.270> narrative<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.200> top<00:04:16.410> seven<00:04:16.799> now<00:04:17.250> than

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
and narrative to the top seven now than

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.849 
and narrative to the top seven now than
they<00:04:17.609> are<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.270> relegation<00:04:18.480> zone<00:04:18.840> so<00:04:19.709> that

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
they are to the relegation zone so that

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.349 
they are to the relegation zone so that
that<00:04:20.010> gives<00:04:20.040> them<00:04:20.340> another<00:04:20.549> ring<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.000> look<00:04:21.180> up

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
that gives them another ring to look up

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.500 
that gives them another ring to look up
but<00:04:22.320> again<00:04:22.590> it's<00:04:23.100> one<00:04:23.190> victory<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.090> they'll<00:04:24.480> I

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
but again it's one victory and they'll I

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.880 
but again it's one victory and they'll I
haven't<00:04:24.840> had<00:04:24.960> enough<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.290> those<00:04:25.380> lately

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
haven't had enough of those lately

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.580 
haven't had enough of those lately
but<00:04:26.880> hopefully<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.390> pressure<00:04:27.990> easing<00:04:28.410> win

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
but hopefully the pressure easing win

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.470 
but hopefully the pressure easing win
over<00:04:28.860> Fulham<00:04:29.040> will<00:04:29.490> will<00:04:29.669> up<00:04:29.790> kind<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.270> will

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
over Fulham will will up kind of will

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.570 
over Fulham will will up kind of will
have<00:04:30.600> restored<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.080> confidence<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.740> meaning

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
have restored the confidence and meaning

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.279 
have restored the confidence and meaning
that<00:04:32.640> they<00:04:32.789> can<00:04:32.970> making<00:04:33.150> them<00:04:33.479> be<00:04:34.020> just

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
that they can making them be just

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.750 
that they can making them be just
