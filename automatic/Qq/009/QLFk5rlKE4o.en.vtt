hi this is kind of the fix for BMW f650
F<00:00:08.370> thunder<00:00:09.000> oh<00:00:10.190> where<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.219> brake<00:00:11.460> light

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
F thunder oh where the brake light

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.870 
F thunder oh where the brake light
wiring<00:00:12.330> gets<00:00:13.080> old<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.590> brake<00:00:14.490> doesn't<00:00:14.730> work

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
wiring gets old and brake doesn't work

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.290 
wiring gets old and brake doesn't work
too<00:00:15.179> well<00:00:15.650> I've<00:00:16.650> got<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.039> working<00:00:17.699> pretty<00:00:18.029> good

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
too well I've got it working pretty good

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.630 
too well I've got it working pretty good
now<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.560> think<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.890> lot<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.220> people<00:00:20.490> know

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
now and I think a lot of people know

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.200 
now and I think a lot of people know
that<00:00:20.990> basically<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.199> light<00:00:22.820> kind<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
that basically the light kind of the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.560 
that basically the light kind of the
wire<00:00:24.449> gets<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.529> use<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.310> rubber<00:00:26.970> grommets

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
wire gets all use the rubber grommets

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.500 
wire gets all use the rubber grommets
over<00:00:28.529> time<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.010> shakes<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.970> just

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
over time you know shakes and just

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
over time you know shakes and just
where's<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.019> wiring<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> contacts<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
where's the wiring and the contacts and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.920 
where's the wiring and the contacts and
the<00:00:32.899> bulb<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:35.130> actually<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.870> kind<00:00:36.870> of

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the bulb you can actually see I kind of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.340 
the bulb you can actually see I kind of
looks<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.140> previous<00:00:37.890> owner<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.989> had<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.200> use

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
looks like previous owner I had to use

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.340 
looks like previous owner I had to use
duct<00:00:40.770> tape<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.190> something<00:00:41.840> kind<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
duct tape or something kind of see that

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.190 
duct tape or something kind of see that
to<00:00:43.770> hold<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:47.719> what<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.780> did<00:00:49.020> instead

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to hold this up and what I did instead

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.330 
to hold this up and what I did instead
was<00:00:50.360> basically<00:00:51.360> put<00:00:51.600> some<00:00:51.809> foam<00:00:53.570> inside<00:00:54.570> there

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
was basically put some foam inside there

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.720 
was basically put some foam inside there
and<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.489> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> gives<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.899> angle

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
and it just kind of gives it that angle

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.380 
and it just kind of gives it that angle
that<00:01:00.079> makes<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.649> brake<00:01:01.859> works<00:01:02.390> which

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
that makes it so the brake works which

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.620 
that makes it so the brake works which
is<00:01:03.600> generally<00:01:04.080> pretty<00:01:04.739> important<00:01:05.479> for<00:01:06.479> any

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
is generally pretty important for any

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.929 
is generally pretty important for any
moving<00:01:06.930> vehicle<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:07.830> especially<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
moving vehicle but especially a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
moving vehicle but especially a
motorcycle<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.450> unlike<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:13.470> previous

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
motorcycle so unlike this previous

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.420 
motorcycle so unlike this previous
owners<00:01:14.460> fix<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.210> taping<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
owners fix of taping it all up to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.910 
owners fix of taping it all up to
support<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.930> actually<00:01:19.320> lets<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> take<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
support this actually lets you take the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.999 
support this actually lets you take the
lens<00:01:20.100> off<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.909> cover<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.570> actually

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
lens off the cover so you can actually

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.249 
lens off the cover so you can actually
on<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> cover<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.259> supporting

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
on the cover so this way of supporting

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.830 
on the cover so this way of supporting
it<00:01:28.380> from<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> bottom<00:01:29.570> instead<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.689> just

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it from the bottom instead of just

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.230 
it from the bottom instead of just
taping<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> previous<00:01:32.759> owner<00:01:32.970> had

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
taping it all like a previous owner had

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
taping it all like a previous owner had
done<00:01:33.420> lets<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> actually<00:01:34.439> take<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> cover

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
done lets you actually take the cover

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.460 
done lets you actually take the cover
off<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.659> service<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.259> ball

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
off so you can you know service the ball

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.340 
off so you can you know service the ball
I<00:01:37.799> find<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.090> know<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.210> contacts<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.110> in

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
I find you know the contacts really in

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.950 
I find you know the contacts really in
there<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.509> problem

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
there is what you know is the problem

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.550 
there is what you know is the problem
and<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:47.119> sort<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.350> get<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and you know if you can sort of get that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.590 
and you know if you can sort of get that
at<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.040> spot<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:52.470> will<00:01:53.180> allow<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> brake

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
at a spot then that will allow the brake

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.660 
at a spot then that will allow the brake
to<00:01:54.810> work<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> probably<00:01:55.890> over<00:01:56.189> time<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.610> know

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to work and probably over time you know

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.639 
to work and probably over time you know
support<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.950> doesn't<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.189> again

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
support that so it doesn't do that again

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.859 
support that so it doesn't do that again
the<00:02:01.649> foam<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.009> use<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:03.299> even<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.600> where<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the foam I use I don't even know where I

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.580 
the foam I use I don't even know where I
got<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.790> I'd<00:02:05.790> kept<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.659> think<00:02:07.469> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
got this but I'd kept it I I think it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.260 
got this but I'd kept it I I think it
came<00:02:07.770> packaged<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.550> something<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.090> bought

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
came packaged with something I bought

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.650 
came packaged with something I bought
and<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.020> kept<00:02:10.340> foam<00:02:11.340> around<00:02:11.610> thinking<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and as I kept foam around thinking it

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.030 
and as I kept foam around thinking it
might<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.319> handy<00:02:13.620> sometime

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
might be in handy sometime

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.979 
might be in handy sometime
and<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:15.209> cut<00:02:15.420> some<00:02:15.599> strips<00:02:15.900> off<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.909> it's

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
and just cut some strips off and it's

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.710 
and just cut some strips off and it's
worked<00:02:18.989> well<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:20.420> one<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.629> other

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
worked well for that one of the other

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.410 
worked well for that one of the other
keys<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:23.269> when<00:02:24.269> you're<00:02:24.390> taking<00:02:24.780> off<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
keys here is when you're taking off the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.000 
keys here is when you're taking off the
underneath<00:02:27.420> here

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
underneath here

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.080 
underneath here
those<00:02:29.010> three<00:02:29.340> bolts<00:02:30.230> um<00:02:31.640> instead<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.819> using<00:02:32.940> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
those three bolts um instead of using a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.710 
those three bolts um instead of using a
socket<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.660> found<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.019> socket<00:02:34.370> kind<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.720> didn't

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
socket I found a socket kind of didn't

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.280 
socket I found a socket kind of didn't
work<00:02:36.840> too<00:02:37.049> well<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:38.330> just<00:02:39.330> use<00:02:39.510> like<00:02:40.230> a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
work too well and just use like a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.890 
work too well and just use like a
ratchet<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.629> you<00:02:42.629> know<00:02:42.690> has<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.049> built<00:02:43.260> in

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
ratchet that you know has the built in

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.369 
ratchet that you know has the built in
tightening<00:02:45.900> capability<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:48.810> really

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
tightening capability and I really

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.440 
tightening capability and I really
didn't<00:02:49.590> over<00:02:49.829> tighten<00:02:50.190> him<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.239> see

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
didn't over tighten him but you can see

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.869 
didn't over tighten him but you can see
these<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:52.379> know<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.650> rubber<00:02:53.010> grommet<00:02:53.609> here

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
these you know this rubber grommet here

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.640 
these you know this rubber grommet here
you<00:02:54.870> know<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.079> really<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.739> what<00:02:55.950> wears<00:02:56.250> down

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
you know that really is what wears down

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.240 
you know that really is what wears down
kind<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.769> see<00:02:59.329> but<00:03:00.329> you<00:03:01.140> know<00:03:01.230> that's<00:03:01.379> that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
kind of see but you know that's that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.900 
kind of see but you know that's that
rubber<00:03:02.579> this<00:03:03.359> one's<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.930> much<00:03:04.379> better<00:03:04.620> shape

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
rubber this one's in much better shape

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.839 
rubber this one's in much better shape
but<00:03:06.410> yeah<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.650> think<00:03:07.769> it's<00:03:07.980> fairly<00:03:08.220> common<00:03:08.609> on

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
but yeah I think it's fairly common on

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.240 
but yeah I think it's fairly common on
these<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.260> didn't<00:03:10.470> over<00:03:10.680> tighten<00:03:11.010> them<00:03:11.069> they

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
these so I didn't over tighten them they

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.979 
these so I didn't over tighten them they
seem<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.730> be<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.879> lot<00:03:12.060> tighter<00:03:12.329> originally

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
seem to be a lot tighter originally

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.569 
seem to be a lot tighter originally
before<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.410> did<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:16.230> guess<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.160> need<00:03:17.430> to

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
before I did this I guess just need to

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.710 
before I did this I guess just need to
check<00:03:18.389> them<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:19.799> know<00:03:19.919> occasionally<00:03:20.599> on<00:03:21.599> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
check them you know occasionally on the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.800 
check them you know occasionally on the
end<00:03:21.840> that's<00:03:22.019> kind<00:03:22.859> of<00:03:22.889> an<00:03:23.010> easy<00:03:23.130> quick<00:03:23.489> fix<00:03:23.810> I'm

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
end that's kind of an easy quick fix I'm

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.879 
end that's kind of an easy quick fix I'm
always<00:03:25.470> very<00:03:25.889> careful<00:03:26.609> when<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.030> putting<00:03:27.269> the

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
always very careful when I'm putting the

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.879 
always very careful when I'm putting the
cover<00:03:28.889> back<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.370> because<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:31.410> know<00:03:31.440> plastic

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
cover back on because you know plastic

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.210 
cover back on because you know plastic
seems<00:03:32.519> like<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:32.880> can<00:03:33.630> be<00:03:33.750> brittle<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:35.130> I

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
seems like it's can be brittle and I

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.159 
seems like it's can be brittle and I
definitely<00:03:35.579> don't<00:03:35.700> want<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.970> crack<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.930> so

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
definitely don't want to crack that so

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.089 
definitely don't want to crack that so
just<00:03:37.410> like<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:38.430> whole<00:03:38.810> taillight<00:03:39.810> mount<00:03:40.109> I'd

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
just like the whole taillight mount I'd

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.690 
just like the whole taillight mount I'd
really<00:03:41.489> don't<00:03:41.669> over<00:03:42.150> tighten<00:03:42.329> these<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:44.489> just

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
really don't over tighten these and just

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.330 
really don't over tighten these and just
kind<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.000> snug<00:03:45.329> them<00:03:45.480> up<00:03:45.599> fairly<00:03:46.049> good<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.470> you

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
kind of snug them up fairly good and you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.360 
kind of snug them up fairly good and you
know<00:03:47.430> it's<00:03:47.790> worth<00:03:48.000> checking<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.980> know<00:03:50.069> every

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
know it's worth checking you know every

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.849 
know it's worth checking you know every
few<00:03:50.549> days<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.209> if<00:03:52.049> I'm<00:03:52.230> riding<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.709> lot

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
few days if you if I'm riding it a lot

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.819 
few days if you if I'm riding it a lot
you<00:03:53.340> know<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:54.389> worth<00:03:54.569> taking<00:03:55.109> ten<00:03:55.440> seconds

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
you know it's worth taking ten seconds

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.569 
you know it's worth taking ten seconds
to<00:03:55.919> make<00:03:56.099> sure<00:03:56.310> everything's<00:03:56.790> working<00:03:57.060> good
