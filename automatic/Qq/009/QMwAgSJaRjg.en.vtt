 hello to all and all his boots 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.080
 pesos so today a video that goes 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.759
 show you how to solve the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.140
 maurice problem of peace turf that is 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.779
 to say that in fact you do not have enough of 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.970
 memory for your minecraft 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.970
 now with the new launcher it's 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.769
 over you can see that my 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.900
 computer for example he has 8 giga of 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.290
 RAM look well at mine at the 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:43.019
 yours simply 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.019
 then i will launch minecraft 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.830
 I'm going in edith profile downstairs to 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.920
 left here you have a little box 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.900
 here jvm arguments you see this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.100
 little box you click on it 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.260
 she was not clicking in mom 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.680
 original you have a small figure 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.970
 just before the g me for example 8 giga 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.270
 so I'm going to put for example 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.410
 bassett giga if you have 4 may t3 by 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.810
 example was a little bit less 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.550
 but that's largely enough 3g guys me I 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.140
 put this and then you have to 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.130
 put cf profile simply and we 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.759
 will realize that I'm turning now 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.960
 at 6.7 or 7 gigabytes of RAM for 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.580
 minecraft it that there will be more 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.780
 never doubted of memories you can 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.270
 install extremely shader 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.369

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.100
 unless you have a pc not enough 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.479
 powerful but you will not have this 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.750
