00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.980
 Hello dear friends of the LFV 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.600
 This instructional video is intended to assemble a conventional PC and its 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.919
 Show components 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.169
 Apple brings I find the builder of this concept 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.289
 could succeed so time and hope that he really 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.289
 is working 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.949
 MR 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.189
 the CPU fans have just arrived 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.740
 the so-called socket must first include Manuela Hohmann because only so you can 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.739
 convene the CDU 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.100
 r 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.360
 The CDU then does not need to use the position 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.470
 because after the CDU was used, of course, you take the lever 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.430
 ours again 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.480
 now the CPU fan is put on it and on the sides left and right none 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.360
 hook 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.499
 not to forget the power supply 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.169
 because without the connection to the motherboard, the fan would not get power 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.860
 dpa how difficult it is the room Burstein just arrived 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.460
 the block is inserted in one of the three raven slots and on 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.990
 the sides of Rome and below with grab handle stabilizing the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.960
 Of course, motherboard still has to speak in the computer case 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.380
 The entrepreneur may provide for special men that 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.660
 be cared for in their homes 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.860
 The important thing is that it's better to use two more goals to make sure 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.950
 that ManU really holds 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.890
 the computer is now set up the rest of the component you can also so 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 plug in or afterwards 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.280
 next come with SuS from the scene 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 which in one of the five of these can be inserted as Lottes 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.540
 because we are allowed to build a networkable computer here 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600
 Of course, there is no lack of a multi-purpose hall 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.430
 on this strength the EM 105 hp makes in the computer and we are not 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.120
 endures the graphics card for laughter 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.050
 She belongs in a so-called result that is provided for that purpose 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.020
 Now all should fail to be bolted to the housing so they 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.169
 securely fastened 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.169
 Mr. Perfect the hard drive has just arrived 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.319
 it is attached to the right of the motherboard to a special protection 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.319
 and bolted to the designated places 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.759
 Now we'll take care of the drive 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:40.979
 The drive is simply inserted into the front of the computer case 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.999
 inside of the housing more precisely on the insured measured against the 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.789
 provided for this place postponed last but not least 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.449
 the latter, so to speak, the power source of the computer which normally 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.449
 always installed at the top left of the housing 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:01.119
 Now all components are still wired together and then the 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.119
 Power source connected 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.120
 before the housing can be closed, however, still need the plug 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.290
 for the onslaught for the ver selb shoulder and for the elite 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.499
 be connected 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.709
 now we could close in the past 35 o'clock 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.509
 The final product is impressive. Now our computer is finished 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.899
 Dr many thanks to love destructive or we hope that through 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:37.459
 This will give me a few more tips and helps in configuring computers 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.039
 could go
