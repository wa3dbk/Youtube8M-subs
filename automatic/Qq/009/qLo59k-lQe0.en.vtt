00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.130
 girl what kind of flaws in it 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.980
 you know you are planning either a second child and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.029
 if so then when do these target give 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.439
 you are a family sport or provide them 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.070
 the right to choose either start deficiencies like 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.190
 in any normal person, they are smarter 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.300
 it is said about them I donâ€™t give anything 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.969
 does it still flaws begin 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.149

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.460
 surely 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.660
 but first grow 1 and give everything for 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.920
 perhaps 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.180
 so you need to do also career 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.670
 so that in an independent woman well 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.620
 should be a profession by age 27 i 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:12.150
 I thought that I could give birth to the second 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:16.110
 family sport but surely a child 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.979
 need to give hit in traffic because 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.540
 what he needs is the development of physical as well 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.479
 how we have a lot to do 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.660

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:31.470
 why not if you like in 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.830
 continue to engage in this species 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.229
 sports yes you please i have the right to choose 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.399

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.870
 on gymnastics live good for a girl 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:49.970
 for plastics for reach nasty 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.010
 I think to drink your question how to cope with 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.260
 loneliness and betrayal when u 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.890
 you lamers kind and bright lost 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.250
 hope but despair first not 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.960
 need and about loneliness in order 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.580
 not to feel alone in 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.510
 first you need to learn how comfortable 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.680
 feels with himself when 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.719
 man accepts himself as he is 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.730
 when a person can and is not afraid to stay 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:21.930
 there was meaning to the place 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:25.080
 only in this case the process begins 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.480
 it is understood that you do not need anyone in 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.310
 principle in order to make you 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.830
 happy you are such a person 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.360
 and only after that can we meet 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.280
 someone 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.900
 whom we can understand because we 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.360
 have taken you and accordingly we 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.850
 We are able to understand what the other person was 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.330
 full there is no matter whether it is a friend or 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.450

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.850

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:20.850
 golden youth scientists who are huge 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.060
 development of our city is like everything 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.010
 aimed at education with us 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.390
 beautiful girls and not girls to me always 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.000
 wanted something 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.770
 in this case, we see the species become 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.480
 very good journalist to do 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.470
 Moscow State University 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.250
 on journalism 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:43.230
 years after that engage in as if 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:47.120
 his profession and in novosibirsk this 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.120
 impossible I come very rarely 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.660
 I plan to fly in the near future because 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.700
 you need to check old grandma 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:05.150
 friends and relatives 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:08.280
 still relatives therefore want 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.900
 fly see how for a few 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.000
 years their life has changed and not the last 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.950
 question today I want to know in detail about 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.130
 your meditations and why are we so early 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:26.310
 get up only lacks proper 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:28.740
 but exactly a serious question doll topic on 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.410
 which i can his baffle follow 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:36.120
 mandrogi that i need to disclose 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.360
 all understand that not a single minute counts 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.550
 getting up early is a belief that 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.450
 karma has less effect on a person when 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.970
 Narada worth knowing and so was born as 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.690
 would really work if cold 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.889
 families 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.620
 then I have 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.189
 I can do this even though I am very hard to get up 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.139
 early in the morning I wake up by force and 5 6 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.120
 am 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.449
 come out and do business and meditate for 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.939
 to soothe together 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:17.449
 harmonize yourself hold into unity 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:19.259
 soul theme rad body and mind at the expense of sleep 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.680
 always enough for me 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:26.629
 I will tell the hell and any notice 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.979
 often enough because when 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.189
 put on cats in this mode 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.629
 get up early and sometimes go to bed late 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:36.830
 because you know how much 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.830
 bend your shooting 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.550
 then naturally you do not get enough sleep and then 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.550
 going pay do hope that i
