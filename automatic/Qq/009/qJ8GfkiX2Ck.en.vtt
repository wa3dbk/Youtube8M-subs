00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.689
 if you are followers of my channel 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.580
 they will know for a long time that 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.650
 personal I really enjoy the 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.020
 episodes of adventure time where 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.120
 ruins of civilization appear 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.550
 of cities product of the great war 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.830
 of the mushrooms that's why I've decided 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.660
 make this video where I will give my 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.760
 first impressions of the smith peak of 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.949
 george and margaret released in the past 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.920
 comic with in san diego california 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.289
 I also make a personal prediction 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.930
 of the chapter we started george and 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.690
 margaret first impressions of the sneak 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.120
 input peeks we can notice something very 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.160
 interesting and 8 there's margaret apparently 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.530
 they give us to understand that they were dedicated to 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.079
 be detective investigators or something 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.360
 looked like when joshua is going to check his 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.550
 Apparatus notifications apparently 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.620
 they are receiving news from a girl 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.260
 vampire that is doing something in the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.840
 sexpe lands are very likely to 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.270
 try marcelino then talk about 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.309
 of a little fire goblin that is 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.890
 causing destruction in the sweet kingdom 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.659
 many of you will be thinking that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.970
 that little fire goblin is the 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.270
 princess flame but they are going through 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.179
 high 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.250
 something very important the princess flame is 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:15.350
 less than end check and jermaine are at 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.270
 look the same age as the end so 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.210
 so much I doubt that that little elf 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.219
 of fire be the princess flame maybe 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.679
 try flank and in the last of the 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.840
 notifications or news is that a 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.179
 woman who prepares country has found a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.610
 field that I had not seen before though 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.740
 coming from trunks we remember that 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.530
 she usually exaggerates a lot any 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.360
 thing remember the case of silvia who 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.819
 confused with the middle finger of a 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.679
 statue and this is where you can see the 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.679
 most impressive scene of this previous 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.810
 when joshua and margaret are coming out 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.729
 of a devastated city are appreciated 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.479
 remains of buildings vehicles 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.520
 abandoned 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.039
 even a van that apparently 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.170
 belonged to a news channel 7 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.750
 it is also to be noticed a couple of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.119
 many humanoids even came to 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.789
 dare to claim that they were human I 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.739
 I sincerely doubt it very much already 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.390
 finalize this smith pic george and 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.819
 margaret arrive at the house of 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.440
 trunks to show up without revealing 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.110
 More details of what this will be 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.270
 episode so good based on this short 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.310
 advance of just over a minute I want 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.190
 make my own prediction of the chapter 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.830
 next to premiere see the location 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.800
 chronological of this episode no place to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.770
 doubts will be at least between 16 and 17 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.960
 years ago I think that at the beginning of 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.820
 this episode end and jake for some 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.190
 strange reason they look at their old house 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.010
 where they lived with their parents Joshua and 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.260
 margaret there you will find old photos or 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.270
 even some diary or even recordings 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.130
 of their parents and with it they will make a 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.020
 flashback telling us the story of 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.030
 jarque and his brother jermaine since 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.220
 they were in the belly of their mother 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.650
 from the chapter hej that the father 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.930
 we could realize that jake when 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.209
 it was just a little boy lived in what 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.280
 it seemed to be a city here is where 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.470
 this confirms another of my 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.780
 predictions is that maybe we'll see 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.459
 marcelina doing pranks but only 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.160
 it will appear as a cameo and not as 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.410
 protagonist here the intriguing thing is itself 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.750
 that field he referred to as trunks 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.030
 yes it is true we all know what 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.190
 trunks is very exaggerated at the moment 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.860
 of the drama and probably that field 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.590
 strange is just something transient and famous 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.360
 but let's think for a moment what 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.850
 little trunks actually saw something 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.180
 really strange in that field here the 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.460
 huge doubt is that he saw what happened 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.590
 what is the urgency do not give us more 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.810
 clues to find out the answers to 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.790
 these questions and therefore any 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.890
 prediction to be made from this 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.470
 moment can be quite elaborate and 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.020
 meaningless yet I will 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.180
 dare to offer you a theories about what 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.040
 who will find Joshua and Margaret nearby 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.350
 from the house of tronquitos but you 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.390
 I notice what in itself is already quite 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.520
 obvious this theory that you will listen to 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.920
 continuation lacks all sustenance and 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.320
 credibility will be based on scarce or 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.709
 no foundations therefore there is a 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.590
 99 99 percent of that is wrong my 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.320
 prediction theory clarified these points 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.310
 we start with the prediction 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.560
 probably near the house of 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.540
 trunks somehow there is a 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.970
 settlement of the last humans in 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.930
 gold and trunks I had never seen him 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.880
 go to investigate 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.710
 joshua and margaret hide for 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.540
 avoid being discovered by these 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.950
 humans but must leave 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.140
 immediate due to 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.240
 Gareth is about to give birth to Jake 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.970
 and german so your research 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.040
 is truncated joshua leads margaret to 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.020
 a hospital in the sweet kingdom and after a 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.640
 couple of days they decide to go back to that 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.740
 human settlement to follow 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.660
 investigating leaving your little ones 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.030
 puppies in sweet daycare 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.520
 kingdom but upon returning they realize 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.130
 that something very strange happened to reach 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.260
 notice signs of a looting violence and 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.810
 that therefore those humans had 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.880
 that flee however in the distance reach 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.940
 to perceive the crying of a baby and go in 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.740
 your search very alarmed like that is that 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.050
 baby is about end and this is where 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.850
 we make the end memory connection 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.100
 doing boom boom fitting to the 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.410
 perfection and to be successful my 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.910
 prediction joshua and margaret will return to 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.130
 your house not only with a couple of 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.350
 puppies but also with a baby 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.300
 human to whom by the way the sweet 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.770
 princess has already implanted a chip 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.230
 in his ear to have it always 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.480
 guarded remember that the sweet 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.610
 Princess knows the past therefore 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.130
 Finding a human being is very 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.800
 interesting because of its scientific side 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.900
 What did you think of my prediction? 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.849
 it is very unlikely that this chapter 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.270
 happen in this way that I just 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:43.940
 describe but let's go and dream not you 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:47.210
 what do you think about it you agree 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.370
 with me you have another prediction I invite you 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.830
 to share this video armes a 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.780
 debate with your friends and even you 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.539
 I invite you to create your own prediction of 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.789
 this episode do not forget to give him a thumb 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.800
