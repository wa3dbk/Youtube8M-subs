00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.980
 if we have the meizu x4 in front with the 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.130
 that has been heard for a long time and 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.439
 well finally how would we talk 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.530
 I went to the shelter as you can see as 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.820
 that we live would be passed with the one of mx3 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.970
 the environment is quite smooth 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.710
 although the truth is a bit is quite 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.710
 different than what we are used to 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.960
 to do with the with android so 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.940
 It costs a little return 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.190
 to manage the rules 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.609
 and we see that it has 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.070
 has enough functions by means of 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.660
 the edges of the screen 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.660
 we have the settings of 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.119
 the brightness of the minimum green phone to 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.930
 maximum we can not leave it to the maximum 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:15.610
 adjustment 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.610
 the battery and the phone as you can see 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.810
 is equal to the normal m x4 and we are worth paying 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.810
 plus 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.350
 miranda 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.259
 why 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.630
 the video we have functions a 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.799
 different camera application that as 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.330
 we can imagine making a system 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.330
 operational completely different 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.680
 the middle button for example in this 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.550
 case does not do the same functions as in 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.780
 we do not know if because it's a prototype 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.520
 because they are directly using only 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.520
 the edges of lateral 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.900
 one of the things that draw attention 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.900
 is that it is quite soft very very soft 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.120
 so it will be just that edge here we see 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.280
 also all the applications that 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.770
 we have open we can manage to 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.500
 through them it has to be said that the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.500
 ubuntu environment is very nice 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.700
 they have the options 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.170
 fairly good 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.840
 I like the fact that it is a system 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.709
 totally different and always gives a little 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.959
 of interest since we check things 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.870
 new with systems and also adds 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.370
 competitions to battle in terms of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.769
 the operating systems 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.540
 as you see aesthetics is exactly the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.310
 same 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.939
 is the phone with your camera 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.459
 megapixels the element processor the 65 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:04.090
 95 with the little bit as technology 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.500
 for the cores let's look to see if 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.030
 we come to the options where I am 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.720
 this initiative for example let's look 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.780
 if this is for example 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.660
 Spanish is only found in 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.360
 here as you see with your ex and spanish 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.550
 from Spain 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.740
 from america 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.110
 need to be allowed let's restart it 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.500
 to see the language setting to see if 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.140
 he does it correctly although it seems that 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.070
 the system is 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.570
 updated as otherwise as 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.840
 we say as to the hardware is 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.970
 exactly the same 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.970
 the same metal back 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.100
 we have the metallic edge the screens 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.320
 it's all exactly the same phone 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.970
 just that with a new operating system 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.370
 we are going to try to talk to personnel from 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.530
 medicine is here at the stand of a 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.290
 world to know if there will be possibility 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.000
 for example if you bought a mx 4 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.100
 so there will be possibility to include for 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.100
 test this operating system 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.310
 As you can see, it is totally 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.810
 translated right now there's no 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.340
 pending explanations we only have the 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.639
 best 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.180
 and here we would have something like legos 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:29.620
 to the environment and ticket that ubuntu has 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.620
 defect in desktop installation 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.620
 the promoter is very well translated in 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.000
 your access 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.440
 to set up different accounts and 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.720
 we have yes yes 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.640
 and good in principle as we say the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.470
 phone looks very good 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.500
 pretty powerful hardware and system 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.080
 operative than the new one but at the same time it's 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.060
 quite interesting 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.740
 let's leave it here and let's continue 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.759
 with our visit inside the mobile 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.759
 world congress see you later
