00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.099
 Directly humanity is not called Yaroslav and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.500
 today move the songs of the stone sour band 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.179
 called eye life I have very 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.210
 bad pronunciation of English words and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.760
 so the song title could clearly 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.949
 several Russian words are heard but it 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.750
 not so wrong so the train went out 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.660
 chamomile 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.660
 [music] 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.130
 Bill 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.919
 [music] 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.460
 [music] 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.690
 So how did she plays a song with him the game 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.190
 no more just 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.930
 but before we play the song we must 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.060
 re- tune your guitar one step down 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
 how to do this i will attach the link below in 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.380
 description on the video lesson where I teach 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.330
 will provide somewhere 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.130
 somehow teaches constructs and so 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.020
 reconfigure guitar well done not when 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.080
 setting up our lazy ass guitar and 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.580
 so how do we play what design 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.350
 we play started the fifth string we 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.080
 click on the third fret and fourth 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.090
 string we press on the fifth fret 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.720
 squeezed squeezed played 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.970
 the fifth string is the fourth string and the second 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.220
 open string even you like it 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.960
 looks like 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.780
 further slide down now we have 5 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.470
 the string is clamped on the fifth fret 4 clamped on 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.450
 seventh year 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.080
 and the second string is also not clamped 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.210
 the screen is exactly the same 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.590
 i.e. 5 string army headquarters then second 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.100
 open 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.640
 [music] 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.400
 gave them move even lower the most from 5 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.720
 string on the seventh fret 4 p. rod 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.320
 ninth year 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.260
 the games are nothing else sixth string 5 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:16.670
 string fourth string in third third 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:21.500
 string 4 and 5 and 6 opening 5 7 4 ninth 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:25.210
 third open 4 5 9 and 5 on removable for 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.210
 me this upbringing when indians johns 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.160
 and once again, that is what we are already 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:39.830
 can play grasshopper of course 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.830
 [music] 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:51.120
 neighbor drills love and now we hide 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.120
 come fight we play also 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.420
 and now go we play with you still 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.770
 already familiar to you designs that 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:08.500
 played right from the start it's 5 by 3 4 by 5 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:11.010
 likewise also now 5 by 5 4 by 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.760
 seventh 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.360
 and at the very end itself the end is simpler than 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.980
 go to 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:26.640
 we play open sixth string this 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:30.010
 very difficult to do try as we 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:45.430
 with you we play the introduction entirely to you 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:48.650
 [music] 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.849
 firstly as in the song the pain with it 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.799
 to play a chord we need to know the fight 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:58.640
 write down down down down up 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.200
 down down down and here's how carefully 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.950
 visibility 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:15.390
 [music] 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:16.820
 with such a piece and quickly disease is what is 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.290
 verdi 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:25.730
 down down what is what is my head 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.920
 such a fight in the whole song and so now to 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.170
 the same chords we play buy it all 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.830
 just play all the same thing already 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.520
 play 5 string on 3 fret 4 string on 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.740
 the fifth fret five that we play 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.690
 play all strings except 6 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.080
 she's just alone and nobody 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:49.330
 loves further we play fifth string on 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.330
 fifth fret and dead water 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.330
 Next you need to read the bass 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.270
 the fifth is strange in the seventh year and the fourth 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.160
 string on 9 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.150
 [music] 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:10.510
 5 here somehow knock out 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:14.230
 [music] 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.470
 and here after we again 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.200
 happy 16 in the ninth year played one 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.580
 times a strip 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.000
 when we play i second time down down 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.790
 rest of the fight 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.320
 the rest would be down below and here 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.420
 the rest will be what's left for you 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.410
 recorded pain but so have to do on 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:38.380
 record we finish i'll get on 5 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.210
 water and fourth string of the 7th fret 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.210
 that is, here's what it looks like completely 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.030
 adidas completely 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.070
 [music] 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:06:01.689
 that is, this is how we play the verse 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:04.469
 [music] 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.469
 she is 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.040
 [music] 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.770
 Well 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.259
 [applause] 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.880
 [music] 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.039
 now to tea with you playing on will endure 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.139
 could machines be easy and simple as a principle 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:34.630
 everything else either i just was 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.410
 constantly so the first thing we play and 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:41.410
 e m is the chord 7 will be exactly the same 5 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.240
 the string is clamped on the third fret 4 p 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.260
 us sacrifice second fret and 2 and first 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.310
 string price from 3 module 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.610
 [music] 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.080
 detectives who play this chord 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.090
 the third string is clamped on the second fret 2 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.090
 See the mode 1 trunk of the Sarmatians network 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.580
 chord chord e m 5 string and 4 string 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.010

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.010
 [music] 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.370
 and here is the same trick as we played 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:14.779

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.529
 play one you completely author you also 

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:17.779
 two blows down 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:20.199
 the rest will continue to be played 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:23.330
 on chord 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.979
 that is, this is how it looks like hello I dumped 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.129
 everything is very simple on the door slam very 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:30.169

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:37.659
 it is generally a lone wolf ny outcast there 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.659
 n 7 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.950
