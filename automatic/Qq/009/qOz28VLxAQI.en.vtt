00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.250

 if you want this class of 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.590
 a series a 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.950

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.670
 sight 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:05.840
 certainly I have it in my hand and then with the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.840
 knife out will not really do it 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.870

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.670
 we are all ears to call admire 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.400
 the knife 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.489
 ie I have to take lamela's in 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.319

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:18.390
 I know where you want to get piglet I know 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.739
 I had to get into the knife 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.390
 in the street 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.000
 okay but say it was a tutorial not 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.170
 he can hardly accept it anyway then 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.950
 then tension you were not moments you could 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:40.340
 makes a beheading 2 at the apple not 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:45.000
 leasys was enough to beat at first the slams 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.360
 and then the flap knife comes in 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.040
 say that this tutorial and a little goes 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.180
 well i am using double meanings because smog 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.180
 the video on youtube is at stake 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:06.690
 then what it is 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.489
 yes because one for eat less who he is 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.180
 that before turning apple you don't do the 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:19.019
 complete lap so he replies to but insists 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:22.109
 they can give you a stomach ache 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.289
 apple but I'm sure I'm not going down 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.720
 the cause works well 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:32.669
 the knife you came to a point 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:36.889
 video on the other side i was wrong 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:42.410
 part case remedy immediately and now 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:48.110

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.110

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.200
 six 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:11.990
 sexy but maybe the teacher after 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.330
 finished eating it you have to remove 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:21.120
 what remains of the apple, that is, everything 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:26.160
 I give you away well it seems to me that the whole 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.850
 towards a model it is thrown over the 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.850

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:56.770
 purchased useful and that is very useful 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.770
 really hope for another all of oil 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:08.180

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:12.020

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.759
 20 to change less people than to do 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.729
