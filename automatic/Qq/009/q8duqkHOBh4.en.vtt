00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the same as the technique that you would

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.740

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
race to a biking race and in my personal

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.089 
race to a biking race and in my personal
opinion<00:00:29.310> seems<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.439> winning<00:00:31.439> races<00:00:31.650> getting

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
opinion seems like winning races getting

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.910 
opinion seems like winning races getting
first<00:00:32.430> place<00:00:32.570> helps<00:00:33.570> boost<00:00:33.780> em<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.380> much
