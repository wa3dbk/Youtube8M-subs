 to make the dough both to the mix with 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.800
 your hands are very clean when the dough 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.840
 be ready by the top of a rug 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.500
 to bake give it the shape of a 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.330
 rectangle over with a waxed paper 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.180
 I use a roller to flatten the more 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.610
 flip the dough with waxed paper 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.280
 this way and put on top of a tray 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.560
 for rectangular oven use a knife 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.260
 to cut the edges and shape 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.119
 of a rectangle 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.020
 since it's ready, it bakes from 5 to 7 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.539
 minutes 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.000

 decorate the place on a plate 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.560
 a link or flip it so you can use 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.259
 the side that is ready to decorate not 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.869
 blueberries raspberries are needed 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.420
 white chocolate sparks bitumen 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.610
 vanilla use a spatula to cover the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.799
 part of the top of the biscuit with bitumen 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.110
 of vanilla and that the whole cookie is 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.270
 cover uses the spatula to make a 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 mini rectangle in the top of 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.129
 the left adds blackberries throughout 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.709
 mini rectangle adds 42 berries 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.750
 following my sequence in a horse that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.970
 it's between the berries it adds a spark 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.069
 of chocolate I use raspberries for 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.400

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:25.099

 You can believe how easy it is to do 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.900
 I decided to do the flag of the USA 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.700
 in honor of the month of its independence but 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.010

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.480
 to try the me 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.560
 it's time to make these dates filled 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.450
 of cream cheese 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.330
 we're going to need a cheese package 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.060
 cream 3 tablespoons of sugar glas a 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.550
 peje of cup of cream to beat to a 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.980
 spoonful of orange juice and half 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.410
 teaspoon of vanilla extract in 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.500
 a blender add the cream cheese 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.020
 sugar icing the cream to beat the juice 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.630
 of orange and vanilla beats it very 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.850
 well add a pinch of salt to give it 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.890
 flavor beats until it stays 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.290
 consistency with what a duya of 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.570
 star open like this inside a 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.460
 Pastry bag and fill it with 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.070
 cream cheese mix you're also going to 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.860
 need strawberries already washed blueberries 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.140
 and a cream cheese mix that we just 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.570
 of making with a sharp knife makes a 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.460
 cut on top of the strawberry a 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.800
 his other cut also by the part of 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.750
 up forming an X, be careful of 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.460
 do not cut the strawberry to the stem 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.680
 let's use the cream cheese mix 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.390
 to fill the strawberries starts with 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.730
 inside the dam until you get 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.650
 until the last step is to put a 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.409
 dwells on top of each strawberry 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.329
 serve them in a nice dish and ready them 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.450
 I recommend refrigerating them until now 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:58.000
 these strawberries are going to serve them 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.090
