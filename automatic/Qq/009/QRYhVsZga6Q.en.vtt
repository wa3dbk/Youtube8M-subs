00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.640 
opening second-half kickoff that took
six<00:01:52.950> minutes

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.380 
six minutes
and<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:53.830> think<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.310> talked<00:01:54.550> about<00:01:54.730> the<00:01:55.000> second

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
and I think we talked about the second

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.950 
and I think we talked about the second
half<00:01:56.490> kickoff<00:01:57.490> critical<00:01:58.000> for<00:01:58.180> Carter<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.630> think

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
half kickoff critical for Carter I think

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.510 
half kickoff critical for Carter I think
this<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.290> critical<00:01:59.710> for<00:01:59.740> long<00:02:00.010> be<00:02:00.190> I<00:02:00.280> think

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
this is critical for long be I think

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.140 
what's another throw that you just is
just<00:04:08.019> almost<00:04:08.409> no<00:04:08.739> way<00:04:08.949> to<00:04:09.009> to<00:04:09.430> make<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.849> throw

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
just almost no way to to make the throw

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.629 
just almost no way to to make the throw
is<00:04:10.449> that<00:04:10.689> the<00:04:10.870> coverage<00:04:11.349> early<00:04:11.769> on<00:04:11.799> was<00:04:12.310> good

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
is that the coverage early on was good

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.849 
is that the coverage early on was good
and<00:04:13.299> he<00:04:13.359> was<00:04:13.540> on<00:04:13.659> a<00:04:13.689> dead<00:04:13.959> sprint<00:04:14.259> to<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.620> left

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
and the curl route fortune was probably

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.569 
and the curl route fortune was probably
over<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.169> just<00:04:17.500> no<00:04:17.620> way<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.829> get<00:04:18.099> it<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.250> him<00:04:18.370> it

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579
