 but if we talk about nokia c5 03 the model 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.390
 relatively modestly without excessive 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.669

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.270
 in bright sun seems a little faded 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.890
 Of course, readability depends on 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.080
 specific lighting conditions 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.540

 Reception stations works well for a smartphone 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.110
 installed a 5 megapixel camera alas 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.910

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.790
 as supported flash data 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.830
 the fact eliminates the obstacles associated with 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.959
 watching videos from youtube and in the browser 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.400

 better use wi-fi 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.750
 connection or about pyramid consumption 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.889
 traffic in these cases becomes clearly 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.750
 not so greedy 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.990

 drove the computer port as a result of the decision 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.840
 It turned out quite ambiguous 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.970
 reworked symbian 94 clearly managed 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.010

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.630
 simplified work on the Internet 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.610
 let the camera without autofocus and flash but 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.410
 good lighting or sunlight 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.210
 doing their job along with 5 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.590

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.780
 divx codecs 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.360

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.880
 imagine nothing complicated and today
