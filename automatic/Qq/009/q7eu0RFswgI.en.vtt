that I guess kind of make your way

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.170 
that I guess kind of make your way
through<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.530> part<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> gameplay<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:48.119> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
through that part of the gameplay but a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
through that part of the gameplay but a
pretty<00:01:48.630> nice<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:49.049> comeback<00:01:49.320> video<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.890> if

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
pretty nice little comeback video and if

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you see right there what I'm doing is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.240 
you see right there what I'm doing is
I'm<00:01:51.840> trying<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.380> aim<00:01:52.470> right<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> tip<00:01:53.189> of

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
I'm trying to aim right at the tip of

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.980 
I'm trying to aim right at the tip of
the<00:01:53.490> head<00:01:53.700> that's<00:01:54.119> something<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.630> saw

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the head that's something that I saw

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
the head that's something that I saw
online<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.500> you're<00:01:55.710> supposed<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
online that you're supposed to do and it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.580 
online that you're supposed to do and it
works<00:01:56.969> incredibly<00:01:57.659> well<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.960> didn't<00:01:58.350> realize

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
works incredibly well I didn't realize

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.679 
works incredibly well I didn't realize
it<00:01:58.740> before<00:01:58.799> because<00:01:59.189> like<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.939> black<00:02:00.210> ops<00:02:00.450> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it before because like in black ops you

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.090 
it before because like in black ops you
want<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> aim<00:02:00.990> towards<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> upper<00:02:01.799> chest

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
want to aim towards like the upper chest

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.550 
want to aim towards like the upper chest
because<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.610> guns<00:02:02.820> recoil<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.689> stuff<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
because if the guns recoil and stuff you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.350 
because if the guns recoil and stuff you
know<00:02:04.680> you're<00:02:05.100> doing<00:02:05.369> fine<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.909> gonna<00:02:06.000> have

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
know you're doing fine if you gonna have

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.690 
know you're doing fine if you gonna have
to<00:02:06.509> upper<00:02:06.689> chest<00:02:06.990> you'll<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.530> fine<00:02:07.700> but

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
to upper chest you'll do just fine but

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430 
to upper chest you'll do just fine but
with<00:02:08.910> Halo<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.360> shields<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.170> everything

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
with Halo and shields and everything

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.170 
with Halo and shields and everything
else<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.340> want<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.550> aim<00:02:11.700> towards<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
else you really want to aim towards the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.950 
else you really want to aim towards the
top<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.720> head

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
top of the head

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720 
top of the head
like<00:02:13.170> almost<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.920> tip<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.370> head<00:02:14.550> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
like almost like the tip of the head and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.890 
like almost like the tip of the head and
to<00:02:14.850> me<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.090> doesn't<00:02:15.240> make<00:02:15.390> sense<00:02:15.450> because

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to me that doesn't make sense because

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.150 
to me that doesn't make sense because
most<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.260> your<00:02:16.380> bullets<00:02:16.680> should<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.980> like

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
most of your bullets should be like

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.490 
most of your bullets should be like
missing<00:02:17.730> their<00:02:18.120> body<00:02:18.330> we're<00:02:18.870> only<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.170> one

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
missing their body we're only like one

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.710 
missing their body we're only like one
hitting<00:02:19.830> them<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.700> for<00:02:20.850> whatever<00:02:21.030> reason<00:02:21.270> it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
hitting them but for whatever reason it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.480 
hitting them but for whatever reason it
works<00:02:21.930> out<00:02:22.080> incredibly<00:02:22.560> well<00:02:22.800> drops<00:02:23.190> shield

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
works out incredibly well drops shield

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.900 
works out incredibly well drops shield
way<00:02:23.940> way<00:02:24.180> faster<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.830> huge<00:02:26.250> tip<00:02:26.670> for

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
way way faster so that is a huge tip for

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.520 
way way faster so that is a huge tip for
you<00:02:27.000> guys<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.480> you're<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:27.870> already<00:02:28.020> doing<00:02:28.290> it

explanation<00:04:37.680> number<00:04:38.280> one<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.460> pick<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.820> laser

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
explanation number one I pick the laser

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.760 
explanation number one I pick the laser
gun<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.870> reason<00:04:40.140> why<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.290> picked<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.590> laser

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
gun the reason why I picked the laser

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.070 
gun the reason why I picked the laser
gun<00:04:41.010> is<00:04:41.130> because<00:04:41.400> this<00:04:41.580> stupid<00:04:42.120> hooking

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
gun is because this stupid hooking

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.920 
gun is because this stupid hooking
overpowered<00:04:43.979> meth<00:04:44.370> tank<00:04:44.729> thing<00:04:45.000> destroys

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
overpowered meth tank thing destroys

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.159 
overpowered meth tank thing destroys
everything<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:47.130> everybody<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.120> think<00:04:48.360> here

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
everything in everybody and I think here

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.110 
everything in everybody and I think here
I<00:04:49.500> guess<00:04:50.040> we're<00:04:50.220> already<00:04:50.370> doing<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.729> comeback

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
I guess we're already doing the comeback

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.360 
I guess we're already doing the comeback
but<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.510> that<00:04:51.840> big<00:04:52.140> tank<00:04:52.410> thing<00:04:52.620> can<00:04:52.890> turn<00:04:53.160> a

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
but that that big tank thing can turn a

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.850 
but that that big tank thing can turn a
game<00:04:53.610> around<00:04:53.880> real<00:04:54.390> fast<00:04:54.419> and<00:04:55.169> so<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.470> really

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
game around real fast and so I really

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.740 
game around real fast and so I really
wanted<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.220> drop<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:57.000> help<00:04:57.150> my<00:04:57.330> team<00:04:57.600> out

know if you look over on the left side

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.580 
know if you look over on the left side
of<00:05:05.820> your<00:05:06.000> screen<00:05:06.150> about<00:05:06.840> middle<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.470> the

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
filled up in a circle the more you kill

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.580 
filled up in a circle the more you kill
the<00:05:11.850> more<00:05:12.060> points<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.510> get<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.260> more<00:05:13.440> that

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
the more points you get the more that

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.650 
the more points you get the more that
drug<00:05:13.950> that<00:05:14.160> bar<00:05:14.490> fills<00:05:14.790> up<00:05:14.940> it's<00:05:15.150> almost<00:05:15.330> like

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
drug that bar fills up it's almost like

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.140 
drug that bar fills up it's almost like
a<00:05:15.690> killstreak<00:05:16.110> or<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.410> point<00:05:16.710> streak<00:05:16.950> um<00:05:17.160> so<00:05:18.000> the

the game that thing fills up and when it
gets<00:05:23.310> all<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.669> way<00:05:23.760> fool<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.150> get<00:05:24.270> an

ordnance<00:05:24.900> drop<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.470> ordnance<00:05:26.430> drops<00:05:26.700> are

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
ordnance drop and ordnance drops are

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.210 
ordnance drop and ordnance drops are
pretty<00:05:27.150> basic<00:05:27.390> you<00:05:28.020> you<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.890> choice

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
pretty basic you you have a choice

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.550 
pretty basic you you have a choice
between<00:05:29.400> three<00:05:29.850> things<00:05:30.150> I'm<00:05:30.479> usually<00:05:31.169> two

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
between three things I'm usually two

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.370 
between three things I'm usually two
weapons<00:05:31.979> in<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.640> a<00:05:33.120> perk<00:05:33.600> or<00:05:33.810> I<00:05:33.900> don't<00:05:34.260> know

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
weapons in a and a perk or I don't know

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.930 
weapons in a and a perk or I don't know
which<00:05:34.500> we<00:05:34.620> call<00:05:34.919> it<00:05:34.979> a<00:05:35.040> perk<00:05:35.310> but<00:05:35.550> some<00:05:35.729> kind<00:05:35.880> of

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
which we call it a perk but some kind of

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.420 
which we call it a perk but some kind of
power<00:05:36.180> up<00:05:36.450> upgrade<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.590> you<00:05:37.680> have<00:05:37.830> two<00:05:38.070> weapons

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
power up upgrade so you have two weapons

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.420 
power up upgrade so you have two weapons
in<00:05:38.550> an<00:05:38.640> upgrade<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.240> essentially<00:05:40.280> you<00:05:41.280> can

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
in an upgrade and essentially you can

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.010 
in an upgrade and essentially you can
pick<00:05:41.640> between<00:05:41.820> each<00:05:42.150> one<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:42.660> it's<00:05:42.840> going<00:05:42.960> to

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
pick between each one and it's going to

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.260 
pick between each one and it's going to
drop<00:05:43.440> wherever<00:05:44.040> you're<00:05:44.250> pointing<00:05:44.790> so<00:05:45.060> if

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
drop wherever you're pointing so if

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.370 
drop wherever you're pointing so if
you're<00:05:45.390> pointing<00:05:45.690> at<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:45.900> ground<00:05:46.140> is

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
you're pointing at the ground is

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.840 
you're pointing at the ground is
probably<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.830> good<00:05:47.010> place<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.370> be<00:05:47.490> pointing

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
probably a good place to be pointing

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.060 
probably a good place to be pointing
either<00:05:48.150> in<00:05:48.270> front<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.660> you<00:05:48.810> or<00:05:49.020> around<00:05:49.380> you<00:05:49.620> you

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
either in front of you or around you you

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.260 
either in front of you or around you you
don't<00:05:50.250> want<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.430> be<00:05:50.490> pointing<00:05:50.820> off<00:05:50.940> into<00:05:51.180> the

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
don't want to be pointing off into the
