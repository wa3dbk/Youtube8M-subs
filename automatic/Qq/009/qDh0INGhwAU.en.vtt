00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:06.520
 hi people the project happens after the year the year returns with a more in 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.529
 Following 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.319
 of your party's production for beds 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.940
 in this second stage 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.839
 I worked at the head of the single bed 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.080
 I started and dismantled all the pieces at last several attempts 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.510
 cesmac they know they have income broke sbt my life it happens 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.359
 when we do not use the right tools 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.739
 but I work a lot with the slogan who does not have dog hunting with cat 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.340
 There is no way there, everything can happen. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.540
 then they say another screwdriver a little bigger but in the end I had to use 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.470
 a tico-tico saw 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.940
 because I did not like it at all 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.400
 had a lot of strength in the markets 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.780
 there closed read 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.250
 Fernando 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.230
 I finished dismantling the whole piece. 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.750
 after that I studied the best way to do the papers and the tax 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 and I decided that I would redo the bed structure but with the reduced measures 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.270
 practice typologies logo 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.950
 so I do not know 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.950
 ferteco type again to arrive at the necessary measures 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.410
 after the sawing work completed I dismounted a little more but psg 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.720
 and I used the sander to remove 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.900
 all the movie 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.940
 and leave the pieces of a neighbor 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.240
 uniforms 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.450
 and I took the opportunity to return 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.510
 all the corners of the pieces 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.610
 for each day gets thinner 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.510
 interdicted 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.560
 the next step will be to assemble these parts 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.940
 drill to escape 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.140
 however this Friday 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.660
 most accessed 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.660
 this cold front moves away 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.110
 rl 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.670
