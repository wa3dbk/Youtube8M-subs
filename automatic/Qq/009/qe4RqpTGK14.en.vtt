00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.140
 is a welcome narrative plus one 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.660
 video of her this time I 'm sorry for my 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.150
 voice slightly lower because the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.150
 Remember equipment but I saw one 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.139
 very interesting news is that 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 awakened a subject I wanted 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.340
 chat with you at irrational games 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.689
 she closed the verb but there who ratinaud 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.980
 old games was who made the bayern crash 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:34.590
 123 and infiniti 7 81 neighborhood shock game 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 mega beast that everyone said that is the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.879
 game of the year when released forget what 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.020
 Launch gta, okay? 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.200
 good the company of the closed but it was lack of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.289
 money, not because although the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.210
 game was very expensive kind low cost 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.370
 millions and I do not know the exact number I will not 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.309
 speak with animation that is not true for 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.399
 You, but I'm very much the duct man. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.539
 old and then the owner of the studio said 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.520
 years 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.960
 you can not keep a study of this 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 magnitude 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.549
 Okay, because it's not sustainable. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.930
 including a problem that the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.299
 games are having today, right? 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.610
 games are getting more expensive and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.860
 they become a professional or a company 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.860
 is to make a profit they have to sell 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.130
 astronomical quantities of copies. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.659
 is usually the veil and is not realistic right 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.880
 so it does not have to happen 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.290
 here you do not make a bubble at a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.659
 games industry I think for the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.600
 games to sell to face they have to be 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.820
 very well done without meaning 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.880
 has to be a mega cultural production 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.220
 narrated with gigantic lapa with everything 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.770
 everything everything everything everything and investing millions 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.049
 in marketing when in fact they 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.009
 can make the games cheaper 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.759
 sure and sell a little less but if 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.399
 plus a cravel of the money margin and this 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.340
 it was the decision that the owner of irrational 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.829
 games took so he got fired all over 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.450
 world is now consuming a studio 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.460
 without the slightest but I did not want to speak 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.110
 the news despite the fact that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.670
 sad business so many people lost the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.840
 employment we will not have lower 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.390
 probably 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 among other things I wanted to use this 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.930
 to talk about difficult decisions that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.840
 we have to take in our life and 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.510
 man this is something lately 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.390
 I've been thinking, I confess here for you. 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.750
 because I had I have to take 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.330
 difficult decisions to 1 having to think 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.000
 in the decisions that I will take these sanctions 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.950
 difficult is she to speak what is and what is not 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.209
 now at least I 'm not ready yet 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.310
 but I wanted to argue with you 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.049
 when I was younger I make decisions 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.250
 difficult not 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.079
 I, for example, in the second high school I 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.329
 I left school, I said I did not want to 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.420
 more study and went stayed a year without 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:00.239
 studying and taking supplements later was a 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.220
 difficult decision was at that time I did not 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.930
 had crap no loss understood 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 when you have nothing to lose one day 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.400
 nothing to lose decisions that are 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.000
 other difficult people for me are 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.310
 because I was not 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.780
 had nothing that everything has nothing is easy 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.310
 you decide something because you do not have 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.720
 nothing to learn right 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.340
 I was also taking a course in 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.739
 theater was almost finished with the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.930
 theater because I do not know if you know I 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.989
 was interested in advertising in 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.700
 yes no sense of being know face to face 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.389
 make several advertisements I had 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.790
 I wanted to do it and then I was 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.959
 almost giving up and not giving up too 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.569
 theater course 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.150
 two months to go was a 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.889
 difficult decision was when not again 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.109
 had nothing to lose, huh? 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.419
 Nowadays I have much to lose. 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.620
 Thanks to you, what is very good about you? 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.540
 too much to lose because I have 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.150
 a lot then I have a channel 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.840
 big I have a house I have to 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.120
 financial stability and such things is 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.160
 one thing that leaves you me mine 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.310
 coward and you know when you have things 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.230
 and it kind of kinda makes all the decisions 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.239
 that I take may affect this and that 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.040
 that this that that and that there 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.810
 when you have no power to arrest the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.669
 The only thing that matters is that I'm only there. 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.890
 affects our other people 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.120
 the decision you make now affects 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.889
 literally thousands of people 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.650
 the sca gon at that point was afraid of 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.410
 make decisions but the guy as he saw himself 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.310
 fallen from the studio the guy has to take 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.300
 a decision to dismiss 200 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.360
 people locked up in the millionaire company 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.430
 to try to do other things is not 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.710
 this is it is something that has a lot 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.760
 The ball for you to do is something that 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.110
 want a thousand 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.990
 Not even the worst that I'm trying to do. 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.270
 figure out how I would do it 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.669
 So I think the guys think I 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.380
 I'm wanting to close the channel, no, I'm not. 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.539
 wanting to close the channel has to do with the 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.930
 but has nothing to do with closing the 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.669
 channel has to do with other things about 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.810
 difficult actions that I have to take is 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.699
 I wanted to ask you, how are you? 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.070
 you do not when you have a 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.830
 difficult decision to make and you have 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:19.729
 something to lose because you risk 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.889
 everything if it stays the same is more 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.830
 second, this is a people thing 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.710
 think right because it is something that in the 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.150
 life we ​​will arrive in situations that 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.220
 We 're going to have to spend that time. 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.289
 cliff there you will look 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:37.970
 that prince looks back at putz 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:40.310
 I can skip them and if I drop this 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.169
 An entire cart fell here full of 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.310
 Anything, I can carry the cart together. 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.880
 with me on the cliff 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.070
 I do not know there's fire fire but I do not think so 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.800
 I was at the end of things right 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.889
 You have to do what makes you happy. 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.160
 understood to do what you felt gates 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:01.690
 in the hotel gat your instinct is not a 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:05.770
 suit do what you think is right 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:09.860
 But it's before you do this. 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.780
 think very well but think it well to talk 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.940
 that's really what I want 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.680
 If I do, who can happen? 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.210
 these things that can happen to me 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.620
 I want this what I want is that I 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.340
 I want and what I do not want here can 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.020
 to happen 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.630
 what are the implications for the other 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.770
 people, I do it, it 's always good, you? 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:30.020
 Think hard but in the end follow your 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.900
 heart I followed my heart when 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.790
 I got out of the theater and I got home. 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.770
 to follow my heart when I create 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.330
 on youtube follow my heart when 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.390
 insisting on the channel on YouTube during 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.970
 a year without being crappy even because 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.970
 It was what I liked to do. 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:51.500
 plus August follow my old heart 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:54.080
 and it worked out okay, it's okay that I'm a 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.630
 person can not be for the majority of 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.720
 understood and it could be that he had a lot of 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.640
 luck what probably the most 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.040
 now you trusted me in my heart 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.110
 extinct I know that in the end in the future 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.140
 I have engaged in doing some 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.670
 thing this thing can work goes 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.250
 to go right and what is wrong, I hope 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.620
 but guys these are my thoughts 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.960
 I wanted to know about you decisions. 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.810
 difficult times you had to take and 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.610
 if you repent you will not run which 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.040
 were the things that happened when 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.830
 if you make those decisions and that's the 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.870
 people see the next thanks for sitting 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.190

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.150
 That's it, thanks a lot, but more. 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.150
 talking to make a hug
