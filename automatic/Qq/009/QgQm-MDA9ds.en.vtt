the world and the best big bands in the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.809 
the world and the best big bands in the
world<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:38.799> being<00:02:39.799> able<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.069> learn<00:02:40.280> from<00:02:40.640> his

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
experience it has just been a tremendous

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.300 
experience it has just been a tremendous
opportunity<00:02:43.549> in<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.269> big<00:02:44.569> band<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.380> think<00:02:45.500> it's

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
opportunity in a big band I think it's

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.009 
opportunity in a big band I think it's
so<00:02:46.489> important<00:02:46.880> for<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.090> drummer<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.900> be

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
so important for the drummer to just be

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.410 
so important for the drummer to just be
like<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.200> gigantic<00:02:48.799> sofa<00:02:49.519> for<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.120> whole<00:02:50.239> band

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
like a gigantic sofa for the whole band

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.880 
like a gigantic sofa for the whole band
to<00:02:50.599> sit<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:53.329> specifically<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.350> think<00:02:54.470> about

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
to sit on and specifically I think about

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.289 
to sit on and specifically I think about
that<00:02:55.069> in<00:02:55.310> terms<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.640> having<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.880> really<00:02:56.030> wide

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
that in terms of having a really wide

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.740 
that in terms of having a really wide
beat<00:02:56.720> phrasing<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.829> way<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.630> whole

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
beat phrasing in a way that the whole

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.289 
beat phrasing in a way that the whole
band<00:02:59.989> can<00:03:00.170> kind<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.410> lay<00:03:00.880> inside<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.030> drums

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
band can kind of lay inside the drums

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.210 
band can kind of lay inside the drums
that's<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.410> most<00:03:03.530> challenging<00:03:04.040> thing<00:03:04.190> about

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
that's the most challenging thing about

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.879 
that's the most challenging thing about
it<00:03:04.549> for<00:03:04.760> me<00:03:04.850> my<00:03:05.150> senior<00:03:05.540> right<00:03:05.750> now<00:03:05.870> going<00:03:06.709> into
