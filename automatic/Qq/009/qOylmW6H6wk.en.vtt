 good afternoon dear friends from the new 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.519
 release and yak knock off and news digest you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.099
 learn about the new operating system 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.509
 google android m on hobby apple 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.699
 augmented reality 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.310
 control of smart watches through 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.960
 gestures about using watches as 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.789
 cloud storage 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.170
 and also about the learning robot himself 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.810
 google has introduced a new version 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.210
 OS android which will be available 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.890
 sometime this fall she figures 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.290
 as android m 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.329
 The new version of android will bring a lot 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.700
 various improvements and optimization 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.160
 google implemented native in android m 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.079
 support for fingerprint scanners 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 principle manufacturers already have enough 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.070
 long time do it yourself but 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.110
 now it will be easier for them 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 android m will allow users 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.829
 manage issued third-party 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.539
 application rights if now when 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.730
 installation program, users can 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.379
 only agree to the terms 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.329
 developers in the new version of os can 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.860
 For example, it will prohibit certain 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.200
 the offer will be accessed by the book 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.659
 contacts or camera unit new 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.330
 OS version received support for port yusb 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.340
 tipe s it will allow example to manage 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.689
 google charge direction in the next 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 times promises to optimize 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.740
 power systems smartphones 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 based on your sensors and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.490
 the sensors will determine what the device is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.150
 for quite a while no one 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.950
 enjoys 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.990
 and translates some services into 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.780
 economy modes in the new system 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.150
 there will be a very useful feature of the shelter 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 custom tabs its essence lies in 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.079
 that when getting internal links in 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.880
 any application it will be 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.530
 not run in the browser but in the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.869
 application through the built in 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.000
 its crown module supporting many 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.960
 full browser features including 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.149
 auto complete 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.250
 For example, if the client network twitter 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.899
 the external link will come to the user 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.579
 clicking on it will not lead to 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.950
 client minimization and launch 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.140
 full crown browser instead 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.610
 the client himself will open an autonomous page 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.009
 all standard 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.829
 browser capabilities make it easy and 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.020
 will speed up work with applications along with 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.450
 android m search giant launches 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.520
 new payment system android pay it 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.280
 works in a similar way 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.599
 competitor using the nfc model and 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.140
 allowing you to bind to your account 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.520
 android drink a plastic card 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.290
 encryption is naturally used 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.420
 transmitted data does not contain 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.459
 bank card information from 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.410
 other innovations can be noted service 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.150
 google photos which is now free 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.940
 provides unlimited volume for 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.489
 store photos and video function let 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.530
 Rickshaw is a simple way to share 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.440
 by any content through 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.230
 or other application owners 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.140
 smartphone nexus 5 nexus 6 tablet 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.150
 nexus 9 and media player nexus player already 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.410
 now have the ability to download and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.500
 install preview version 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.010
 android l developer preview 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.930
 designed for developers 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 Apple has acquired the company Met. 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.959
 created as a volkswagen project in 2003 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.790
 year to me and and specializes 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.670
 on developments in the field of augmented 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.430
 reality she has a community 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.370
 developers about a thousand customers 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.709
 and 150 thousand users in 30 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.000
 Worldwide , the company has experience 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.250
 cooperation with famous 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.950
 manufacturers for example with ferrari 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.560
 why apple needed company I throw 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.150
 one can only guess at 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.190
 apple have plans to add 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.599
 augmented reality applications in their 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.400
 products about two years ago was 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.379
 mimo device is presented 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.849
 which allowed to manage different 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.730
 electronics through motions 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.470
 fingers and forearms like 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.580
 technology used and the creators 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.409
 device aria 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.640
 it also allows you to manage 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.489
 electronics through a variety of 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.230
 gestures and movements but if in the case of media 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.670
 it was necessary to decide what 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.040
 drive through this bracelet 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.650
 Aria is aimed at quite specific 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.379
 device and scripts talking about smart 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.480
 the watch area is attached to the watch strap and 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.200
 allows you to control them without touching 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.939
 to display 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.709
 pairing with the clock occurs 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.780
 via bluetooth and the device itself 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.629
 does not have its own battery 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.700
 at the moment I am able to work with 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.300
 hours pebble time and miss decision 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.560
 android 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.239
 p company revolt came up 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.460
 alternative use case 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.840
 smart watches that may be of interest 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.910
 potential buyers 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.100
 developers suggest using 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.590
 your watches instead of cloud storage for 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.080
 user information for these 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.890
 goals revolt watches are equipped with flash memory 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.260
 32 or 128 gigabyte clock 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.980
 equipped with a display and a half 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.360
 inch resolution of 240 by 240 pixels 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.460
 which covers the glass gorilla glass 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.470
 3 and also can boast 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.450
 metal case and water protection 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.800
 battery charge should be enough for 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.230
 three days of battery life 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.150
 another watch feature is the ability 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.430
 wear them as a pendant or just 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.230
 keychain at the moment developers 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.780
 raise money for a project on the site 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.390
 indigo angle per version with thirty two 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.600
 gigabytes of memory asking for 200 dollars 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.090
 while the modification with 128 gigabytes 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.410
 will cost $ 300 supplies must 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.240
 start next january in 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.730
 University of California Barkley 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.440
 created a robot nonsense that uses 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.200
 deep learning algorithms based on 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.480
 neural network to master new for 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.910
 self action learning opportunity 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.040
 nonsense like a child who 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.110
 acquires skills by trial and error 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.150
 can theoretically be completely excluded from 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.340
 the operation of the robot writing 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.470
 new code is enough to set the task 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.020
 which he is physically able to solve and 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.360
 give enough time to solve it 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.220
 sorry unlike human nonsense not 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.320
 able to take into account previous experience 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.080
 which does not allow to learn over time 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.770
 faster however the project participants are full 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.360
 optimism 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.250
 they count substantially 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.610
 improve technology 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.919
 self study in the coming years 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.360
 it was the most interesting news 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.150
