00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.260
 wide range and if it is a business 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
 tilt remains the favorite not 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.180
 classic costume but used 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.610
 shirt without ties and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.670
 mandatory summer fabrics and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 summer types of fabric is flax blended 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.720
 silk steel fabrics and that which 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.750
 are hygroscopic as regards 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.330
 this image is here represented 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.810
 more creative dynamic and youth 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.170
 option 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.530
 and this is reflected in the shirt color 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.410
 rolled up 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.170

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.129
 diverse to be seen in this 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.260
 manner of refinement and high cost of this 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.319
 the set is honorable not only spectacular 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.830

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.959

 young man in the creativity field 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.370

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.260
 combine complex colors in one set 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.870
 many men want to wear white in the summer 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.230

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.049

 his style factors are 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.090
 horizontal bar and combination 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.189

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.000
 spectacular in this set with games 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:09.069
 white pants is a prerogative of summer is very 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.579
 good to use their names in the sea 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.989
 style 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.939
 used not only for marine 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.099
 traveling but we also over 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.900
 urban informal setting white 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.879
 blocks can also be worn with a contrast 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.540
 shirt depending on your color type 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:26.220
 and it is recommended not to wear white pants 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.220
 very dark shoes 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.460
 and the last summer look include yourself 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.320

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.780
 yes this is a chic kit that consists 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.030
 from white fitted shirt and 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.070
 summer pants because the advantage is 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.660
 elegant fabric whose composition is Lena 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.370
 silk is luxury clothing and 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.030
 designed for summer 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.530
 hanging out outside the office of course and 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.870
 carries such a very pronounced 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.810
 sexy off target 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.290
 plus it can be used for summer 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.330
 party for an informal setting 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.910
 because men should not only work 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.060
 I also managed to take a rest and notice that 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.190
 socks are missing in this image 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.280
 quite right very subtly noted 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.010
 question because man is not always in 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.070
 aware of how to wear socks with what you can with what 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.050
 and what socks I want 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.110
 comment on this image 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.290
 it is not designed to work with 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.020
 here summer moccasins and of course you can 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.020
 use it on bare foot that 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:48.590
 As for the other options, then the business 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.560
 the suit is worn with socks around and around 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.740
 and it is desirable that the socks were either in tone 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.020
 shoes either to match informal trousers 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.330
 in the summertime we are always 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.180
 use summer shoes from not 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.540
 wearing socks is strictly forbidden 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.390
 these shoes like flip-flops or summer 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.970
 moccasins involves wearing wet 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.530
 leg is very important because it is 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.530
 nuances create stiga 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.330
 he
