00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.130
 Year and learn here at the company 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.380
 tal in the car mechatronics with a focus 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.759
 I would like to use commercial vehicle technology now 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.759
 show my workplace 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.399
 his job kfz mechatroniker it comes 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.750
 to know about it 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.960
 vehicle electrics and mechanics too 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.000
 obtain maintenance and later maintenance 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.539
 Perform repairs independently 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.159
 can 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.170
 and for me this is exactly the right one 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.170
 profession had always been like limp 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.810
 This uses vehicles as before 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.150
 especially with trucks and other vehicles 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.430
 how to do buses in the van 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.320
 we lead from the tire change over 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.890
 expectations to larger ones 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.270
 Repair everything by the trucks again 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.370
 to bring to the street 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.990
 she finds it very interesting because the 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.990
 dimensions are overwhelming 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.170
 after training to 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.770
 kfz-mechatroniker you have very good 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.450
 career prospects respectively 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.520
 opportunities for further education not 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.880
 Take for example from on the project 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.290
 and auto parts where you parallel to 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.740
 letter to the master also make 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.960
 can 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.820
 The missing very important because each 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.020
 practical basis for a 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.020
 has an engineering degree
