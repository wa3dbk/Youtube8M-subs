choose a channel strip set over here and
we<00:00:49.390> go<00:00:49.480> to<00:00:49.540> an<00:00:49.660> ultra<00:00:49.900> beat<00:00:50.020> and<00:00:50.230> say<00:00:50.470> if<00:00:50.560> I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
we go to an ultra beat and say if I

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.580 
we go to an ultra beat and say if I
choose<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.630> any<00:00:52.630> one<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.990> kits<00:00:53.260> will<00:00:53.440> just

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
choose a any one of the kits will just

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.920 
choose a any one of the kits will just
grab<00:00:53.770> one<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.040> them<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.340> it<00:00:55.180> loads<00:00:55.420> this<00:00:55.720> in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
grab one of them and it loads this in

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.390 
grab one of them and it loads this in
you<00:00:56.650> will<00:00:56.920> want<00:00:57.190> to<00:00:57.310> change<00:00:57.640> this<00:00:58.920> from<00:00:59.920> stereo

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
you will want to change this from stereo

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.180 
you will want to change this from stereo
to<00:01:01.210> multi<00:01:01.690> ok<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:02.200> go<00:01:02.470> ahead<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.650> just<00:01:02.830> flip

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
to multi ok so go ahead and just flip

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.429 
to multi ok so go ahead and just flip
that<00:01:03.370> over<00:01:03.430> now<00:01:04.420> even<00:01:04.809> if<00:01:04.900> you've<00:01:05.019> changed

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
that over now even if you've changed

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.380 
that over now even if you've changed
some<00:01:05.590> settings<00:01:06.070> or<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:06.640> have<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.909> particular

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
some settings or you have a particular

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.139 
some settings or you have a particular
preset<00:01:08.290> in<00:01:08.470> there<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:08.979> will<00:01:09.400> retain<00:01:09.880> that

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
preset in there it will retain that

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.899 
preset in there it will retain that
preset<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.990> does<00:01:11.200> retain<00:01:11.499> the<00:01:11.679> preset<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.280> just

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
preset it does retain the preset it just

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.440 
preset it does retain the preset it just
basically<00:01:13.630> reopens<00:01:14.409> it<00:01:14.590> with<00:01:14.740> your<00:01:14.890> preset

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
basically reopens it with your preset

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.590 
basically reopens it with your preset
with<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.479> multi-channel<00:01:17.020> output<00:01:17.649> ok<00:01:18.429> so<00:01:19.179> I'm

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
with a multi-channel output ok so I'm

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.880 
with a multi-channel output ok so I'm
going<00:01:19.749> to<00:01:19.780> go<00:01:19.869> ahead<00:01:19.929> and<00:01:20.020> use<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.320> sequences

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
going to go ahead and use the sequences

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.249 
going to go ahead and use the sequences

want to go ahead and create a new

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.630 
want to go ahead and create a new
auxiliary<00:02:19.930> channel<00:02:20.440> strip<00:02:20.710> and<00:02:20.890> there's<00:02:21.490> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
auxiliary channel strip and there's a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.860 
auxiliary channel strip and there's a
key<00:02:21.790> command<00:02:22.090> for<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.390> as<00:02:22.480> well<00:02:22.510> but<00:02:22.750> we're

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
key command for that as well but we're

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.570 
key command for that as well but we're
gonna<00:02:22.990> go<00:02:23.050> ahead<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.230> create<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:24.340> when<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:24.490> do

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
gonna go ahead and create and when I do

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.450 
gonna go ahead and create and when I do
that<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:24.940> want<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.210> go<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.420> create<00:02:25.600> five<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.370> we

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
that I want to go and create five and we

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.100 
that I want to go and create five and we
need<00:02:27.610> them<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.850> be<00:02:27.940> stereo<00:02:28.450> because<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.930> does

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
need them to be stereo because it does

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.280 
need them to be stereo because it does
come<00:02:29.350> out<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.890> ultra<00:02:30.460> beat<00:02:30.660> 11<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.900> 12<00:02:32.050> and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
come out of the ultra beat 11 and 12 and

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.530 
come out of the ultra beat 11 and 12 and
so<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.770> is<00:02:32.890> they<00:02:33.130> are<00:02:33.160> stereo<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.970> that's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
so on so it is they are stereo so that's

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.600 
so on so it is they are stereo so that's
basically<00:02:38.200> you're<00:02:38.830> going<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.010> create<00:02:39.250> five

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
basically you're going to create five

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.950 
basically you're going to create five
you're<00:02:40.030> going<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.210> make<00:02:40.270> sure<00:02:40.420> this<00:02:40.540> stereo

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
you're going to make sure this stereo

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.050 
you're going to make sure this stereo
and<00:02:41.260> hit<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:41.800> create<00:02:42.010> button<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.430> here's<00:02:42.880> our

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
and hit the create button and here's our

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.650 
and hit the create button and here's our
five<00:02:43.920> auxiliary<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.700> next<00:02:46.120> step<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.570> to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
five auxiliary the next step is to

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.310 
five auxiliary the next step is to
change<00:02:47.440> their<00:02:47.680> input<00:02:48.420> orientation<00:02:49.420> so<00:02:50.080> where

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
change their input orientation so where

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.110 
change their input orientation so where
it<00:02:50.410> says<00:02:50.560> input<00:02:50.950> 1<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.310> 2<00:02:51.459> here<00:02:51.790> we're<00:02:52.000> going

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
it says input 1 and 2 here we're going

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.699 
it says input 1 and 2 here we're going
to<00:02:52.180> click<00:02:52.420> there<00:02:52.720> I'm<00:02:53.050> going<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.410> change<00:02:53.650> that

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
to click there I'm going to change that

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.020 
to click there I'm going to change that
and<00:02:53.890> you'll<00:02:54.040> notice<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.310> instrument<00:02:54.910> is

all<00:04:19.860> 20<00:04:20.130> pieces<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.030> can<00:04:24.180> use<00:04:24.420> them

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
all 20 pieces and so you can use them

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.200 
all 20 pieces and so you can use them
solo<00:04:25.650> them<00:04:27.890> so<00:04:28.890> with<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.310> sound<00:04:29.670> here<00:04:29.970> we

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
solo them so with this sound here we

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.210 
solo them so with this sound here we
have<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:30.420> strange<00:04:31.410> sound<00:04:33.950> I'm<00:04:34.950> gonna<00:04:35.070> come

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
have this strange sound I'm gonna come

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.460 
have this strange sound I'm gonna come
in<00:04:35.250> here<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.730> maybe<00:04:36.090> we'll<00:04:36.300> put<00:04:36.480> some<00:04:37.230> sort<00:04:37.410> of

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
in here and maybe we'll put some sort of

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.080 
in here and maybe we'll put some sort of
setting<00:04:38.460> on<00:04:38.610> here<00:04:39.200> let's<00:04:40.200> do<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:41.090> electric

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
setting on here let's do a electric

00:04:42.090 --> 00:05:21.680 
setting on here let's do a electric
guitar<00:04:44.360> Dublin<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.940> so<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.210> get<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.510> point

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
guitar Dublin and so you get the point

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.810 
guitar Dublin and so you get the point
now<00:05:22.650> you<00:05:22.710> have<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.040> opportunity<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.790> go

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
now you have the opportunity to go

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.480 
now you have the opportunity to go
through<00:05:24.240> each<00:05:24.620> different<00:05:25.620> channel<00:05:26.100> strip<00:05:26.310> and

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
through each different channel strip and

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.700 
through each different channel strip and
apply<00:05:26.760> effects<00:05:27.270> either<00:05:27.600> channel<00:05:28.110> strip<00:05:28.410> sets

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
apply effects either channel strip sets

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.070 
apply effects either channel strip sets
or<00:05:28.920> you<00:05:29.190> can<00:05:29.340> add<00:05:29.580> your<00:05:29.790> own<00:05:29.850> affects<00:05:30.360> all<00:05:30.630> the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
or you can add your own affects all the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.750 
or you can add your own affects all the
cards<00:05:31.470> by<00:05:31.650> just<00:05:31.890> inserting<00:05:32.490> them<00:05:32.640> here<00:05:33.350> okay

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
cards by just inserting them here okay

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.470 
cards by just inserting them here okay
instead<00:05:35.760> of<00:05:35.790> stereo<00:05:36.360> out<00:05:38.210> we're<00:05:39.210> going<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.390> go

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
instead of stereo out we're going to go

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.610 
instead of stereo out we're going to go
ahead<00:05:39.510> and<00:05:39.840> change<00:05:40.260> this<00:05:40.350> to<00:05:41.010> bus<00:05:41.690> one<00:05:42.690> okay

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
ahead and change this to bus one okay

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.650 
ahead and change this to bus one okay
and<00:05:44.190> when<00:05:44.640> we<00:05:44.730> do<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.000> bus<00:05:45.120> one<00:05:45.300> actually<00:05:45.600> it

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
and when we do the bus one actually it

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.909 
and when we do the bus one actually it
made<00:05:45.780> it<00:05:45.900> automatically<00:05:46.500> let's<00:05:46.650> get<00:05:46.770> rid<00:05:46.860> of

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
made it automatically let's get rid of

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.850 
made it automatically let's get rid of
this<00:05:47.010> one<00:05:47.190> when<00:05:48.060> we<00:05:48.180> do<00:05:48.360> that<00:05:48.600> these<00:05:49.169> outs<00:05:49.500> are

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
this one when we do that these outs are

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.950 
this one when we do that these outs are
now<00:05:50.390> resolving<00:05:51.390> to<00:05:51.570> this<00:05:51.720> one<00:05:52.050> slider<00:05:53.900> now<00:05:54.900> the

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
now resolving to this one slider now the

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.750 
now resolving to this one slider now the
benefit<00:05:55.380> of<00:05:55.410> that<00:05:55.470> is<00:05:55.590> you<00:05:55.890> can<00:05:56.070> EQ<00:05:56.580> and

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
benefit of that is you can EQ and

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.190 
benefit of that is you can EQ and
compress<00:05:57.120> each<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.690> drum<00:05:57.900> parts

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
compress each of the drum parts

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.080 
compress each of the drum parts
separately<00:05:58.620> and<00:05:58.890> then<00:05:59.190> you<00:05:59.460> can<00:05:59.610> go<00:05:59.760> to<00:05:59.820> the

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
separately and then you can go to the

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.420 
separately and then you can go to the
master<00:06:00.510> bus<00:06:00.930> so<00:06:01.260> we<00:06:01.440> could<00:06:01.590> change<00:06:01.770> this<00:06:02.100> to

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
master bus so we could change this to

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.550 
master bus so we could change this to
the<00:06:03.270> ultra<00:06:03.720> beat<00:06:03.960> master<00:06:05.690> so<00:06:06.690> now<00:06:06.870> these<00:06:07.290> all

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
the ultra beat master so now these all

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.770 
the ultra beat master so now these all
result<00:06:08.010> to<00:06:08.130> the<00:06:08.160> one<00:06:08.400> master<00:06:08.850> slider<00:06:09.150> and<00:06:09.570> at

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
result to the one master slider and at

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.409 
result to the one master slider and at
that<00:06:09.870> point<00:06:10.110> you<00:06:10.230> could<00:06:10.440> put<00:06:10.650> possibly<00:06:11.419> some

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
that point you could put possibly some

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.280 
that point you could put possibly some
sort<00:06:12.660> of<00:06:12.750> grouped<00:06:14.390> effect<00:06:15.390> on<00:06:15.570> it<00:06:15.690> group<00:06:15.930> kit

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
sort of grouped effect on it group kit

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.740 
sort of grouped effect on it group kit
what<00:06:17.100> you<00:06:17.220> do<00:06:17.370> like<00:06:17.580> this<00:06:17.640> do<00:06:18.000> this<00:06:18.180> vintage

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
what you do like this do this vintage

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.930 
what you do like this do this vintage
group<00:06:19.110> kids<00:06:19.440> so<00:06:19.740> here<00:06:20.280> we<00:06:20.370> go<00:06:20.400> we<00:06:20.580> got<00:06:20.669> the<00:06:20.729> kit

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
group kids so here we go we got the kit

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.280 
group kids so here we go we got the kit
over<00:06:21.150> here<00:06:21.330> this<00:06:21.450> is<00:06:21.600> all<00:06:21.690> playing<00:06:21.900> and<00:06:22.169> then

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
over here this is all playing and then

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.900 
over here this is all playing and then
it's<00:06:22.440> going<00:06:22.590> through<00:06:22.860> this<00:06:23.010> it<00:06:23.490> kind<00:06:23.729> of<00:06:23.760> like

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
it's going through this it kind of like

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:30.200 
it's going through this it kind of like
it's<00:06:24.060> mastering<00:06:24.690> channel<00:06:25.050> strip

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.340 

so<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.270> get<00:06:31.450> the<00:06:31.570> point<00:06:31.750> and<00:06:32.020> then<00:06:32.140> you<00:06:32.230> have

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
so you get the point and then you have

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.020 
so you get the point and then you have
the<00:06:32.470> stereo<00:06:33.010> out<00:06:33.220> which<00:06:33.430> is<00:06:33.550> obviously<00:06:33.850> the

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
the stereo out which is obviously the

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.700 
the stereo out which is obviously the
final<00:06:34.570> out<00:06:34.690> where<00:06:34.870> you<00:06:34.930> could<00:06:35.080> have<00:06:35.260> your

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
final out where you could have your

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.040 
final out where you could have your
mastering<00:06:36.160> set<00:06:36.370> for<00:06:36.610> its<00:06:36.790> output<00:06:37.270> and<00:06:37.480> then

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
mastering set for its output and then

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.540 
mastering set for its output and then
you<00:06:38.200> have<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.530> master<00:06:38.740> but<00:06:39.100> this<00:06:39.220> is<00:06:39.310> a<00:06:39.340> way

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
you have the master but this is a way

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.060 
you have the master but this is a way
for<00:06:39.580> you<00:06:39.880> to<00:06:39.910> be<00:06:40.270> able<00:06:40.300> to<00:06:40.510> send<00:06:41.070> different

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
for you to be able to send different

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.180 
for you to be able to send different
sounds<00:06:42.790> out<00:06:42.970> to<00:06:43.450> different<00:06:43.630> auxiliary<00:06:44.320> from

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
sounds out to different auxiliary from

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.040 
sounds out to different auxiliary from
the<00:06:45.310> ultra<00:06:45.670> beat<00:06:45.790> and<00:06:46.030> this<00:06:46.570> does<00:06:46.810> actually

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
the ultra beat and this does actually

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.930 
the ultra beat and this does actually
work<00:06:47.230> for<00:06:47.470> all<00:06:47.890> the<00:06:48.190> plugins<00:06:48.430> that<00:06:48.730> our
