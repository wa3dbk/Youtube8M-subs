00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
have ADHD but that's only because they

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.240 
have ADHD but that's only because they
don't<00:00:13.290> know<00:00:13.349> what<00:00:13.469> it's<00:00:13.590> really<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.009> have

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250

as<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> little<00:00:14.670> kid<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.030> diagnosed<00:00:15.240> with<00:00:15.570> it

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
as a little kid I was diagnosed with it

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.060 
as a little kid I was diagnosed with it
but<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.929> never<00:00:16.080> took<00:00:16.260> any<00:00:16.410> meds<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.039> I

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
but I never took any meds for it so I

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.920 
but I never took any meds for it so I
never<00:00:17.369> knew<00:00:17.640> what<00:00:17.910> normal<00:00:18.510> people<00:00:18.539> thought

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930

like<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.170> can't<00:00:19.410> stand<00:00:19.650> when<00:00:19.830> people<00:00:20.070> say<00:00:20.160> that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
like I can't stand when people say that

ADHD<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> real<00:00:21.270> thing<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.900> it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
ADHD is not a real thing and that it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.689 
ADHD is not a real thing and that it's
just<00:00:22.380> an<00:00:22.470> excuse<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:22.830> lazy<00:00:23.160> people<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.580> blame

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
just an excuse for lazy people to blame

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.099 
just an excuse for lazy people to blame
their<00:00:23.939> laziness<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> can't<00:00:25.019> stand

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
their laziness on what I can't stand

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.630 
their laziness on what I can't stand
even<00:00:25.410> more<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.830> when<00:00:26.070> people<00:00:26.250> actually

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
even more is that when people actually

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.400 
even more is that when people actually
do<00:00:27.000> use<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.449> an<00:00:27.539> excuse<00:00:27.900> even<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.320> they

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
do use it as an excuse even when they

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.689 
do use it as an excuse even when they
don't<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.130> because<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.429> didn't

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
don't have it just because they didn't

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.009 
don't have it just because they didn't
do<00:00:29.760> well<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:29.970> school<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.630> they're<00:00:30.779> bad<00:00:30.990> at

studying or something but really there's

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.950 
studying or something but really there's
no<00:00:32.579> excuse<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.270> grew<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
no excuse because I grew up with it and

even<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.460> made<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.789> joke<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.180> only<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> joke

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
even I made that joke but only as a joke

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
even I made that joke but only as a joke
because<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.410> such<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> huge<00:00:58.949> exaggeration

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
because that is such a huge exaggeration

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
because that is such a huge exaggeration
it's<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.390> nothing<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> most<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it's really nothing like that most of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
it's really nothing like that most of
the<00:01:01.379> time<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.859> sound<00:01:02.190> unrealistic<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the time if they sound unrealistic to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.070 
the time if they sound unrealistic to
you<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.239> probably<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.930> don't

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you it's probably just because you don't

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.719 
you it's probably just because you don't
have<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.379> trust<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.710> they're<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:04.949> real<00:01:05.400> they

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
have but trust me they're all real they

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520 
have but trust me they're all real they
