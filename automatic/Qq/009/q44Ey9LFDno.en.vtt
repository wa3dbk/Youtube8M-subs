the real red rings cuz there is a

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.690 
the real red rings cuz there is a
dimmest<00:02:11.020> right<00:02:12.020> there<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:13.130> can't<00:02:13.490> really<00:02:13.580> see

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
dimmest right there you can't really see

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.300 
dimmest right there you can't really see
it<00:02:14.000> off<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.300> my<00:02:14.330> camera<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:15.380> there<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.800> dim

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
it off on my camera but there is a dim

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.480 
it off on my camera but there is a dim
red<00:02:17.240> line<00:02:17.510> that<00:02:17.720> year<00:02:17.959> whereas<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.010> second

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
red line that year whereas the second

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.220 
red line that year whereas the second
controller<00:02:19.790> suppose<00:02:20.090> me<00:02:20.240> it's<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.480> dim<00:02:20.990> red

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
controller suppose me it's a dim red

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.020 
controller suppose me it's a dim red
light<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.430> not<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.580> real<00:02:22.820> ones

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
light so it's not the real ones

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.610 
light so it's not the real ones
everyone's<00:02:23.480> interest<00:02:23.750> rate<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.020> black<00:02:24.350> right

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
everyone's interest rate a black right

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.300 
everyone's interest rate a black right
there<00:02:25.209> but<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.140> great<00:02:27.680> way<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.920> trick

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
there but this is a great way to trick

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.000 
there but this is a great way to trick
