 Let's hear the impression of graduation 

00:00:49.786 --> 00:00:54.501
 Hi, I am Jang Keun-seok of the 06th Business Administration Department of Business Administration 

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:59.810
 It is embarrassing to graduate for the first time in eight years 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.402
 Especially, give me such a merit award at school 

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:07.020
 Thank you very much for practicing patriotism Hanyang 

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:25.279
 Q. What is your impression of graduation? I entered Hanyang University in 2006 with a 06 school number 

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.883
 I will graduate for the first time in eight years 

00:01:27.883 --> 00:01:35.114
 It's a bit embarrassing but don't give up till the end 

00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:41.090
 I'm working hard until now, and I'm glad I can participate until today's graduation ceremony 

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:45.058
 And personally, I did everything I wanted to do when I went to university 

00:01:45.058 --> 00:01:50.760
 The campus is likely to be my most important student age 

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:57.296
 By chance, if there are juniors or people who are going to enter university soon 

00:01:57.296 --> 00:02:00.150
 I think I should try it once by all means 

00:02:00.698 --> 00:02:06.636
 Q. What is your feeling of receiving a merit award? I'm still wondering what part I benefited from 

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:12.980
 I am our school slogan as a student of Hanyang University 

00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:22.620
 I always talked a lot of school outside the part called "patriotic Hanyang, the practice of love" 

00:02:22.623 --> 00:02:29.707
 So maybe it's a lot to tell you a lot of schools abroad 

00:02:29.707 --> 00:02:32.270
 I think I received an award 

00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:37.816
 I think that the connection as Hanyang people will be connected even if I graduate 

00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:40.040
 Thank you
