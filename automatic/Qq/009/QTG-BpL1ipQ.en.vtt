00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
now let's talk about the fit of this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.550 
now let's talk about the fit of this
boot<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.610> 100<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> 100<00:02:03.960> flex<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
boot it's a 100 it's a 100 flex and a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.380 
boot it's a 100 it's a 100 flex and a
100<00:02:04.920> last<00:02:05.100> exactly<00:02:05.759> let's<00:02:05.850> talk<00:02:06.090> about<00:02:06.180> both

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
100 last exactly let's talk about both

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.149 
100 last exactly let's talk about both
of<00:02:06.420> those

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
of those

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.639 
of those
so<00:02:07.490> that's<00:02:07.939> going<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.119> be<00:02:08.179> your<00:02:08.450> average<00:02:08.660> mm<00:02:09.379> or

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
so that's going to be your average mm or

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.740 
so that's going to be your average mm or
your<00:02:09.860> average<00:02:10.220> last<00:02:10.489> fits<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.629> know

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
your average last fits the you know

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.440 
your average last fits the you know
normal<00:02:12.650> or<00:02:12.980> medium<00:02:13.459> lasted<00:02:13.879> foot<00:02:14.150> probably

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
normal or medium lasted foot probably

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.539 
normal or medium lasted foot probably
eighty-five<00:02:15.050> ninety<00:02:15.080> percent<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.310> skier

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
eighty-five ninety percent of the skier

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.180 
eighty-five ninety percent of the skier
but<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.879> a<00:02:16.910> snugger<00:02:17.420> fit<00:02:17.569> than<00:02:18.080> more<00:02:18.890> wider

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
little fur at the top I see yep it's a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.650 
little fur at the top I see yep it's a
custom<00:02:43.129> heat<00:02:43.310> moldable<00:02:43.640> liner<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:44.239> needed

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
custom heat moldable liner if needed

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.839 
custom heat moldable liner if needed
you've<00:02:45.379> got<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.769> faux<00:02:45.980> fur<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.519> it<00:02:46.579> gives<00:02:46.700> a
