00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.399 
make a a bizarre photo because she was
so<00:01:47.399> big<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.299> had<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.600> helped<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.140> mover

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
so big you had to have helped a mover

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.289 
so big you had to have helped a mover
you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.649> imagine<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.100> 300<00:01:50.579> pound<00:01:50.729> snake<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you can imagine a 300 pound snake that

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
you can imagine a 300 pound snake that
is<00:01:51.420> all<00:01:51.540> muscle<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.950> got<00:01:53.100> me<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.250> thinking

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
is all muscle so it got me to thinking

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.209 
is all muscle so it got me to thinking
about<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.500> snakes<00:01:55.500> I've<00:01:55.770> handled

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
about all of the snakes I've handled

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.010 
about all of the snakes I've handled
over<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.640> course<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.090> my<00:01:57.240> time<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.659> National

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
over the course of my time at National

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.209 
over the course of my time at National
Geographic<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.329> I<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.829> handle

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
Geographic and I just know if you handle

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.679 
Geographic and I just know if you handle
enough<00:02:02.520> snakes<00:02:02.820> you're<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.390> bitten

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
enough snakes you're going to get bitten

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.430 
enough snakes you're going to get bitten
and<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.310> been<00:02:05.520> didn't<00:02:05.850> later<00:02:06.390> God<00:02:06.750> God<00:02:07.409> God

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.790 

that's<00:02:12.440> why<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.680> best<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:15.170> okay<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.500> pick<00:02:15.650> up

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
that's why it best it's okay to pick up

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440 
that's why it best it's okay to pick up
the<00:02:15.920> Python<00:02:16.519> by<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.700> way<00:02:16.819> it's<00:02:16.940> not<00:02:17.090> done<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the Python by the way it's not done the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.970 
the Python by the way it's not done the
snake<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:17.959> okay<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.200> pick<00:02:18.410> those<00:02:18.590> up<00:02:18.620> and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
snake so it's okay to pick those up and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.220 
snake so it's okay to pick those up and
usually<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.480> have<00:02:20.660> been<00:02:20.810> bitten<00:02:21.019> by

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
usually and I have been bitten by

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.220 
usually and I have been bitten by
pythons<00:02:21.680> too<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:22.160> usually<00:02:22.550> will<00:02:23.450> always<00:02:23.540> they

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
pythons too but usually will always they

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.140 
pythons too but usually will always they
grab<00:02:24.470> their<00:02:24.650> prey<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.340> squeeze<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.970> death

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
grab their prey and squeeze it to death

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.550 
grab their prey and squeeze it to death
and<00:02:26.300> then<00:02:26.390> they<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:26.660> take<00:02:26.780> your<00:02:26.989> time<00:02:27.170> eating

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
and then they can take your time eating

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.670 
and then they can take your time eating
it<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.780> over<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> course<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.170> my<00:02:30.290> time<00:02:30.530> at

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
it so over the course of my time at

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.199 
it so over the course of my time at
National<00:02:31.010> Geographic<00:02:31.129> I've<00:02:31.610> had<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.910> handle<00:02:32.150> a

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
National Geographic I've had to handle a

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.150 
National Geographic I've had to handle a
lot<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.480> snakes<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.840> always<00:02:33.080> try<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.319> if<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:34.069> a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
lot of snakes I always try to if it's a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.190 
lot of snakes I always try to if it's a
venomous<00:02:34.519> snake<00:02:34.580> though<00:02:35.000> use<00:02:35.629> some<00:02:35.870> kind<00:02:36.019> of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
venomous snake though use some kind of

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.229 
venomous snake though use some kind of
stick<00:02:36.500> or<00:02:36.769> clasping<00:02:37.370> device<00:02:37.670> because<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.030> just

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
stick or clasping device because I just

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.500 
stick or clasping device because I just
know<00:02:38.420> every<00:02:39.410> expert<00:02:39.860> i<00:02:40.010> have<00:02:40.190> seen<00:02:40.480> has<00:02:41.480> been

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
know every expert i have seen has been

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.720 
know every expert i have seen has been
bitten<00:02:41.989> no<00:02:42.650> matter<00:02:42.830> how<00:02:43.040> good<00:02:43.280> they<00:02:43.430> are<00:02:43.579> with

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
bitten no matter how good they are with

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.069 
bitten no matter how good they are with
snakes<00:02:43.970> because<00:02:44.120> snakes<00:02:44.360> are<00:02:44.599> really<00:02:44.840> fast

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
snakes because snakes are really fast

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.020 
snakes because snakes are really fast
and<00:02:45.349> you'll<00:02:45.680> get<00:02:46.099> lulled<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.489> sleep<00:02:46.549> or<00:02:46.910> you're

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
and you'll get lulled to sleep or you're

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.339 
and you'll get lulled to sleep or you're
looking<00:02:47.269> at<00:02:47.390> something<00:02:47.569> else<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.049> suddenly

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
looking at something else and suddenly

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.559
