00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
use half the fireplace as a backdrop but

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220 
use half the fireplace as a backdrop but
there<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.090> some<00:00:48.329> background<00:00:48.750> noise<00:00:48.870> and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.710 
can see we have forced the game disc
which<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.229> little<00:01:10.650> bit<00:01:10.890> portent<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
which is a little bit portent to

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.410 
which is a little bit portent to
actually<00:01:12.720> play<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.960> game<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.420> arguably

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
actually play the game that is arguably

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.899 
actually play the game that is arguably
the<00:01:15.630> most<00:01:15.659> critical<00:01:15.990> component<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.400> set

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the most critical component of the set

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.289 
the most critical component of the set
we<00:01:18.299> also<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:19.140> behind<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.340> scenes<00:01:20.549> DVD

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
we also have here behind the scenes DVD

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.149 
we also have here behind the scenes DVD
which<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.170> will<00:01:22.290> probably<00:01:22.500> never<00:01:22.860> watch

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
which I will probably never watch

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.460 
which I will probably never watch
because<00:01:23.759> my<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.320> by<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
because my I think by the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.890 
because my I think by the
behind-the-scenes<00:01:26.130> DVD<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.570> original

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.819 
starcraft it's still in its original
packaging<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> i<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.140> never<00:01:34.320> ever<00:01:34.560> watch

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
packaging so i will never ever watch

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.990 
packaging so i will never ever watch
that<00:01:35.420> but<00:01:36.420> nonetheless<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.829> cool<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.189> have

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.179 

next<00:01:42.000> what<00:01:42.329> else<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.659> got<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.950> of

hear<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.200> really<00:01:49.409> good<00:01:49.590> soundtrack<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.579> i

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
hear it's a really good soundtrack so i

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
hear it's a really good soundtrack so i
will<00:01:51.630> probably<00:01:51.899> put<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.399> my<00:01:53.610> ipod

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

will probably put this like on my ipod
for<00:01:54.270> no<00:01:54.420> reason<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.259> i<00:01:55.320> could<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.680> like

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
for no reason so i could just be like

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.260 
for no reason so i could just be like
