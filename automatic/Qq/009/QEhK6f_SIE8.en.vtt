not the nap dinner out there but like
because<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.270> internet<00:04:22.570> it's<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.750> lot<00:04:22.900> easier

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
because the internet it's a lot easier

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.290 
because the internet it's a lot easier
for<00:04:23.260> all<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.530> us<00:04:23.680> anime<00:04:24.370> fans<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:25.030> get<00:04:25.180> together

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
for all of us anime fans to get together

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.940 
for all of us anime fans to get together
and<00:04:25.630> discuss<00:04:25.840> stuff<00:04:26.200> and<00:04:26.410> kind<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.590> geek

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
and discuss stuff and kind of geek

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.830 
and discuss stuff and kind of geek
or<00:04:27.430> what<00:04:27.700> we<00:04:27.790> were<00:04:27.940> most<00:04:28.330> passionate<00:04:28.690> about

or what we were most passionate about

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.290 
or what we were most passionate about
and<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.080> think<00:04:29.110> that's<00:04:29.350> what<00:04:29.470> really<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.770> is

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
and I think that's what really is is

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.670 
and I think that's what really is is
because<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.540> internet<00:04:31.810> like<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.110> know<00:04:32.230> it's

because the internet like you know it's

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.960 
because the internet like you know it's
a<00:04:32.740> lot<00:04:32.890> easier<00:04:33.010> for<00:04:33.190> us<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.370> get<00:04:33.580> together<00:04:33.670> in

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
a lot easier for us to get together in

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.520 
a lot easier for us to get together in
that<00:04:34.090> circle<00:04:34.480> that<00:04:34.570> we<00:04:34.660> never<00:04:34.810> had<00:04:35.020> when<00:04:35.500> we
