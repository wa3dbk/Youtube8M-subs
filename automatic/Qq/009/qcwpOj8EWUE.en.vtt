in history needed upgrading its these

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.819 
in history needed upgrading its these
two<00:00:42.579> guys<00:00:43.059> first<00:00:43.750> long<00:00:44.140> as<00:00:44.379> I<00:00:44.470> can<00:00:44.650> possibly

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
two guys first long as I can possibly

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.610 
two guys first long as I can possibly
remember<00:00:45.309> these<00:00:46.269> two<00:00:46.659> particular<00:00:46.900> figures

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
remember these two particular figures

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.759 
remember these two particular figures
have<00:00:47.980> gotten<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.610> largest<00:00:49.300> amount<00:00:49.750> of<00:00:49.960> hate<00:00:50.500> I

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
have gotten the largest amount of hate I

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.639 
have gotten the largest amount of hate I
suppose<00:00:51.309> because<00:00:51.670> these<00:00:52.329> toys<00:00:52.690> look<00:00:52.989> nothing

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
suppose because these toys look nothing

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.950 
suppose because these toys look nothing
like<00:00:53.979> their<00:00:54.159> actual<00:00:54.549> cartoons<00:00:55.119> how<00:00:55.629> can<00:00:55.809> how

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
like their actual cartoons how can how

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.539 
like their actual cartoons how can how
can<00:00:56.170> you<00:00:56.260> pretend<00:00:56.680> that<00:00:56.769> this<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.100> Ironhide

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
can you pretend that this is Ironhide

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.160 
can you pretend that this is Ironhide
when<00:00:57.729> it<00:00:57.820> doesn't<00:00:58.000> even<00:00:58.150> look<00:00:58.269> like<00:00:58.449> Ironhide

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
when it doesn't even look like Ironhide

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.289 
when it doesn't even look like Ironhide
there<00:00:59.500> was<00:00:59.589> always<00:00:59.739> one<00:00:59.949> of<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.159> biggest

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
there was always one of the biggest

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.579 
there was always one of the biggest
complaints<00:01:01.299> that<00:01:01.449> I've<00:01:01.570> always<00:01:01.900> had<00:01:02.320> with

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
complaints that I've always had with

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.320 
complaints that I've always had with
this<00:01:02.739> set<00:01:02.979> and<00:01:03.250> probably<00:01:03.640> one<00:01:03.760> of<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.909> reasons

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
this set and probably one of the reasons

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.660 
this set and probably one of the reasons
why<00:01:04.479> it<00:01:04.540> took<00:01:04.750> me<00:01:04.960> so<00:01:05.409> long<00:01:05.439> to<00:01:05.979> actually<00:01:06.159> buy

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
why it took me so long to actually buy

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.310 
why it took me so long to actually buy
them<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.090> mean<00:01:07.270> honest<00:01:07.720> they<00:01:07.900> don't<00:01:07.930> even<00:01:08.140> have

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
them I mean honest they don't even have

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.749 
them I mean honest they don't even have
heads<00:01:08.530> what<00:01:09.009> are<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.159> supposed<00:01:09.369> to<00:01:09.430> do<00:01:09.580> with

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
heads what are you supposed to do with

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.719 
heads what are you supposed to do with
them<00:01:09.900> basically<00:01:10.900> wait<00:01:11.350> until<00:01:11.650> 2008<00:01:12.280> when<00:01:12.310> best

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
them basically wait until 2008 when best

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.609 
them basically wait until 2008 when best
toys<00:01:12.970> came<00:01:13.270> out<00:01:13.420> with<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.600> head<00:01:13.930> for<00:01:14.140> Ironhide

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
toys came out with a head for Ironhide

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.499 
toys came out with a head for Ironhide
and<00:01:14.830> ratchet<00:01:15.009> flip<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.850> on<00:01:15.970> here<00:01:16.150> on<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.360> back

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
and ratchet flip it on here on the back

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.609 
and ratchet flip it on here on the back
and<00:01:16.659> you<00:01:16.750> can<00:01:16.900> see<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:17.229> there<00:01:17.380> were<00:01:17.439> just

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
and you can see that there were just

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.350 
and you can see that there were just
little<00:01:17.799> tiny<00:01:17.979> heads<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.520> slid<00:01:18.939> into<00:01:19.119> the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
little tiny heads that slid into the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.999 
little tiny heads that slid into the
back<00:01:19.600> section<00:01:19.900> here<00:01:20.320> are<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.710> figures

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
back section here are the figures

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.069 
back section here are the figures
themselves<00:01:21.159> near<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.150> heads<00:01:22.329> themselves<00:01:22.479> and

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
themselves near the heads themselves and

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.200 
themselves near the heads themselves and
actually<00:01:23.530> they<00:01:23.650> were<00:01:23.710> really<00:01:23.799> nice<00:01:24.640> upgrade

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
actually they were really nice upgrade

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.270 
actually they were really nice upgrade
pieces<00:01:25.630> kind<00:01:26.050> of<00:01:26.110> expensive<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:26.740> set<00:01:26.950> alone

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
pieces kind of expensive this set alone

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.340 
pieces kind of expensive this set alone
was<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.610> believe<00:01:27.790> $30<00:01:28.600> when<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.870> first<00:01:29.020> came<00:01:29.290> out

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
was I believe $30 when it first came out

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.410 
was I believe $30 when it first came out
you<00:01:29.800> could<00:01:29.950> probably<00:01:30.070> get<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.310> cheaper<00:01:30.670> now<00:01:30.820> but

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
you could probably get a cheaper now but

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.270 
you could probably get a cheaper now but
it's<00:01:31.630> really<00:01:31.930> really<00:01:32.500> simple<00:01:32.680> you<00:01:32.950> see<00:01:33.130> this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
it's really really simple you see this

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.620 
it's really really simple you see this
little<00:01:33.520> slot<00:01:33.760> thing<00:01:34.060> right<00:01:34.210> here<00:01:34.390> they<00:01:34.600> just

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
little slot thing right here they just

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.390 
little slot thing right here they just
slide<00:01:35.170> right<00:01:35.530> down<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:38.740> your<00:01:38.950> Ironhide

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
slide right down and now your Ironhide

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.700 
slide right down and now your Ironhide
has<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.729> head<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.450> your<00:01:40.900> ratchet<00:01:41.080> has<00:01:41.440> a<00:01:41.470> head

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
has a head and your ratchet has a head

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.620 
has a head and your ratchet has a head
that<00:01:42.070> won't<00:01:42.370> kind<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.820> left<00:01:42.970> some<00:01:43.120> problems

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
that won't kind of left some problems

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.140 
that won't kind of left some problems
cuz<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.229> added<00:01:44.560> some<00:01:44.800> height<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.100> him<00:01:45.430> now<00:01:46.000> his

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
cuz you added some height to him now his

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.010 
cuz you added some height to him now his
arms<00:01:46.450> really<00:01:46.659> looked<00:01:46.990> kind<00:01:47.260> of<00:01:47.350> dopey<00:01:47.770> any

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
arms really looked kind of dopey any

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.380 
arms really looked kind of dopey any
girl<00:01:50.020> arms<00:01:50.470> I<00:01:50.740> guess<00:01:51.310> would<00:01:51.549> be<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.700> nice<00:01:52.000> term

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
girl arms I guess would be a nice term

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.539 
girl arms I guess would be a nice term
but<00:01:52.690> they're<00:01:53.140> just<00:01:53.290> terrible<00:01:53.890> looking<00:01:54.250> one

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
but they're just terrible looking one

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.580 
but they're just terrible looking one
thing<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:54.880> was<00:01:55.090> really<00:01:55.120> really<00:01:56.049> nice<00:01:56.380> about

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
thing that was really really nice about

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.530 
thing that was really really nice about
these<00:01:56.920> though<00:01:57.159> is<00:01:57.400> that<00:01:57.760> they<00:01:58.210> could<00:01:58.270> actually

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
these though is that they could actually

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.230 
these though is that they could actually
fold<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.350> they<00:01:59.620> could<00:01:59.770> actually<00:01:59.920> store<00:02:00.580> envy

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
fold and they could actually store envy

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.660 
fold and they could actually store envy
Okamoto<00:02:01.690> I'm<00:02:01.870> just<00:02:02.080> gonna<00:02:02.460> transform<00:02:03.460> him

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
Okamoto I'm just gonna transform him

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.560 
Okamoto I'm just gonna transform him
real<00:02:03.940> quick

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
so you can kind of see that it was

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.089 
so you can kind of see that it was
actually<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.450> really<00:02:07.900> nice<00:02:08.319> touch<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:09.069> I

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
actually a really nice touch that I

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.720 
actually a really nice touch that I
really<00:02:09.789> liked<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.860> then<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.129> take<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.549> back

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
really liked and then you take the back

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.390 
really liked and then you take the back
section<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:14.080> just<00:02:14.230> plug<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.739> down<00:02:15.069> and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
section and you just plug this down and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.430 
section and you just plug this down and
you<00:02:16.000> can<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.629> head<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:16.989> still<00:02:17.110> in

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
you can see that the head is still in

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.380 
you can see that the head is still in
there<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.640> actually<00:02:18.849> have<00:02:19.239> them

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
there but you can actually have them

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.500 
there but you can actually have them
store<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.470> headpiece<00:02:20.739> in<00:02:21.310> VO<00:02:21.610> commode<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.269> I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
store that headpiece in VO commode and I

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.280 
store that headpiece in VO commode and I
really<00:02:22.750> thought<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:23.019> there<00:02:23.140> was<00:02:23.260> a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
really thought that there was a

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.770 
really thought that there was a
brilliant<00:02:23.950> idea<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.370> they<00:02:24.640> had<00:02:24.819> enter<00:02:25.330> gear

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
brilliant idea that they had enter gear

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.570 
brilliant idea that they had enter gear
for<00:02:26.019> toys<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.620> as<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.040> can<00:02:27.189> see<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.459> a

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.920 
for toys and as you can see you have a
nice<00:02:27.790> silhouette<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.360> what<00:02:28.510> we're<00:02:28.659> gonna<00:02:28.750> be

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930

then all you have to do is take this and
this<00:03:49.729> kind<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.150> just<00:03:50.209> fits<00:03:50.750> into<00:03:50.959> place<00:03:51.319> here

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
this kind of just fits into place here

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.379 
this kind of just fits into place here
doesn't<00:03:52.129> really<00:03:52.159> peg<00:03:52.609> in<00:03:52.819> anything<00:03:53.180> doesn't

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
doesn't really peg in anything doesn't

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.089 
doesn't really peg in anything doesn't
really<00:03:53.629> slot<00:03:53.989> in<00:03:54.199> anything<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.709> just<00:03:54.739> kind<00:03:55.040> of

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
really slot in anything you just kind of

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:56.680 
really slot in anything you just kind of
hold<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.430> there<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:55.729> then<00:03:55.879> you<00:03:56.000> rotate<00:03:56.419> these

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
hold it there and then you rotate these

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.930 
hold it there and then you rotate these
up<00:03:57.049> and<00:03:57.349> that's<00:03:58.069> what's<00:03:58.280> actually<00:03:58.400> gonna<00:03:58.699> hold

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
up and that's what's actually gonna hold

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.270 
up and that's what's actually gonna hold
it<00:03:59.120> in<00:03:59.209> place<00:03:59.359> and<00:03:59.959> here<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.680> have<00:04:00.799> Ironhide

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
it in place and here you have Ironhide

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.000 
it in place and here you have Ironhide
and<00:04:01.609> yeah<00:04:02.359> I<00:04:02.810> really<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.739> way<00:04:03.829> this

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
and yeah I really like the way this

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.770 
and yeah I really like the way this
thing<00:04:04.280> looks<00:04:04.519> now<00:04:05.060> granted<00:04:05.419> people<00:04:05.690> have

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
thing looks now granted people have

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.149 
thing looks now granted people have
complained<00:04:06.139> because<00:04:06.379> now<00:04:06.530> his<00:04:06.709> upper<00:04:06.979> body

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
complained because now his upper body

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.280 
complained because now his upper body
looks<00:04:07.489> real<00:04:07.729> bulky<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.209> his<00:04:08.299> legs<00:04:08.599> look<00:04:08.870> small

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
looks real bulky and his legs look small

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.869 
looks real bulky and his legs look small
but<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:09.709> don't<00:04:09.949> really<00:04:10.099> think<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.459> looks<00:04:10.669> all

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
but I don't really think it looks all

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.930 
but I don't really think it looks all
that<00:04:11.359> terribly<00:04:11.989> bad<00:04:12.319> you<00:04:12.919> take<00:04:13.280> his<00:04:13.430> gun<00:04:13.669> in<00:04:13.849> it

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
that terribly bad you take his gun in it

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.560 
that terribly bad you take his gun in it
obviously<00:04:14.150> can<00:04:14.659> hold<00:04:14.900> in<00:04:15.079> either<00:04:15.349> hand<00:04:15.859> and<00:04:16.130> I

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
obviously can hold in either hand and I

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.229 
obviously can hold in either hand and I
just<00:04:17.570> love<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.169> way<00:04:18.289> this<00:04:18.470> looks<00:04:18.530> I<00:04:19.280> mean

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
just love the way this looks I mean

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.480 
just love the way this looks I mean

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
that's really spiffy the extra battery

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.520 
that's really spiffy the extra battery
is<00:04:22.880> used<00:04:23.120> because<00:04:23.539> he<00:04:23.750> actually<00:04:23.930> has<00:04:24.260> one

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530

really nice blue glow to his eyes
fantastically<00:04:35.930> now<00:04:36.169> one<00:04:36.470> thing<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.979> do

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
fantastically now one thing that you do

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
have to be careful with his head is

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.960 
have to be careful with his head is
actually<00:04:39.050> articulated<00:04:39.710> however<00:04:40.460> because<00:04:40.940> of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
actually articulated however because of

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.760 
actually articulated however because of
the<00:04:41.150> LED<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.779> the<00:04:41.900> wiring<00:04:42.139> that's<00:04:42.469> in<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:42.680> you

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
the LED and the wiring that's in it you

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.970 
the LED and the wiring that's in it you
can<00:04:42.950> really<00:04:43.250> only<00:04:43.430> go<00:04:43.789> about<00:04:44.000> ninety<00:04:44.510> degree

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
can really only go about ninety degree

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.980 
can really only go about ninety degree
left<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.460> right<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:46.240> can<00:04:46.480> go<00:04:46.720> all<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.870> way

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
left and right you can go all the way

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.990 
left and right you can go all the way
around<00:04:47.230> but<00:04:47.800> you're<00:04:47.920> gonna<00:04:48.040> snap<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.520> wire

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
around but you're gonna snap the wire

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.360 
around but you're gonna snap the wire
so<00:04:49.210> there's<00:04:49.660> Ironhide<00:04:50.230> right<00:04:50.710> there<00:04:50.950> and

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
so there's Ironhide right there and

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.910 
so there's Ironhide right there and
here's<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.760> ratchet<00:04:52.120> figure<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.570> again<00:04:53.260> the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
here's the ratchet figure and again the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.820 
here's the ratchet figure and again the
face<00:04:54.370> is<00:04:54.610> kind<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.090> goofy-looking<00:04:55.480> his<00:04:56.440> crest

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
face is kind of goofy-looking his crest

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.190 
face is kind of goofy-looking his crest
is<00:04:56.980> almost<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.340> little<00:04:57.370> bit<00:04:57.730> too<00:04:57.940> big<00:04:58.270> this<00:04:58.930> this

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
is almost a little bit too big this this

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.080 
is almost a little bit too big this this
crest<00:04:59.530> obviously<00:05:00.070> is<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.220> little<00:05:00.490> bit<00:05:00.610> smaller

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
crest obviously is a little bit smaller

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.670 
crest obviously is a little bit smaller
but<00:05:01.780> again<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.140> have<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.380> little<00:05:02.500> button

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
but again you have the little button

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.960 
but again you have the little button
here<00:05:02.920> on<00:05:02.950> the<00:05:03.040> back<00:05:03.280> then<00:05:03.490> when<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:03.700> push<00:05:03.940> it

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
here on the back then when you push it

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.270 
here on the back then when you push it
you<00:05:04.840> get<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.140> light-up<00:05:05.380> feature<00:05:05.530> in<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.160> ice

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
you get the light-up feature in the ice

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.820 
you get the light-up feature in the ice
which<00:05:06.700> is<00:05:06.910> very<00:05:07.480> reminiscent<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:08.170> just<00:05:08.620> blue

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
which is very reminiscent of just blue

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.950 
which is very reminiscent of just blue
pane<00:05:09.070> on<00:05:09.280> this<00:05:09.430> one<00:05:09.610> very<00:05:09.790> nice<00:05:10.330> looking

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
pane on this one very nice looking

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.500 
pane on this one very nice looking
the<00:05:11.350> only<00:05:11.560> real<00:05:11.980> unfortunate<00:05:12.360> aspect<00:05:13.360> of

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
the only real unfortunate aspect of

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.450 
the only real unfortunate aspect of
these<00:05:13.660> figures<00:05:13.930> the<00:05:14.380> only<00:05:14.830> real<00:05:15.220> unfortunate

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
these figures the only real unfortunate

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.400 
these figures the only real unfortunate
aspect<00:05:16.210> of<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.360> figures<00:05:16.630> is<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:17.230> add-on

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
aspect of the figures is that the add-on

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.410 
aspect of the figures is that the add-on
parts<00:05:17.920> can't<00:05:18.220> store<00:05:18.580> anywhere<00:05:18.880> which<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.390> a

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
parts can't store anywhere which is a

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.420 
parts can't store anywhere which is a
disappointment<00:05:20.080> in<00:05:20.290> my<00:05:20.410> opinion<00:05:20.800> but<00:05:21.070> really

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
disappointment in my opinion but really

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.550 
disappointment in my opinion but really

I<00:05:26.110> mean<00:05:26.320> really<00:05:26.530> come<00:05:26.920> on<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.430> real<00:05:27.640> question

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
I mean really come on the real question

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.000 
I mean really come on the real question
is<00:05:28.240> whether<00:05:28.630> or<00:05:28.810> not<00:05:28.870> this<00:05:29.170> set<00:05:29.410> is<00:05:29.530> worth<00:05:29.740> it

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
is whether or not this set is worth it

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.810 
is whether or not this set is worth it
each<00:05:30.400> set<00:05:30.940> retails<00:05:31.840> separately<00:05:32.590> for<00:05:32.890> $30<00:05:33.580> or

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
each set retails separately for $30 or

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.120 
each set retails separately for $30 or
you<00:05:34.180> can<00:05:34.390> get<00:05:34.540> both<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.810> them<00:05:35.110> for<00:05:35.500> I<00:05:35.530> think

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
you can get both of them for I think

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.610 
you can get both of them for I think
like<00:05:36.340> 50<00:05:36.910> $6.99<00:05:37.720> now<00:05:38.140> there<00:05:38.290> might<00:05:38.470> be<00:05:38.500> a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
like 50 $6.99 now there might be a

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.620 
like 50 $6.99 now there might be a
little<00:05:38.860> bit<00:05:39.070> too<00:05:39.220> pricey<00:05:39.550> for<00:05:39.880> some<00:05:40.060> people<00:05:40.420> so

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
little bit too pricey for some people so

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.450 
little bit too pricey for some people so
based<00:05:40.900> on<00:05:41.140> that<00:05:41.200> I<00:05:41.590> really<00:05:41.920> can't<00:05:42.310> recommend

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
based on that I really can't recommend

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.570 
based on that I really can't recommend
it<00:05:42.970> does<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.480> make<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.780> figures<00:05:44.080> look<00:05:44.320> better

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
it does it make the figures look better

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.130 
it does it make the figures look better
absolutely<00:05:45.580> in<00:05:45.670> my<00:05:45.820> opinion<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.420> absolutely

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
absolutely in my opinion it absolutely

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.500 
absolutely in my opinion it absolutely
makes<00:05:47.500> them<00:05:47.770> look<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.460> hell<00:05:48.910> of<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:49.150> lot<00:05:49.330> better

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
makes them look a hell of a lot better

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.960 
makes them look a hell of a lot better
but<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.080> price<00:05:50.350> is<00:05:50.680> a<00:05:50.740> little<00:05:51.010> bit<00:05:51.310> steep<00:05:51.580> so

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
but the price is a little bit steep so

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.970 
but the price is a little bit steep so
this<00:05:52.150> is<00:05:52.300> definitely<00:05:52.870> a<00:05:53.020> set<00:05:53.290> for<00:05:53.500> collectors

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
this is definitely a set for collectors

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.610 
this is definitely a set for collectors
with<00:05:54.460> money<00:05:54.760> but<00:05:55.120> in<00:05:55.240> my<00:05:55.450> opinion<00:05:56.020> this<00:05:56.350> set

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
with money but in my opinion this set

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.830 
with money but in my opinion this set
finally<00:05:57.160> gives<00:05:57.370> us<00:05:57.490> a<00:05:57.640> nice<00:05:57.910> way<00:05:58.180> to<00:05:58.210> probably

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
finally gives us a nice way to probably

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.920 
finally gives us a nice way to probably
display<00:05:59.200> our<00:05:59.680> g1<00:06:00.280> Ironhide<00:06:00.880> and<00:06:01.090> ratchets<00:06:01.540> so

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
display our g1 Ironhide and ratchets so

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.390 
display our g1 Ironhide and ratchets so
