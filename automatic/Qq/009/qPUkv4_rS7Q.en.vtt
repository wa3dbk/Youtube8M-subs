00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
while shox plays the games and so that's

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.320 
while shox plays the games and so that's
generally<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.229> distribution<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.330> workload

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
generally the distribution of workload

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
and we might even do those sometimes but

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.580 
and we might even do those sometimes but
that's<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.600> not<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> purpose<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.439> this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that's really not the purpose of this

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.690 
that's really not the purpose of this
build<00:01:55.799> we're<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> show<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.520> guys

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
build we're going to show you guys

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.550 
build we're going to show you guys
builds<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.299> work<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> highest<00:01:58.079> level<00:01:58.530> of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
builds that work at the highest level of

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469 
builds that work at the highest level of
Grandmaster<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.729> do<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.030> by<00:02:00.240> showing

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
Grandmaster and we do that by showing

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.749 
Grandmaster and we do that by showing
you<00:02:00.719> actual<00:02:01.140> games<00:02:01.380> instead<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:01.979> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you actual games instead of just you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
you actual games instead of just you
know<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.909> practice<00:02:03.390> custom<00:02:03.810> game<00:02:04.020> where<00:02:04.200> we

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
know a practice custom game where we

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
know a practice custom game where we
open<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.149> example<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.570> this

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
open and so like for example in this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
open and so like for example in this
game<00:02:06.840> shox<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.229> playing<00:02:07.469> against<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.039> ranked<00:02:08.369> 12

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
game shox is playing against a ranked 12

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
game shox is playing against a ranked 12
grand<00:02:08.970> mass<00:02:09.119> reserve<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.200> that's<00:02:10.619> basically

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
grand mass reserve so that's basically

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400 
grand mass reserve so that's basically
our<00:02:11.129> focus<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.060> games<00:02:12.270> um<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.989> also<00:02:13.140> want

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
our focus of the games um we also want

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.790 
our focus of the games um we also want
to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040 
to
the<00:02:13.980> replays<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.640> each<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.970> games<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the replays of each of the games in the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.950 
the replays of each of the games in the
folder<00:02:16.500> pillow<00:02:16.830> or<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.660> same

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
folder pillow or in the in the same

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.890 
folder pillow or in the in the same
place<00:02:19.230> where<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:20.100> our<00:02:20.580> website<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.660> that

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
place where on our website and so that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.140 
place where on our website and so that
basically<00:02:22.110> allows<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.890> track<00:02:23.430> or<00:02:23.790> watch

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
basically allows you to track or watch

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.210 
basically allows you to track or watch
their<00:02:24.420> games<00:02:24.630> at<00:02:24.870> your<00:02:25.020> own<00:02:25.170> pace<00:02:25.410> figure<00:02:26.190> out

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
their games at your own pace figure out

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.920 
their games at your own pace figure out
specific<00:02:26.730> timings<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.390> want<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.900> just

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
specific timings that you want and just

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.020 
specific timings that you want and just
basically<00:02:28.680> get<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> lot<00:02:29.400> more<00:02:29.430> information

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
basically get a lot more information

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.730 
basically get a lot more information
that<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.300> can't<00:02:30.510> explain<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.990> one<00:02:31.200> video<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
that we can't explain in one video and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.590 
that we can't explain in one video and
this<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.310> something<00:02:32.580> that's<00:02:32.730> unique<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.360> no

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
this is something that's unique that no

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.630 
this is something that's unique that no
other<00:02:33.810> website<00:02:34.590> has<00:02:34.770> so<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.160> guys<00:02:35.310> have

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
exactly what um what kind of things you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.360 
exactly what um what kind of things you
want<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.750> look<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:51.930> because<00:02:52.560> obviously<00:02:53.040> we're

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
want to look for because obviously we're

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.560 
want to look for because obviously we're
making<00:02:53.550> these<00:02:53.640> videos<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.090> lot<00:02:54.210> of<00:02:54.300> people

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
making these videos for a lot of people

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.600 
making these videos for a lot of people
and<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.560> can<00:02:55.740> tailor<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.160> everyone's

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
and so not we can tailor to everyone's

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.140 
and so not we can tailor to everyone's
expectations<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> future<00:02:59.460> we<00:02:59.700> also<00:02:59.820> plan

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
expectations in the future we also plan

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.120 
expectations in the future we also plan
adding<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.750> member's<00:03:01.350> area<00:03:01.470> if<00:03:01.770> that's<00:03:01.950> not

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
adding a member's area if that's not

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.530 
adding a member's area if that's not
already<00:03:02.400> up<00:03:02.640> at<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.940> time<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.300> video

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
already up at the time of the video

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.060 
already up at the time of the video
where<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.110> guys<00:03:04.290> can<00:03:04.500> discuss<00:03:04.920> these

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
where you guys can discuss these

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.730 
where you guys can discuss these
strategies<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.360> if<00:03:06.750> we<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.170> really<00:03:07.470> were

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
strategies and so if we just really were

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.890 
strategies and so if we just really were
trying<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.160> create<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.400> community<00:03:08.730> where<00:03:09.630> it's

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
trying to create a community where it's

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.810 
trying to create a community where it's
focused<00:03:10.320> on<00:03:10.410> getting<00:03:10.740> better<00:03:11.010> starcraft<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
focused on getting better starcraft and

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.220 
focused on getting better starcraft and
