00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
up at the sky and I can see very clearly

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.609 
up at the sky and I can see very clearly
we've<00:00:15.179> got<00:00:15.299> clear<00:00:15.540> skies<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:16.049> England<00:00:16.410> tonight

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
we've got clear skies in England tonight

we've got clear skies in England tonight
and<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.490> can<00:00:17.670> see<00:00:17.850> very<00:00:18.150> clearly<00:00:18.570> overhead<00:00:19.410> both

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and I can see very clearly overhead both

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.650 
and I can see very clearly overhead both
the<00:00:20.279> moon<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.320> Jupiter<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:23.300> it's<00:00:24.300> quite

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the moon and Jupiter and it's quite

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.509 
the moon and Jupiter and it's quite
pretty<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> moon

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
pretty because you can see now the moon

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.490 
pretty because you can see now the moon
is<00:00:26.550> about<00:00:27.000> six<00:00:27.330> degrees<00:00:27.480> away<00:00:27.990> from<00:00:28.260> Jupiter

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
is about six degrees away from Jupiter

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.859 
is about six degrees away from Jupiter
and<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.580> getting<00:00:29.910> closer<00:00:30.240> by<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.660> minute

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and it's getting closer by the minute

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.380 
and it's getting closer by the minute
and<00:00:31.320> over<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> coming<00:00:31.980> 24<00:00:32.669> hours<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> moon

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and over the coming 24 hours the moon

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.650 
and over the coming 24 hours the moon
will<00:00:33.600> pass<00:00:33.840> over<00:00:34.110> Jupiter<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:36.000> it's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
will pass over Jupiter and and it's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.060 
will pass over Jupiter and and it's
going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.020> conjunct<00:00:37.380> Jupiter<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
going to be conjunct Jupiter for the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.310 
going to be conjunct Jupiter for the
next<00:00:38.340> 24<00:00:38.969> hours<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.450> generally<00:00:39.870> seen<00:00:40.170> as

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
next 24 hours so it's generally seen as

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.720 
next 24 hours so it's generally seen as
a<00:00:40.350> good<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.160> lot<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.399> different

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.810 

don't<00:02:51.860> want<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.040> say<00:02:52.160> too<00:02:52.220> much<00:02:52.400> because<00:02:52.730> I'll

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
don't want to say too much because I'll

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.210 
don't want to say too much because I'll
get<00:02:52.910> yourself<00:02:53.270> into<00:02:53.540> trouble<00:02:53.690> but<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.590> do<00:02:54.770> feel

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
get yourself into trouble but I do feel

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.690 
get yourself into trouble but I do feel
that<00:02:55.250> there<00:02:55.550> could<00:02:55.820> be<00:02:55.850> something<00:02:56.330> quite

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
that there could be something quite

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.400 
that there could be something quite
radical<00:02:58.700> developing<00:02:59.570> in<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.810> coming<00:03:00.080> 24

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
radical developing in the coming 24

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.620 
radical developing in the coming 24
hours<00:03:00.830> borderline<00:03:01.400> explosive<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.360> I<00:03:02.390> don't

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
hours borderline explosive and I don't

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.020 
hours borderline explosive and I don't
think<00:03:02.960> I<00:03:03.170> mean<00:03:03.410> in<00:03:03.830> this<00:03:04.250> closer<00:03:04.550> way<00:03:04.820> that

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
think I mean in this closer way that

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.720 
think I mean in this closer way that
talks<00:03:05.300> of<00:03:05.480> bombs<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.110> big<00:03:06.410> bangs<00:03:06.740> okay

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
talks of bombs and big bangs okay

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.360 
talks of bombs and big bangs okay
I<00:03:07.760> think<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.570> explosive<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.350> a<00:03:09.440> way<00:03:09.590> that's

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
I think it's explosive in a way that's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.300 
I think it's explosive in a way that's
much<00:03:10.550> more<00:03:10.790> revelatory<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:14.980> bear<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.130> mind

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
much more revelatory it's bear in mind

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.620 
much more revelatory it's bear in mind
that<00:03:16.640> what's<00:03:16.940> going<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.760> it's<00:03:20.240> not<00:03:20.420> so

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
that what's going on is is it's not so

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.830 
that what's going on is is it's not so
much<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> smoke<00:03:21.140> screen<00:03:22.600> certainly<00:03:23.600> there's

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
much a smoke screen certainly there's

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.170 
much a smoke screen certainly there's
levels<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.410> orchestration<00:03:25.130> in<00:03:25.580> every<00:03:25.940> level

of human life whether that orchestration

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.030 
of human life whether that orchestration
is<00:03:29.000> done<00:03:29.210> by<00:03:29.420> humans<00:03:29.930> groups<00:03:30.530> or<00:03:30.830> by<00:03:30.980> the
