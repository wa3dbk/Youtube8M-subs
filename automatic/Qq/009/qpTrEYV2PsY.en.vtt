00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 before this problem before Brazil 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.560
 to play even did an interview with erik 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.200
 beck here in this studio and did the following 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.540
 Question to him, does he hit if Brazil is? 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.299
 Deleted already have an excuse was 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.570
 because neymar did not play and responded 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.570
 said that it is not quite like it already comes from 98 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.430
 because of ronaldo and yes we will go 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.230
 talk rather about neymar and marquinhos 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 You talk here on thiago silva too. 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.609
 here in al have a matter that were 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.079
 injecting here into our page that you 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.190
 can read and was elected the best and the worst 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.829
 player on the field but it was not 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.530
 player who was voted the worst 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.430
 the best was joaquim 9 that the coach 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 from Germany 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 the worst was elected felipão luiz felipe 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 scolari will have Brazil coach 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.190
 who was to blame for this elimination 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.610
 Bile was felipão 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.699
 The German fella told us in the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.399
 range germany attacked win suffered a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.170
 counterattack attacked algeria that has 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.750
 a cast much worse than Brazil suffered 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.240
 very much against the attack on the very first 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.159
 time against france attacked france 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 there was a danger when France was 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.330
 up to as Brazil did today 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.010
 Germany took more danger to France not 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.290
 created absolutely nothing 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.869
 that is, the coach had to look at two 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.549
 things that made germany during the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.140
 Cupcakes and what did Brazil do? 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.750
 anyway soccer coach 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 brazil that felipão wanted to see marking the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.960
 as he did in the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.090
 Confederations against Spain did not do 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.759
 this and no games did not have an acting 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.020
 of 90 minutes then the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.150
 coach had to do 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.310
 on one side like playing in the other teams 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.110
 eternal from Brazil, I wrote back 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 about this before the game is not is not is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 human is a magic or reinforce the cast 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.710
 I would have put three flyers to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 reset the three players of the 4 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.509
 2 3 1 The German is for the people 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.369
 midfielder to use three players from 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.909
 velocity when retrieving the ball as 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.610
 holland was bernard william and was 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.229
 Hulk was not Fred who arrived in the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.000
 world and the world cup without having 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.340
 actually entered it because not fred 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.049
 He has speed and that player and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.729
 centerpiece that acts on the back of the show 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.009
 stadium to see the ball in front of 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.140
 the defenders because there a game in the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.920
 eddie's backs the other tries to use the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.660
 space the year 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.000
 that's because he does not advance and leaves the ball 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.090
 germany recovers the ball against attack 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.890
 that felipão did in the game in the game and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.180
 still a space between German field 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.950
 has a better touch of the ball of the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.160
 world that the 5 there are very good at it 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.670
 to play like that, Brazil suffered 16 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.400
 goals against attacks 2 against 2 343 only tô 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.860
 marcelo with freedom there to move forward and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.269
 flamenco of who plays of the marcello miller 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.880
 Then it is to ask the felipão then asked that the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.910
 Brazil lost the game to defeat by 7 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.420
 goals there, I think it's in the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.680
 and game proposal is in reais 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.019
 huh 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.870
 say to be gentle is devoid of 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.940
 intelligence observed that it happened in 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.280
 world cup and also in the poor performance of 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.299
 several players who started out as 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.440
 take the goals 2 to 0 were getting lost 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.340
 psychologically and germany left 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.780
 emotionally physically 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.620
 technically that's why Brasil took 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.269
 seven goals 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.400
 now a seven-year rout and not 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.609
 can explain in detail the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.829
 Brazil again I repeat never had 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.450
 seven goals in all history is 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.519
 a sincere request from Uruguay once 6 a 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.959
 1 of argentina today took seven when 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.950
 You take the biggest thrashing in history. 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.680
 has a culprit 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.680
 now the head who was the mentor of this 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.579
 The whole situation of leaving brazil exposed 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.019
 and try to do what he does not 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.040
 achieved during the world cup 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.040
 It was exactly the felipão
