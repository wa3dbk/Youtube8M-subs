most of them I could not find in any of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.190 
most of them I could not find in any of
our<00:01:23.280> reports<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:23.939> said<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.780> were

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
our reports they said that they were

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
our reports they said that they were
afraid<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.530> repercussions<00:01:25.799> though<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.640> like

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
afraid of repercussions though like like

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.880 
afraid of repercussions though like like
the<00:01:27.090> woman<00:01:27.630> who<00:01:27.840> had<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> chair<00:01:28.470> thrown<00:01:28.740> at

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the woman who had that chair thrown at

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.429 
the woman who had that chair thrown at
her<00:01:28.979> last<00:01:29.220> year<00:01:29.520> by<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> student<00:01:30.060> she<00:01:30.750> had<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> go

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
her last year by a student she had to go

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.840 
her last year by a student she had to go
through<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> disciplinary<00:01:32.430> hearing<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
through a disciplinary hearing and I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.160 
through a disciplinary hearing and I
think<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.689> were<00:01:33.810> saying<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
think that that they were saying that

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.830 
think that that they were saying that
they're<00:01:34.829> concerned<00:01:35.250> about<00:01:35.840> reporting

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
they're concerned about reporting

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.030 
they're concerned about reporting
something<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> sudden

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
something and now now all of a sudden

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
something and now now all of a sudden
they're<00:01:38.280> being<00:01:38.579> disciplined<00:01:38.939> right<00:01:39.720> well

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
they're being disciplined right well

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
they're being disciplined right well
there<00:01:39.960> certainly<00:01:40.140> wouldn't<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.680> any

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
there certainly wouldn't be any

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.469 
there certainly wouldn't be any
repercussions<00:01:41.100> against<00:01:41.970> teachers<00:01:42.119> again

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
repercussions against teachers again

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.880 
repercussions against teachers again
like<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.899> said<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:43.710> think

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
like I just said it but you would think

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
like I just said it but you would think
that<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.759> wasn't<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.329> happened

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that but then that wasn't what happened

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.380 
that but then that wasn't what happened
last<00:01:45.750> year<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.200> well<00:01:47.040> there's<00:01:47.220> 26<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
last year right well there's 26 like I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
last year right well there's 26 like I
said<00:01:48.450> faculty<00:01:49.140> advisory<00:01:49.649> committees<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
said faculty advisory committees and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.490 
said faculty advisory committees and
there<00:01:51.119> are<00:01:51.240> reports<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:51.750> every<00:01:51.960> single<00:01:52.140> school

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
there are reports at every single school

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.139 
there are reports at every single school
so<00:01:52.740> there<00:01:52.890> certainly<00:01:53.040> aren't<00:01:53.430> repercussions

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
so there certainly aren't repercussions

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.700 
so there certainly aren't repercussions
that<00:01:54.299> ever<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.079> not<00:01:55.439> you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
that ever you know that's just not you

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.190 
that ever you know that's just not you
can<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.790> understand<00:01:57.299> why<00:01:57.360> they'd<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.750> fearful

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
can you understand why they'd be fearful

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.340 
can you understand why they'd be fearful
of<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.820> what<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> can't<00:02:00.240> understand<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.290> why

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
of them what I can't understand is why

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350 
of them what I can't understand is why
they<00:02:01.950> wouldn't<00:02:02.250> report<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> their

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

year<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.370> don't<00:02:24.550> think<00:02:24.700> that's<00:02:24.910> accurate

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
year and I don't think that's accurate

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.390 
year and I don't think that's accurate
but<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.750> Carolee<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.800> that's<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.100> hundred

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
but I Carolee know that's a hundred

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.370 
but I Carolee know that's a hundred
percent<00:02:27.459> accurate<00:02:27.970> that's<00:02:28.180> fact<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.900> mean<00:02:29.230> when

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
percent accurate that's fact I mean when

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.140 
percent accurate that's fact I mean when
that<00:02:29.530> happened<00:02:30.010> there<00:02:30.370> was<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.550> disciplinary

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
last year alright can you see why that

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.500 
last year alright can you see why that
would<00:02:41.770> be<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> deterrent<00:02:42.310> for<00:02:42.640> people<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.180> come

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
would be a deterrent for people to come

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.270 
would be a deterrent for people to come
forward<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:43.959> talk<00:02:44.319> about<00:02:44.470> attacks<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.130> year

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
what I can't see is why that would be a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.420 
what I can't see is why that would be a
deterrent<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.970> uh<00:02:50.160> report<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.310> your
