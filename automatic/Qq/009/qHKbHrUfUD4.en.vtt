00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hi everybody 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.040
 it's steven and today I'm you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.410
 presents a new cydia tweak that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.820
 is called nice remy who's who 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 really excellent you'll see it 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 since looking slipping from the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.460
 edge of the screen I can easily 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.240
 access to my latest applications 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.430
 open 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 it's super convenient it works but 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 for all on the screen there for example on 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.439
 the top it splits in two and leaves 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.599
 appear but last four 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.429
 open applications and then if 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.779
 I open the settings and I'll have 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.669
 now five applications 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.100
 the tweak can display at least one 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.380
 maximum 5 so the age and settings 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.829
 the video the music the weather and the game 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.840
 center 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.940
 So here is how it works 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.559
 slide from one of the edges and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.570
 the screen opens in half to let 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.100
 to appear the applications that does not prevent 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.870
 absolutely no change of page you 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.320
 see it and as I told you that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.399
 walk everywhere on all pages 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 so this tweak is finally going to you 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.270
 allow to switch easily between 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.100
 your apps openly 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.750
 even when you are inside 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.399
 this one you see it there in the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.470
 music I can easily go 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.820
 in settings for example so 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.229
 now you do not have to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.390
 need to return to the screen 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.770
 home to change application 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.750
 you use the tweak that's a lot 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.040
 faster and what is excellent that 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.770
 it also works on the screen 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 locked watch the tweak will split 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.920
 the screen in half to show you the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 applications lately open 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.549
 in fact he will take the maximum 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.860
 last five apps that get 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.780
 find in your multitasking and you 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.250
 display like these on the screen of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.229
 lock inside the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.150
 applications or even on your screen 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.049
 Home 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.340
 then for those sows that you go 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.030
 to see it we have a lot of options 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.680
 configuration 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.450
 so you go to the settings 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.040
 in the cydia tweaks section and in 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.350
 that of rÃ©my nice shot there we have three 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.880
 sections we will start with this one the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.649
 first option allows you to activate or 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.509
 to disable the tweak if you ever 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.790
 do not want to use it anymore and then 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.740
 next if you are right-handed or left-handed 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.659
 you will be able to choose the meaning of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.310
 slips to activate the tweak so 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.880
 there it was right-handed from the right 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.799
 towards the left 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.240
 if I choose left-handed it will be 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.009
 the left to the right 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 so the meaning is different depending if 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.549
 you choose one or the other following 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.140
 if you are right-handed or left-handed you 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.009
 check one or the other it's really 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.039
 as you prefer 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.420
 I prefer that meaning by slipping 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.230
 the right to the left of the screen I 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.430
 find that it is 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.220
 practice so it's this one that I'm going 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.629
 use that's how it works the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.340
 first activation method so it's 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.260
 this one but you can also checked 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.090
 this one this time it will be necessary for you 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.159
 see slipped from the top to the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.290
 down from one of the edges of the screen 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.640
 so me it will be the right edge seen all to 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.200
 the hour I had checked right 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.000
 if you tick left you have to press 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.959
 on the left edge of the screen one 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.819
 continues in the panel of 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.650
 configuration and the next option is going 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.150
 allow you to disable the tweak 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.829
 in some of your applications 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.140
 so just check it by 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.790
 example here the calculator so here it 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 will mean that the tweak will not work 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.870
 more in the calculators app 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.000
 bones I have beautiful slipped as much as I 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.920
 want it will not work at all 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.599
 unable to activate the tweak in the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.140
 applications would have ticked you here in 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.609
 The settings 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.129
 you see that if I uncheck the 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.510
 calculator and I retry game can bel 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.819
 and activated the tweak 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.980
 so you have the list of everything that 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.359
 is installed on your device and for 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.440
 practical reasons if you want that 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.400
 the tweak does not work in 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.739
 some applications 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.239
 well you coachmen finally if you 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.129
 you feel like you can assign a 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.849
 activator gesture high week activating 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.319
 the last option 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.579
 I do not recommend it 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.530
 a lot of fluid and we're going 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.290
 interest here animations 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.760
 there for now I checked pocket you 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.359
 see how it looks if I check 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.069
 flat 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.750
 the animation is a little different 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.150
 you see we have a sliding panel 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.590
 on the screen and for this flat animation 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.519
 we have several other effects that are 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.650
 available here 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.510
 hop it will be a slip up 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.120
 crazy as its name indicated it will be 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.790
 down and finally if I tick spitz 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.660
 it'll cut in half like these 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.099
 see so again this is 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.900
 really like you want you tick 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.569
 the facts you prefer 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.880
 I prefer to use pocket this effect 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.620
 there that makes a sort of gap of 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.760
 the screen you saw it on it's the one 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.620
 that I prefer and that I use 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.359
 then we can also play on the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.819
 size of the icons there they will be 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.169
 much bigger so I prefer 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.000
 rather than at the fai's called 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.349
 big or icons are smaller 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.519
 more discreet 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.590
 by checking this one I think it's 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.970
 really too big and then same thing 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.280
 for the name of the icons could also 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.900
 change his style to continue in 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.160
 the configuration of the tweak we will go to 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.560
 the next section that will us 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.880
 allow to change the appearance 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.280
 the first option you see it goes 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.390
 allow to blur the background you 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.130
 see that the back of my application 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.460
 and a lot 1 is that just now 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.169
 you can activate this fsi 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.789
 you like it and it will work in 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.220
 all the apps here in the 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.949
 music here in the calculator the 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.569
 fund is blurry and second option that's fine 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.110
 display a darkening in 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.759
 background 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.830
 that's what it gives so you can 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.750
 the handset also to the blur I find that 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.060
 it's pretty cool as is done and I 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.800
 will keep this one can also play 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.630
 on the sharpness of the icons by checking 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.069
 this option you see it's a 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.930
 a little less clear from just now 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.800
 same thing for the apps name 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.330
 if it is activated 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.729
 so I'm going to activate it anyway 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.680
 done here so the age shows the names of the 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.270
 applications that's how it gets 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.099
 present now you have the name 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.020
 displayed below the icon of 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.360
 applications so there the settings the 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.060
 calculator music video weather 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.770
 that's how it works and the a7 and in 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.669
 down one can also the displayed in water this 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.560
 name if you feel like it 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.000
 I think that the display is not 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.650
 necessarily a good idea you have you 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.150
 seeing that it exceeds a little I prefer 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.460
 rather disable this name from 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.259
 applications finally last options 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.849
 customizable it's the bottom in 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.190
 ticking linden that's what it gave 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.630
 so far with color it will be gray 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.949
 so what's practical is that in 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.070
 ticking color you have the option 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.050
 here to configure yourself the colors 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.400
 of background so you move the 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.500
 little slider you have below in 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.220
 down a color palette really 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.590
 very complete 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.360
 I choose red pressed on save 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.389
 and then I choose the second 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.789
 color I'm going to take purple I 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.690
 backup and then these games reactive 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.250
 the tweak 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.830
 look, we see that the fund has changed 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.180
 it is now exactly purple red 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.820
 as I had it set up so that 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.199
 works perfectly everywhere and following 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.550
 the theme you use that can 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.949
 really give something rather 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.909
 pretty here I'm lucky it's pretty 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.680
 well with my theme 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.969
 So that's really like you 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.009
 want to either choose a color 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.570
 custom be you use the bottom 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.340
 linden which is available in the 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.110
 settings it's really like you 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.090
 prefer 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.039
 this tweak it's called so remy nice that 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.889
 it is available on the cydia store at 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.080
 price of a dollar 99 on the source of big 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.940
 boss and he will allow you as I 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.139
 wanted to show to cut your screen in 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.300
 two to bring up the 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.860
 recently used apps you 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.050
 to launch them very well 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.000
 easily like this you slip on 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.320
 one of the edges of the screen you view 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 this new little menu that appears as 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.040
 that's it so I repeat it's really 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.720
 something that I find excellent 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.640
 super convenient it really helps 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.050
 save time in some cases so 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.880
 here for me a tweak really very 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.860
 good you tell me what you have 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.690
