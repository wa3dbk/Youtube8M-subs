Grace<00:02:35.870> was<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> most<00:02:36.410> favorable<00:02:36.920> choice<00:02:37.160> and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
Grace was the most favorable choice and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.400 
Grace was the most favorable choice and
so<00:02:38.030> yes<00:02:38.270> he<00:02:38.420> goes<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.810> Zurich<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.230> he

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
so yes he goes to Zurich and I he

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.020 
so yes he goes to Zurich and I he
intimidates<00:02:39.860> me<00:02:39.950> also<00:02:40.220> but<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.760> okay

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
intimidates me also but it's okay

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.520 
intimidates me also but it's okay
because<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.420> do<00:02:41.480> believe<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.959> have<00:02:42.170> at<00:02:42.349> least

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
because I do believe I have at least

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.510 
because I do believe I have at least
plus<00:02:43.120> either<00:02:44.120> two<00:02:44.480> or<00:02:44.780> three<00:02:45.020> right<00:02:45.140> now<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:46.430> it

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
plus either two or three right now so it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.830 
plus either two or three right now so it
doesn't<00:02:46.580> matter<00:02:46.880> too<00:02:47.090> much<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.569> go<00:02:47.720> for

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
doesn't matter too much so I go for

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.479 
doesn't matter too much so I go for
helping<00:02:48.140> hand<00:02:48.319> boost<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.709> earthquake<00:02:49.220> takes

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
helping hand boost the earthquake takes

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.460 
helping hand boost the earthquake takes
out<00:02:49.640> everything<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.840> he<00:02:50.989> goes<00:02:51.170> into<00:02:51.319> his

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
out everything and that he goes into his

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.500 
out everything and that he goes into his
elements<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.010> his<00:02:52.130> bride<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.400> these<00:02:53.330> two

elements and his bride on these two

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.550 
elements and his bride on these two
things<00:02:53.750> are<00:02:53.900> kind<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.080> gonna<00:02:54.170> be<00:02:54.260> an<00:02:54.410> issue

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
things are kind of gonna be an issue

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.680 
things are kind of gonna be an issue
because<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.160> can't<00:02:55.610> go<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:55.970> rock<00:02:56.150> slide<00:02:56.330> and

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
because I can't go for a rock slide and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.479 
because I can't go for a rock slide and
kill<00:02:57.170> both<00:02:57.440> or<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.830> can't<00:02:58.100> go<00:02:58.220> for<00:02:58.400> an
