feels<00:00:20.180> incredibly<00:00:21.180> light<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:21.810> it's

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
feels incredibly light actually it's

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.480 
feels incredibly light actually it's
almost<00:00:22.140> bizarrely<00:00:22.650> light<00:00:22.980> when<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.160> picked<00:00:23.400> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
almost bizarrely light when I picked it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.620 
almost bizarrely light when I picked it
up<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.699> almost<00:00:23.880> dropped<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.330> because<00:00:24.420> I

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
up I almost dropped it because I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.970 
up I almost dropped it because I
expected<00:00:25.109> more<00:00:25.170> weight<00:00:25.500> than<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> actually

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
expected more weight than is actually

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.670 
expected more weight than is actually
here<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.869> doesn't<00:00:27.960> mean<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.439> you

the operating system the big story today
is<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> hardware<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> say<00:01:34.710> it's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
is the hardware and have to say it's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.730 
is the hardware and have to say it's
definitely<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.960> an<00:01:37.079> evolution<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.680> terms

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
definitely it is an evolution in terms

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
definitely it is an evolution in terms
of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> design<00:01:38.159> language<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> spoke<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
noticed is the detail on this the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120 
noticed is the detail on this the
machined<00:01:57.689> edges<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.560> heard<00:01:58.950> somebody

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
machined edges of this I heard somebody

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.289 
machined edges of this I heard somebody
