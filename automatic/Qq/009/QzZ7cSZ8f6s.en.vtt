to learn how to draw stick figures

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.839 
to learn how to draw stick figures
because<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.960> know<00:00:25.080> these<00:00:25.230> little<00:00:25.380> guys<00:00:25.650> that

everyone does when they're a little kid
you<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.710> draw<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.130> head<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:30.029> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
you just draw a little head with this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179 
you just draw a little head with this
little<00:00:30.420> arm<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.230> he's<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.470> cute<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
legs and that's a stick figure but it's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
legs and that's a stick figure but it's
actually<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> good<00:00:38.969> representation<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.960> how

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
actually a good representation of how

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.630 
actually a good representation of how
you're<00:00:40.290> gonna<00:00:40.379> start<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.100> draw<00:00:41.399> how

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you're gonna start out to draw how

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.130 
you're gonna start out to draw how
you're<00:00:41.790> gonna<00:00:41.879> learn<00:00:42.180> how<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.480> draw<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> human

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you're gonna learn how to draw the human

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.430 
you're gonna learn how to draw the human
figure<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.379> we're<00:00:46.379> gonna

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
figure and like with this we're gonna

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.470 
figure and like with this we're gonna
start<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.280> head<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.450> a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
start out with the head just like a

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.119 
start out with the head just like a
little<00:00:48.780> kid<00:00:48.989> would<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.739> time<00:00:50.010> we're

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
little kid would but this time we're

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.410 
little kid would but this time we're
going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> draw<00:00:50.430> an<00:00:50.550> oval<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.210> gonna<00:00:51.300> be

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
going to draw an oval it's not gonna be

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.529 
going to draw an oval it's not gonna be
perfectly<00:00:51.870> round<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.340> an<00:00:53.430> oval<00:00:53.969> because

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
perfectly round so be an oval because

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.389 
perfectly round so be an oval because
that's<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.620> human<00:00:56.070> head<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
that's more what the human head is

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.310 
that's more what the human head is
shaped<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.850> now<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> last<00:00:57.899> lesson<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
shaped like now in the last lesson I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
shaped like now in the last lesson I
kind<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.620> went<00:00:58.770> over<00:00:58.829> recognizing<00:00:59.640> shapes<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
kind of went over recognizing shapes and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.639 
kind of went over recognizing shapes and
I'm<00:01:00.180> gonna<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.750> bit<00:01:00.899> more<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.320> depth

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
I'm gonna go a little bit more in depth

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
I'm gonna go a little bit more in depth
in<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> show<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:02.940> how<00:01:03.420> these<00:01:03.690> shapes

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
in this and show you how these shapes

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.760 
in this and show you how these shapes
stack<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> human<00:01:05.309> body<00:01:05.489> now<00:01:06.619> when<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
stack up with a human body now when you

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.469 
stack up with a human body now when you
start<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> shapes<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.030> human

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
start out with the shapes with the human

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.030 
start out with the shapes with the human
body<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.350> first<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.860> draw

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
body what you want to do first is draw

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
body what you want to do first is draw
the<00:01:11.100> head<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> head<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.570> where

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the head because from the head is where

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.990 
the head because from the head is where
you<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> proportions<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> rest<00:01:14.850> of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you get the proportions for the rest of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.080 
you get the proportions for the rest of
the<00:01:15.750> rest<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> body<00:01:16.430> all<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:17.880> once

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the rest of the body all right now once

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.960 
the rest of the body all right now once
you've<00:01:18.299> drawn<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> head<00:01:19.100> next<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.700> use

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you've drawn the head next is to use

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.719 
you've drawn the head next is to use
that<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.630> create<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.290> heights<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.520> rest

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that to create the heights of the rest

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.060 
that to create the heights of the rest
of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> body<00:01:24.350> typically<00:01:25.350> people<00:01:25.710> will<00:01:25.890> tell

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
of the body typically people will tell

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.710 
of the body typically people will tell
you<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> human<00:01:26.790> body<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> seven<00:01:27.540> heads

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you that a human body is seven heads

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
you that a human body is seven heads
tall<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.320> we're<00:01:28.470> gonna<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> rule

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
tall so we're gonna go with that rule

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420 
tall so we're gonna go with that rule
and<00:01:30.049> this<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.200> how<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> did<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> when<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> first

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and this is how I did it when I first

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.920 
and this is how I did it when I first
started<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:32.909> some<00:01:33.270> people<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:33.600> tell<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
started out some people will tell you to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.450 
started out some people will tell you to
get<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> ruler<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> tell

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
get out the ruler I'm not going to tell

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920 
get out the ruler I'm not going to tell
you<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> I'm<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.299> tell<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> how

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you to do that I'm going to tell you how

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.740 
you to do that I'm going to tell you how
to<00:01:36.990> approximate<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.659> you're

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
to approximate it because when you're

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.600 
to approximate it because when you're
typically<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:40.710> drawing<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.579> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
typically when I'm drawing a lot of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.210 
typically when I'm drawing a lot of
times<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.090> don't<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> ruler<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.409> me<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
times I don't have a ruler with me or I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.520 
times I don't have a ruler with me or I
don't<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.090> anything<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.869> measure<00:01:46.170> with

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
don't have anything to measure with
