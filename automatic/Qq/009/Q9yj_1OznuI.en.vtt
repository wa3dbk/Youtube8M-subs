something<00:01:21.660> for<00:01:22.020> desktop<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:23.240> thought<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
something for desktop I thought this is

something for desktop I thought this is
going<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.080> fun

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
going to be fun

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.740

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979

it's I think the best sounding plug-in
on<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.280> market<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> moment<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.690> know<00:01:36.750> them
