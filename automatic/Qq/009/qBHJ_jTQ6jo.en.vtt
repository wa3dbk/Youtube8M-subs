way<00:00:56.070> shape<00:00:56.340> or<00:00:56.489> form<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> let's<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.350> start

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
way shape or form so let's just start

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.299 
way shape or form so let's just start
with<00:00:58.649> our<00:00:58.770> shape<00:01:00.289> this<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.980> that's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
with our shape this one here that's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.270 
with our shape this one here that's
wrong<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.260> three<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:04.890> from<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
wrong we want to go three back from the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
wrong we want to go three back from the
wall<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.119> then<00:01:06.479> we're<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.810> want<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> go

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
wall and then we're going to want to go

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
wall and then we're going to want to go
one<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.479> back

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
one right here and then we want to back

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.590 
one right here and then we want to back
as<00:01:09.900> well<00:01:10.110> again<00:01:10.740> remember<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.880> keep<00:01:12.090> them<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
as well again remember to keep them a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
as well again remember to keep them a
good<00:01:12.930> distance<00:01:13.140> away<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.740> these<00:01:14.010> two

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
good distance away so that these two

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.030 
good distance away so that these two
redstone<00:01:14.490> lines<00:01:14.939> don't<00:01:15.180> touch<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.710> pretty

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
redstone lines don't touch it is pretty

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.260 
redstone lines don't touch it is pretty
straightforward<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.939> point<00:01:18.150> forward

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
straightforward from that point forward

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.429 
straightforward from that point forward
so<00:01:18.689> let's<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.080> grab<00:01:19.259> our<00:01:19.470> repeaters

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
so let's just grab our repeaters

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.219 
so let's just grab our repeaters
repeater<00:01:22.439> repeater<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.869> then<00:01:24.869> right<00:01:25.080> back

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
repeater repeater and then right back

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.460 
repeater repeater and then right back
here<00:01:25.500> repeater<00:01:26.479> switch<00:01:27.479> over<00:01:27.780> grab<00:01:28.080> yourself

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
here repeater switch over grab yourself

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.420 
here repeater switch over grab yourself
a<00:01:29.479> sticky<00:01:30.479> piston<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.320> throw<00:01:32.009> your<00:01:32.100> sticky

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
a sticky piston and throw your sticky

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.450 
a sticky piston and throw your sticky
piston<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.360> as<00:01:33.540> well<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.829> block<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
piston on there as well as a block of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.120 
piston on there as well as a block of
choice<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.619> throw<00:01:37.829> some

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
choice on there and then just throw some

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.700 
choice on there and then just throw some
netherrack<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.970> there<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.810> let's<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.530> grab

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
netherrack on there so let's just grab

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.770 
netherrack on there so let's just grab
our<00:01:40.950> dispensers<00:01:41.579> pretty<00:01:41.939> easy<00:01:42.150> stuff<00:01:42.329> from

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
our dispensers pretty easy stuff from

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.960 
our dispensers pretty easy stuff from
this<00:01:42.960> point<00:01:43.170> forward<00:01:44.210> dispensa<00:01:45.210> Lord

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
this point forward dispensa Lord

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.319 
this point forward dispensa Lord
dispenser<00:01:47.970> or<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:49.189> fly<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> sky<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.939> you

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
and half of them in here and look at

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.390 
and half of them in here and look at
that<00:02:10.820> grab<00:02:11.420> some<00:02:11.630> right<00:02:11.810> stone<00:02:12.080> dust<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.770> dust

know<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.650> think<00:03:54.980> on<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:55.250> one<00:03:55.310> here<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.880> could

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
know I think on this one here you could

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.240 
know I think on this one here you could
even<00:03:56.180> if<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:57.080> wanted<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.470> go<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:57.799> far<00:03:57.830> as<00:03:58.130> to

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
even if you wanted to go so far as to

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.130 
even if you wanted to go so far as to
you<00:03:58.910> could<00:03:59.120> hook<00:03:59.239> this<00:03:59.420> up<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.750> daylight

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
you could hook this up to a daylight

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.500
