x2 I'm kind of comparing this against my
DSLR<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.660> Canon<00:00:13.049> 7d<00:00:14.150> my<00:00:15.150> main<00:00:15.360> concern<00:00:15.750> was

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
DSLR it's a Canon 7d my main concern was

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.730 
DSLR it's a Canon 7d my main concern was
you<00:00:17.760> know<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> compare<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you know is this going to compare to the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.630 
you know is this going to compare to the
quality<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> 7d<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:23.160> short<00:00:23.369> answer

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
quality of the 7d and the short answer

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.420 
quality of the 7d and the short answer
is<00:00:23.670> yes<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:25.619> know<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.980> something<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.310> I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
is yes you know this is something that I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.390 
is yes you know this is something that I
would<00:00:26.550> definitely<00:00:26.820> switch<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.800> I'll<00:00:29.189> go

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
would definitely switch to so I'll go

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.070 
would definitely switch to so I'll go
over<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.550> couple<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> downsides<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.810> found

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
over a couple of the downsides I found

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.280 
over a couple of the downsides I found
first<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.880> guess<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.210> biggest<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.719> far<00:00:33.930> was<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
first I guess the biggest so far was the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.709 
first I guess the biggest so far was the
grip<00:00:34.730> it's<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> pretty<00:00:35.940> small<00:00:36.059> grip<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
grip it's a pretty small grip this is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.270 
grip it's a pretty small grip this is
kind<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> thumb<00:00:37.380> catch<00:00:37.710> you've<00:00:37.950> got<00:00:38.129> on

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
kind of the thumb catch you've got on

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.930 
kind of the thumb catch you've got on
here<00:00:39.469> not<00:00:40.469> very<00:00:40.680> big<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.760> come

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
here not very big I know that they come

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
here not very big I know that they come
you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.450> buy<00:00:42.629> an<00:00:42.840> extra<00:00:43.230> piece<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:43.890> go

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you can buy an extra piece that will go

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.850 
you can buy an extra piece that will go
into<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:45.079> mount<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.530> then<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.739> goes

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
into the mount here and then it goes

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.119 
into the mount here and then it goes
across<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.530> definitely

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
across so if you get this out definitely

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.060 
across so if you get this out definitely
invest<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.660> well<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> grip<00:00:52.800> right

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
invest in that as well as the grip right

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.950 
invest in that as well as the grip right
here<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> grip<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.480> screws<00:00:54.930> into

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
here you can get a grip that screws into

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.900 
here you can get a grip that screws into
the<00:00:55.320> bottom<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> hole<00:00:57.410> and

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
the bottom just right in the hole and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.700 
the bottom just right in the hole and
it'll<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> grip<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:00.870> bigger

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it'll make the grip a little bit bigger

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
it'll make the grip a little bit bigger
for<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> that's<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.629> also

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
weather sealing I noticed a couple

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
weather sealing I noticed a couple
places<00:01:07.280> for<00:01:08.280> example<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.950> then

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
places for example right here and then

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770 
places for example right here and then
some<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:11.909> wheels<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.540> mean<00:01:12.659> this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
some of the other wheels I mean this

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.179 
some of the other wheels I mean this
isn't<00:01:13.080> meant<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.350> weather<00:01:13.619> sealed<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.040> all

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
isn't meant to be weather sealed at all

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.280 
isn't meant to be weather sealed at all
but<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.909> type<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> photography<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.930> I'm

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
don't worry about you know tilt screens

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
don't worry about you know tilt screens
at<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> wouldn't<00:01:34.439> even<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.549> hesitate

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
at all I wouldn't even you know hesitate

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.080 
at all I wouldn't even you know hesitate
because<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.829> so<00:01:37.829> that's<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.310> those<00:01:38.970> are

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
because of that so that's that those are

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.120 
because of that so that's that those are
just<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> downsides<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:40.380> very<00:01:40.590> many<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.009> my

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
just the downsides not very many in my

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.730 
just the downsides not very many in my
opinion<00:01:41.960> some<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> things<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.380> loved<00:01:43.619> about

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
opinion some of the things I loved about

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.460 
opinion some of the things I loved about
it<00:01:43.890> were<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> size<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.790> course<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.990> pretty

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it were the size of course it's pretty

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.010 
it were the size of course it's pretty
it's<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.369> small<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> lot<00:01:48.810> lighter

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it's pretty small and it's a lot lighter

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
it's pretty small and it's a lot lighter
than<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.320> thought<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> would<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
than I thought it would be as well I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.060 
than I thought it would be as well I
know<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.450> top<00:01:51.720> part<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.380> made<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
know the top part right here is made of

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.990 
know the top part right here is made of
metal<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:55.079> guess<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> top<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
metal so I guess the top here and then I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.760 
metal so I guess the top here and then I
believe<00:01:57.479> possibly<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> front<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
believe possibly the front I know the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.789 
believe possibly the front I know the
bottom<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.930> think<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.140> plastic<00:02:01.590> or

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
bottom is not I think it was plastic or

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.090 
bottom is not I think it was plastic or
something<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> size<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.920> weight

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
something and so the size and the weight

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.700 
something and so the size and the weight
is<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> big<00:02:05.759> advantage<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:07.079> took<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
is a big advantage I took it to a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.960 
is a big advantage I took it to a
concert<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.629> other<00:02:09.720> night<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.970> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
concert just the other night and the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.059 
concert just the other night and the
size<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.200> doesn't<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.560> doesn't<00:02:13.709> stick

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
size it just doesn't it doesn't stick

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.679 
size it just doesn't it doesn't stick
like<00:02:14.310> you're<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.939> know<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.329> a<00:02:15.359> huge

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
like you're you know you have a huge

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.989 
like you're you know you have a huge
DSLR<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.499> you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.400> take<00:02:17.579> pictures<00:02:17.969> and

DSLR and you can take pictures and

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.300 
DSLR and you can take pictures and
people<00:02:18.450> aren't<00:02:18.749> staring<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.379> so<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.799> was

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
people aren't staring at you so that was

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.789 
people aren't staring at you so that was
actually<00:02:20.609> pretty<00:02:20.790> nice<00:02:21.409> the<00:02:22.409> other<00:02:22.469> thing<00:02:22.709> I

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
actually pretty nice the other thing I

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.580 
actually pretty nice the other thing I
love<00:02:22.950> was<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.340> EVF<00:02:24.019> electronic<00:02:25.019> viewfinder

was<00:02:40.829> actually<00:02:41.010> really<00:02:41.400> surprised<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:42.030> was

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
was actually really surprised I was

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.670 
was actually really surprised I was
really<00:02:42.870> worried<00:02:43.109> that<00:02:43.169> it<00:02:43.319> was<00:02:43.379> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> be

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
really worried that it was going to be

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.250 
really worried that it was going to be
kind<00:02:43.889> of<00:02:43.950> laggy<00:02:44.569> but<00:02:45.569> turns<00:02:45.810> out<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.139> was

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
kind of laggy but turns out it was

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
kind of laggy but turns out it was
actually<00:02:46.560> really<00:02:46.739> fast<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:47.819> my<00:02:47.909> biggest

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
actually really fast that was my biggest

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.709 
actually really fast that was my biggest
concern<00:02:48.650> but<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.829> plenty<00:02:50.099> fast<00:02:50.310> for<00:02:50.639> me<00:02:50.760> so

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:51.719 
concern but it's plenty fast for me so

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.240 
concern but it's plenty fast for me so
that's<00:02:51.930> that's<00:02:52.290> not<00:02:52.469> a<00:02:52.500> concern<00:02:52.829> for<00:02:52.949> me

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
that's that's not a concern for me

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.610 
that's that's not a concern for me
