00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
nine for them it could have been a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
nine for them it could have been a
symbol<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.170> their<00:01:16.500> peoples<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.250> well<00:01:17.430> their

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
symbol of their peoples in well their

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
symbol of their peoples in well their
country<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:19.380> could<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.650> been<00:01:19.680> anything<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
country it could have been anything and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.160 
country it could have been anything and
that<00:01:21.330> looks<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.630> there's<00:01:21.900> some<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.140> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that looks like there's some kind of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.649 
that looks like there's some kind of
reflection<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> middle<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.030> circle

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
reflection in the middle of this circle

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.340 
reflection in the middle of this circle
like<00:01:25.049> there<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> dome<00:01:26.189> over<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.790> very

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
like there is a dome over it very

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
like there is a dome over it very
difficult<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> Mariner<00:01:30.150> 7

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
difficult to see but the Mariner 7

photos are special how special these are
the<00:01:33.659> ones<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.170> even<00:01:35.070> astronauts<00:01:35.579> themselves

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the ones that even astronauts themselves

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.289 
the ones that even astronauts themselves
have<00:01:36.689> been<00:01:36.900> quoted<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.530> saying<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.299> NASA

one<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.250> those<00:01:50.369> amazing<00:01:50.930> anomalies<00:01:52.280> now<00:01:53.509> let's

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
one of those amazing anomalies now let's

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.120 
one of those amazing anomalies now let's
look<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.110> program<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.920> called

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
look at this program is called

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.370 
look at this program is called
photoscape<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.509> right<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:58.079> in

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
photoscape as you see right up here in

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.880 
photoscape as you see right up here in
the<00:01:58.710> corner<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.570> is<00:02:00.570> pretty<00:02:01.290> amazing

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the corner and is pretty amazing

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.520 
the corner and is pretty amazing
actually<00:02:02.450> I'm<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.810> come<00:02:03.990> down<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
actually I'm going to come down here to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.779 
actually I'm going to come down here to
adjust<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.090> level<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.459> let's<00:02:08.459> come<00:02:08.729> down

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
adjust the level and let's come down

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.090 
adjust the level and let's come down
here<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> change<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:11.360> negative

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
here to change it to negative

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.500 
here to change it to negative
