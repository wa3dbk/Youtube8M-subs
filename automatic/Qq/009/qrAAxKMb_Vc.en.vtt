and<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.670> true<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> evo<00:00:39.570> shift<00:00:39.600> doesn't

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and it's true that the evo shift doesn't

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720 
and it's true that the evo shift doesn't
have<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> couple<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> higher-end<00:00:41.100> features

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
have a couple of the higher-end features

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.630 
have a couple of the higher-end features
but<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> still<00:00:42.750> got<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> lot<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.829> I'm

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
but it still got a lot going for it I'm

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.729 
but it still got a lot going for it I'm
going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> start<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> design<00:00:45.600> first<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
going to start with the design first the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
going to start with the design first the
evo<00:00:47.039> shift<00:00:47.070> has<00:00:47.640> some<00:00:47.850> similarities<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
evo shift has some similarities to the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.920 
evo shift has some similarities to the
HTC<00:00:49.289> evo<00:00:49.680> 4g<00:00:49.940> like<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> four<00:00:51.270> touch<00:00:51.510> sensitive

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
HTC evo 4g like the four touch sensitive

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.380 
HTC evo 4g like the four touch sensitive
buttons<00:00:52.020> below<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.860> display<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.210> more

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
buttons below the display but it's more

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
buttons below the display but it's more
compact<00:00:54.870> device<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:55.920> has<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> slide-out

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
compact device and also has a slide-out

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
compact device and also has a slide-out
qwerty<00:00:56.969> keyboard<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:58.170> style<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
qwerty keyboard I know style is a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.349 
qwerty keyboard I know style is a
personal<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> happen<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
personal thing but I happen to like the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.360 
personal thing but I happen to like the
smaller<00:01:00.660> form<00:01:00.960> factor<00:01:01.020> even<00:01:01.649> though<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.190> means

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
smaller form factor even though it means

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.880 
smaller form factor even though it means
you<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> smaller<00:01:03.390> display<00:01:03.890> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you get a smaller display the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.649 
you get a smaller display the
touchscreen<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.549> still<00:01:05.850> sharp<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> bright<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
touchscreen is still sharp and bright so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.870 
touchscreen is still sharp and bright so
that<00:01:06.840> fact<00:01:07.110> wasn't<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> huge<00:01:07.920> issue<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.310> me<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that fact wasn't a huge issue for me I

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
that fact wasn't a huge issue for me I
also<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> phone<00:01:10.290> has<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.470> very

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
also like that the phone has a very

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.590 
also like that the phone has a very
solid<00:01:11.130> premium<00:01:11.580> feel<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.119> unlike<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
solid premium feel to it unlike the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.200 
solid premium feel to it unlike the
samsung<00:01:13.110> epic<00:01:13.470> 4g<00:01:13.500> which<00:01:14.250> felt<00:01:14.490> plasticky<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
samsung epic 4g which felt plasticky and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
samsung epic 4g which felt plasticky and
slick<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> say<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.040> epic<00:01:17.280> 4g

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
slick I do have to say that the epic 4g

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.280 
slick I do have to say that the epic 4g
still<00:01:17.939> has<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> better<00:01:18.330> keyboard<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
still has the better keyboard but the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
still has the better keyboard but the
evo<00:01:19.500> shift<00:01:19.530> isn't<00:01:20.009> bad<00:01:20.430> either<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.360> buttons

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
evo shift isn't bad either the buttons

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.810 
evo shift isn't bad either the buttons
are<00:01:21.810> bit<00:01:22.110> smaller<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.830> flattered<00:01:23.189> but

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
are bit smaller and flattered but

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.850 
are bit smaller and flattered but
there's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> decent<00:01:24.750> amount<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.320> space<00:01:25.500> between

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
there's a decent amount of space between

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.289 
there's a decent amount of space between
them<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> didn't<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.700> too<00:01:26.909> many<00:01:27.030> miss

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
them so I didn't have too many miss

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.569 
them so I didn't have too many miss
presses<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.409> d-pad<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> lower

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
presses the d-pad here on the lower

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.460 
presses the d-pad here on the lower
right<00:01:29.850> side<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.420> also<00:01:30.750> small<00:01:30.810> enough<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
right side is also small enough so that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.469 
right side is also small enough so that
it<00:01:31.920> doesn't<00:01:32.250> make<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.610> awkward<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it doesn't make it awkward to use the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.020 
it doesn't make it awkward to use the
keyboard<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
keyboard so I'm going back to the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.789
