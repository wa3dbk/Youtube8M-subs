00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.580 
time thinking when they didn't have it
and<00:03:32.730> before<00:03:33.329> they<00:03:33.630> had<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.959> surgery<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.440> fix

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and before they had the surgery to fix

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.349 
and before they had the surgery to fix
it<00:03:34.829> all<00:03:35.519> they<00:03:35.760> could<00:03:35.819> think<00:03:35.940> about<00:03:36.120> was<00:03:36.299> how

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
it all they could think about was how

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.319 
it all they could think about was how
they<00:03:36.569> were<00:03:36.660> supposed<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.200> look<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:38.329> every

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
they were supposed to look and every

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.420 
they were supposed to look and every
time<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.840> get<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.079> new<00:03:40.319> piercing<00:03:40.620> or<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.099> stretch

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
time I get a new piercing or I stretch

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.170 
time I get a new piercing or I stretch
my<00:03:41.519> ears<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.849> size<00:03:42.060> bigger<00:03:42.090> or<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:43.049> do<00:03:43.500> anything

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
my ears a size bigger or I do anything

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.490 
my ears a size bigger or I do anything
modification<00:03:45.180> wise<00:03:45.359> it<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.690> one<00:03:46.049> step<00:03:46.260> closer

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
modification wise it is one step closer

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.620 
modification wise it is one step closer
to<00:03:46.739> how<00:03:46.829> I'm<00:03:47.040> I've<00:03:47.400> always<00:03:47.669> thought<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.419> I

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
to how I'm I've always thought that I

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.229 
to how I'm I've always thought that I
should<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:49.889> know<00:03:50.250> that's<00:03:50.459> not<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.940> same

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
should be and I know that's not the same

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.909 
should be and I know that's not the same
for<00:03:51.419> a<00:03:51.480> lot<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.660> people<00:03:51.750> in<00:03:52.049> that<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.650> know<00:03:52.769> we

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
for a lot of people in that you know we

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.110 
for a lot of people in that you know we
may<00:03:53.099> be<00:03:53.160> in<00:03:53.310> minority<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.819> people<00:03:53.940> who

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
may be in minority of people who

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.349 
may be in minority of people who
modified<00:03:54.419> but<00:03:54.810> it's<00:03:55.430> we're<00:03:56.430> not<00:03:56.579> at<00:03:56.879> least<00:03:57.150> I'm

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
modified but it's we're not at least I'm

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.670 
modified but it's we're not at least I'm
not<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.629> kind<00:03:57.840> of<00:03:57.959> person<00:03:58.079> where<00:03:58.349> it's<00:03:58.500> not

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
not the kind of person where it's not

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.470 
not the kind of person where it's not
spiritual<00:03:59.220> I'm<00:03:59.370> not<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> spiritual<00:03:59.970> person<00:04:00.150> but

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
spiritual I'm not a spiritual person but

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.589 
spiritual I'm not a spiritual person but
it's<00:04:00.780> definitely<00:04:01.019> a<00:04:01.560> very<00:04:01.889> intimate<00:04:02.669> process

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
it's definitely a very intimate process

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.390 
it's definitely a very intimate process
of<00:04:03.870> getting<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.410> know<00:04:04.530> yourself<00:04:04.680> and<00:04:05.220> your

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
body and what it can do and what it

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.860 
body and what it can do and what it
can't<00:04:07.019> do<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.470> knowing<00:04:08.340> how<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.359> can<00:04:09.690> take

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
can't do and knowing how you can take

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.330 
can't do and knowing how you can take
the<00:04:09.989> steps<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.379> be<00:04:10.590> closer<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:10.949> who<00:04:11.129> you're

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
the steps to be closer to who you're

the steps to be closer to who you're
supposed<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.940> be<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.769> I<00:04:13.769> know<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.190> sounds<00:04:14.250> like

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
supposed to be and I know it sounds like

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.370 
supposed to be and I know it sounds like
bullshit<00:04:14.879> but<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.569> know<00:04:15.690> eerie<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.139> both

bullshit but you know eerie and I both

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.440 
bullshit but you know eerie and I both
are<00:04:16.440> proof<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.039> there<00:04:17.639> are<00:04:17.669> people<00:04:17.849> who<00:04:18.299> do

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
are proof that there are people who do

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.690 
are proof that there are people who do
take<00:04:19.200> modification<00:04:19.979> more<00:04:20.159> serious<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.579> then

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
take modification more serious and then

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.290 
take modification more serious and then
teenage<00:04:21.030> rebellion<00:04:21.390> or

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
which my goal is 50 so that's damn close

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.189 
which my goal is 50 so that's damn close
the<00:05:03.550> when<00:05:03.940> I<00:05:03.969> had<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.240> take<00:05:04.360> them<00:05:04.569> out<00:05:04.690> for<00:05:04.960> the

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
the when I had to take them out for the

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.510 
the when I had to take them out for the
same<00:05:05.349> reason<00:05:05.379> took<00:05:05.710> my<00:05:05.800> bridge<00:05:06.009> out<00:05:06.219> just

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
same reason took my bridge out just
