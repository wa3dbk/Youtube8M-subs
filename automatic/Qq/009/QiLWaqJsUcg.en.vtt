we actually already did this review I
wasn't<00:00:24.009> really<00:00:24.189> happy<00:00:24.460> with<00:00:24.700> it<00:00:24.820> because<00:00:24.880> I

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
wasn't really happy with it because I

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.240 
wasn't really happy with it because I
didn't<00:00:25.450> make<00:00:25.570> it<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:25.990> this<00:00:26.140> is<00:00:26.320> my<00:00:26.349> gun<00:00:26.680> so<00:00:27.039> I

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
kind of wanted to redo it because I

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.380

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
it for an extra $20 I think it is on

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.890 
it for an extra $20 I think it is on
airsoft<00:00:48.430> GI<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.760> think<00:00:49.150> I<00:00:49.210> got<00:00:49.390> this<00:00:49.510> for<00:00:49.690> about

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
airsoft GI I think I got this for about

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.670 
airsoft GI I think I got this for about
170<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:52.090> an<00:00:52.329> extra<00:00:52.570> $20<00:00:53.050> you<00:00:53.110> get<00:00:53.230> real<00:00:53.410> wood

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
170 for an extra $20 you get real wood

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.160 
170 for an extra $20 you get real wood
it's<00:00:53.980> really<00:00:54.400> just<00:00:54.850> extremely<00:00:55.630> more

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
it's really just extremely more

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.940 
it's really just extremely more
realistic<00:00:57.810> again<00:00:58.810> everything<00:00:59.500> is<00:00:59.710> metal

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
realistic again everything is metal

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.310 
realistic again everything is metal
which<00:01:00.190> means<00:01:00.430> a<00:01:00.820> little<00:01:01.300> bit<00:01:01.390> heavier<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:01.780> I

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
which means a little bit heavier so I

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.690 
which means a little bit heavier so I
think<00:01:03.130> it's<00:01:03.250> about<00:01:03.579> 7<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.809> 9<00:01:05.049> pounds<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.159> what

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
think it's about 7 to 9 pounds is what

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.819 
think it's about 7 to 9 pounds is what
I've<00:01:07.049> heard<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:10.299> not<00:01:10.420> overly<00:01:10.899> heavy<00:01:11.229> but<00:01:11.680> you

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
I've heard it's not overly heavy but you

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.649 
I've heard it's not overly heavy but you
know<00:01:11.920> it's<00:01:12.729> got<00:01:12.909> some<00:01:12.939> weight<00:01:13.210> behind<00:01:13.420> it

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
know it's got some weight behind it

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.270 
know it's got some weight behind it
alright<00:01:13.899> so<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.140> start<00:01:14.259> off<00:01:14.560> with<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:14.950> hop-up

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
alright so to start off with the hop-up

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.180 
alright so to start off with the hop-up
isn't<00:01:15.640> here<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.960> doesn't<00:01:17.290> stay<00:01:17.530> open<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:17.950> have

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
isn't here it doesn't stay open you have

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.520 
isn't here it doesn't stay open you have
to<00:01:18.340> hold<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.820> it's<00:01:19.540> like<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.690> m4<00:01:20.049> wheel

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
to hold it and it's like a m4 wheel

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.140 
to hold it and it's like a m4 wheel
based<00:01:20.830> hop-up<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:24.070> sights<00:01:24.820> are

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
based hop-up and the sights are

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.140 
based hop-up and the sights are
adjustable<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:25.960> elevation<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:27.700> windage

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
adjustable for elevation not windage

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.390 
adjustable for elevation not windage
they<00:01:28.540> don't<00:01:28.720> move<00:01:28.869> back<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.320> forth<00:01:29.590> but<00:01:30.040> it's

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
they don't move back and forth but it's

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.649 
they don't move back and forth but it's
not<00:01:30.520> really<00:01:30.700> that<00:01:30.729> big<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.000> an<00:01:31.119> issue<00:01:31.240> anyway

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
not really that big of an issue anyway

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.960 
not really that big of an issue anyway
in<00:01:32.560> world<00:01:32.920> war<00:01:33.130> ii<00:01:33.310> they<00:01:33.670> weren't<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.909> most

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
in world war ii they weren't the most

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.620 
in world war ii they weren't the most
sophisticated<00:01:34.210> back<00:01:34.900> then<00:01:36.299> charging<00:01:37.299> handle

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
sophisticated back then charging handle

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.750 
sophisticated back then charging handle
is<00:01:37.930> on<00:01:38.080> this<00:01:38.229> side<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:41.010> actually<00:01:42.010> if<00:01:42.490> you<00:01:42.610> do

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
is on this side that actually if you do

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.390 
is on this side that actually if you do
this<00:01:42.909> too<00:01:43.180> much<00:01:43.390> um<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:44.680> piece<00:01:45.130> up<00:01:45.369> here

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
this too much um this piece up here

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.870 
this too much um this piece up here
starts<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.150> like<00:01:46.330> chip<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.020> little<00:01:47.260> bit

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
starts to like chip a little bit

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.850 
starts to like chip a little bit
actually<00:01:48.880> like<00:01:49.299> broke<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.110> off<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.350> little<00:01:50.680> bit

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
actually like broke it off a little bit

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.990 
actually like broke it off a little bit
like<00:01:50.950> there's<00:01:51.220> like<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.369> piece<00:01:51.760> like<00:01:51.970> a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
like there's like a piece like a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.820 
like there's like a piece like a
millimeter<00:01:52.510> by<00:01:52.720> millimeter<00:01:52.750> that<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:53.560> broke

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
millimeter by millimeter that I broke

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.789 
millimeter by millimeter that I broke
off<00:01:54.990> again<00:01:55.990> that's<00:01:56.140> just<00:01:56.229> because<00:01:56.409> this<00:01:56.650> is

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
off again that's just because this is

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.490 
off again that's just because this is
kind<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.100> cheap<00:01:57.340> metal<00:01:57.700> but<00:01:58.240> it's<00:01:58.450> I<00:01:58.780> mean<00:01:59.290> if

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
kind of cheap metal but it's I mean if

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.560 
kind of cheap metal but it's I mean if
you<00:01:59.650> look<00:01:59.920> like<00:02:00.189> right<00:02:00.430> here<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.210> thing<00:02:01.450> is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
you look like right here the thing is

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.660 
you look like right here the thing is
beat<00:02:01.810> up<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:02.170> lot<00:02:02.439> which<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:03.070> think<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:03.460> makes

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
beat up a lot which I think just makes

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.880 
beat up a lot which I think just makes
it<00:02:03.790> look<00:02:03.939> cooler<00:02:04.210> because<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:04.900> know<00:02:04.990> as<00:02:05.200> all

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
it look cooler because you know as all

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.899 
it look cooler because you know as all
World<00:02:06.250> War<00:02:06.400> 2<00:02:06.520> guns

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
World War 2 guns

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.759 
World War 2 guns
if<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.210> ever<00:02:07.299> see<00:02:07.540> them<00:02:07.689> always<00:02:08.229> look

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
if you ever see them always look

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.859 
if you ever see them always look
destroyed<00:02:09.369> for<00:02:09.849> whatever<00:02:10.000> reason<00:02:10.450> even<00:02:10.629> if

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
destroyed for whatever reason even if

spent only like 20 dollars for it and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.340 
spent only like 20 dollars for it and
I've<00:02:34.890> heard<00:02:35.160> them<00:02:35.370> hold<00:02:35.580> about<00:02:36.140> 650<00:02:37.140> rounds

I've heard them hold about 650 rounds
which<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.830> believe<00:02:38.190> because<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.640> thing<00:02:38.820> is

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
which I believe because the thing is

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.360 
which I believe because the thing is
tremendous<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.410> also<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.800> quick<00:02:41.100> wined

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
tremendous and it also is quick wined

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.160 
tremendous and it also is quick wined
they<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.030> put<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.390> whole<00:02:42.510> tool<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.020> there

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
they just put the whole tool in there

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.660 
they just put the whole tool in there
and<00:02:43.740> turn<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:45.240> doors<00:02:45.740> open<00:02:46.740> up<00:02:46.800> there<00:02:47.070> they

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
and turn it the doors open up there they

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.240 
and turn it the doors open up there they
do<00:02:47.730> not<00:02:48.000> lock<00:02:48.450> closed<00:02:49.020> so<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.740> can<00:02:50.100> get

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
do not lock closed so if you can get

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.890 
do not lock closed so if you can get
around<00:02:50.370> while<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.240> bee<00:02:51.390> bees<00:02:51.570> are<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.720> there

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
around while the bee bees are in there

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.900 
around while the bee bees are in there
it'll<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.380> go<00:02:52.500> flying<00:02:52.860> out<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.580> go<00:02:53.730> all<00:02:53.820> over

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
it'll just go flying out and go all over

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.310 
it'll just go flying out and go all over
the<00:02:54.060> place<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.660> want<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.870> be<00:02:54.930> careful<00:02:55.230> with

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the place so you want to be careful with

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.860 
the place so you want to be careful with
that<00:02:55.760> one<00:02:56.760> thing<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.060> do<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.480> about<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that one thing I do like about the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.420 
that one thing I do like about the
magazine<00:02:58.290> though<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:58.950> look<00:02:59.160> at<00:02:59.310> it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
magazine though is if you look at it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.590 
magazine though is if you look at it
like<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:01.190> nozzle<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.370> hidden<00:03:02.730> inside<00:03:03.000> so

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
like this the nozzle is hidden inside so

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.210 
like this the nozzle is hidden inside so
if<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.740> looks<00:03:05.010> like

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
if you see it like this it looks like

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.070 
if you see it like this it looks like
there<00:03:05.430> should<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.850> rounds<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.480> here<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:06.960> it

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
there should be rounds in here like it

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.680 
there should be rounds in here like it
looks<00:03:07.350> pretty<00:03:07.650> authentic<00:03:07.970> which<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.180> like<00:03:09.420> it

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
looks pretty authentic which I like it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.280 
looks pretty authentic which I like it
looks<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.170> lot<00:03:10.500> more<00:03:10.680> realistic<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:12.050> GM<00:03:13.050> did<00:03:13.230> a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
looks a lot more realistic a GM did a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.400 
looks a lot more realistic a GM did a
good<00:03:13.470> job<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.160> replicating<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.330> real<00:03:15.540> stg44

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
good job and replicating the real stg44

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.280 
good job and replicating the real stg44
or<00:03:16.890> MP<00:03:17.280> 44<00:03:18.920> also<00:03:19.920> one<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.120> downsides<00:03:21.660> again

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
or MP 44 also one of the downsides again

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.990 
or MP 44 also one of the downsides again
not<00:03:22.650> really<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.010> big<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.340> deal<00:03:23.490> though<00:03:23.760> is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
not really that big of a deal though is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.540 
not really that big of a deal though is
that<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.900> can't<00:03:25.860> figure<00:03:26.010> out<00:03:26.130> how<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.310> take<00:03:26.520> it

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
that I can't figure out how to take it

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.550 
that I can't figure out how to take it
apart<00:03:26.700> there's<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.420> couple<00:03:27.750> pins<00:03:28.140> if<00:03:28.410> you're<00:03:28.530> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
apart there's a couple pins if you're a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.040 
apart there's a couple pins if you're a
movement<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.130> slide<00:03:29.700> pieces<00:03:30.660> away<00:03:30.840> from

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
movement you can slide pieces away from

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.230 
movement you can slide pieces away from
each<00:03:31.320> other<00:03:31.470> but<00:03:32.100> they<00:03:32.310> do<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:32.760> come

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
each other but they do not come

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.100 
each other but they do not come
completely<00:03:33.870> apart<00:03:34.230> they<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:34.860> do<00:03:35.130> not<00:03:35.160> do<00:03:35.550> it

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
completely apart they just do not do it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.300 
completely apart they just do not do it
I've<00:03:37.110> never<00:03:37.260> seen<00:03:37.680> or<00:03:37.830> heard<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.070> anyone

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
I've never seen or heard of anyone

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.310 
I've never seen or heard of anyone

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
other thing that I don't know if it's

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.050 
other thing that I don't know if it's
really<00:03:48.540> an<00:03:48.630> issue<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:49.110> it's<00:03:49.260> strange<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:50.010> that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
really an issue but it's strange is that

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.270 
really an issue but it's strange is that
every<00:03:51.060> version<00:03:51.270> I've<00:03:51.600> seen<00:03:51.900> has<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:53.010> little

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
every version I've seen has the little

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.120 
every version I've seen has the little
loop<00:03:53.490> over<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.910> front<00:03:54.209> sight<00:03:54.450> which<00:03:55.080> they<00:03:55.950> all

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
loop over the front sight which they all

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.390 
loop over the front sight which they all
do<00:03:56.580> have<00:03:56.690> mine<00:03:57.690> does<00:03:57.959> not<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.650> came<00:03:58.920> like<00:03:59.100> that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
do have mine does not it came like that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.040 
do have mine does not it came like that
it<00:03:59.610> didn't<00:03:59.940> break<00:04:00.180> off<00:04:00.450> for<00:04:00.690> anything<00:04:00.870> and

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
it didn't break off for anything and

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.840 
it didn't break off for anything and
shipping<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.560> tell<00:04:01.890> because<00:04:02.040> like<00:04:02.820> a

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
shipping you can tell because like a

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.290 
shipping you can tell because like a
clean<00:04:03.800> cut<00:04:04.800> it's<00:04:05.040> not<00:04:05.220> like<00:04:05.490> broken<00:04:05.970> or

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
clean cut it's not like broken or

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.330 
clean cut it's not like broken or
anything<00:04:06.360> but<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:07.560> just<00:04:07.590> doesn't<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.190> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
anything but it just doesn't have the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.060 
anything but it just doesn't have the
loop<00:04:08.520> on<00:04:08.700> top<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.870> bad<00:04:10.140> not<00:04:10.530> necessarily

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
loop on top is that bad not necessarily

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.360 
loop on top is that bad not necessarily
it<00:04:11.400> just<00:04:11.610> looks<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.300> little<00:04:12.330> bit<00:04:12.540> weird<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:13.370> got

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
it just looks a little bit weird I got

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.000 
it just looks a little bit weird I got
used<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.700> fast<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.440> sights<00:04:16.709> still

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
used to it fast and the sights still

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.060 
used to it fast and the sights still
work<00:04:17.250> just<00:04:17.280> as<00:04:17.820> well<00:04:17.970> but<00:04:18.470> also<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.709> take<00:04:19.919> the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
work just as well but also to take the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.340 
work just as well but also to take the
battery<00:04:20.489> out<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.880> push<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:21.359> pin<00:04:21.630> let's

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
battery out you push this pin let's

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.680 
battery out you push this pin let's
knock<00:04:22.560> off<00:04:22.850> your<00:04:23.850> battery<00:04:24.060> goes<00:04:24.330> right<00:04:24.600> in

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
knock off your battery goes right in

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.840 
knock off your battery goes right in
there<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.650> takes<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.980> stick<00:04:26.250> type<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.669> comes

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
there it takes a stick type it comes

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.780 
there it takes a stick type it comes
with<00:04:27.000> an<00:04:27.090> 8.4<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:28.260> can't<00:04:28.470> fit<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.680> 9.6<00:04:29.370> which<00:04:29.640> I

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
with an 8.4 you can't fit a 9.6 which I

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.430 
with an 8.4 you can't fit a 9.6 which I
highly<00:04:30.060> recommend<00:04:30.510> because<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.930> thing<00:04:31.140> is

extra man cuz I was ripping through

extra man cuz I was ripping through
rounds<00:04:36.589> again<00:04:37.620> EGM<00:04:38.039> doesn't<00:04:38.370> make<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:39.120> best

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
rounds again EGM doesn't make the best

rounds again EGM doesn't make the best
speed<00:04:40.830> motors<00:04:41.249> though<00:04:41.520> but<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:42.479> one's

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:42.719 
speed motors though but this one's

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.890 
speed motors though but this one's
pretty<00:04:42.990> decent<00:04:44.180> I've<00:04:45.180> had<00:04:45.360> this<00:04:45.479> for<00:04:45.629> like<00:04:45.719> two

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
pretty decent I've had this for like two

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.480 
pretty decent I've had this for like two
years<00:04:46.139> it's<00:04:46.349> still<00:04:46.439> one<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.889> my<00:04:46.949> favorites

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
years it's still one of my favorites

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.309 
years it's still one of my favorites
just<00:04:47.639> because<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:48.059> realism<00:04:48.449> factor<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.259> the

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
just because the realism factor and the

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.469 
just because the realism factor and the
performance<00:04:49.879> one<00:04:50.879> of<00:04:50.969> the<00:04:51.029> weird<00:04:51.270> things

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
performance one of the weird things

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.079 
performance one of the weird things
about<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.779> stock<00:04:52.050> also<00:04:52.699> is<00:04:53.699> that<00:04:53.759> you<00:04:53.879> can

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:54.089 
about the stock also is that you can

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:57.409 
about the stock also is that you can
flip<00:04:54.629> this<00:04:54.779> open<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.349> believe<00:04:56.099> on<00:04:56.939> the<00:04:56.969> real<00:04:57.210> one

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
flip this open I believe on the real one

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.070 
flip this open I believe on the real one
is<00:04:57.689> a<00:04:57.719> math<00:04:58.289> thing<00:04:59.069> or<00:04:59.370> a<00:04:59.430> cleaning<00:04:59.909> tool<00:05:00.330> set

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
is a math thing or a cleaning tool set

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.709 
is a math thing or a cleaning tool set
here<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:01.800> don't<00:05:02.099> need<00:05:02.279> a<00:05:02.309> map<00:05:02.639> or<00:05:02.999> cleaning

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
here you don't need a map or cleaning

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.189 
here you don't need a map or cleaning
tools<00:05:04.129> but<00:05:05.129> it's<00:05:06.059> just<00:05:06.210> all<00:05:06.449> so<00:05:06.659> cool<00:05:06.870> I<00:05:06.930> mean

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
tools but it's just all so cool I mean

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.779 
tools but it's just all so cool I mean
usually<00:05:07.409> what<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.800> do<00:05:07.889> is<00:05:08.039> when<00:05:08.279> I<00:05:08.370> take<00:05:08.490> off<00:05:08.669> the

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
usually what I do is when I take off the

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.119 
usually what I do is when I take off the
battery<00:05:08.969> I<00:05:09.389> just<00:05:09.689> put<00:05:09.899> the<00:05:09.990> pin<00:05:10.199> in<00:05:10.349> there<00:05:10.529> I'll

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
battery I just put the pin in there I'll

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.739 
battery I just put the pin in there I'll
put<00:05:11.399> in<00:05:11.520> like<00:05:11.699> an<00:05:11.819> allen<00:05:12.180> key<00:05:12.360> or<00:05:12.389> whatever

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:12.749 
put in like an allen key or whatever

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.019 
put in like an allen key or whatever
just<00:05:13.199> in<00:05:13.499> case<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:14.069> need<00:05:14.099> to<00:05:14.279> do<00:05:14.399> some<00:05:14.580> repairs

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:15.029 
just in case I need to do some repairs

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:19.700 
just in case I need to do some repairs
in<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.300> field<00:05:17.029> so<00:05:18.029> that's<00:05:18.379> basically<00:05:19.379> a<00:05:19.499> bad

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
in the field so that's basically a bad

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.179 
in the field so that's basically a bad
also<00:05:20.339> the<00:05:20.520> fire<00:05:21.120> selector<00:05:21.479> switch<00:05:22.129> this<00:05:23.129> is

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
also the fire selector switch this is

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.649 
also the fire selector switch this is
the<00:05:23.370> only<00:05:23.699> thing<00:05:23.849> that<00:05:23.969> they<00:05:24.059> screwed<00:05:24.360> up<00:05:24.479> on

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
the only thing that they screwed up on

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.399 
the only thing that they screwed up on
it<00:05:24.930> should<00:05:25.229> twist<00:05:26.159> on<00:05:26.639> the<00:05:27.120> real<00:05:27.300> one<00:05:27.539> just<00:05:28.080> you

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
it should twist on the real one just you

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.089 
it should twist on the real one just you
know<00:05:28.529> down<00:05:29.059> semi-auto<00:05:30.059> whatever<00:05:30.629> but<00:05:31.439> it<00:05:31.860> does

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
know down semi-auto whatever but it does

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.929 
know down semi-auto whatever but it does
not<00:05:32.249> it<00:05:32.520> slides<00:05:33.499> so<00:05:34.499> one<00:05:34.919> flip<00:05:35.189> back<00:05:35.399> a<00:05:35.430> semi

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:35.939 
not it slides so one flip back a semi

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.999 
not it slides so one flip back a semi
all<00:05:36.449> the<00:05:36.599> way<00:05:36.659> back<00:05:36.810> is<00:05:36.990> full<00:05:37.199> auto<00:05:37.349> it's

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
all the way back is full auto it's

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.709 
all the way back is full auto it's
usually<00:05:38.399> a<00:05:38.610> little<00:05:38.699> bit<00:05:38.879> tricky<00:05:39.209> to<00:05:39.330> get<00:05:39.539> the

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
usually a little bit tricky to get the

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.350 
usually a little bit tricky to get the
semi<00:05:40.110> because<00:05:40.379> you<00:05:40.620> either<00:05:41.580> slide<00:05:41.939> it<00:05:42.089> all<00:05:42.240> the

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
semi because you either slide it all the

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.800 
semi because you either slide it all the
way<00:05:42.449> back<00:05:42.629> or<00:05:42.959> you<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.459> yeah<00:05:44.509> but<00:05:45.509> you<00:05:45.629> can

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
way back or you just yeah but you can

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.570 
way back or you just yeah but you can
usually<00:05:46.439> I<00:05:46.649> go<00:05:46.800> all<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.009> way<00:05:47.099> to<00:05:47.189> auto<00:05:47.459> and

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
usually I go all the way to auto and

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.629 
usually I go all the way to auto and
then<00:05:47.669> click<00:05:47.969> it<00:05:48.120> once<00:05:48.300> forward<00:05:49.399> but<00:05:50.399> you<00:05:50.459> got

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
then click it once forward but you got

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.279 
then click it once forward but you got
to<00:05:50.699> get<00:05:50.819> used<00:05:50.969> to<00:05:51.060> that<00:05:51.240> because<00:05:51.449> usually<00:05:51.810> you

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
to get used to that because usually you

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:53.839
