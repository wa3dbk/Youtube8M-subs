00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.940
 Haunted is a game for children to 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.250
 from 4 years that is very easy to 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.350
 play and it was very fun and especially 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.289
 you need a lot of memory this is the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.470
 game is a game as you see very 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.670
 entertaining very ghost gemma that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.770
 draws much attention to children 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.420
 let's see how safe this is the game 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.840
 It is a game already as it has explained very 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.780
 simple is for children and good starting 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.270
 of 4 years and you will see that it is very pleasant 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.970
 or play with some pawns 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.610
 with a color you have a tab here of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.340
 wood in front of each player so that 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.340
 see that player here colors 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.100
 and with a die where he has 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.760
 two of the faces is ghost find 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.360
 these are numbers from 1 to 4 are numbers 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.080
 what does the first one consist of? 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.380
 luck who starts but smaller 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.930
 and if a quantity comes out for example I am 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.930
 I yellow with two rungs 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.320
 they are going to look for is the sense the needles 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.930
 of the next watch rock turn 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.330
 imagine that the red strip that come out to 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.020
 miss me 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.119
 here we see play ghosts 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.890
 to use with the responsible pawns 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.850
 ghost the player who has left 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.810
 have two options oppose 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.659
 in the ghost at its worst or put it in 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.390
 the plan of another person 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.549
 the most fun, the best is what 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.170
 so much the people I put it then for 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.850
 win 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.070
 once you have made it worse here 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.350
 when it has already been there mounted by the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.610
 head of magnet that has and inside there is 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.630
 a magnet 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.060
 and inside is the worst kept not 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.460
 can look at the other heading what is the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.250
 that is below has to have memory 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.250
 and always agreed virtual your 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.560
 ghost 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.270
 next turn for example then now 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.470
 I would throw it to the green color and throw a 3 2 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.960
 1 2 and 3 would put on and now I would throw the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.070
 the orange color that is the one that has 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.070
 currently the ghost 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.260
 and another ghost comes out 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.260
 can catch 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.420
 put 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.830
 now ghost 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.830
 whoever wants 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.600
 and each one remember our worst 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:00.320
 next turn now I am the yellow 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.320
 and I get another miss like the red 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.450
 comes the red strip and the salt of the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.780
 ghost 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.670
 we already have the ghost games 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.040
 one that you signal runs ghost if 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.040
 someone throws and a ghost comes out 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.170
 can 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.170
 do two things 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.050
 or exchange for example this ghost 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.050
 with this 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.640
 I exchange my file with this one 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.030
 it's a way that we always know which one 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.349
 is what is our ghost and what is 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.760
 under others because now 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.720
 if we knew what the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.590
 yellow now either the green and 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.430
 honestly I do not remember what the 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.860
 green 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.190
 I think it was this project here I was 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.590
 the green 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.180
 then now I would be this is the one that 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.610
 I would have to move to win the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.950
 game the game wins the one that 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:05.410
 first get here up here 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.060
 lift the skirt the ghost and make it 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.739
 in its color 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.780
 if I, for example, am playing 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.030
 I think it's the green today playing such a 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.280
 and when I have finished being the green 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.239
 and I will win 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.120
 I am orange, we won 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.340
 that's why you have to take into account which 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.280
 it's your color, you stay very good with him and 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.340
 follow lois and also follow that of the 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.650
 others something very simple children 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.080
 love because the ghost that eats 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.460
 the character later with a simple 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.590
 movement so it comes back out again 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:44.410
 the pivot the pawn with its magnetized head 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.480
 and play again this is the game is very 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.080
 simple and I hope you liked it 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.080
 see you later
