nice sunny day and I think it's all type

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.540 
nice sunny day and I think it's all type
of<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.050> color<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.860> picture<00:02:35.040> quite<00:02:35.310> nicely

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
of the color in the picture quite nicely

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.979 
of the color in the picture quite nicely
now<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.390> phone<00:02:36.660> uses<00:02:37.280> gyroscopic<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.989> when

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
now the phone uses gyroscopic so when

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.650 
now the phone uses gyroscopic so when
I'm<00:02:40.410> viewing<00:02:41.069> my<00:02:41.250> pictures<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.390> want<00:02:42.600> to

I'm viewing my pictures if I want to
tell<00:02:43.620> my<00:02:43.799> phone<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.280> way<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.790> would<00:02:44.910> adjust

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
tell my phone this way it would adjust

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.360 
tell my phone this way it would adjust
if<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.600> want<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> tell<00:02:46.110> my<00:02:46.530> friend<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.830> way<00:02:46.950> it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
if I want to tell my friend that way it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.949 
if I want to tell my friend that way it
will<00:02:47.489> adjust<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.209> view<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> picture

will adjust so I can view the picture

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.620 
will adjust so I can view the picture
whatever<00:02:49.319> angle<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.950> choose<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.940> gyroscopic

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
whatever angle I choose the gyroscopic

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.509 
whatever angle I choose the gyroscopic
sort<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.019> applied<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.769> motion<00:02:53.010> sense<00:02:53.400> of

sort of applied to the motion sense of

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.309 
sort of applied to the motion sense of
gaming<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.269> while<00:02:54.480> you're<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.049> plane<00:02:55.290> you

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
gaming so while you're in a plane you

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.809 
gaming so while you're in a plane you
can<00:02:55.590> tilt<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.920> phone<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.430> left<00:02:56.640> or<00:02:56.790> right

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
can tilt the phone to the left or right

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.280 
can tilt the phone to the left or right
and<00:02:57.120> example<00:02:57.599> if<00:02:57.660> you're<00:02:57.780> playing<00:02:57.900> darts

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
and example if you're playing darts

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.670 
and example if you're playing darts
relying<00:02:59.190> up<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.459> darts<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.880> board<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.420> then

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
relying up the darts the board and then

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.170 
relying up the darts the board and then
flicking<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.519> dark<00:03:02.760> should

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
flicking like that and the dark should

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.750 
flicking like that and the dark should
hopefully<00:03:03.560> at<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.709> board<00:03:04.920> now<00:03:05.459> I'm<00:03:05.610> only

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
hopefully at the board now I'm only

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.000 
hopefully at the board now I'm only
negative<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.500> swings<00:03:07.769> not

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
negative of this is the swings not

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.430 
negative of this is the swings not
exactly<00:03:08.459> huge<00:03:09.269> plates<00:03:09.720> are<00:03:09.870> phone<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.290> why

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
exactly huge plates are phone so why

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.930 
exactly huge plates are phone so why
should<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.739> be<00:03:10.859> with<00:03:11.459> this<00:03:11.579> kind<00:03:11.820> of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
should it be with this kind of

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.300 
should it be with this kind of
technology<00:03:12.299> when<00:03:12.660> you're<00:03:12.810> flicking<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:14.100> doll

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
technology when you're flicking the doll

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.670 
technology when you're flicking the doll
or<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.670> fishing<00:03:15.000> rod<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:16.260> can't<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:16.590> see

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
or the fishing rod you can't really see

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.190 
or the fishing rod you can't really see
so<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:17.280> kind<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.640> fluke<00:03:17.910> will<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.870> catch<00:03:19.079> a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
so it's kind of a fluke will you catch a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.960 
so it's kind of a fluke will you catch a
fish<00:03:19.380> will<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:19.950> hit<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.160> dartboard<00:03:20.579> who
