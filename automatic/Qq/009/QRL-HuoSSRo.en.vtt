00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
order to thread it on and that's what I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.220 
order to thread it on and that's what I
was<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.180> was<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:24.660> Home<00:00:24.810> Depot
