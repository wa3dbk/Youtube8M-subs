00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
can't quite back up which i don't really

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
can't quite back up which i don't really
like<00:01:03.719> i<00:01:04.019> prefer<00:01:04.799> being<00:01:05.010> able<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> back<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.549> like

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
like i prefer being able to back up like

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
like i prefer being able to back up like
with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> bomber<00:01:06.390> marine<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.170> i<00:01:07.380> guess

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
with the bomber marine but i guess

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.100 
with the bomber marine but i guess
there's<00:01:08.189> no<00:01:08.280> such<00:01:08.490> comfort<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.020> case

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
there's no such comfort and just in case

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.130 
there's no such comfort and just in case
you<00:01:10.200> didn't<00:01:10.439> catch<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.280> speed<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:11.670> I

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
you didn't catch it you can speed up I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.120 
you didn't catch it you can speed up I
guess<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:13.320> helpful<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.830> you're<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
guess that's helpful if you're in a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.620 
guess that's helpful if you're in a
hurry<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.909> level<00:01:15.210> doesn't<00:01:15.420> really

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
hurry but this level doesn't really

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.899 
hurry but this level doesn't really
require<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.320> because<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> want<00:01:17.820> to
