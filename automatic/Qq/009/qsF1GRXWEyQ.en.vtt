00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
also the same and this one are also the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.490 
also the same and this one are also the
same<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:54.000> main<00:00:54.390> difference<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.379> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

made<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.329> coated<00:00:57.329> canvas<00:00:57.600> while<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> monogram

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
made of coated canvas while the monogram

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.460 
made of coated canvas while the monogram
still<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.930> they<00:01:00.930> say<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.410> coated<00:01:01.949> textile

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
still is they say it's a coated textile

so<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:05.040> fade<00:01:05.430> over<00:01:06.270> time

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so this one can fade over time

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
so this one can fade over time
especially<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> time

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
especially if you use it all the time

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.420 
especially if you use it all the time
and<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.150> gets<00:01:09.270> exposed<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.900> Sun<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.250> fade

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and it gets exposed to Sun that can fade

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.330 
and it gets exposed to Sun that can fade
easily<00:01:12.110> well<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:13.650> as<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.890> tell

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
I've had it for three years and it still

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
I've had it for three years and it still
pretty<00:01:17.790> much<00:01:18.000> looks<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> same<00:01:18.930> since<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> day

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
pretty much looks the same since the day

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.749 
pretty much looks the same since the day
I<00:01:19.740> caught<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:21.530> as<00:01:22.530> far<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> material<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I caught it as far as the material is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.789 
I caught it as far as the material is
concerned<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:28.170> material<00:01:28.650> is

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
concerned I think the this material is

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.870 
concerned I think the this material is
very<00:01:29.180> thin<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.630> light<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:32.610> think

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
very thin and very light and I think

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.940 
very thin and very light and I think
it's<00:01:33.060> very<00:01:33.600> prone<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.799> you're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
it's very prone to you know if you're

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.010 
it's very prone to you know if you're
not<00:01:35.130> very<00:01:35.369> careful<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> rub<00:01:36.600> against

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
not very careful and if you rub against

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.920 
not very careful and if you rub against
a<00:01:37.110> rough<00:01:37.350> surface<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> pointed<00:01:38.700> edge<00:01:38.939> then

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
a rough surface or a pointed edge then

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.420 
a rough surface or a pointed edge then
this<00:01:40.439> bag<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.950> get<00:01:41.189> damaged<00:01:42.000> easily<00:01:42.409> while<00:01:43.430> as

centered<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.140> roller<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.000> your

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
centered to the roller and your

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
centered to the roller and your
baguettes<00:02:21.420> clean<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.770> a

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
baguettes clean so I think this is a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.610 
baguettes clean so I think this is a
good<00:02:23.100> idea<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.940> clean<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:25.020> if

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
good idea for you to clean it because if

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.400 
good idea for you to clean it because if
you<00:02:25.920> use<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.640> damp<00:02:26.910> cloth<00:02:27.240> we're<00:02:27.720> not<00:02:27.870> sure<00:02:28.200> if

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
you use a damp cloth we're not sure if

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.930 
you use a damp cloth we're not sure if
that's<00:02:28.560> gonna<00:02:28.830> cost<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.220> bag<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.550> fade<00:02:29.760> or

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
that's gonna cost the bag to fade or

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.380 
that's gonna cost the bag to fade or
what<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.800> suggest<00:02:31.800> use<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:32.640> at<00:02:33.180> least

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
what so I suggest use this one at least

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.820 
what so I suggest use this one at least
you<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.900> know<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.080> rub<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> bag

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
you you know you rub it on the bag

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.250 
you you know you rub it on the bag
lightly<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.450> dusts<00:02:36.900> will<00:02:37.170> disappear<00:02:39.260> as

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
lightly and the dusts will disappear as

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.890 
lightly and the dusts will disappear as
far<00:02:40.590> as<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.210> leather<00:02:42.210> trimmings<00:02:42.750> are

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
far as the leather trimmings are

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.130 
far as the leather trimmings are
concerned<00:02:43.350> they<00:02:44.280> are<00:02:44.520> similar<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.720> terms<00:02:45.960> of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
concerned they are similar in terms of

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.750 
concerned they are similar in terms of
the<00:02:46.230> structure<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> leather<00:02:47.550> are

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
the structure but the leather are

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.920 
the structure but the leather are
actually<00:02:48.270> different<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.300> notice<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
actually different if you notice the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.280 
actually different if you notice the
leather<00:02:52.110> trimming<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:53.750> ebon<00:02:54.750> version<00:02:55.320> is

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
leather trimming on the ebon version is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.150 
leather trimming on the ebon version is
shinier<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.100> more<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.830> smooth

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
shinier and it's more it's it's a smooth

shinier and it's more it's it's a smooth
leather<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.200> lighter<00:03:04.440> or<00:03:04.710> leather

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.000

there's<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.880> certain<00:03:09.720> texture<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.830> leather

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
there's a certain texture on the leather

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.910 
there's a certain texture on the leather
that<00:03:11.310> makes<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.790> little<00:03:11.940> different<00:03:12.920> and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
that makes it a little different and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.380 
that makes it a little different and
that<00:03:14.100> applies<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.490> all<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.240> leather

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
trimmings on the bag as it stands up I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.930 
trimmings on the bag as it stands up I
don't<00:03:22.020> know<00:03:22.200> for<00:03:22.560> for<00:03:22.860> me<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.130> don't<00:03:23.250> use<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> base

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
don't know for for me I don't use a base

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.120 
don't know for for me I don't use a base
shaper<00:03:24.360> on<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.320> bin<00:03:25.770> version<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:27.000> for<00:03:27.450> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
shaper on the bin version but for the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.620 
shaper on the bin version but for the
adil<00:03:29.130> version<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.850> suggest<00:03:30.240> that<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.450> use<00:03:30.480> a

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
adil version I suggest that you use a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.920 
adil version I suggest that you use a
bag<00:03:30.960> shaper<00:03:31.290> because<00:03:31.710> it's<00:03:32.310> bad<00:03:32.900> quite<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
bag shaper because it's bad quite a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.380 
bag shaper because it's bad quite a
little<00:03:34.290> bit<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.340> think<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.150> know<00:03:36.240> it's

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
little bit and I think you know it's

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.570 
little bit and I think you know it's
gonna<00:03:36.570> help<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.050> bag<00:03:37.230> stay<00:03:37.650> as<00:03:37.830> structured<00:03:38.370> as

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
gonna help the bag stay as structured as

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.690 
gonna help the bag stay as structured as
it<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:39.020> one<00:03:40.020> more<00:03:40.170> difference<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.400> side

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
it is one more difference is on the side

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.230 
it is one more difference is on the side
there's<00:03:42.210> also<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.660> lining<00:03:43.200> there<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:44.240> leather

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
there's also a lining there a leather

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.870 
there's also a lining there a leather
lining<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.380> think<00:03:46.680> protection<00:03:47.340> gives<00:03:47.580> a

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
lining that I think protection gives a

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.690 
lining that I think protection gives a
definite<00:03:48.300> structure<00:03:48.630> on<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.050> bag<00:03:49.700> overall

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
definite structure on the bag overall

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.460 
definite structure on the bag overall
this<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.180> think<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.570> very<00:03:51.600> nice<00:03:52.140> and

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
this is I think a very nice and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.040 
this is I think a very nice and
functional<00:03:52.710> bag<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.820> don't<00:03:54.120> suggest<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
functional bag I don't suggest that you

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.140 
functional bag I don't suggest that you
use<00:03:55.230> it<00:03:55.380> as<00:03:55.500> an<00:03:55.650> everyday<00:03:55.770> bag<00:03:56.040> because<00:03:56.760> again

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
use it as an everyday bag because again

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.110 
use it as an everyday bag because again
it<00:03:57.990> might<00:03:58.140> fade<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.920> things<00:03:59.430> like<00:03:59.670> that<00:03:59.910> but

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
it might fade and things like that but

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.090 
it might fade and things like that but
it<00:04:00.270> should<00:04:00.480> last<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.960> a<00:04:01.020> long<00:04:01.230> time<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.860> you're

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
it should last you a long time if you're

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.610 
it should last you a long time if you're
very<00:04:02.520> careful<00:04:02.790> all<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.660> rest<00:04:04.050> of<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.260> details
