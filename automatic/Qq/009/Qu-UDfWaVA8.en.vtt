00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
video now what I do this isn't my trick

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.240 
video now what I do this isn't my trick
there's<00:00:40.140> actually<00:00:40.410> my<00:00:40.469> cousin<00:00:40.680> showed<00:00:41.040> me

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
there's actually my cousin showed me

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.840 
there's actually my cousin showed me
this<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:43.170> basically<00:00:43.829> you've<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.250> damage<00:00:44.700> on

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
this so basically you've got damage on

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.110 
this so basically you've got damage on
the<00:00:44.940> wall<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:47.070> first<00:00:47.100> time<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> showed<00:00:47.969> me

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the wall the first time you showed me

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.310 
the wall the first time you showed me
this<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.360> thought<00:00:48.539> he<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.110> bad

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this I thought he was just a really bad

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.600 
this I thought he was just a really bad
plaster<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.070> actually<00:00:50.340> quite<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> good

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
plaster it's actually quite a good

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.670 
plaster it's actually quite a good
technique<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.420> find<00:00:51.719> some<00:00:52.020> damage

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
technique so you find some damage

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.889 
technique so you find some damage
somewhere<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:54.059> were<00:00:54.239> some<00:00:54.390> already

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
somewhere so these were some already

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.200 
somewhere so these were some already
done<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.129> there's<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.460> damage<00:00:56.699> there<00:00:57.000> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
done so there's a bit of damage there so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.180 
done so there's a bit of damage there so
basically<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.780> cover<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> plaster<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
basically you just cover the plaster and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639 
basically you just cover the plaster and
then<00:00:59.280> chop<00:00:59.550> off<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> edges<00:01:00.289> leaving<00:01:01.289> plenty

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
then chop off the edges leaving plenty

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.650 
then chop off the edges leaving plenty
of<00:01:01.770> plaster<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> actual<00:01:02.760> damage<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.449> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
of plaster on the actual damage and then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.450 
of plaster on the actual damage and then
that<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:03.989> stand<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.739> you'll<00:01:04.920> notice<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that will stand out so you'll notice and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
that will stand out so you'll notice and
that<00:01:05.580> area<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.270> seal<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> same

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that area and then seal it at the same

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.310 
that area and then seal it at the same
time<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> wall<00:01:08.220> paint<00:01:09.320> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
time with the with the wall paint and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.219 
time with the with the wall paint and
that's<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.000> best<00:01:12.000> way<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.479> won't<00:01:12.720> miss<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
that's the best way so you won't miss it

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.630 
that's the best way so you won't miss it
there<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> lot<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.799> extra<00:01:13.979> plaster<00:01:14.490> there

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
there is a lot of extra plaster there

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.370 
there is a lot of extra plaster there
I'm<00:01:14.760> sorry<00:01:15.020> exaggerating<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
I'm sorry exaggerating this for the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.810 
I'm sorry exaggerating this for the
video<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> bit<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> idea

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
video a bit but you can get the idea

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.920 
video a bit but you can get the idea

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you in private of painting this is just

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.370 
you in private of painting this is just
a<00:01:23.460> tip<00:01:24.030> from<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.390> mind<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.780> lot<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.020> painters

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
a tip from my mind a lot of painters

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
a tip from my mind a lot of painters
probably<00:01:25.680> would<00:01:25.799> laugh<00:01:26.009> at<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.580> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
probably would laugh at this but it is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.109 
probably would laugh at this but it is
practical<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> does<00:01:27.630> work<00:01:28.909> now<00:01:29.909> where<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
practical it does work now where I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
practical it does work now where I
learned<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.509> trick<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:31.350> actually

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
learned this trick from it was actually

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.789 
learned this trick from it was actually

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
I was on quite a big job like a comment

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
cousin was working with me and I know

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.640 
cousin was working with me and I know
where<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.360> these<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.720> spots<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.530> over

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
where all these little spots all over

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
where all these little spots all over
the<00:01:40.799> house<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.520> didn't<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.000> what<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the house and I didn't know what the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.999 
the house and I didn't know what the
hell<00:01:42.360> he<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.479> doing<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.990> asked<00:01:43.500> him<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.710> said<00:01:43.740> why

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
hell he was doing I asked him I said why

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.410 
hell he was doing I asked him I said why
are<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.250> doing<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> he<00:01:45.240> said

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
are you doing like this and he said

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.230 
are you doing like this and he said
would<00:01:45.570> say<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.810> don't<00:01:45.990> miss<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:47.060> no<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
would say you don't miss them no I just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.760 
would say you don't miss them no I just
thought<00:01:48.360> he<00:01:48.479> was<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:48.780> crap<00:01:49.020> plaster<00:01:49.590> but

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
thought he was really crap plaster but

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
thought he was really crap plaster but
when<00:01:50.549> you're<00:01:50.670> doing<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> big<00:01:51.060> job<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.509> you're<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
when you're doing a big job if you're in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.969 
when you're doing a big job if you're in
the<00:01:51.899> middle<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> second<00:01:52.560> coat<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the middle of the second coat and you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.859 
the middle of the second coat and you
see<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> repair<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.270> you've<00:01:54.390> missed<00:01:54.570> which

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
see a repair that you've missed which

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.020 
see a repair that you've missed which
quite<00:01:55.140> often<00:01:55.320> happens<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.880> don't

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
quite often happens because you don't

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.240 
quite often happens because you don't
get<00:01:57.180> everything<00:01:57.420> first<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:57.990> many<00:01:58.619> painter<00:01:59.130> who

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
get everything first go many painter who

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.380 
get everything first go many painter who
says<00:01:59.430> he<00:01:59.520> gets<00:01:59.640> everything<00:01:59.909> first<00:02:00.210> guys

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
says he gets everything first guys

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.310 
says he gets everything first guys
probably<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> liar<00:02:02.719> it's<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> was<00:02:04.170> why<00:02:04.290> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
probably a liar it's just that was why I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.249 
probably a liar it's just that was why I
doing<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> anyway<00:02:05.600> another<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.810> doing<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.140> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
doing it anyway another one doing it is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.529 
doing it anyway another one doing it is
you<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.469> actually<00:02:07.500> put<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> pit<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.179> Steiner<00:02:09.179> in

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
you can actually put a pit of Steiner in

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.210 
you can actually put a pit of Steiner in
the<00:02:09.750> plaster<00:02:10.379> which<00:02:10.530> will<00:02:10.649> actually<00:02:10.979> cover

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the plaster which will actually cover

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.860 
the plaster which will actually cover
the<00:02:11.430> plaster<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.300> also<00:02:12.420> create

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the plaster but that can also create

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.490 
the plaster but that can also create
other

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
other

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
other
for<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.100> you're<00:02:14.250> using<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.580> neutral<00:02:14.910> color

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
for you if you're using a neutral color

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.430 
for you if you're using a neutral color
you're<00:02:15.300> going<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.510> give<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.780> extra<00:02:15.870> coats<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
you're going to give it extra coats to

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.980 
you're going to give it extra coats to
cover<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.830> stuff<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.660> another

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
cover and stuff like that and another

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.840 
cover and stuff like that and another
thing<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.260> will<00:02:19.410> say<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.190> sit<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.760> this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
thing I will say is that I sit in this

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.880 
thing I will say is that I sit in this
video<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.540> seal<00:02:21.900> these<00:02:22.110> patches<00:02:22.380> with<00:02:22.770> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
video that I seal these patches with the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.440 
video that I seal these patches with the
wall<00:02:23.100> paint<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.640> that's<00:02:23.700> exactly<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.330> do

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
wall paint and that's exactly what I do

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.250 
wall paint and that's exactly what I do
I<00:02:24.780> don't<00:02:25.320> use<00:02:25.560> an<00:02:25.680> undercoat<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> patches

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
I don't use an undercoat on the patches

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.960 
I don't use an undercoat on the patches
technically<00:02:28.260> that's<00:02:28.440> wrong<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.760> all

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
technically that's wrong because of all

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.370 
technically that's wrong because of all
black<00:02:30.240> bear<00:02:30.510> plaster<00:02:30.960> should<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.260> an

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
black bear plaster should have an

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.800 
black bear plaster should have an
undercoat<00:02:31.710> but<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:33.000> will<00:02:33.210> get<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.420> better<00:02:33.660> job

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
undercoat but you will get a better job

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.230 
undercoat but you will get a better job
I<00:02:34.170> find<00:02:34.470> sealing<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.520> patches<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.120> the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
I find sealing just the patches with the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.540 
I find sealing just the patches with the
wall<00:02:36.420> paint<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.500> some<00:02:37.710> reason<00:02:38.100> even

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
wall paint because for some reason even

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.550 
wall paint because for some reason even
after<00:02:38.970> two<00:02:39.150> coats<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.600> use<00:02:39.840> under<00:02:40.110> coat<00:02:40.320> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
two coats of low Sheen sometimes you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.390 
two coats of low Sheen sometimes you
still<00:02:43.050> see<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.380> patches<00:02:43.770> at<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.100> end<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
still see the patches at the end of the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.190 
still see the patches at the end of the
day<00:02:44.550> or<00:02:44.700> as<00:02:44.790> usual<00:02:45.270> Oh<00:02:45.450> Shane<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.990> never

happens<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.430> sheen<00:02:47.670> level<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.270> matched<00:02:48.840> up

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
happens the sheen level is matched up

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.130 
happens the sheen level is matched up
quicker<00:02:49.320> anyway
