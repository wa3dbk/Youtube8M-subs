transmittal scavenger sees a fire ant he
was<00:00:25.090> originally<00:00:25.540> intended<00:00:25.779> to<00:00:25.990> be

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
was originally intended to be

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.650 
was originally intended to be
transmittal<00:00:27.490> inferno<00:00:28.000> but<00:00:28.270> then<00:00:28.390> there<00:00:28.510> was<00:00:28.600> a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
transmittal inferno but then there was a

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.060 
transmittal inferno but then there was a
last-minute<00:00:28.990> switch<00:00:29.380> up<00:00:29.560> with<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:29.830> name<00:00:30.040> and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
last-minute switch up with the name and

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.360 
last-minute switch up with the name and
he<00:00:30.550> ends<00:00:30.790> up<00:00:30.849> coming<00:00:31.090> out<00:00:31.330> a<00:00:31.390> scavenger<00:00:32.190> he<00:00:33.190> was

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
he ends up coming out a scavenger he was

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.660 
he ends up coming out a scavenger he was
actually<00:00:33.700> called<00:00:33.910> inferno<00:00:34.420> in<00:00:34.629> Japan<00:00:35.670> which

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
actually called inferno in Japan which

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.400 
actually called inferno in Japan which
is<00:00:36.699> all<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.180> proof<00:00:37.360> I<00:00:37.510> need

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
is all the proof I need

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.430 
is all the proof I need
I<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.699> what<00:00:39.790> mr.<00:00:40.030> ansvil<00:00:40.210> inferno<00:00:40.780> even

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
I think it what mr. ansvil inferno even

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.869 
I think it what mr. ansvil inferno even
though<00:00:41.530> he<00:00:41.620> does<00:00:41.739> have<00:00:41.920> scavenger<00:00:42.580> stamp

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
though he does have scavenger stamp

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.090 
though he does have scavenger stamp
phones<00:00:43.090> but<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:43.629> prefer<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:44.590> think<00:00:44.620> that's<00:00:44.830> more

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
phones but I prefer to think that's more

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.250 
phones but I prefer to think that's more
his<00:00:45.280> function<00:00:45.820> than<00:00:46.239> his<00:00:46.510> name<00:00:48.420> yeah<00:00:49.420> areas<00:00:49.780> as

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
his function than his name yeah areas as

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.610 
his function than his name yeah areas as

what<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:29.730> well<00:02:33.829> just<00:02:34.829> bring<00:02:34.920> them<00:02:35.129> up

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
what it was but well just bring them up

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.849 
what it was but well just bring them up
however<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.720> get<00:02:36.840> him<00:02:36.930> up<00:02:37.049> then<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.680> flip

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
however just get him up then you flip

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.930 
however just get him up then you flip
these<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.220> wheels<00:02:38.340> back<00:02:38.730> here<00:02:39.120> out<00:02:39.390> I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
these little wheels back here out I

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.460 
these little wheels back here out I
guess<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.030> want<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.239> least<00:02:42.269> have<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.720> legs<00:02:43.260> so

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
guess you want at least have the legs so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.699 
guess you want at least have the legs so
they're<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.709> blocking<00:02:44.159> those<00:02:44.280> wheels<00:02:44.579> I<00:02:45.709> just

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
they're not blocking those wheels I just

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.770 
they're not blocking those wheels I just
like<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.909> then<00:02:50.090> his<00:02:51.090> head<00:02:51.359> actually

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
like that and then his head actually

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.559 
like that and then his head actually
comes<00:02:51.959> back<00:02:52.079> you<00:02:52.889> open<00:02:53.129> up<00:02:53.159> these<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:54.359> flip

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
comes back you open up these and flip

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.080 
comes back you open up these and flip
these<00:02:54.720> forward<00:02:55.139> is<00:02:55.260> kind<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.620> laser<00:02:56.340> guns<00:02:56.700> here

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
these forward is kind of laser guns here

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.410 
these forward is kind of laser guns here
the<00:02:57.900> head<00:02:58.049> comes<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.620> up<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.750> the<00:03:00.750> body<00:03:00.989> here

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
the head comes back up to the body here

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.699 
the head comes back up to the body here
you<00:03:03.420> can't<00:03:03.720> actually<00:03:03.900> see<00:03:04.109> you<00:03:04.349> can<00:03:04.470> open

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
you can't actually see you can open

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.039 
you can't actually see you can open
these<00:03:04.799> up<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.129> have<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> head<00:03:05.690> kind<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.750> flat

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
these up and have the head kind of flat

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.390 
these up and have the head kind of flat
there<00:03:09.109> in<00:03:10.109> this<00:03:10.290> mode<00:03:11.780> point<00:03:12.780> these<00:03:12.900> forward

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
there in this mode point these forward

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.710 
there in this mode point these forward
and<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:14.489> flip<00:03:14.849> these<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.389> said<00:03:15.419> I<00:03:15.569> had<00:03:15.690> I

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and then flip these like I said I had I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.509 
and then flip these like I said I had I
had<00:03:16.019> these<00:03:16.169> drills<00:03:16.500> angled<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.099> let<00:03:17.220> his<00:03:17.340> head

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
had these drills angled to let his head

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.900 
had these drills angled to let his head
angle<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.970> little<00:03:18.000> bit<00:03:18.319> there<00:03:19.319> in<00:03:19.440> ant<00:03:19.620> mode<00:03:19.910> but

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
angle a little bit there in ant mode but

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.129 
angle a little bit there in ant mode but
he<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.269> throws<00:03:21.419> a<00:03:21.480> little<00:03:21.540> drill<00:03:21.870> tank

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
he kind of throws a little drill tank

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.080 
he kind of throws a little drill tank
and<00:03:22.560> again<00:03:22.829> there's<00:03:23.010> what<00:03:23.129> you<00:03:23.220> can<00:03:23.579> do

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
and again there's what you can do

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.339 
and again there's what you can do
whatever<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.419> can<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.629> get<00:03:24.840> these<00:03:24.930> legs<00:03:25.199> out

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
whatever you can to get these legs out

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.229 
whatever you can to get these legs out
of<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.500> way<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:26.489> then<00:03:26.699> he's<00:03:26.790> got<00:03:26.910> some<00:03:27.150> little

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
of the way but then he's got some little

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.000 
of the way but then he's got some little
treads<00:03:29.569> little<00:03:30.569> rubber<00:03:30.739> wheels<00:03:31.739> on<00:03:31.889> these

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
treads little rubber wheels on these

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.619 
treads little rubber wheels on these
treads<00:03:32.310> here<00:03:32.430> treads<00:03:32.910> on<00:03:33.030> these<00:03:33.150> wheels<00:03:33.359> here

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
treads here treads on these wheels here

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.500 
treads here treads on these wheels here
that<00:03:34.379> allows<00:03:34.590> them<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:34.919> when<00:03:35.040> he<00:03:35.129> rolls<00:03:35.510> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
that allows them so when he rolls the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.119 
that allows them so when he rolls the
drills<00:03:37.220> activating<00:03:38.220> spin<00:03:39.859> see<00:03:40.859> this<00:03:40.980> one's

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
drills activating spin see this one's

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.189 
drills activating spin see this one's
kind<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.879> centered<00:03:42.389> so<00:03:42.629> it<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:42.930> flopping

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
kind of not centered so it just flopping

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.589 
kind of not centered so it just flopping
around<00:03:43.379> but<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.910> he<00:03:45.000> turns<00:03:45.209> into<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.449> little

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
around but so he turns into a little

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.180 
around but so he turns into a little
drill<00:03:45.870> tank<00:03:47.989> it's<00:03:48.989> not<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:49.290> cleanest<00:03:49.980> drill

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
drill tank it's not the cleanest drill

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.309 
drill tank it's not the cleanest drill
tank<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.609> world<00:03:50.870> there's<00:03:51.870> lots<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.139> ant

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
tank in the world there's lots of ant

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.000 
tank in the world there's lots of ant
legs<00:03:52.530> everywhere<00:03:53.120> like<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.209> said<00:03:54.389> you<00:03:54.629> can<00:03:55.049> this

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
legs everywhere like I said you can this

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.229 
legs everywhere like I said you can this
is<00:03:56.159> just<00:03:56.310> kind<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:56.549> how<00:03:56.639> I<00:03:56.669> did<00:03:56.879> it<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.090> get<00:03:57.180> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
is just kind of how I did it to get a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.689 
is just kind of how I did it to get a
quick<00:03:57.480> transformation<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:59.099> can<00:03:59.430> fiddle<00:03:59.609> with

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
quick transformation you can fiddle with

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.030 
quick transformation you can fiddle with
those<00:03:59.909> legs<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.449> get<00:04:00.599> them<00:04:00.750> positioned<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:01.949> a

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
those legs and get them positioned in a

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.649 
those legs and get them positioned in a
way<00:04:02.159> that<00:04:02.310> makes<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.639> happy<00:04:02.819> because<00:04:03.480> you've

way that makes you happy because you've
got<00:04:03.840> two<00:04:04.500> ball<00:04:04.709> joints<00:04:05.010> in<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.190> hinge<00:04:05.430> you've

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
got two ball joints in a hinge you've

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.659 
got two ball joints in a hinge you've
got<00:04:05.790> plenty<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.150> options<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:07.340> bring<00:04:08.340> them<00:04:08.519> out

got plenty of options to bring them out

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.219 
got plenty of options to bring them out
and<00:04:08.849> make<00:04:09.000> somebody<00:04:09.239> they<00:04:09.419> used<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:09.989> actually

I can't rat was but I used to have a
pretty<00:04:30.550> cool<00:04:30.790> spaceship<00:04:31.270> mode<00:04:31.480> for<00:04:31.720> him

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.650

continuing on to robot mode go ahead and

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.250 
continuing on to robot mode go ahead and
leave<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.790> ant<00:04:39.790> head<00:04:40.000> up<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.750> want<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:40.990> split

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
leave the ant head up you want to split

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.570 
leave the ant head up you want to split
this<00:04:41.800> entire<00:04:42.160> segment<00:04:42.580> for<00:04:42.850> section<00:04:43.120> here<00:04:44.580> and

that's<00:04:45.790> all<00:04:45.940> gonna<00:04:46.180> become<00:04:46.300> his<00:04:46.510> arms<00:04:46.840> that's

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
that's all gonna become his arms that's

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.690
