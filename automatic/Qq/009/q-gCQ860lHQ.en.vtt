00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
the 30 is still fine so I will use this

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.090 
the 30 is still fine so I will use this
a<00:04:02.450> lot<00:04:02.660> while<00:04:02.959> I<00:04:03.170> am<00:04:05.140> traveling<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:07.040> I

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
a lot while I am traveling and the and I

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.770 
a lot while I am traveling and the and I
would<00:04:07.310> definitely<00:04:07.820> recommend<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.450> dummy

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
would definitely recommend this dummy

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.479 
would definitely recommend this dummy
beam<00:04:09.110> if<00:04:09.350> you're<00:04:09.470> traveling<00:04:09.920> because<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.370> just

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
beam if you're traveling because it just

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.009 
beam if you're traveling because it just
doesn't<00:04:10.760> show<00:04:10.940> where<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.480> can<00:04:11.630> use<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.930> in

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
doesn't show where and you can use it in

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.400 
doesn't show where and you can use it in
all<00:04:12.140> kinds<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.530> weather<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:15.079> looks<00:04:15.320> like

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
all kinds of weather so it looks like

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.379 
all kinds of weather so it looks like
I'm<00:04:15.620> leaning<00:04:15.859> towards<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.609> 30<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.209> guess

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
I'm leaning towards the 30 and I guess

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.750 
I'm leaning towards the 30 and I guess
if<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.660> had<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.840> pick<00:04:18.109> one<00:04:18.290> if<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:18.859> had<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.519> pick

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
if I had to pick one if I had to pick

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.220 
if I had to pick one if I had to pick
one<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.720> 30

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
one it's the 30
