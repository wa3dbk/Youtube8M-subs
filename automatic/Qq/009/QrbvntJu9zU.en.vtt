00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.889 
look at this when usually they don't get
bid<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.840> up<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.799> that's<00:01:52.459> a<00:01:52.579> good<00:01:52.700> thing<00:01:52.759> but<00:01:53.569> the

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
bid it up so that's a good thing but the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.050 
bid it up so that's a good thing but the
question<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.259> when<00:01:54.469> will<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.709> be<00:01:54.770> back<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.280> last

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
question is when will it be back so last

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.020 
question is when will it be back so last
year<00:01:56.270> EA<00:01:56.990> took<00:01:57.380> down<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.709> web<00:01:57.829> app<00:01:58.009> it<00:01:58.670> was

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
year EA took down the web app it was

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.550 
year EA took down the web app it was
around<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.389> star<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.899> did<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.049> video<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.409> it

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
around the star and did a video on it

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.989 
around the star and did a video on it
when<00:02:00.709> the<00:02:00.740> web<00:02:00.950> back<00:02:01.069> she<00:02:01.189> got<00:02:01.310> taken<00:02:01.459> down<00:02:01.759> I

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
when the web back she got taken down I

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.699 
when the web back she got taken down I
think<00:02:02.600> last<00:02:02.749> year<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.139> was<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.289> couple<00:02:03.619> months

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
think last year it was a couple months

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.819 
think last year it was a couple months
later<00:02:03.859> though<00:02:04.630> around<00:02:05.630> like<00:02:05.779> march<00:02:06.049> time<00:02:06.409> it

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
later though around like march time it

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.320 
later though around like march time it
was<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.979> march<00:02:07.219> I<00:02:07.429> things<00:02:07.609> like<00:02:07.789> end<00:02:07.969> of<00:02:08.119> March

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
was a march I things like end of March

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.670 
was a march I things like end of March
but<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.789> believe<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.240> we<00:02:12.050> probably<00:02:12.350> won't<00:02:12.530> be

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
but I believe that we probably won't be

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.800 
but I believe that we probably won't be
seeing<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> way<00:02:13.130> life<00:02:13.280> until<00:02:13.520> FIFA<00:02:13.819> 16<00:02:14.000> just

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
seeing the way life until FIFA 16 just

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.429 
seeing the way life until FIFA 16 just
like<00:02:14.959> they<00:02:15.080> did<00:02:15.140> last<00:02:15.260> year<00:02:16.000> around<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.120> time

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
like they did last year around this time

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.780 
like they did last year around this time
since<00:02:18.439> coin<00:02:18.680> sellers<00:02:19.040> are<00:02:19.159> selling<00:02:19.400> corn<00:02:19.610> so

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
since coin sellers are selling corn so

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.330 
since coin sellers are selling corn so
chief<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.269> stuff<00:02:20.480> eh<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.500> try<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:21.799> take<00:02:22.159> out

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
chief and stuff eh is try and take out

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.280 
chief and stuff eh is try and take out
the<00:02:22.370> web<00:02:22.670> app

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the web app

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.800 
the web app
so<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.829> coin<00:02:24.189> prices<00:02:24.340> go<00:02:24.700> back<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.939> there's

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
so the coin prices go back up there's

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.339 
so the coin prices go back up there's
less<00:02:25.930> people<00:02:26.290> buying<00:02:26.530> coins<00:02:27.329> so<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.989> web<00:02:29.170> app

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
less people buying coins so the web app

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.589 
less people buying coins so the web app
if<00:02:29.650> we're<00:02:30.640> lucky<00:02:30.670> we'll<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.420> back<00:02:31.450> before

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
if we're lucky we'll get it back before

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.899 
if we're lucky we'll get it back before
the<00:02:32.379> FIFA<00:02:32.680> 16<00:02:32.829> if<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.340> think<00:02:33.549> that's<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.760> good

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
the FIFA 16 if you think that's a good

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.149 
the FIFA 16 if you think that's a good
thing<00:02:33.969> for<00:02:34.329> me<00:02:34.870> I'm<00:02:35.049> nicely<00:02:35.349> too<00:02:35.530> bothered<00:02:35.950> I'm

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
thing for me I'm nicely too bothered I'm

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.709 
thing for me I'm nicely too bothered I'm
fine<00:02:36.849> with<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.060> down<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.540> honest

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
fine with it down to be honest

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.679 
fine with it down to be honest
kilometers<00:02:38.109> train<00:02:38.290> on<00:02:38.439> the<00:02:38.530> console<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.760> we

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
kilometers train on the console so we

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.420 
kilometers train on the console so we
might<00:02:40.959> see<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.349> make<00:02:41.709> sure<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.890> follow<00:02:42.129> me<00:02:42.280> on

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
might see it make sure to follow me on

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.610

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
about that sort of stuff but we probably

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.929 
about that sort of stuff but we probably
won't<00:02:47.530> be<00:02:47.709> seen<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:47.980> web<00:02:48.159> app<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.489> FIFA<00:02:48.790> 16

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
won't be seen the web app to a FIFA 16

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.709 
won't be seen the web app to a FIFA 16
and<00:02:50.340> yet<00:02:51.340> fever<00:02:51.670> 16<00:02:52.030> it'll<00:02:52.359> probably<00:02:52.540> happen

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:52.719 
and yet fever 16 it'll probably happen

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.080 
and yet fever 16 it'll probably happen
exactly<00:02:53.109> the<00:02:53.650> same<00:02:53.829> again<00:02:54.099> it<00:02:54.790> will<00:02:54.879> be<00:02:54.939> able

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
exactly the same again it will be able

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.940 
exactly the same again it will be able
to<00:02:55.269> start<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.659> game<00:02:55.689> then<00:02:56.470> we'll<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.799> get

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
to start the game then we'll just get

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.940 
to start the game then we'll just get
taken<00:02:57.310> down<00:02:57.340> Oh<00:02:58.049> probably<00:02:59.049> would<00:02:59.739> have<00:02:59.799> had<00:02:59.920> a
