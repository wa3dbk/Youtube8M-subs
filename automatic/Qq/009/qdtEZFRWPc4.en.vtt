00:00:04.967 --> 00:00:08.867
 It should not be difficult to fight for silver coins. 

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.367
 Actually not so simple 

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.567
 Saving coins requires some knowledge and special skills 

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.300
 I want to do a good job not only to do a good job. 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.467
 Also keep in mind the strategic tips 

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:33.400
 For example, choosing the right car is very important. 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.400
 The highest-order chariot will not bring the biggest benefit 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.133
 Although the tenth-order chariot is invincible 

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.567
 But the cost is also extremely expensive 

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.467
 Such as shells, repairs... 

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:46.200
 Just like buying a horse-drawn carriage for fuel economy, it’s not worth the candle. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.267
 If the target is silver coins, you must choose a chariot with high income but low maintenance. 

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.233
 The most balanced chariot usually appears in the 8th order 

00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:03.600
 No special consumables are needed, and the necessary items are enough: kit, first aid kit, high explosives and composite armor-piercing projectiles 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.100
 However, you can use it when you are snoring. 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.333
 If something doesn’t come in handy this time, don’t buy it next time. 

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.367
 It’s right to save money and fight! 

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.267
 The most important way to start from combat 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.300
 The basic scores for any battle are: 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.900
 • Participating in silver coins 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.933
 • Multiplied by the vehicle class 

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:23.700
 • Victory bonus 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.167
 The rest is dependent on performance. 

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:29.000
 The calculation is based on the magnification and formula. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.267
 In fact, it is not difficult to understand, let's take a look 

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.267
 The first magnification is the silver coin associated with life. 

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.800
 Very simple, the more damage you cause, the higher the silver coin 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.700
 The enemy’s fire and the ammunition rack are the most profitable 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.433
 Hit a shot to get the damage ten times 

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.700
 These tips also have some tips. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.333
 First of all, destroying the enemy will not add points, focusing on the amount of damage. 

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:58.967
 Second, if you hit a target that someone else has detected, the profit will be reduced by a quarter. 

00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:03.833
 But if you help your teammates find the target, you can get half of the damage to the silver coin. 

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:06.133
 And don't have to waste shells 

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:11.267
 Sometimes, when a competent scout is better than a chariot 

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:14.367
 The first person to find an enemy can get a fixed bonus. 

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:18.667
 But if there are too many scouts, everyone can only split the profits. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.300
 This is the main source of income and depends entirely on personal skills. 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.600
 In addition to injury and reconnaissance, there are other ways to score 

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:30.700
 Occupation base can also add points 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.133
 If you occupy the base, regardless of how much contribution your teammates make, the profits are equally divided. 

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:39.767
 It’s useless to run away after a few minutes of occupation. 

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:43.233
 Next time, for fun, you decide to destroy all enemy forces. 

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:47.400
 First think about whether it will be better to occupy the enemy base. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.867
 Injury and reconnaissance of silver coins after the war 

00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:54.233
 Will multiply the individual coefficients of each tank 

00:02:54.333 --> 00:03:01.233
 In addition, the value-added account has a third bonus, multiplying the silver coin by 1.5. 

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.767
 Of course, you can’t make too many silver coins by one war. 

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:08.567
 So when you need an overall strategy, the combat mission can help. 

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:13.700
 If your goal is to complete all your daily tasks, keep in mind these elements that affect silver coins. 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.400
 You can accumulate a lot of silver coins right away. 

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:32.267
 Is it not so difficult to earn silver coins by using snoring? 

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:35.333
 Come to the battle, I wish you a high singer!
