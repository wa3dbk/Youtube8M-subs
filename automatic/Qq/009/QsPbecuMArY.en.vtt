80 85 minutes to put a right shift in
and<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:58.830> what<00:01:59.010> we<00:01:59.130> say<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.310> them<00:01:59.550> you<00:02:00.060> put<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
and that's what we say to them you put a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.900 
and that's what we say to them you put a
shift<00:02:00.720> in<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.500> we'll<00:02:01.620> drag<00:02:01.800> you<00:02:01.950> off<00:02:02.100> you

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
shift in and then we'll drag you off you

know<00:02:03.030> simple<00:02:03.450> as<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.810> got<00:02:03.990> strong<00:02:04.440> bench

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
know simple as that we got strong bench

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.150 
know simple as that we got strong bench
so<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.610> need<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> utilize<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:07.040> you<00:02:08.040> know

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and even our own players were a bit

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.910 
and even our own players were a bit
gobsmacked<00:02:40.860> by<00:02:40.920> some<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.940> his<00:02:42.030> ability<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.920> you

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
gobsmacked by some of his ability so you

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.140 
gobsmacked by some of his ability so you
know<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.190> know<00:02:44.310> what<00:02:44.459> he<00:02:44.550> brings<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:45.030> know

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
know we know what he brings we know

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.120 
know we know what he brings we know
where<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.480> bring<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.930> team<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.380> i

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
where you can bring to the team and i

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.699 
where you can bring to the team and i
thought<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:48.120> actually<00:02:48.269> a<00:02:48.570> good<00:02:48.810> move<00:02:49.380> him

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
thought was actually a good move him

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.820 
thought was actually a good move him
coming<00:02:50.070> on<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.549> fair<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.940> know<00:02:51.030> when<00:02:51.570> we

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
coming on to be fair you know when we

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.320 
coming on to be fair you know when we
kind<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.890> went<00:02:53.040> ahead<00:02:53.190> sometimes<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.299> think

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
kind of went ahead sometimes you think

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.390 
kind of went ahead sometimes you think
about<00:02:54.540> showing<00:02:54.989> things<00:02:55.170> up<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.739> i<00:02:55.980> think<00:02:56.310> it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
about showing things up and i think it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.740 
about showing things up and i think it
was<00:02:56.489> maybe<00:02:56.670> better<00:02:57.000> actually<00:02:57.209> bringing<00:02:57.600> him

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
was maybe better actually bringing him

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.350 
was maybe better actually bringing him
on<00:02:57.900> because<00:02:58.049> i<00:02:58.320> think<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.680> saw<00:02:58.920> how<00:02:59.910> two<00:02:59.970> or

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
on because i think you saw how two or

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.270 
on because i think you saw how two or
three<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.840> our<00:03:01.080> players<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.590> reacted<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.100> hear

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
three of our players and reacted to hear

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.070 
three of our players and reacted to hear
me<00:03:02.430> seems<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.000> get<00:03:03.150> everyone<00:03:03.390> playing<00:03:03.750> it's

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
me seems to get everyone playing it's

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.320 
me seems to get everyone playing it's
that<00:03:04.230> kind<00:03:04.500> of<00:03:04.560> player<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.100> sudden<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.120> see

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
that kind of player so sudden you see

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.800 
that kind of player so sudden you see
matt's<00:03:06.570> he<00:03:07.049> gets<00:03:07.320> lively<00:03:07.830> see<00:03:08.220> Kiko<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.090> we

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
matt's he gets lively see Kiko and we

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.150 
matt's he gets lively see Kiko and we
start<00:03:10.110> keeping<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.470> ball<00:03:10.650> better<00:03:10.950> i<00:03:11.070> think

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
start keeping the ball better i think

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.280 
start keeping the ball better i think
that's<00:03:11.489> one<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.850> his<00:03:12.060> greatest<00:03:12.600> assets<00:03:13.110> not

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
that's one of his greatest assets not

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.770 
that's one of his greatest assets not
just<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.620> skill<00:03:13.920> but<00:03:14.160> he<00:03:14.850> gets<00:03:15.120> other<00:03:15.330> people

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
just a skill but he gets other people

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.289 
just a skill but he gets other people
ticking<00:03:16.500> as<00:03:16.620> well<00:03:16.830> which<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:18.000> know<00:03:18.150> we

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
ticking as well which you know we

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.449 
ticking as well which you know we
haven't<00:03:18.600> really<00:03:18.690> had<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.110> late<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.799> i<00:03:20.100> think<00:03:20.250> he

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
haven't really had of late so i think he

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.770 
haven't really had of late so i think he
could<00:03:20.640> be<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.760> big<00:03:20.970> asset<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.420> our<00:03:21.510> team<00:03:21.570> and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
could be a big asset to our team and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.270 
could be a big asset to our team and
it's<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.320> about<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.650> know<00:03:22.739> keep<00:03:22.980> getting

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
it's just about you know keep getting

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.759 
it's just about you know keep getting
him<00:03:23.370> fit<00:03:23.640> now<00:03:23.900> getting<00:03:24.900> him<00:03:24.989> integrated<00:03:25.530> into

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
him fit now getting him integrated into

the<00:03:44.730> pitch<00:03:44.909> of<00:03:45.090> wheels<00:03:45.269> yes<00:03:45.599> they<00:03:45.930> kind<00:03:46.290> of

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
the pitch of wheels yes they kind of

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.369
