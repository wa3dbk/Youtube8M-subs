00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.879
 good evening everyone is thomas de nokia des 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.389
 points like and this time I you 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.410
 offers a small demo of the new 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.010
 the new speaker nokia and jbl the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.779
 power the big format there is a small 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.180
 format also call it up 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.080
 it seems to me from nokia jbl also who is 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.099
 smaller that looks like an old 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.520
 version cape fangs sixty 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.920
 look like this in this style 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.500
 that is to say more this side matt and me the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.579
 metal side who finally needs who the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.960
 maybe interested a little less because 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.730
 that it is ultimately by training that we have 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.030
 already seen while here we have something 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.039
 of totally new proposed with jbl 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.920
 So she makes a very good sound wing 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.379
 walk via nscc marked here 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.149
 so she works through bluetooth and she 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.850
 also allows wireless charging of the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.489
 phone including lumia 920 and lumia 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.510
 800 twenty when at the appropriate time 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.479
 here it comes with so here I 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.740
 a model closely so I do not have the box 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 I do not think I have an official box 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.890
 that I have an all- white box 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.360
 nothing marked on it in the box that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.119
 I had the charger I sector 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.020
 which is plugged in there the mains charger 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.790
 I had a jack jack cable to plug in 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.930
 on the other exit because it works 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.030
 by bluetooth or parkak 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.340
 there is a USB cable also I have not 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 had with so I do not know if he is so 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.119
 provides me I did not have them and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.119
 the on off button 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.520
 what more to say about the beast I could 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.610
 power in mind it seems to me that these 2 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.860
 x 10 watts 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.940
 2 x 10 watts it seems like that's it 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.580
 seems little eh when you are told two 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.270
 times 10 watts did 20 watts in total 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.050
 do not worry I tested them 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.190
 just before there is a sound it's very 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.300
 very good of course it will not make you 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.160
 beautiful night in the summer for an apartment 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.100
 know I'm an apartment and got 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.120
 largely largely enough that's good 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.590
 that she is walking as I wanted 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.460
 dikes and nfc she recharges from 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.350
 cordless phones 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.310
 the nfc allows a connection 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.610
 bluetooth faster and that's so I 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.170
 showed you I have here it was him 1920 me 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:27.620
 read 1920 yellow so I want that that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:30.350
 gives lessons you heard was 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.730
 already logged in g logo i have the logo of 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.300
 job just above that says that 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.290
 so that's it my phone is connected 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.030
 the enclosure also we see it 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.980
 the whole thing went on and the logo 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.810
 bluetooth is on here too 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.100
 so in this logo is there is lit in 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.049
 blue that means something that is 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.130
 connected so there and disown them if I run 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:58.430
 I start my music 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:03:01.820
 logically it should turn I can 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.290
 adjust the sound here and there if I do not lie 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.900
 take I'm not from me 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.159
 I'm just going to turn up the sound for 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.599
 you 're not going to go 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.220
 count of big thing I'm filming with 1 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.110
 800 reading view so there are microphones 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.700
 the three microphones with recording see this 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.090
 that it gives but finally if I go up to 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.090
 charge 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.600
 so you've seen that shows too 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.010
 very very high level of sound there is 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.110
 no problem to redo for one for one 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.830
 apartment in front she has to 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.000
 roughly correspondingly it does not 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.620
 roughly speaking when we look 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.700
 here in fact we see that it's been 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.670
 close to the same size and we see the round 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.370
 of teeth in fact I am convinced that it 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.020
 must be the equivalent of 2 well not this 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.910
 model there but the new j lamps 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.070
 led who have a hard time with his debt 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.360
 equivalent of two like that undermines me ity 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.080
 so you have there maybe the power 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.459
 2.2 play-offs in 1 but finally it's 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.330
 impressive we see it from elsewhere 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.700
 is that on a speaker so it's 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.459
 like on the pin up and that this is the 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.550
 pay 360 it's like on the wound up on 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.970
 at the exit for what's called the 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.570
 low but it's fast it's fast said 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:34.630
 on this one we have a lot of this 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:37.100
 which would confirm what would confirm that 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.870
 so knows two more speakers up to 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.110
 note finally it's the equivalent of two 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:45.410
 years I like that you saw I 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.650
 direct my music from here when I can 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:53.200
 the enclosure to direct 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.200
 if I want to play music here 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.090
 how does it work very well and so 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.850
 the little novelty with this speaker 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:14.270
 is that it is also to 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.740
 pause for you hear it and that's it 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.639
 had the little beep that confirms that the 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.550
 phone is changing 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.880
 by the way we see the frame that lights up 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.530
 when the phone charges here who 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.790
 therefore indicates that the phone is so 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.190
 well placed is where it gets 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.169
 place and I 'm not going here because my 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.790
 phone is not fully charged 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.280
 but it seems to me that when he is 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.300
 loaded up this little light there 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.100
 by the way in the video you see at 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.500
 himself and in union does not want to valid 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.000
 and do not see read my parents and well what 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.860
 little light there it must light up when 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.139
 the phone is fully charged but the 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:54.040
 blow we can put his music there 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:54.040
 recharge is still seen here 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.460
 it loads 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:14.199
 it's the same for a disconnection and 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:21.219
 here I am disconnected from the gipn and 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:25.919
 the seer became white here for the 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:30.490
 jbl power so this one is available 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.930
 it goes from 299 euros to a lot more expensive 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.819
 up to his must go up to 400 euros 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.189
 on some sites but the site I you 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:40.090
 I put the article on nokia points 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:42.699
 like the site phone call point fr 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.699
 so a site exclusively devices and 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:49.240
 accessories mocks at the front of color 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.469
 cyan like here white and black 299 euros 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.009
 so it's the lowest price on the market 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:54.639
 currently in France and they are 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.629
 available 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.629
 here
