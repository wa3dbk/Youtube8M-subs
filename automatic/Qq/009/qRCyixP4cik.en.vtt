let's talk about melee DPS and range dps
real<00:05:19.080> quick<00:05:19.290> so<00:05:20.160> if<00:05:20.370> we're<00:05:20.580> going<00:05:20.760> under<00:05:21.180> let's

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
real quick so if we're going under let's

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.730 
real quick so if we're going under let's
go<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:22.490> warlock<00:05:23.490> or<00:05:23.730> warlock<00:05:24.690> is<00:05:24.930> a<00:05:24.990> spell

caster they're going to be staying away

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.730 
caster they're going to be staying away
