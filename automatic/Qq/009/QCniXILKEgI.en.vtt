kind<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.500> changed<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.660> year<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:29.260> went

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
kind of changed for this year we went

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.660 
kind of changed for this year we went
back<00:02:29.760> run<00:02:30.760> away<00:02:30.850> from<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:32.100> from<00:02:33.100> your<00:02:33.400> case

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.699 
back run away from the from your case
from<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> active<00:02:34.360> gear<00:02:34.750> kiss<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.230> went<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.680> a

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
from the active gear kiss and went to a
