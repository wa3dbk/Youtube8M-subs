00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
signature here slopes a little upwards

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
signature here slopes a little upwards
from<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> rest<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> writing<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> you

optimism so this person is also wishing

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.369 
optimism so this person is also wishing
to<00:00:53.309> appear<00:00:53.789> maybe<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.420> little<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:55.199> optimistic

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to appear maybe a little more optimistic

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.639 
to appear maybe a little more optimistic
than<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:57.020> this<00:00:58.020> person<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
than they actually are this person is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.580 
than they actually are this person is
very<00:00:58.879> optimistic<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.809> how<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> slopes

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
very optimistic see how that slopes

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.529 
very optimistic see how that slopes
upwards<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.280> also<00:01:02.520> very<00:01:02.730> confident<00:01:03.300> it's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
upwards and also very confident it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.939 
upwards and also very confident it's
fairly<00:01:03.840> large<00:01:04.080> writing<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.830> it's

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
fairly large writing and it's

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.230 
fairly large writing and it's
underscored<00:01:07.010> this<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.220> again<00:01:08.850> has<00:01:09.060> an

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
underscored this one again has an

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.140 
underscored this one again has an
underscore<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.670> see<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.030> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
underscore and the you can see that this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
underscore and the you can see that this
underscore<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.200> looks<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.619> bit

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
underscore actually looks a little bit

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.130 
underscore actually looks a little bit
like<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> dollar<00:01:14.490> sign<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.150> its<00:01:15.330> side<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.630> what

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
like a dollar sign on its side so what

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.570 
like a dollar sign on its side so what
would<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.409> indicate<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.040> person<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
would that indicate this person is

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.950 
would that indicate this person is
fairly<00:01:17.850> concerned<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.659> money<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.780> this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
fairly concerned about money and this

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.410 
fairly concerned about money and this
one<00:01:22.170> even<00:01:22.409> more<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> writing

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
one even more and the and the writing

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.469 
one even more and the and the writing
itself<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.930> extremely<00:01:25.439> angular<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.549> you've

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
itself is extremely angular and you've

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.780 
itself is extremely angular and you've
got<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.259> ornate<00:01:28.890> kind<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
got this very ornate kind of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.819 
got this very ornate kind of
underscoring<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.290> doesn't<00:01:34.710> have

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
underscoring here this it doesn't have

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
underscoring here this it doesn't have
an<00:01:34.950> underscore<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> has<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> very

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
an underscore but what it has is a very

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.330 
an underscore but what it has is a very
long<00:01:38.030> dynamic<00:01:39.030> T<00:01:39.960> stem<00:01:41.180> DT<00:01:42.180> bar<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.780> should<00:01:43.079> say

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
long dynamic T stem DT bar I should say

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.319 
long dynamic T stem DT bar I should say
crossing<00:01:44.340> over<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:44.850> which<00:01:44.970> goes<00:01:45.210> over

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
crossing over here which goes over

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.289 
crossing over here which goes over
almost<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.869> whole<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.530> name<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.299> this

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
almost the whole of the name and this

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.170 
almost the whole of the name and this
one<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:48.930> interesting<00:01:49.579> he<00:01:50.579> has<00:01:50.700> actually

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
one is very interesting he has actually

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.630 
one is very interesting he has actually
crossed<00:01:51.570> himself<00:01:51.930> out<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:53.040> his<00:01:53.369> signature

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
crossed himself out with his signature

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.050 
crossed himself out with his signature
and<00:01:54.509> what<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.899> indicates<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.700> somebody<00:01:56.700> who

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and what that indicates is somebody who

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.440 
and what that indicates is somebody who
is<00:01:57.619> almost<00:01:58.619> trying<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.280> cross<00:01:59.670> himself<00:01:59.939> out

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
is almost trying to cross himself out

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.080 
is almost trying to cross himself out
and<00:02:01.280> occasionally<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.369> might<00:02:02.490> see<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.909> in

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and occasionally you might see this in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.450 
and occasionally you might see this in
somebody's<00:02:03.329> signature<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.040> actually

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
somebody's signature this is actually

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.320 
somebody's signature this is actually
somewhat<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.970> could<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.300> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
somewhat of a this this could be a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.540 
somewhat of a this this could be a
challenging<00:02:09.929> sign<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
challenging sign if you see this and
