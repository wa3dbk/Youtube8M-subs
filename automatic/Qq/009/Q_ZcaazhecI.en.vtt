alright thanks for checking us out today

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.850 
alright thanks for checking us out today
this<00:00:22.450> is<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.750> demonstration<00:00:23.050> for<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.650> rank

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
this is the demonstration for the rank

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.000 
this is the demonstration for the rank
of<00:00:24.100> fat<00:00:24.700> B<00:00:25.000> boost<00:00:25.840> pedal<00:00:26.020> it's<00:00:26.770> a<00:00:26.830> boost

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
of fat B boost pedal it's a boost

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.460 
of fat B boost pedal it's a boost
pedal<00:00:27.160> made<00:00:27.520> for<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:27.849> bass<00:00:28.000> guitar<00:00:28.420> and<00:00:28.689> what

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
pedal made for the bass guitar and what

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.230 
pedal made for the bass guitar and what
it's<00:00:29.590> intended<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:30.160> do<00:00:30.340> is<00:00:30.640> obviously<00:00:30.939> just

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
it's intended to do is obviously just

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.060 
it's intended to do is obviously just
add<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.599> nice<00:00:31.840> little<00:00:31.869> boost<00:00:32.320> if<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:32.770> need<00:00:32.920> it

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
add a nice little boost if you need it

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.930 
add a nice little boost if you need it
for<00:00:33.250> a<00:00:33.309> you<00:00:33.790> know<00:00:33.820> chorus<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.480> bridge<00:00:34.510> or<00:00:35.080> a<00:00:35.940> you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
for a you know chorus a bridge or a you

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.600 
for a you know chorus a bridge or a you
know<00:00:37.000> occasional<00:00:37.540> bass<00:00:37.690> solo<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:39.460> of<00:00:39.550> the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
know occasional bass solo one of the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.729 
know occasional bass solo one of the
things<00:00:39.820> that<00:00:40.000> this<00:00:40.150> really<00:00:40.960> adds<00:00:41.170> it's<00:00:41.530> really

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
things that this really adds it's really

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.350 
things that this really adds it's really
nice<00:00:41.890> is<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.160> get<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.309> J<00:00:42.550> fat<00:00:42.790> at<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:42.940> input

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
nice is you get a J fat at the input

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.939 
nice is you get a J fat at the input
which<00:00:43.510> sort<00:00:43.720> of<00:00:43.809> opens<00:00:44.110> things<00:00:44.260> up<00:00:44.500> brightens

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
which sort of opens things up brightens

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.100 
which sort of opens things up brightens
things<00:00:45.010> up<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.670> hair<00:00:46.239> it<00:00:46.480> doesn't<00:00:46.629> add<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:46.840> ton<00:00:47.080> of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
things up a hair it doesn't add a ton of

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.509 
things up a hair it doesn't add a ton of
trouble<00:00:47.500> but<00:00:47.620> just<00:00:47.650> you<00:00:48.010> know<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.220> only<00:00:48.340> way<00:00:48.460> I

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
trouble but just you know the only way I

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:49.920 
trouble but just you know the only way I
can<00:00:48.610> describe<00:00:48.790> it<00:00:49.150> is<00:00:49.239> you<00:00:49.449> just<00:00:49.629> hear<00:00:49.750> things

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
can describe it is you just hear things

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.869 
can describe it is you just hear things
sort<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.260> open<00:00:50.559> up<00:00:50.680> like<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:50.890> good<00:00:51.159> preamp<00:00:51.640> in<00:00:51.850> a

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
sort of open up like a good preamp in a

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.600 
sort of open up like a good preamp in a
you<00:00:52.330> know<00:00:52.390> in<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.600> good<00:00:52.720> studio<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.370> then<00:00:54.519> it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
you know in a good studio and then it

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.390 
you know in a good studio and then it
goes<00:00:54.760> into<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.170> germanium<00:00:56.920> part<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.339> the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
goes into the the germanium part of the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.369 
goes into the the germanium part of the
circuit<00:00:57.760> which<00:00:57.850> has<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.030> new<00:00:58.239> old<00:00:58.420> stock<00:00:58.540> 60s

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
circuit which has a new old stock 60s

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.310 
circuit which has a new old stock 60s
germanium<00:01:00.100> transistor<00:01:00.699> and<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.989> happens

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
germanium transistor and what happens

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.350 
germanium transistor and what happens
there<00:01:02.620> is<00:01:02.650> it<00:01:03.040> just<00:01:03.220> adds<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.580> little<00:01:03.760> bit<00:01:03.879> of<00:01:04.030> a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
there is it just adds a little bit of a

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.600 
there is it just adds a little bit of a
little<00:01:04.629> bit<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.870> grit<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:06.040> little<00:01:06.400> bit<00:01:06.490> of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
little bit of grit and a little bit of

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.510 
little bit of grit and a little bit of
girth<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.570> just<00:01:08.500> it<00:01:08.710> gets<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.100> really<00:01:09.310> nice

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
girth and just it gets a really nice

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.890 
girth and just it gets a really nice
thing<00:01:09.760> happening<00:01:10.150> it's<00:01:10.299> one<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:10.479> those<00:01:10.540> pedals

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
thing happening it's one of those pedals

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.120 
thing happening it's one of those pedals
or<00:01:11.020> once<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.320> have<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.619> on<00:01:11.740> you're<00:01:11.950> gonna<00:01:12.040> be

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
or once you have it on you're gonna be

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.680 
or once you have it on you're gonna be
reluctant<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.670> turn<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.000> off<00:01:13.119> but<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.420> doesn't

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
reluctant to turn it off but it doesn't

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.630 
reluctant to turn it off but it doesn't
color<00:01:13.810> things<00:01:14.170> too<00:01:14.350> much<00:01:14.560> it's<00:01:15.070> not<00:01:15.130> intended

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
color things too much it's not intended

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.370 
color things too much it's not intended
to<00:01:15.670> be<00:01:15.760> totally<00:01:16.299> transparent<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:17.170> some

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
to be totally transparent like some

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.830 
to be totally transparent like some
clean<00:01:17.560> boosts<00:01:17.830> I<00:01:18.010> did<00:01:18.340> want<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.360> affect<00:01:19.479> the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
clean boosts I did want it to affect the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.780 
clean boosts I did want it to affect the
sound<00:01:20.140> I<00:01:20.380> did<00:01:20.590> want<00:01:20.799> it<00:01:20.890> you<00:01:21.340> know<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.520> to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
sound I did want it you know you to

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.230 
sound I did want it you know you to
really<00:01:22.000> notice<00:01:22.390> when<00:01:22.570> it's<00:01:22.719> on<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:25.060> it

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
really notice when it's on but it

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.580 
really notice when it's on but it
doesn't<00:01:25.509> color<00:01:25.630> things<00:01:25.899> too<00:01:26.109> much<00:01:26.259> you<00:01:26.500> know

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
doesn't color things too much you know

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.609 
doesn't color things too much you know
and<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.829> also<00:01:27.600> makes<00:01:28.600> things<00:01:28.719> really<00:01:29.170> nice<00:01:29.320> for

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
and it also makes things really nice for

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.249 
and it also makes things really nice for
going<00:01:29.770> into<00:01:30.189> you<00:01:31.030> know<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.149> compressor<00:01:31.869> either

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
going into you know a compressor either

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.480 
going into you know a compressor either
before<00:01:32.680> after<00:01:32.950> you're<00:01:33.189> going<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.369> get

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
before after you're going to get

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.580 
before after you're going to get
different<00:01:33.670> results<00:01:33.850> but<00:01:34.719> it<00:01:35.020> works<00:01:35.439> really

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
different results but it works really

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.200 
different results but it works really
well<00:01:35.710> with<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.250> can<00:01:36.369> also<00:01:36.490> be<00:01:36.640> used<00:01:37.000> as<00:01:37.149> a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
well with that it can also be used as a

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.749 
well with that it can also be used as a
little<00:01:37.570> mini<00:01:37.719> preamp<00:01:38.200> for<00:01:38.500> going<00:01:39.280> into<00:01:39.460> your

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
little mini preamp for going into your

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.609 
little mini preamp for going into your
da<00:01:40.060> W<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.630> kind<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.899> add<00:01:41.109> a<00:01:41.140> little<00:01:41.380> life<00:01:41.590> to

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
da W to kind of add a little life to

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.410 
da W to kind of add a little life to
your<00:01:41.979> bass<00:01:42.130> before<00:01:42.429> things<00:01:42.820> are<00:01:43.030> converted<00:01:43.390> to

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
your bass before things are converted to

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.810 
your bass before things are converted to
ones<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:43.840> zeros<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:45.039> also<00:01:45.189> sounds<00:01:45.640> good

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
ones and zeros and it also sounds good

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.849 
ones and zeros and it also sounds good
as<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.030> pre<00:01:46.420> preamp<00:01:46.840> meaning<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.350> can<00:01:47.499> hit<00:01:47.619> this

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
as a pre preamp meaning you can hit this

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.039 
as a pre preamp meaning you can hit this
and<00:01:48.189> then<00:01:48.579> go<00:01:48.759> into<00:01:48.939> any<00:01:49.270> standard<00:01:49.539> sort<00:01:49.990> of

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
and then go into any standard sort of

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.020 
and then go into any standard sort of
you<00:01:50.229> know<00:01:50.289> preamp<00:01:50.770> for<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.100> going<00:01:51.219> to<00:01:51.280> UD<00:01:51.549> aw

you know preamp for you going to UD aw
it's<00:01:52.240> still<00:01:52.509> going<00:01:52.719> to<00:01:52.780> add<00:01:52.899> some<00:01:53.229> nice<00:01:53.409> life

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
it's still going to add some nice life

it's still going to add some nice life
to<00:01:53.829> it<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.429> also<00:01:54.759> for<00:01:55.240> for<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.689> pedal<00:01:56.229> as

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
germanium transistor and there it's very

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.050 
germanium transistor and there it's very
very<00:01:58.299> quiet<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:59.560> did<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.429> know<00:02:00.520> quite<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:00.789> few

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
very quiet I did you know quite a few

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.200 
very quiet I did you know quite a few
things<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:02.649> you<00:02:03.429> know<00:02:03.549> did<00:02:03.939> everything

things that in you know did everything

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.639 
things that in you know did everything
that<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.450> could<00:02:04.719> to<00:02:04.749> make<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.020> as<00:02:05.200> quiet<00:02:05.530> as

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
that I could to make it as quiet as

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.730 
that I could to make it as quiet as
possible<00:02:06.130> including<00:02:06.280> putting<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:06.999> big<00:02:07.179> old<00:02:07.329> fat

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
of those noise problems I'm going to go

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.760 
of those noise problems I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.550> give<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> little<00:02:14.170> sample<00:02:14.380> here

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
ahead and give you a little sample here

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.170 
ahead and give you a little sample here
what<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.100> does<00:02:16.620> just<00:02:17.620> get<00:02:17.800> my<00:02:17.920> volume<00:02:18.370> up<00:02:18.490> here

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.960 

there's<00:02:21.989> going<00:02:22.079> to<00:02:22.170> be<00:02:22.260> my<00:02:22.409> clean<00:02:23.099> semi<00:02:23.519> bypass

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
there's going to be my clean semi bypass

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:32.780 
there's going to be my clean semi bypass
now<00:02:30.799> I'm<00:02:31.799> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.010> turn<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.220> pedal<00:02:32.489> on<00:02:32.579> here

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
now I'm going to turn the pedal on here

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.280 
now I'm going to turn the pedal on here
I'm<00:02:32.849> not<00:02:32.970> giving<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.329> a<00:02:33.420> ton<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.599> volume<00:02:33.840> boost

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
I'm not giving it a ton of volume boost

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.539 
I'm not giving it a ton of volume boost
this<00:02:34.439> is<00:02:34.500> going<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:34.829> be<00:02:34.980> more<00:02:35.250> you're<00:02:35.400> just

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
this is going to be more you're just

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:45.340 
this is going to be more you're just
hearing<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> pedal<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.420> doing

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.200 

what<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.190> hear<00:02:46.340> there's<00:02:46.520> like<00:02:46.790> it's

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
what you can hear there's like it's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.090 
what you can hear there's like it's
almost<00:02:47.960> all<00:02:48.290> sudden<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.770> hear<00:02:48.980> the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
almost all sudden you can hear the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.710 
almost all sudden you can hear the
strings<00:02:49.490> you<00:02:49.730> can<00:02:49.760> hear<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.120> pick<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.600> know

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
strings you can hear the pick you know

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.790 
strings you can hear the pick you know
hitting<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.140> strings<00:02:51.410> but<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.710> not

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
hitting the strings but it's not

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.490 
hitting the strings but it's not
necessarily<00:02:52.310> just<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.580> treble<00:02:52.970> who's<00:02:53.120> because

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
necessarily just a treble who's because

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.110 
necessarily just a treble who's because
that's<00:02:54.500> not<00:02:54.650> what<00:02:54.800> it's<00:02:54.950> doing<00:02:55.190> here<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
that's not what it's doing here the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.120 
that's not what it's doing here the
what's<00:02:56.810> happening<00:02:57.260> here<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.650> kind<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:57.980> you

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
what's happening here is you kind of you

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.500 
what's happening here is you kind of you
know<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.310> way<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.460> picture<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.360> got

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
know the way I picture is that you got

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.900 
know the way I picture is that you got
the<00:02:59.630> mid-range<00:02:59.990> here<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:01.250> doesn't<00:03:01.640> smooth

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
the mid-range here and it doesn't smooth

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.970 
the mid-range here and it doesn't smooth
out<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.300> mid-range<00:03:02.690> what<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.170> does<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.830> so

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
out the mid-range what it does is it so

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.380 
out the mid-range what it does is it so
it<00:03:04.040> brings<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.460> lows<00:03:04.730> up<00:03:04.970> around<00:03:05.240> that

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
it brings the lows up around that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.120 
it brings the lows up around that
mid-range<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.020> then<00:03:06.110> opens<00:03:06.380> up<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.560> top<00:03:06.860> and

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
mid-range and then opens up the top and

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.950 
mid-range and then opens up the top and
just<00:03:07.160> sort<00:03:07.460> of<00:03:07.550> really<00:03:08.210> gives<00:03:08.420> things<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.780> nice

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
just sort of really gives things a nice

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.450 
just sort of really gives things a nice
even<00:03:09.350> sound<00:03:09.620> without<00:03:10.010> necessarily

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
even sound without necessarily

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:24.790 
even sound without necessarily
compressing<00:03:11.590> okay<00:03:12.590> here's<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.010> clean<00:03:13.280> signal

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:36.880 

I'm<00:03:25.800> gonna<00:03:25.950> turn<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.280> pedal<00:03:26.580> on<00:03:26.670> here
