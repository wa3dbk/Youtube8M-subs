got your inside handle for the middle

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.530 
got your inside handle for the middle
back<00:00:35.960> we're<00:00:36.960> gonna<00:00:37.110> start<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> upper

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
back we're gonna start with the upper

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.690 
back we're gonna start with the upper
overhand<00:00:39.540> grip<00:00:39.629> first<00:00:40.160> now<00:00:41.160> Jason's<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.610> be

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
overhand grip first now Jason's gonna be

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
overhand grip first now Jason's gonna be
arching<00:00:42.090> his<00:00:42.180> back<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.649> board<00:00:43.890> intense

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
arching his back and the board intense

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.979 
arching his back and the board intense
in<00:00:44.309> his<00:00:44.399> abs<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> stays<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.870> his

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989

you go six to ten repetitions depending

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.529 
you go six to ten repetitions depending
if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.039> lower<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> repetitions<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.390> for

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
if you lower the repetitions more for

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.560 
now again if you're going for strength
training<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.800> take<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.460> rest<00:02:01.000> between<00:02:01.330> sets

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
training you take a rest between sets

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.390 
training you take a rest between sets
one<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.960> two<00:02:02.080> minutes<00:02:02.410> if<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.130> want<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.340> go

one to two minutes if you want to go
more<00:02:03.610> for<00:02:03.850> conditioning<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.750> fat<00:02:04.870> burning

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
more for conditioning and fat burning

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.960 
more for conditioning and fat burning
you're<00:02:05.830> working<00:02:06.070> in<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.250> circuit<00:02:06.610> I'm<00:02:06.850> gonna

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
you're working in a circuit I'm gonna

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.880 
you're working in a circuit I'm gonna
have<00:02:07.060> Jason<00:02:07.240> do<00:02:07.450> another<00:02:07.720> round<00:02:07.960> all<00:02:08.530> four

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
have Jason do another round all four

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.889 
have Jason do another round all four
angles<00:02:09.070> but<00:02:09.700> we're<00:02:09.789> gonna<00:02:09.880> add<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.210> tactic

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
angles but we're gonna add in tactic

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.120 
angles but we're gonna add in tactic
there's<00:02:11.170> three<00:02:11.350> types<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.590> repetitions

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
there's three types of repetitions

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.740 
there's three types of repetitions
there's<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.580> positive<00:02:13.060> which<00:02:13.210> contracts<00:02:13.600> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
there's a positive which contracts the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.540 
there's a positive which contracts the
muscle<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.440> negative<00:02:14.830> which<00:02:14.950> stretches<00:02:15.280> it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
muscle the negative which stretches it

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.920 
muscle the negative which stretches it
and<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.970> peak<00:02:16.180> contraction<00:02:16.540> where<00:02:16.810> you're

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and the peak contraction where you're

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.570 
and the peak contraction where you're
holding<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.320> flexing<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.740> muscle<00:02:18.070> I'm<00:02:18.400> gonna

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
holding and flexing the muscle I'm gonna

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.030 
holding and flexing the muscle I'm gonna
have<00:02:18.730> him<00:02:18.910> do<00:02:19.060> both<00:02:19.440> around<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.590> negatives

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
have him do both around the negatives
