00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.530
 the state becomes a list of the family of the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.310
 services as his first artistic 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.930
 manipulation with card games and you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.090
 You can use it for several things 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.840
 For example, if you have something routine 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.119
 show 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.570
 the example can be used for this 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.460
 a praying spectator card on a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.250
 elegant fashion style send back the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.460
 before you grab this game 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 kappeler does not control another 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 to use variant is really a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 fresh in it 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.450
 okay that means that here if you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.280
 wrong even makes Schalke now 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 simply, I know that something else 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.980
 more beautiful and fluid on it but must 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.969
 statement 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.890
 The snow can actually be one of those 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.539
 one of those difficult movements 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.890
 and she that in reality it is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.550
 actually consists of only three 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.430
 steps 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 the first step is how we do it 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
 bottom part of the game of this 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.799
 upmarket positions by the way the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.210
 starting position in the fingertips 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.970
 interrupt that okay you can once 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.030
 About the printing with the thumb 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.650
 Doing the pressure with yours 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.200
 Thumb on the top half of the game 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.900
 extended and thus the lower part 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.160
 naturally 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.950
 another possibility is then correct 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.610
 too difficult is the index finger too 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.620
 use 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.530
 to tackle here and just like that 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.480
 to help, then you end up with these three 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.080
 Exposure exactly the position the 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.820
 we want to have 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.890
 that is step back rhine depending on 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.260
 what I like experimenting better 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.210
 a bit around and have done that 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.770
 Can you do the second after power? 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.100
 Step is like the lower half 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.490
 get the card slot on the top 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.490
 then first your index finger 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.200
 back to the bottom half to her 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.140
 the upper half passes by 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.850
 catch the facebook users and now 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.130
 you have to still with the thumb light 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.190
 exert pressure 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.390
 maybe you want the upper half 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.000
 Of course you can do it all over 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.320
 Give a little more movement and that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.740
 whole a little more lively 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.540
 let by you act a little bit 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.360
 Of course, moving shows you like that 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.200
 Let's see and let or 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.239
 which nation Einstein's step 2 and 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.050
 before it goes down with the thumb 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.030
 Here you move forward to play 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.200
 clamped it will not happen and 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.640
 this is where the closeness comes with 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.640
 a forward movement 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.270
 I hope you liked it and we did 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.389
 see you next time
