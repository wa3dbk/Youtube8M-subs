00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 who lived the otherwise very deep more 

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.000
 spongebob squarepants uhu hello and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.040
 welcome to a small one 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.250
 recommendation to the new spot movie 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 Spongebob Squarepants 3 d or this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.299
 sponge really smells of crossgate 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.400
 you probably think now 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100
 hey that's about kids kag that has to be too 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 nobody really see but no that is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.220
 Certainly not some of you 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 surely have the trailer 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.599
 Seen the new movie and think 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 Now with the voice of Patrick 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.090
 and from tadeusz probably hey 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.090
 damn it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.180
 that sounds really shitty but 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.579
 Luckily both parties are not 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.260
 necessarily so often represented in the new film 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.270
 that you can watch the whole time now 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.680
 I have to keep my ears when I am now 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 but for my personal opinion 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.300
 which of course you would ask 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.829
 then I would answer that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.969
 that these two actually agree 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.129
 not so bad 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.770
 I do not know how you feel about it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.559
 the voice of thaddeus and patrick 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.870
 so absolutely shit is that you on 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.730
 dearest your ears travel out 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.040
 would be the first ten years ago 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.290
 Of course, there was sports 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.140
 the series already before the series 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.570
 Of course, it's just really color 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.130
 and only really blatantly nice 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.270
 Of course, everyone still not spongebob 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.560
 He has seen in his life 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.759
 Of course something missed that you can 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.280
 ever hold on like that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.680
 But now so the question is the first 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.020
 first movie because better than the second 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.780
 so as the current one as bontrup 3d 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.100
 I can be sure of that 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.710
 indulge in my opinion is the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.329
 first spot film clearly more serious 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.650
 Of course, I'm still with them 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.500
 To the legendary laughter you 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.259
 but has incorporated to the second film 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.049
 so to spongebob squarepants 3d is the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.700
 first clearly serious namely what you 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.790
 at 3d spongebob square-headed around the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.100
 ears gets hewn is really blatant 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.450
 there are some jokes here they have the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.590
 really make no sense at all 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.790
 Of course, that can be me too 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 then it's just too stupid jokes 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.729
 easy to understand cool is there 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 Of course , if there was one 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.119
 but would have given fabulous duck then 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 the world would be lost anyway 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.960
 no this time there are no ends in 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.039
 SpongeBob Squarepants never existed before 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.660
 but this time there is a dolphin and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.210
 Of course, the illuminates are there as well 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.650
 another occurs 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.870
 many of you are certainly wondering 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.010
 now also whether spongebob how to do that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.910
 perhaps seen in the trailer 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.350
 has quite often or too often outside in 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.990
 the outside world is no longer under 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.330
 the water no but outside there at 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.910
 The people on it I can blatantly 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.610
 give really good answer namely no 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.690
 it has fortunately he is not not 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.390
 often or 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.700
 not even half of the film 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.140
 No, most of the things are happening 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.620
 luck still down in the well-known 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.210
 bikini bottom world down in the sea 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.580
 I think that's pretty cool because I had 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.560
 really scared that there is too much outside 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.820
 But hey , it's not like that 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.760
 Now everyone can do it all together 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.290
 drive a bit further down and 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.810
 do not make us so upset about this 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.060
 film because the film is really very good 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.510
 has succeeded in many cool moments 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.340
 is very funny and my recommendation of that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.720
 film in any case as we of course 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.820
 Spongebob can has not there 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.560
 necessarily too much changes he works 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.440
 still with the big crab has 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.570
 his pet still holds gary 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.450
 still just with the big cable 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.340
 mister crepes and still has his 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.120
 patrick's best friend and still has 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.310
 his annoying neighbor ag there is 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.590
 also a very funny moment 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.800
 when you travel back to the future 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.530
 or patrick back as future travels and 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.280
 an old dinosaur with one 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.170
 well-known faces gets rewarded for it 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.050
 to go to the film already because that 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.670
 is really funny very funny 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.020
 So I had the choice the 50th 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.660
 appreciates to go great or just in 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.890
 3d spongebob square-headed and i have 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.540
 me how this is so nice here 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.400
 can recognize and probably also 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.140
 has not heard out of 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.330
 this film decided because he is 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.590
 really cool as I said a recommendation 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.630
 for anyone who simply spongebob 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.230
 stands or simply on animated 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.130
 movies because hey what is better than 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.140
 animated movies exactly nothing 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.900
 or women so if you are your girlfriend 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.880
 somehow can not persuade in 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.890
 flash software to go then go on 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.470
 every case with her for a change 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.299
 in Spongebob because that's worth it 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.410
 really if you like the video 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.670
 should have then let the thumb 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.900
 upwards as I would be very far 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.030
 Thank you and I'll see you in the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.540
 next video again if it says 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.590
 everything was clear children had not 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.040
 according to heyer captain then the whole 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.040
 much more
