00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
our SL a 3d printer so first we got a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.140 
our SL a 3d printer so first we got a
plug<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.769> power<00:00:10.769> cord<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:12.080> our<00:00:13.080> data<00:00:13.410> cord

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
plug in the power cord and our data cord

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.950 
plug in the power cord and our data cord
also<00:00:15.260> we<00:00:16.260> got<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> plug<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.160> data<00:00:17.369> core

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
also we got a plug it in the data core

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:28.070 
also we got a plug it in the data core
to<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.800> computer<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:26.449> surround<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.630> 3d

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
to the computer and surround the 3d

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.279 
to the computer and surround the 3d
printer<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.570> we<00:00:30.570> also<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.990> make<00:00:31.260> sure

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
printer and we also got make sure

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.610 
printer and we also got make sure
there's<00:00:32.070> enough<00:00:32.450> recite<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.750> our<00:00:33.989> liquid<00:00:34.230> pool

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
there's enough recite in our liquid pool

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.990 
there's enough recite in our liquid pool
to<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.579> order<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.969> form<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.630> 3d<00:00:36.930> model<00:00:37.969> okay

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to in order to form the 3d model okay

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.290 
to in order to form the 3d model okay
and<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.480> before<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.500> start<00:00:40.710> our<00:00:41.129> own<00:00:41.300> program

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and now before we start our own program

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.560 
and now before we start our own program
we<00:00:43.140> need<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.469> USB<00:00:43.920> key<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.730> order<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.120> start<00:00:45.510> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
we need this USB key in order to start a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.130 
we need this USB key in order to start a
program<00:00:45.780> without<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.890> USB<00:00:47.640> key<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.750> cannot

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
program without the USB key we cannot

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.819 
program without the USB key we cannot
start<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.680> program<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:53.239> double-click<00:00:54.239> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
already beginning to sign the operation

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.260 
already beginning to sign the operation
you<00:03:26.540> can<00:03:26.690> see<00:03:26.930> on<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.650> liquid<00:03:27.980> pool<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.819> laser

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
you can see on the liquid pool the laser

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:58.360 
you can see on the liquid pool the laser
is<00:03:29.480> beginning<00:03:30.050> to<00:03:30.080> form<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.740> 3d<00:03:31.069> model

and you see every slice you cut right
here<00:04:02.269> there<00:04:03.260> will<00:04:03.349> be<00:04:03.410> a<00:04:03.560> mock<00:04:03.830> release<00:04:04.360> after

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
here there will be a mock release after

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:53.769 
here there will be a mock release after
the<00:04:05.540> operation<00:04:06.110> is<00:04:06.230> done
