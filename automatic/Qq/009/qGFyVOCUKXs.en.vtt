 It is 8 rather than try to make your own pc in about Â¥ 35000 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:35.420
 I am using some new equipment Patik up here this time Pocha cp 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.630
 I want to support 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.150
 Unreasonable a series 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.420
 It is a system of 5800 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.500
 When 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.910
 Among the cpu amd that has improved graphic performance 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.390
 as a series 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.950
 First 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:59.950
 It's a tall guy, isn't it about 12000 yen ? 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.950
 Socket is fm 2 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:11.909
 8 clock frequency is certainly 3.8 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.909
 We purchased with most 2000 Sofmap Yes It is this 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.150
 Next is the motherboard motherboard 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.150

 How is it? 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:34.290
 from gigabyte 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:38.180
 It becomes 75 md 3 h of 8 f 2 boats 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.180
 Micro atx 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.530
 Properly 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:57.130
 Yes Motherboard was about 6600 yen here 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.630
 As a feature of the gb Te 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.630
 Japanese manual is attached 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.900
 Well would Well good in this 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.390
 Here 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.390
 It is the next memory It is memory this time we use ddr 3 this time 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.020
 The fact that Well I moat model 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.520
 Take care 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.190
 2 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.190
 i 3 certainly there cut here. 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.530
 Of Well pc 3 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:40.160
 It is 600 of 10,000 It is over 10,600 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.160
 It is a thing with permanent guarantee Yes here 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.090
 so 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.819
 I use from the beginning 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.920
 8 windows 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.370
 No 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.880
 Software is 32-bit version 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.970
 It is a flow rate product from before that I would like to do if I use it, yes 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.970
 The 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.420
 And 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.520
 Fight N

 Do you see 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.739
 Hard disk 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.530
 adly immediately of kb in Well 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.680
 Is it about 8000 yen by hard disk 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.420
 It comes out from the place called wd green 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.560
 3.5 inches 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:31.750
 Externally written and written 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.170
 We think that we want to build in normally and need power supply by this as power supply is necessary by this 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.170
 Not 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.160
 Click here for Oh

 Oh from the change in the Meiji 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.790
 Well from the power cable 4 pin of Saturn 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.030
 2 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.950
 Kana look 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:04.810
 It is 4 articles, and sata power supply becomes 2 from 4 pins 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.830
 Use this to increase the power supply 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:16.370
 Is I would like to put Well Well now pc Oh 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:20.709
 athlon ii was so much performance improvement that the previous pc's 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.709
 I think I want to see the specs 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.389
 I see 8 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.830
 The spec is here 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:34.360
 The memory is so cpu is the processor 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.990
 6.3 and memory 5.5 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.430
 Graphics 3.4 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.150
