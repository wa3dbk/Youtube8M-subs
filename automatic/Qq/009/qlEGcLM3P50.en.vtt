00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.970
 hello friends in today's video we're going 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:11.049
 to explain how to place your knife 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.049
 prosciutto ham to cut it there 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.849
 several various techniques depending on the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.070
 area where we are the one we are 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.650
 short 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.650
 when we are cutting so much the mace 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.060
 as the last pass there are two injured 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.960
 techniques seems 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 the first is to place the knife 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.590
 totally straight 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.680
 A) Yes 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.460
 and what we get is that the showers 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.460
 come out completely 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 and the second technique that can be 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.660
 use is to place the knife 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.660
 inclined 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.390
 what we get is that the slices 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.600
 serrano inclined and open with a 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.359
 peak 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.490
 what technique is is better because they are not 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.970
 both equally good 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.250
 you can use one or the other depending on 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.370
 the presentations of dishes that you want 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.330
 do but the two techniques are equal 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.330
 equally valid 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.530
 Another way to place the knife is 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.120
 when we are near the bones 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.760
 in this case near the bone of the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.320
 the explanation that I'm going to give here is 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.780
 when the ham is a leg a leg 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.990
 right, but the explanation serves 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.360
 same when the leg is left but 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.760
 in this case the explanation would be valid for 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.970
 the area of ​​the counter mace is worth this 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.700
 explanation is right leg and cutters 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.130
 who use the right hand to cut 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.789
 what technique that we techniques are used 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.579
 to cut the area of ​​the tip the area 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.490
 that is near the bone of the bone 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:04.840
 coxal or o of the hip so good there 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.610
 two techniques one is to place the hand well 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.950
 leaning is you 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 in the area of ​​the mass until here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.470
 would cut is like that and then turn and aix the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.470
 knife and place and so it's worth 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.340
 and the second technique that can be 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.150
 use here if this technique seems to you 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.870
 a little uncomfortable is 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.079
 take the knife like this would cut him jce 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.079
 here 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.640
 then instead of doing this cut to 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.640
 cut the cut like this 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.320
 which cut is better or what technique is 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.560
 better then as before are the two 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.900
 equally as valid 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.920
 you have to use where the most comfortable 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.470
 or site photos so poor many people who 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.180
 this technique is the first one that used 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.500
 It seems very uncomfortable, because the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.940
 doll is rotated and good along 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.760
 the cut, well, the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.040
 doll and they seem much more comfortable 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.420
 who use this technique the 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.340
 second technique 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.170
 but good you can use any 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.970
 any of the now let's see 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.520
 the techniques that we have deployed 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.300
 but a little more a little more closely 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.300
 to see the detail 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.300
 let's see in more detail the four 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.290
 cutting techniques that we just 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.019
 explain 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.340
 the area of ​​the club the technique that we have 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.340
 explained straight cut 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:04:00.500
 it is loncha sale 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.500
 completely straight and the inclined cut 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.730
 where we can see that the slice comes out 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:14.459
 with a small peak and then the techniques 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.459
 from the tip area 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.830
 with the inclined doll 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.950
 or without tilting the doll 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.490
 Well, here we have explained the 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.010
 four techniques the two of the area 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.910
 of the club and the two of the area 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.640
 tip 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.610
