00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.750 
Wii which I gave to my dad but here's
the<00:00:20.970> thing<00:00:21.260> apparently<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.500> had<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.039> redownload

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the thing apparently I had to redownload

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.920 
the thing apparently I had to redownload
all<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.689> Wii<00:00:24.869> games<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.710> there<00:00:26.160> because

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
all the Wii games on there because

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.140 
all the Wii games on there because
apparently<00:00:28.250> Nintendo<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.429> strict<00:00:29.820> about

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
apparently Nintendo is strict about

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.959 
apparently Nintendo is strict about
piracy<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> avoid<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.669> so

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
piracy and they want to avoid it so

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.479 
piracy and they want to avoid it so
therefore<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.230> cannot<00:00:34.530> switch<00:00:34.890> games<00:00:35.190> onto

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
therefore you cannot switch games onto

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.880 
therefore you cannot switch games onto
an<00:00:35.730> SD<00:00:36.149> card<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.660> play<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.260> another<00:00:37.530> weave

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
an SD card to play it on another weave

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.750 
an SD card to play it on another weave
which<00:00:38.280> sucks<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:40.050> lost<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:41.040> your

money<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.230> points<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.129> gotta

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
money and all your points so you gotta
