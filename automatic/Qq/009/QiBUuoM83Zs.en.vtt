00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.320
 nice evening after the most successful 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.640
 start in the season in the 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.690
 club history of borussia dortmund 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.369
 May I warmly welcome you 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.070
 Welcome to the press conference, too 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.619
 both coaches thorsten finch and jÃ¼rgen 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.510
 Klopp may say that before 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.489
 one of them particularly knowledgeable 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.620
 was florian groeger who has the huawei 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:37.489
 played today and won 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.040
 may be happy about a who s end d1 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.829
 Handy congratulations was exactly 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.320
 the right tip 6 to 2 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:49.070
 Please stand up he does not like to 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.270
 shy thorsten finch i want you 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.570
 I am your commentary on the game 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.180
 actually only have about 15 minutes 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.290
 a proper team of von 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.339
 seen from our side 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.110
 otherwise of course the bvb has 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.439
 of course, played superbly as 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.630
 bad the good thing was that we went after that 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.520
 2 0 actually somehow again 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.679
 have come back to 2 2 I have 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.210
 thought now my team has yes 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.999
 no respect respect to great respect 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.259
 We had that in the beginning and we did 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.030
 were always too far away we have each one 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.810
 lost two families second ball 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.010
 lost or not and so can 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.020
 you, of course 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.310
 when bvb do not exist we have live 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 we played a lot of balls through the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.030
 middle played what we where we of course 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.350
 also knew that the bvb then if they 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.350
 catch in the ball there are fast in 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.050
 playing great and they are then 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.480
 also very dangerous with her pace 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.040
 the technique with the spielwitz and we 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.460
 then made it very easy for them 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.790
 Today, thank thorsten fink you drive the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.790
 played 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.950
 yes it was a step forward today 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.729
 even if we get two goals 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.440
 i believe the dude about the 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.330
 complete 90 minutes on the mountain I good 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.340
 We played football in the first 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.720
 had a lot more chances at half-time 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.130
 that we achieved in the gate is so 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.890
 a nature of the matter that was relative 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.930
 Many big jobs have to be done with few 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.080
 possibilities then accept a gate 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.280
 that was not believe it must be in the beginning 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.550
 For us we think a two 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.040
 Carelessness then comes too late 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.540
 makes you naturally super great tor 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.239
 and this changes a game like that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.470
 a little bit of everything makes me feel 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.270
 that if I need to change anything anyway 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.630
 but actually one or the other 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.060
 have to intensify a bit 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.739
 i think marco was just a first 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.360
 completion preparation involved i 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.090
 my here 7 absolutely over myself 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.680
 I would not have fired at all 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.290
 that was a story we like 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.470
 still with in the program would have taken 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.820
 and that is done now and often 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.830
 only together the experience made that 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.300
 the balance only holds one 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.010
 bad days have the relevance 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.530
 The compensation is simply good 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.790
 was made by hamburg and we at 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.540
 Standards must be very clear to us 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.640
 improve 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.840
 they were dangerous again and again 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.310
 is a quality of hamburg but 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.410
 Of course, in reverse, also by us 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.090
 none that is not really good there 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.650
 we have to get started 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.489
 but we are all after the 22nd 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.930
 still quiet 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.820
 so I also relatively quiet he 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.430
 with my team already and have 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.280
 then I would have felt that 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.260
 we're here today with that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.079
 properly played ball then still the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.730
 can make the decision and 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.870
 then it became outstanding 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.090
 if, of course, switching game was 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.590
 then crazy good fun 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.810
 to watch and then you really see 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.860
 difficult to stop once it so so 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.000
 roll in if you roll so 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.290
 have come and then been for 6 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.730
 but I believe in a beautiful evening for all 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.450
 the city an extraordinary 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.629
 the atmosphere 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.950
 Thank you, I think I know that 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.879
 I mean the grandstand relatively 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.590
 see long standing 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.000
 That's not all 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.170
 not the day here 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.879
 so it was cool thanks for that 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.530
 then go if you ask from yours 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.849
 Please give me a quick round 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.299
 handzeichen we are then with the micro 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:31.760
 quickly with you matthias dersch ruhr 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:33.889
 news i hope that in both 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.539
 even then fell on the first strike 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.280
 gotten around and he had thought it 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.300
 going 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.100
 It was not quite round 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.490
 I did not think so 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.490
 heard correctly 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.389
 After two times everything is fine and good 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.919
 think that ok then notice that stop yourself 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.880
 do not have to be there now because then 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.789
 taken out sz bruise on the cock 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.710
 is uncomfortable but should be fine too 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.520
 should be regulated in the next days 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.919
 At least I hope so 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.060
 how happy to get hit on your knees so 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.440
 in the scene and that is also connected 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.789
 but I do not believe it 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.250
 given bigger problems 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.960
 you're a little bit over there 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.039
 a few things but overall i hope so 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.729
 but that we are came out clean 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.729
 there are more questions 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:28.050
 does not seem to me the case yet 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:29.400
 here in front of him patrick brandenburg he 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.680
 After the game, they had a short break 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.300
 with marco reus still talked about 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.330
 It was in this entertainment otherwise 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.350
 that betrayed 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.730
 I told him how he got the ball through 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.600
 read as well as missed chance and 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.520
 get the sky on levi 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.070
 Everyone has passed before everyone 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.880
 So I like him so far 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.570
 somehow tried by three 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.550
 people shoot through markus quite well 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.520
 relaxed in dealing with their chances 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.350
 What seemed very good to us in the case 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.710
 rewarded with a traumtor one 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.710
 it
