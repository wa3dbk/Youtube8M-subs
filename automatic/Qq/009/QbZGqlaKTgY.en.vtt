00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.309 

this<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.709> fraca<00:00:02.120> when<00:00:03.120> I<00:00:03.149> met<00:00:03.449> him<00:00:03.570> really<00:00:03.959> long

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
this is fraca when I met him really long

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.769 
this is fraca when I met him really long
ago<00:00:04.710> there<00:00:05.009> were<00:00:05.100> no<00:00:05.310> material<00:00:05.910> notes<00:00:06.120> yet<00:00:06.540> in

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
ago there were no material notes yet in

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.100 
ago there were no material notes yet in
blender<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.880> for<00:00:09.300> example<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> material

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
blender so the for example the material

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.530 
blender so the for example the material
for<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.380> peak<00:00:10.620> was<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> complete<00:00:11.820> mess<00:00:12.090> because

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
for the peak was a complete mess because

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.340 
for the peak was a complete mess because
I<00:00:12.840> used<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.530> lot<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.889> image<00:00:14.759> textures<00:00:15.299> as<00:00:15.690> mask

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
I used a lot of image textures as mask

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.060 
I used a lot of image textures as mask
for<00:00:17.810> controlling<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.990> specularity<00:00:19.500> for

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
for controlling the specularity for

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.189 
for controlling the specularity for
example<00:00:20.490> inside<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.150> mouth<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
example inside the mouth or in the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.300 
example inside the mouth or in the
tongue<00:00:22.439> or<00:00:22.820> in<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.090> week<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.650> really<00:00:26.070> a

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
tongue or in the week it was really a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.870 
tongue or in the week it was really a
big<00:00:26.519> mess<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:27.660> when<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.439> got<00:00:28.680> material<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
big mess but when we got material out I

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.020 
big mess but when we got material out I
could<00:00:30.779> fix<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.369> have<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> nice

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
could fix this and have a nice

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.030 
could fix this and have a nice
transition<00:00:33.300> between<00:00:33.960> different<00:00:34.500> materials

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
transition between different materials

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.310 
transition between different materials
for<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> dong<00:00:35.940> inside<00:00:36.630> part<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> mouth

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
for the dong inside part of the mouth

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.299 
for the dong inside part of the mouth
and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.710> beak<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.329> even<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> eyelids<00:00:40.590> for

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and the beak and even the eyelids for

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.420 
and the beak and even the eyelids for
example<00:00:41.989> it<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.530> nice<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:43.950> as

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
example it was really nice because as

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.900 
example it was really nice because as
you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.640> see<00:00:44.899> it<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.140> all<00:00:46.289> only<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.950> mesh<00:00:47.219> so

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you can see it is all only one mesh so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.690 
you can see it is all only one mesh so
if<00:00:48.059> i<00:00:48.210> use<00:00:48.390> different<00:00:48.989> materials<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
if i use different materials there you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
if i use different materials there you
will<00:00:50.820> really<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.420> seam<00:00:51.870> between<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
will really see a seam between the the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
will really see a seam between the the
beacon<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> inside<00:00:54.539> part<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> their<00:00:55.170> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
beacon and the inside part of their of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.950 
beacon and the inside part of their of
the<00:00:56.100> mouth<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:59.120> material<00:01:00.120> notes<00:01:00.300> were<00:01:00.510> really

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the mouth so material notes were really

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.139 
the mouth so material notes were really
helpful<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.340> will<00:01:02.550> show<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> now

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
helpful there and I will show you now

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.800 
helpful there and I will show you now
how<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.390> did<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.929 

well<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.560> materials<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.189> still<00:01:12.369> a<00:01:12.460> mess<00:01:12.610> I

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
well the materials is still a mess I

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.920 
well the materials is still a mess I
know<00:01:13.060> but<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:16.119> bit<00:01:16.240> more<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.780> can

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
know but a little bit more you can

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.279 
know but a little bit more you can
understand<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.470> little<00:01:17.590> bit<00:01:17.740> better<00:01:17.979> now<00:01:18.340> so

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
understand a little bit better now so

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.649 
understand a little bit better now so
here<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.320> have<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.680> bunch<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.369> vertex<00:01:22.270> color

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
here I have a bunch of vertex color

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.080 
here I have a bunch of vertex color
layers<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:25.030> know<00:01:25.149> vertex<00:01:25.539> colors<00:01:26.020> are<00:01:26.350> just

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
layers you know vertex colors are just

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.359 
layers you know vertex colors are just
we<00:01:28.090> can<00:01:28.299> paint<00:01:28.570> over<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.320> divide<00:01:30.039> the

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
we can paint over the divide the

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.980 
we can paint over the divide the
vertices<00:01:30.820> in<00:01:31.330> our<00:01:31.450> mesh<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:34.299> click<00:01:34.539> on<00:01:34.570> new

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
vertices in our mesh just click on new

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.999 
vertices in our mesh just click on new
on<00:01:35.350> vertex<00:01:35.979> color<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:38.380> have<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.560> new<00:01:38.799> layer

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
on vertex color and you have a new layer

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.940 
on vertex color and you have a new layer
and<00:01:39.250> then<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.579> can<00:01:39.729> paint<00:01:40.829> into<00:01:41.829> these

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
and then you can paint into these

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.609 
and then you can paint into these
vertices<00:01:42.569> I'm<00:01:43.569> blender<00:01:43.959> will<00:01:44.140> interpolate

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
vertices I'm blender will interpolate

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.600 
vertices I'm blender will interpolate
between<00:01:45.069> each<00:01:46.000> producer<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:46.929> will<00:01:47.610> between

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
between each producer it will between

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.300 
between each producer it will between
each<00:01:49.119> vertex<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:50.590> will<00:01:50.709> interpolate<00:01:51.159> the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
each vertex you will interpolate the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.580 
each vertex you will interpolate the
color<00:01:51.670> between<00:01:52.030> them<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:52.840> it<00:01:52.990> gives<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.409> nice

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
color between them so it gives a nice

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.169 
color between them so it gives a nice
smooth<00:01:54.340> shading<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:56.619> really<00:01:56.920> precise<00:01:57.340> but<00:01:57.759> in

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
smooth shading not really precise but in

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.419 
smooth shading not really precise but in
this<00:01:58.479> case<00:01:58.720> is<00:01:59.049> work<00:01:59.349> it<00:01:59.619> works<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.920> i<00:02:02.979> can<00:02:03.250> show

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
this case is work it works so i can show

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.919 
this case is work it works so i can show
you<00:02:03.459> now<00:02:03.759> that<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.209> other<00:02:05.819> layers<00:02:06.819> i<00:02:07.149> had<00:02:07.360> for

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
you now that the other layers i had for

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.330 
you now that the other layers i had for
example<00:02:08.380> week<00:02:08.590> tongue<00:02:10.739> that's<00:02:11.739> for<00:02:12.069> another

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
example week tongue that's for another

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.390 
example week tongue that's for another
material<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:13.480> material<00:02:13.510> for<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.170> tongue<00:02:14.400> baked

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
material a material for the tongue baked

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.449 
material a material for the tongue baked
inside<00:02:15.820> for<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.840> inside<00:02:17.440> part<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.799> of<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
inside for the inside part of the of the

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.970 
inside for the inside part of the of the
mouth<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:20.760> big<00:02:21.760> i'll<00:02:22.030> eat<00:02:22.329> for<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.200> eyelids

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
mouth and big i'll eat for the eyelids

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.500 
mouth and big i'll eat for the eyelids
and<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.280> little<00:02:24.519> bit<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.850> mouth<00:02:25.030> as<00:02:25.299> well<00:02:25.480> i

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
and a little bit of the mouth as well i

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.380 
and a little bit of the mouth as well i
wanted<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.989> put<00:02:26.530> just<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:27.100> little<00:02:27.640> bit<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.180> that

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
wanted to put just a little bit of that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.890 
wanted to put just a little bit of that
red<00:02:28.660> color<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.319> eyelids<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:31.209> on<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
red color of the eyelids on the on the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.050

edge<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.799> mouth<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:35.340> i<00:02:36.340> made<00:02:36.670> all<00:02:36.850> these

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
edge of the mouth so i made all these

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.090 
edge of the mouth so i made all these
vertex<00:02:37.900> colors<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.980> mix<00:02:39.639> them<00:02:39.910> using<00:02:40.480> notes

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
vertex colors and I mix them using notes

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.849 
vertex colors and I mix them using notes
if<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.190> go<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.670> material<00:02:42.790> settings<00:02:43.299> in

specularity and then I have a mix node
when<00:04:00.349> instead<00:04:00.709> of<00:04:00.860> using<00:04:01.069> a<00:04:01.310> fixed<00:04:01.610> value<00:04:02.180> i'm

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
when instead of using a fixed value i'm

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.559 
when instead of using a fixed value i'm
using<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:04.010> geometry<00:04:04.940> note<00:04:05.650> where<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.680> can<00:04:07.010> just

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
using a geometry note where I can just

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.640 
using a geometry note where I can just
feel<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:09.579> caulfield<00:04:11.079> down<00:04:12.079> there<00:04:12.319> all<00:04:12.500> the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
feel the caulfield down there all the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.180 
feel the caulfield down there all the
way<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.829> the<00:04:13.010> bottom<00:04:14.350> with<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.380> name<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.859> the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
way to the bottom with the name of the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.719 
way to the bottom with the name of the
the<00:04:17.030> vertex<00:04:17.840> color<00:04:18.109> layer<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.739> want<00:04:18.979> to<00:04:19.130> use<00:04:19.340> for

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.159 

mix<00:04:22.729> in<00:04:22.940> this<00:04:23.349> so<00:04:24.349> the<00:04:24.770> white<00:04:24.979> values<00:04:26.139> will<00:04:27.139> be

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
mix in this so the white values will be

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.010 
mix in this so the white values will be
the<00:04:27.710> eyelid<00:04:28.220> color<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:30.800> ideal<00:04:31.130> material<00:04:31.340> and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
the eyelid color the ideal material and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.200 
the eyelid color the ideal material and
the<00:04:33.020> black<00:04:33.229> part<00:04:33.500> will<00:04:33.740> be<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.669> rest<00:04:34.910> in

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
the black part will be the the rest in

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:45.320 
the black part will be the the rest in
this<00:04:35.539> case<00:04:35.780> is<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.080> big

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.760 

so<00:04:46.330> on<00:04:46.510> top<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.990> i<00:04:47.350> had<00:04:48.070> another<00:04:49.770> special

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
so on top of that i had another special

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.800 
so on top of that i had another special
material<00:04:51.370> only<00:04:51.490> for<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.910> specularity<00:04:52.300> i

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
material only for the specularity i

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.760 
material only for the specularity i
wanted<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.770> add<00:04:53.890> some<00:04:54.160> extra<00:04:55.200> specularity<00:04:56.200> to

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
wanted to add some extra specularity to

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.440 
wanted to add some extra specularity to
some<00:04:57.040> materials<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:59.050> i<00:04:59.380> made<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.770> frak<00:05:00.700> up<00:05:00.730> peak

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
some materials so i made a frak up peak

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.070 
some materials so i made a frak up peak
spec<00:05:02.350> to<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.880> kind<00:05:04.090> of<00:05:04.240> names<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:04.780> have<00:05:04.900> to

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
spec to that kind of names you have to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.010 
spec to that kind of names you have to
avoid<00:05:05.320> them<00:05:05.590> but<00:05:07.500> yeah<00:05:08.500> it<00:05:08.800> worked<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:10.660> just<00:05:10.930> to

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
avoid them but yeah it worked so just to

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.130 
avoid them but yeah it worked so just to
have<00:05:11.200> some<00:05:11.410> make<00:05:11.560> some<00:05:12.130> extra<00:05:13.140> specularity

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
have some make some extra specularity

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.160 
have some make some extra specularity
like<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.740> did<00:05:14.980> on<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:16.150> on<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.720> previous

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
like I did on the on the previous

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.710 
like I did on the on the previous
tutorial<00:05:20.670> so<00:05:21.670> I<00:05:21.700> have<00:05:22.000> another<00:05:22.210> one<00:05:22.480> which<00:05:22.690> is

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
tutorial so I have another one which is

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.400 
tutorial so I have another one which is
a<00:05:23.370> frak<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.400> big<00:05:24.700> tongue<00:05:27.720> for<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.840> tongue<00:05:29.050> I'm

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
a frak a big tongue for the tongue I'm

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.880 
a frak a big tongue for the tongue I'm
mixing<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:30.370> with<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.820> big<00:05:31.810> tongue<00:05:32.230> vertex

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
mixing it with the big tongue vertex

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.620 
mixing it with the big tongue vertex
color<00:05:33.190> layer<00:05:33.870> then<00:05:35.640> okay<00:05:36.640> after<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.180> big<00:05:37.360> and

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
color layer then okay after the big and

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.060 
color layer then okay after the big and
the<00:05:37.810> eyelids<00:05:38.140> are<00:05:39.390> are<00:05:40.390> now<00:05:40.630> mixed<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.290> have

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
the eyelids are are now mixed I have

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.600 
the eyelids are are now mixed I have
mouth<00:05:42.730> inside<00:05:44.460> material<00:05:45.460> and<00:05:45.720> I<00:05:46.720> have<00:05:47.140> another

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
mouth inside material and I have another
