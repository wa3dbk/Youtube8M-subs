00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
we've been working on Facebook for a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.450 
we've been working on Facebook for a
couple<00:00:16.020> hours<00:00:16.320> now<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.710> get<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.070> intro

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
couple hours now and I get this intro

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.279 
couple hours now and I get this intro
down<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.449> finally<00:00:18.660> just<00:00:18.810> came<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.050> with<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
down so I finally just came up with a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.609 
down so I finally just came up with a
easy<00:00:19.560> way<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> teach<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.340> guys<00:00:21.380> not<00:00:22.380> that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
easy way to teach you guys not that

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.320 
easy way to teach you guys not that
correctly<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.580> close<00:00:23.820> enough<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.240> where

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
correctly but it's close enough to where

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.650 
correctly but it's close enough to where
you<00:00:24.449> could<00:00:24.600> pass<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.810> by<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.789> Dustin<00:00:27.390> says

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
you could pass it by and as Dustin says

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.710 
you could pass it by and as Dustin says
it'll<00:00:28.400> be<00:00:29.400> good<00:00:29.550> enough<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.880> get<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.179> laid

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
it'll be good enough to get you laid

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
it'll be good enough to get you laid
if<00:00:31.500> you're<00:00:32.250> applying<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> drunk<00:00:33.030> chick

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
actually this works for a sober chick

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.020 
actually this works for a sober chick
too<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.680> you're<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.829> playing<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.160> fun<00:00:38.219> it

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.080 

thanks<00:04:58.650> three<00:04:58.800> mothers

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.580 

this<00:05:03.090> astronomer<00:05:03.630> doesn't<00:05:03.930> change<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.260> I<00:05:04.410> just

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
this astronomer doesn't change it I just

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:19.530 
this astronomer doesn't change it I just
a<00:05:04.680> little<00:05:04.830> shaky<00:05:05.130> there

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.180 

and<00:05:20.540> then<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:21.410> course<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.890> picks<00:05:22.100> up<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:25.040> it's

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
and then of course it picks up and it's

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.730 
and then of course it picks up and it's
the<00:05:25.280> same<00:05:25.520> progression<00:05:26.360> as<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.050> verse<00:05:27.260> so<00:05:27.590> we

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
the same progression as the verse so we

00:05:27.740 --> 00:06:14.700 
the same progression as the verse so we
got

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.920 

so<00:06:15.460> I'm<00:06:15.520> just<00:06:15.669> adding<00:06:15.819> a<00:06:15.939> lot<00:06:16.090> extra<00:06:16.419> down<00:06:16.720> up

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
so I'm just adding a lot extra down up

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:46.890 
so I'm just adding a lot extra down up
in<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.199> first<00:06:17.409> Emile<00:06:17.830> in<00:06:17.949> a<00:06:18.009> second

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.580 

okay<00:06:47.950> that's<00:06:48.950> neither<00:06:49.370> verse<00:06:49.640> I<00:06:50.350> also<00:06:51.350> have<00:06:51.500> to

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
okay that's neither verse I also have to

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.800 
okay that's neither verse I also have to
do<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.800> the<00:06:51.890> bridge<00:06:52.160> and<00:06:52.460> its<00:06:52.640> SIA<00:06:53.060> done<00:06:53.360> in<00:06:53.540> D

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
do is the bridge and its SIA done in D

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:14.480 
do is the bridge and its SIA done in D
so<00:06:54.110> you<00:06:54.140> got

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.980 

switch<00:07:15.490> off<00:07:15.700> the<00:07:15.730> strumming<00:07:16.330> on<00:07:16.540> the<00:07:16.780> course

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
switch off the strumming on the course

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.470 
switch off the strumming on the course
because<00:07:17.710> it<00:07:18.430> slows<00:07:18.700> down<00:07:18.910> after<00:07:19.120> the<00:07:19.300> first

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480 
because it slows down after the first

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.000 
because it slows down after the first
and<00:07:19.630> second<00:07:19.960> time<00:07:20.050> maybe<00:07:20.350> that<00:07:20.620> for<00:07:20.740> the<00:07:20.800> first

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
and second time maybe that for the first

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.860 
and second time maybe that for the first
time<00:07:21.250> and<00:07:21.940> you<00:07:22.030> can<00:07:22.180> just<00:07:22.210> kind<00:07:22.480> of<00:07:22.510> add<00:07:22.660> your

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
time and you can just kind of add your

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.360 
time and you can just kind of add your
own<00:07:22.900> little<00:07:23.230> thing<00:07:23.410> in<00:07:23.530> there<00:07:23.650> the<00:07:24.040> stronger

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
own little thing in there the stronger

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.129 
own little thing in there the stronger
part<00:07:24.610> is<00:07:24.790> the<00:07:25.090> hardest<00:07:25.450> part<00:07:25.720> of<00:07:25.780> this<00:07:25.900> song

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139 
part is the hardest part of this song

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.320 
part is the hardest part of this song
and<00:07:26.560> it<00:07:27.400> might<00:07:27.520> be<00:07:27.550> a<00:07:27.639> little<00:07:27.730> confusing<00:07:28.150> the

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.330 
and it might be a little confusing the

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.900 
and it might be a little confusing the
way<00:07:28.450> up<00:07:28.540> and<00:07:28.690> switching<00:07:29.200> it<00:07:29.260> up<00:07:29.410> a<00:07:29.680> bit<00:07:30.400> uh

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
way up and switching it up a bit uh

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.440 
way up and switching it up a bit uh
just<00:07:31.480> try<00:07:31.660> follow<00:07:31.960> when<00:07:32.139> I<00:07:32.169> first<00:07:32.440> said<00:07:32.680> and<00:07:33.160> uh

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.450 
just try follow when I first said and uh

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.670 
just try follow when I first said and uh
think<00:07:34.450> you<00:07:34.510> can<00:07:34.660> feel<00:07:34.840> free<00:07:35.080> to<00:07:35.110> switch<00:07:35.380> it<00:07:35.530> off

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
think you can feel free to switch it off

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.219 
think you can feel free to switch it off
after<00:07:36.280> that<00:07:38.370> now<00:07:39.540> I'll<00:07:40.540> try<00:07:40.780> to<00:07:40.840> look<00:07:40.960> up<00:07:41.110> the

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:41.229
