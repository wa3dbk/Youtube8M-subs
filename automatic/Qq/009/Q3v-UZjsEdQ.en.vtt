that's about 17 thousand square feet
plus<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.420> also<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.640> wood<00:00:41.640> boiler<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.270> heat

our dryers to dry our peanuts with it I

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.709 
our dryers to dry our peanuts with it I
guess<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.480> about<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:48.840> years<00:00:48.870> ago<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
guess it was about two years ago with a

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
guess it was about two years ago with a
another<00:00:51.719> brand<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.820> wood<00:00:53.820> boilers<00:00:54.530> we<00:00:55.530> use<00:00:55.770> two

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
another brand of wood boilers we use two

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
another brand of wood boilers we use two
of<00:00:56.219> those<00:00:56.370> units<00:00:56.850> two<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> largest<00:00:57.510> units

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of those units two of the largest units

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.670 
of those units two of the largest units
that<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.170> had<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.399> placed<00:00:59.730> them<00:01:00.410> in<00:01:01.410> two

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that they had and we placed them in two

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.759 
that they had and we placed them in two
different<00:01:01.710> spots<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.930> found<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.409> we

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
different spots and found that we

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.830 
different spots and found that we
couldn't<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> heat<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.240> distributed

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
couldn't get the heat to be distributed

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.480 
couldn't get the heat to be distributed
everywhere<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.979> wanted<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:09.540> found<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
everywhere we wanted to we found the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.090 
everywhere we wanted to we found the
portage<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.670> main<00:01:11.880> boiler<00:01:12.710> about<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> year<00:01:14.010> ago

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
portage and main boiler about a year ago

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.550 
portage and main boiler about a year ago
now<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:16.400> replaced<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> two<00:01:17.759> units

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
now and we replaced the two units

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.539 
now and we replaced the two units
replaced<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:22.040> with<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> portage<00:01:23.430> in

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
replaced it with a with the portage in

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.570 
replaced it with a with the portage in
Maine<00:01:23.729> wood<00:01:23.940> boiler<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.680> found<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
Maine wood boiler and we found that it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.060 
Maine wood boiler and we found that it
has<00:01:26.820> made<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> huge<00:01:27.330> difference<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:28.380> use<00:01:28.590> less

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
has made a huge difference we use less

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.300 
has made a huge difference we use less
wood<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.540> less<00:01:30.810> produced<00:01:31.409> less<00:01:31.560> ash<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
wood and it less produced less ash and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.340 
wood and it less produced less ash and
we<00:01:33.299> still<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.259> surplus<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:35.100> heat<00:01:35.820> left<00:01:36.350> so

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
we still have a surplus of heat left so

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.710 
we still have a surplus of heat left so
we<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.340> fill<00:01:38.550> our<00:01:38.700> boilers<00:01:39.119> probably

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
we would fill our boilers probably

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.560 
we would fill our boilers probably
once<00:01:42.720> maybe<00:01:43.500> twice<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.920> day<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.970> really

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
once maybe twice a day if it's really

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.730 
once maybe twice a day if it's really
cold<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.120> will<00:01:48.300> last<00:01:48.480> all<00:01:48.750> night<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.500> found

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
cold and it will last all night we found

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.920 
cold and it will last all night we found
that<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.430> probably<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.240> most<00:01:51.390> efficient

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that it's probably the most efficient

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.860 
that it's probably the most efficient
unit<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.410> is<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:54.210> we're<00:01:54.360> very<00:01:54.390> very

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
unit there is and we're very very

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.260 
unit there is and we're very very
pleased<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.520> saved<00:01:56.760> us<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:57.030> huge

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
pleased with it and it's saved us a huge

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
pleased with it and it's saved us a huge
amount<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> money<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:58.200> figure<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.890> old

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
amount of money we figure at the old

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.330 
amount of money we figure at the old
unit<00:01:59.810> will<00:02:00.810> probably<00:02:01.290> pay<00:02:01.470> for<00:02:01.650> itself<00:02:01.920> in

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
unit will probably pay for itself in

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.469 
unit will probably pay for itself in
five<00:02:02.790> years<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.820> installation<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.940> all<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
five years the installation of all the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.169 
five years the installation of all the
underground<00:02:07.440> piping<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.850> said<00:02:09.030> there's

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
underground piping like I said there's

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.420 
underground piping like I said there's
about<00:02:09.300> 2,500<00:02:10.009> feet<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
about 2,500 feet of it

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.130 
about 2,500 feet of it
we<00:02:12.300> went<00:02:12.510> from<00:02:14.150> inch<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> half<00:02:15.390> steel<00:02:15.810> pipe

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
we went from inch and a half steel pipe

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.840 
we went from inch and a half steel pipe
to<00:02:16.440> two<00:02:16.860> inch<00:02:17.070> steel<00:02:17.340> pipe<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:18.270> high-tech<00:02:19.850> dip

the<00:02:23.750> long<00:02:24.069> long<00:02:25.069> start<00:02:27.159> insulated<00:02:28.299> piping<00:02:29.349> we

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
the long long start insulated piping we

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.820 
the long long start insulated piping we
tried<00:02:30.650> them<00:02:30.799> all<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.810> our<00:02:32.810> installation<00:02:33.440> was

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.430 

unique<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.129> different<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:39.110> lot<00:02:39.260> more

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
unique it's different it it's a lot more

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.770 
unique it's different it it's a lot more
complicated<00:02:39.860> but<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.790> average<00:02:40.940> installation

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
complicated but the average installation

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.240 
complicated but the average installation
is<00:02:41.989> fairly<00:02:42.230> simple<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.159> be<00:02:43.310> done<00:02:45.220> by<00:02:46.220> a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
is fairly simple and it can be done by a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.460 
is fairly simple and it can be done by a
person<00:02:46.549> who's<00:02:46.909> fairly<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:48.440> know

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
person who's fairly you know

person who's fairly you know
mechanically<00:02:49.069> inclined<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:51.549> we<00:02:52.549> found<00:02:52.819> that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
mechanically inclined and we found that

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.539 
mechanically inclined and we found that
with<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.829> different<00:02:57.220> applications<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.370> we

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
with the different applications that we

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.330 
with the different applications that we
have<00:02:58.579> here<00:02:59.239> it<00:03:00.140> just<00:03:00.410> took<00:03:00.530> us<00:03:00.680> longer<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.129> do

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
have here it just took us longer to do

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.940 
have here it just took us longer to do
it<00:03:01.629> but<00:03:02.629> we<00:03:02.900> just<00:03:03.019> kept<00:03:03.260> adding<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.859> the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
it but we just kept adding on to the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.250 
it but we just kept adding on to the
system<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.790> we<00:03:05.180> can<00:03:05.329> still<00:03:05.569> keep<00:03:05.750> adding<00:03:06.109> on

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
system and we can still keep adding on

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.380 
system and we can still keep adding on
to<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:07.450> we're<00:03:08.450> quite<00:03:08.840> pleased<00:03:09.170> with<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:10.390> with

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
to it we're quite pleased with the with

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.420 
to it we're quite pleased with the with
the<00:03:11.540> unit<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:14.079> overall<00:03:15.430> the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
the unit and but overall the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.140 
the unit and but overall the
performances<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:18.769> can't<00:03:18.950> compare<00:03:19.310> just

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
performances just can't compare just

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:29.550 
performances just can't compare just
can't
