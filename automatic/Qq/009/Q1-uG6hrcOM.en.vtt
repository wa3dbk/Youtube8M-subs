00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.909
 hello my name is my position I am head chef at the café de paris in 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.219
 biarritz is worried today so we present the recipe 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.220
 Salmon gravlax which astonishes its boom in Munich 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 so salmon gravlax it's a cold entry 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.460
 to start the recipe 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.009
 seen it will sell relaxe gold we took to a van that does pretty much 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.060
 between them 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.910
 leaves about 3 and a half pounds 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.890
 first step that of frédéric rivet 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890
 so here I'm going to do what's called in English the net 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.030
 in security pessimism as much as possible 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.030
 a demand 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.830
 so after the next step 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.750
 on the menu three years the park 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.880
 those parties that are a little greasy 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.539
 so knowing as much as for the best video 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.280
 more surely possible to bring up a fishmonger 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.760
 it will be much more classic is much faster 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.560
 Then I will remove the edges 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 so with a small place to stopped 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.870
 marinade highlights 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.170
 ictelecom account is the marina da so we need some 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.180
 ingredients so here we did 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 two gendarmes including that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.070
 we have a little more than a tablespoon of 0 9% 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.120
 we are ten years old then your card 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.220
 150 grams of sugar 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.370
 a pirate bay 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.370
 black pepper and crush and ten cents 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.440
 as well as a good year 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.960
 so the next step 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960
 with a water container that fits as well as possible 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.299
 we will have a little faty movie 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.129
 deep on which we pose right now 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.889
 and that then allows us to pack the salmon fillet 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.189
 for the marina of indoor laziness and inscriptions contact 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.989
 very simple to mix all the ingredients 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.709
 it is well Toulouse 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.029
 basically the same sources 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.279
 bob o'donnell 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.279
 in the marinade 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:51.549
 if we mix chemical if they are difficult 6h10 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.639
 next step in my previous 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.269
 in a container with fine parts 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.779
 and then it stays more than my life I go the marina on the salmon fillet or 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.449
 the simplest 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.049
 the most effective at the mark 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.049
 if we had 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.309
 from the outset the marco marzano teammates start that's all 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.689
 to allow that 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.069
 his daughter stella maris 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.069
 but it is well in touch 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.219
 if this sum is spread over the entire chain 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.229
 so here's another salmon is ready to marinate a step 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.689
 important so tamarina everything goes smoothly 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.429
 it is important to understand 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.809
 on the salmon fillet 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.369
 when I take the second tub 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.799
 this very stage 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.360
 just a few days so we who even eat lezennes 2 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.180
 you can put the conflict 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.680
 that's what you have at home 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.660
 after that, it's still under pressure and we left for a marinade of 36 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.849
 hours 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.119
 with an important step salmon as its marina good 

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:34.180
 reject water and the ko it is important to remove it all eight 

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:34.740
 hours 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.629
 so that the marina unfolds 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.429
 now i'm going to place in the fridge so precisely for these 

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:42.360
 three marinade figures 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.669
 the job the salmon said once he was withdrawing them money 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.400
 this year they are happy marina afp so after it takes to withdraw 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 precisely this marinade 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.270
 we can also respect to spend a little bit just as necessary if 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.319
 details for august are a little too much dancefloor 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.719
 and after just sponging it with a topaloff patrick paper 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.939
 now proceed to the last step 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.479
 the message 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.059
 in my skin we will cut the bridges 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.330
 small slices like this 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.150
 the broken poetess 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.150
 after you can listen to it at the finest subsidies 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.139
 a small piece of lemon 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.339
 for the company also often 2010 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:35.990
 it's just beautiful 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.439
 you have to do it yourself 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.099
 meanwhile could well in the Afghan conflict 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.360
 it's up to you 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 then we watered him 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.860
 a little trickle 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:54.889
 she created this little flick
