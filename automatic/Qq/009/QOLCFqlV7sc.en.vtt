I assume going into the device and the
other<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> 12<00:01:17.850> volt<00:01:18.119> DC<00:01:18.330> power

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
other one is just the 12 volt DC power

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.249 
other one is just the 12 volt DC power
on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.979> PC<00:01:20.520> connections<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.450> look<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.960> far

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
on the PC connections they look as far

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.859 
on the PC connections they look as far
only<00:01:22.560> see<00:01:22.770> connections<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.479> there's<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
only see connections or just there's the

have the transmitter plug into an
extension<00:03:16.070> cord<00:03:16.400> on<00:03:16.490> my<00:03:16.670> wall<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:18.230> I'll<00:03:18.380> just

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
extension cord on my wall and I'll just

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.710 
extension cord on my wall and I'll just
simply<00:03:19.010> unplug<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:21.080> music<00:03:21.440> will<00:03:21.530> stop

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.960

my PC but if you notice my transmitter

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.780 
my PC but if you notice my transmitter
has<00:03:32.300> no<00:03:32.570> lights<00:03:33.250> it's<00:03:34.250> totally<00:03:34.700> dead

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
that I was broadcasting I'll plug it

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.250 
that I was broadcasting I'll plug it
back<00:03:52.760> in

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.390 

try<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.320> anyway

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.890 

there<00:04:04.030> we<00:04:04.180> go

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.110 

now<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:10.379> this<00:04:10.650> stock<00:04:10.920> antenna<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:11.909> garage

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
now on this stock antenna in this garage

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.330 
now on this stock antenna in this garage
just<00:04:12.629> basically<00:04:13.080> it's<00:04:13.290> not<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.769> obvious<00:04:14.040> is

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
just basically it's not that obvious is

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.559 
just basically it's not that obvious is
just<00:04:14.489> kind<00:04:14.700> of<00:04:14.760> thrown<00:04:15.030> together<00:04:15.150> for<00:04:15.510> the

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
just kind of thrown together for the

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.800 
just kind of thrown together for the
demonstration<00:04:17.329> manufacturer<00:04:18.329> says<00:04:18.540> if<00:04:18.660> it's

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
demonstration manufacturer says if it's

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.840 
demonstration manufacturer says if it's
worth<00:04:18.959> two<00:04:19.229> to<00:04:19.380> three<00:04:19.590> hundred<00:04:19.620> meters<00:04:20.160> I'm

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
worth two to three hundred meters I'm

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.939 
worth two to three hundred meters I'm
getting<00:04:21.510> about<00:04:21.600> four<00:04:22.079> houses<00:04:22.320> or<00:04:22.740> five

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
getting about four houses or five

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.140 
getting about four houses or five
hundred<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.520> left<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.419> two<00:04:24.810> raising<00:04:25.760> so<00:04:26.760> it's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
hundred to left and two raising so it's

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.840 
hundred to left and two raising so it's
pretty<00:04:27.300> good<00:04:27.510> that's<00:04:27.720> kind<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.110> what<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.290> want<00:04:28.560> I

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
pretty good that's kind of what I want I

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.480 
pretty good that's kind of what I want I
could<00:04:29.850> improve<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.270> with<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.419> dipole<00:04:30.870> antenna

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
could improve it with a dipole antenna

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.230 
could improve it with a dipole antenna
anyways<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.610> just<00:04:32.639> thought<00:04:32.910> I'd<00:04:33.030> share<00:04:33.180> that

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
anyways I just thought I'd share that

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.400 
anyways I just thought I'd share that
with<00:04:33.479> you<00:04:34.040> thanks<00:04:35.040> for<00:04:35.160> looking
