I've<00:00:20.820> done<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.210> well<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.630> year<00:00:21.689> set<00:00:22.199> for

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
I've done really well this year set for

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.759 
I've done really well this year set for
about<00:00:22.410> 28<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.430> 30<00:00:23.730> young<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> first

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
about 28 to 30 young so that's the first

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.230 
about 28 to 30 young so that's the first
round<00:00:26.130> Birds<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.820> as<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.570> go<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.980> you'll<00:00:28.980> see

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
round Birds and as we go up you'll see

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.930 
round Birds and as we go up you'll see
these<00:00:30.240> are<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.480> second<00:00:31.489> second<00:00:32.489> round<00:00:32.669> Birds

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
these are the second second round Birds

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.240 
these are the second second round Birds
I<00:00:33.239> mean<00:00:33.780> these<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.380> problem<00:00:34.829> month<00:00:35.010> behind

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I mean these are a problem month behind

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.580 
I mean these are a problem month behind
but<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> starting<00:00:36.360> took<00:00:36.630> two<00:00:36.840> molt<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.320> now

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but the starting took two molt out now

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.340 
but the starting took two molt out now
and<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> year<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.629> know<00:00:39.750> change<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and up to the year you know change the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.340 
and up to the year you know change the
color<00:00:40.620> I've<00:00:41.309> been<00:00:41.520> giving<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:42.050> color<00:00:43.050> food

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
color I've been giving them color food

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.569 
color I've been giving them color food
in<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> water<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.649> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> drinking<00:00:47.190> waters

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
in the water and in the drinking waters

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.369 
in the water and in the drinking waters
you<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> food<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.200> well

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
you see and then in the food as well

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.680 
you see and then in the food as well
just<00:00:49.559> sprinkling<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.370> top<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.480> sea

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
just sprinkling it on top of the the sea

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.760 
just sprinkling it on top of the the sea
I've<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:52.649> got<00:00:53.329> one<00:00:54.329> Mueller<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.170> did<00:00:55.410> actually

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
I've also got one Mueller I did actually

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.189 
I've also got one Mueller I did actually
produce<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> end<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> up

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
produce one in the end there it is up

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.369 
produce one in the end there it is up
there<00:00:59.149> it's<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.270> obviously<00:01:00.629> malted<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.170> yet

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
there it's not obviously malted out yet

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.359 
there it's not obviously malted out yet
so<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.890> still<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.250> its<00:01:02.480> juvenile<00:01:03.480> colors<00:01:04.470> but

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so it's still in its juvenile colors but

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.420 
so it's still in its juvenile colors but
no<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.320> make<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.950> nice

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
no I think it's going to make a a nice

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.990 
no I think it's going to make a a nice
bird<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> bad<00:01:09.780> size<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.430> mean

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
bird it's a not a bad size so I mean

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.370 
bird it's a not a bad size so I mean
that's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.270> good<00:01:12.390> thing<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.240> see

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
that's a good thing but as you can see

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.030 
that's a good thing but as you can see
there's<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.470> fair<00:01:17.040> selection<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.869> intensive

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
there's a fair selection of intensive

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.950 
there's a fair selection of intensive
feather<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.430> non<00:01:20.640> intensive<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.509> hopefully

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
feather and non intensive so hopefully

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.469 
feather and non intensive so hopefully
we'll<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.439> mix<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.189> birds<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.180> pair

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
we'll have a good mix of birds to pair

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
we'll have a good mix of birds to pair
out<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.960> next<00:01:25.200> year<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.240> the
