Hi girls! In today’s tutorial, I will show you how to make a mosaic French manicure. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.470
Made of small colored shapes. 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.290
Of course, you can vary the colors as you like. 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.290
So let’s have a look to this video, hoping that you’ll enjoy it!

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.580
First of all, I’ve applied two coats of pink nail polish for French manicure. 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.840
To unify and enhance the color of the nail and to hide the imperfections. 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.280
Then I use nail polishes in shade of pink and violet. 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.020
Right then I make a quick French manicure, a sort of color swatch 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.320
To bring out the colors that I will use. 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.060
So I make the French manicure and I let it dry. 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.910
Then I use my nail polish brush to draw miscellaneous shapes on the French manicure. 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.940
The shapes don’t have to look perfect since we’ll make the outlines later. 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.570
Use preferably a nail polish that comes with a fine brush. 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.460
Like Essie or Orly nail polishes: they are easier to draw with. 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.270
Otherwise you can use a detail brush, dip it in the nail polish and make your drawings. 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.980
Then with a liner or a detail brush; it works with both brushes

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.010
I make the outlines of the colored shapes that I have drawn earlier. 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.230
When I’m done with the outlines, I draw a thick line of demarcation 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.380
to separate the nail tip from the rest of the nail. 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.450
And I let it dry. 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.750
Then with pink nail polish or acrylic paint and a dotting 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.410
I add very small dots inside the thick dividing line. 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.040
As I love rhinestones, I’ve added a rhinestone on the lunula. 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.740
When you’re done, apply the final top coat! 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.740
That’s it! I hope that you’ve enjoyed this video!
