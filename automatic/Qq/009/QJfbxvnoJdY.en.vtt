okay<00:00:00.539> here's<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.920> fun<00:00:01.920> quick<00:00:02.429> test<00:00:02.700> I'm<00:00:03.300> gonna

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay here's a fun quick test I'm gonna

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.760 
okay here's a fun quick test I'm gonna
use<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.929> Aspen<00:00:05.060> HQs<00:00:06.060> stereo<00:00:07.049> microphone<00:00:07.560> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
use the Aspen HQs stereo microphone and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.230 
use the Aspen HQs stereo microphone and
stereo<00:00:07.950> in<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.400> case<00:00:08.580> only<00:00:08.760> means<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.090> it

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
stereo in this case only means that it

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.209 
stereo in this case only means that it
goes<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.420> left<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.260> right<00:00:10.740> channel<00:00:11.099> as

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
goes to left and right channel as

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.339 
goes to left and right channel as
opposed<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.700> mono<00:00:11.910> one<00:00:12.240> which<00:00:12.900> only<00:00:13.110> goes

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
opposed to the mono one which only goes

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.210 
opposed to the mono one which only goes
to<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.730> the<00:00:14.730> left<00:00:14.880> channel<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.289> I'm<00:00:17.039> gonna

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
to the the left channel and so I'm gonna

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.720 
to the the left channel and so I'm gonna
use<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.580> stereo<00:00:17.850> lav<00:00:18.449> mic<00:00:19.080> here<00:00:19.520> to<00:00:20.520> go<00:00:20.699> into

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
use the stereo lav mic here to go into

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.960 
use the stereo lav mic here to go into
my<00:00:21.270> video<00:00:21.810> camera<00:00:22.260> which<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.590> my<00:00:22.710> iPhone<00:00:23.220> 4<00:00:23.609> I'm

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sound pretty good because I'm within a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.040 
sound pretty good because I'm within a
foot<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:35.160> phone<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.360> back<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.780> here

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
foot of the phone but as I back up here

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990 
foot of the phone but as I back up here
you'll<00:00:37.559> see<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> audio<00:00:38.280> changes

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you'll see that the audio changes

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.340 
you'll see that the audio changes
significantly<00:00:41.629> too<00:00:42.629> much<00:00:42.750> stuff<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:43.170> but

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
significantly too much stuff over but

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.090 
significantly too much stuff over but
the<00:00:43.710> audio<00:00:43.920> should<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.219> much<00:00:44.399> different<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
the audio should be much different and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.709 
the audio should be much different and
as<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.190> move<00:00:47.340> around<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.850> changes<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.480> gets<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
as I move around it changes it gets a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
lot more there's a lot more reverb in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.479 
lot more there's a lot more reverb in
this<00:00:51.270> room<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.960> you're<00:00:52.140> hearing<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> lav

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
this room that you're hearing so a lav

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.420 
this room that you're hearing so a lav
mic<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.000> gonna<00:00:54.180> allow<00:00:54.360> me<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.600> take<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.430> out

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
mic is gonna allow me to take that out

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.000 
mic is gonna allow me to take that out
of<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.149> equation<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.960> we're<00:00:58.559> gonna<00:00:58.649> connect

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
of the equation so we're gonna connect

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
of the equation so we're gonna connect
it<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.280> I'm<00:00:59.550> using<00:00:59.760> an<00:00:59.969> app<00:01:00.059> called<00:01:00.090> filmic<00:01:00.690> Pro
