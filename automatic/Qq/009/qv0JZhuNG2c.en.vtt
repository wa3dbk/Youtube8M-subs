00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.459 
and this is my mudroom outside and sort
of<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> little<00:00:55.949> test<00:00:56.250> place<00:00:56.850> here

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
of so and I got a little test place here

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.010 
of so and I got a little test place here
now<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.559> already<00:00:58.710> tested<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.579> put<00:01:00.329> little<00:01:00.480> fish

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
now I'm already tested I put little fish

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
now I'm already tested I put little fish
in<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.620> little<00:01:01.739> minnow<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.449> it<00:01:03.449> picked<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
in here a little minnow and it picked it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.219 
in here a little minnow and it picked it
clean<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.180> produced<00:01:06.180> enough<00:01:06.450> oxygen<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> keep

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
clean and produced enough oxygen to keep

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.640 
clean and produced enough oxygen to keep
it<00:01:07.380> alive<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it alive so it's really good for that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
it alive so it's really good for that
you<00:01:10.860> might<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.189> even<00:01:11.340> need<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:11.820> air<00:01:11.970> pump<00:01:12.210> but

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you might not even need an air pump but

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.020 
you might not even need an air pump but
you<00:01:13.080> might<00:01:13.260> want<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.250> Lux<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.909> know

what<00:01:59.549> should<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.820> do<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.799> video<00:02:01.799> but

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
what should I do with this a video but

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.340 
what should I do with this a video but
yeah<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.180> I'm<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> plug<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.170> show

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
yeah so I'm going to plug it in and show

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.310 
yeah so I'm going to plug it in and show
you<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.549> isn't<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.090> best<00:02:06.420> test<00:02:06.810> because

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you and this isn't the best test because

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.460 
you and this isn't the best test because
I<00:02:07.560> can't<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.729> down<00:02:08.759> far<00:02:09.599> enough<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.929> bring

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
I can't put it down far enough to bring

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.979 
I can't put it down far enough to bring
it<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> max<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:12.150> basically<00:02:12.540> see<00:02:12.840> how

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
it to the max but you basically see how

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.820 
it to the max but you basically see how
it<00:02:13.140> works<00:02:13.379> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it works and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:22.430 
it works and
show<00:02:14.040> yeah<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.520> let<00:02:15.180> me<00:02:15.270> plug<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:21.260> okay<00:02:22.260> it's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
show yeah so let me plug it in okay it's

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.660 
show yeah so let me plug it in okay it's
in<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.310> water<00:02:23.430> comes<00:02:23.850> up<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:25.670> it's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
in and the water comes up and it it's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.040 
in and the water comes up and it it's
like<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.820> waterfall<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.360> guess<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.900> make<00:02:27.930> a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
like a waterfall I guess you can make a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.120 
like a waterfall I guess you can make a
waterfall<00:02:28.560> Nikhil

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
waterfall Nikhil

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.260 
waterfall Nikhil
now<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.820> he<00:02:29.970> here<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.690> like<00:02:31.820> pulsing<00:02:32.850> water

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
now is he here it's like pulsing water

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.930 
now is he here it's like pulsing water
that's<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.980> not<00:02:35.130> down<00:02:35.460> and<00:02:35.730> water

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
that's because it's not down and water

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.790 
that's because it's not down and water
you<00:02:36.120> want<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.840> water<00:02:37.050> level<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.620> about

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
you want it the water level to be about

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.010 
you want it the water level to be about
here<00:02:38.130> this<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.970> little<00:02:39.210> test<00:02:39.420> thing<00:02:39.840> I

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
here this is just a little test thing I

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.100 
here this is just a little test thing I
have<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.000> don't<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> fish<00:02:42.810> tank

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
have so but I don't have a fish tank

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.910 
have so but I don't have a fish tank
right<00:02:43.200> now<00:02:43.320> because<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.950> use<00:02:44.130> bins<00:02:44.840> but<00:02:45.840> um<00:02:46.110> yeah

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
right now because I use bins but um yeah

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.000 
right now because I use bins but um yeah
this<00:02:47.070> is<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> great<00:02:47.550> test<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:49.470> can<00:02:49.620> see<00:02:49.800> how<00:02:49.890> it

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
this is a great test you can see how it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.710 
this is a great test you can see how it
works<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.490> know<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> filters<00:02:51.090> there<00:02:51.300> the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
works you know the filters there the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.050 
works you know the filters there the
water<00:02:51.930> comes<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.410> on<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> backside<00:02:53.060> I'll

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
water comes up on the backside I'll

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.720 
water comes up on the backside I'll
actually<00:02:54.330> show<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:56.130> thing<00:02:56.370> comes<00:02:56.580> off

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
actually show you this thing comes off

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.660 
actually show you this thing comes off
easy<00:02:57.090> I'll<00:02:57.300> come<00:02:58.050> up<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.320> easy<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:58.830> yeah<00:02:59.490> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
easy I'll come up that easy but yeah the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.160 
easy I'll come up that easy but yeah the
water<00:02:59.850> splashes<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:00.630> that's<00:03:00.840> why<00:03:00.990> that's

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
water splashes there that's why that's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.699 
water splashes there that's why that's
for<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:02.450> I'll<00:03:03.450> show<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.720> see<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.350> comes<00:03:04.530> up

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
for there I'll show you see it comes up

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.400 
for there I'll show you see it comes up
through<00:03:04.890> there<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:06.270> water<00:03:06.570> comes<00:03:06.870> up<00:03:07.050> from

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
through there the water comes up from

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.180 
through there the water comes up from
that<00:03:07.830> bottom<00:03:08.280> tube<00:03:08.550> down<00:03:08.850> there<00:03:09.860> comes<00:03:10.860> up

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
that bottom tube down there comes up

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.430 
that bottom tube down there comes up
here<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:13.230> then<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.310> goes<00:03:14.490> through<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.910> filter

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
here and then it goes through the filter

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.180 
here and then it goes through the filter
and<00:03:16.440> out<00:03:16.800> there<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:19.080> makes<00:03:19.260> some<00:03:19.590> oxygen

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
and out there and it makes some oxygen

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.180 
and out there and it makes some oxygen
bubbles<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.320> sort<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:22.440> an<00:03:22.620> air<00:03:22.739> pump<00:03:22.950> at

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
bubbles so sort of like an air pump at

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.380 
bubbles so sort of like an air pump at
the<00:03:23.310> same<00:03:23.519> time<00:03:24.140> works<00:03:25.140> great<00:03:25.650> uh<00:03:26.390> I

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
the same time works great uh I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.690 
the same time works great uh I
definitely<00:03:28.050> recommend<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.950> if<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
definitely recommend it if you have a

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.070 
definitely recommend it if you have a
old<00:03:30.420> fish<00:03:31.250> or<00:03:32.250> something<00:03:32.730> smaller<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.360> know<00:03:33.720> a

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
old fish or something smaller you know a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.100 
old fish or something smaller you know a
crayfish<00:03:35.510> something<00:03:36.510> smaller<00:03:36.930> a

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
crayfish something smaller a

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.160 
crayfish something smaller a
fire-bellied<00:03:37.769> toads<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.340> would<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.580> good<00:03:38.760> for

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
fire-bellied toads it would be good for

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.530 
fire-bellied toads it would be good for
but<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.350> don't<00:03:40.530> want<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.739> put<00:03:40.860> this<00:03:41.070> in<00:03:41.540> any

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
but you don't want to put this in any

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.320 
but you don't want to put this in any
sort<00:03:43.080> of<00:03:43.170> big<00:03:43.680> tank<00:03:44.040> or<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.459> turtle<00:03:45.000> tank<00:03:45.120> this

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
sort of big tank or a turtle tank this

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.140 
sort of big tank or a turtle tank this
is<00:03:45.390> for<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.959> small<00:03:46.170> tank<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.640> one<00:03:47.820> two<00:03:47.910> three

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
is for a small tank the one two three

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.870 
is for a small tank the one two three
now<00:03:48.360> if<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.050> got<00:03:49.200> one<00:03:49.800> of<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.010> bigger<00:03:50.280> filters

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
now if you got one of the bigger filters

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.460 
now if you got one of the bigger filters
I'd<00:03:51.090> say<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.450> beat<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.690> works<00:03:52.200> for<00:03:52.410> a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
I'd say that beat that works for a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.970 
I'd say that beat that works for a
turtle<00:03:52.890> tank<00:03:53.100> or<00:03:53.370> anything<00:03:53.400> really<00:03:54.739> yeah<00:03:55.739> and

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
turtle tank or anything really yeah and

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.710 
turtle tank or anything really yeah and
make<00:03:56.400> sure<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:56.820> stick<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.300> down<00:03:57.420> in<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.690> water

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
make sure you stick it down in the water

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.259 
make sure you stick it down in the water
as<00:03:58.080> far<00:03:58.320> as<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.560> can<00:03:58.800> right<00:03:59.459> under<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.970> spout

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
as far as you can right under the spout

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.850 
as far as you can right under the spout
pretty<00:04:00.660> much<00:04:01.519> for<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.670> max<00:04:03.290> water<00:04:04.290> flow<00:04:04.650> edge

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
pretty much for the max water flow edge

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.850 
pretty much for the max water flow edge
if<00:04:05.250> that's<00:04:05.519> even<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.850> word<00:04:05.910> but<00:04:06.420> yeah<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.830> a
