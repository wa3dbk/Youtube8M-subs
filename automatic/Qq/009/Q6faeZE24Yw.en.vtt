00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960
 schnafel 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.830
 but today it's about the topic 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.290
 Training helps There are two varieties 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.119
 Runners who have been running for years 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.710
 once a week always the same 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.200
 stretch around the same duck pond 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.020
 in the same tempo which it totally 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.570
 no matter if they get faster and then 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.150
 There are such high-performance organisms as 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.520
 So people need me again 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.949
 on your old days and the best time 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.420
 we want to get out faster 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.430
 I want to buy books 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.190
 divine steffi he bought i like something 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 he buys himself what the colleagues of 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.580
 runnersworld.de had 4000 pages 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.979
 but you can do that too 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.710
 abbreviate a bit there are five tips and 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.960
 they are always and for all first 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.059
 training at least three times a week 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.799
 The body forgets the training stimulus 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.229
 after 72 hours at the latest 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.360
 and that's why everyone can work out 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.760
 over the week have to be second 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.520
 from these at least three times training 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.040
 out of it a lot faster 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 feel good speed out of the comfort zone 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.780
 and quite honest sometimes, too 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.150
 really fun to run up the mountain and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.430
 ballet it sweating really bad 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.740
 Third, be honest you can yes 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.380
 Himself all his life 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.940
 shit with also the weather would be 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.290
 a little bit that the wind is the slope 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.750
 then I would have been much faster 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.000
 would have had bicycle chain point on the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.290
 What she says and that counts stops 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.490
 you all that nice to count 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 that just makes stress but not 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.240
 faster becomes very important to us 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.360
 stabilization exercises for the deep 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.970
 hip muscle for the stomach for the back 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.500
 that is good for the attitude that he is tired 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 can not be that fast that leaves you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.250
 Run faster and faster always 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.030
 still separate the hÃ¼ftkreisen and so 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.610
 make a junk 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.480
 no down in the since 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.520
 move forward 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.930
 and what else do I support and support 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.800
 a farm man half hourly system 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.360
 at the most important 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.649
 Regenerate and can be but in all 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.649
 relax reading a training book 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.820
 and by the way, if you still have hot 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.530
 have training tips if you have suggestions 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.420
 Always have something to complain about 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.370
 so on facebook on youtube and 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.150
 of course on achim-achilles de 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.150
 have fun
