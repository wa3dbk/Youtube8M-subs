00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.780
 another way to import songs to 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.639
 our library is using files 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.490
 that we already have stored in our 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.509
 hard drives or in other types of media 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.470
 of storage as CDs or DVDs 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:26.750
 USB memories it is possible to import or 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.640
 add these discs in two ways 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.399
 different the first one of it is 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.520
 selecting the options to add 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.620
 folder file to the library that is 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.430
 found in the file menu we are going to 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.890
 see how to use this option we click 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.950
 in the brno file and once we're 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.220
 inside it we select any of 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.350
 these two options the first one is going to add 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.170
 a single file and the second one 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.030
 full folder including everything 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.340
 be in it 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.489
 in my case I want to add only 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.829
 albums logically complete these 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.140
 albums I have them sorted by 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.909
 folders so I'm going to select the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.780
 second option add folder to the 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.720
 library once the selections 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.550
 will appear the windows explorer or a 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.369
 windows explorer window for 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.369
 find the folder or folders that 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.759
 we want to select myself previously with 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.789
 I walk some albums to this folder that I have 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.700
 here I will select any of 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:35.090
 them each one is a different album 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.479
 I'm going to select that automatically 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.450
 has added to the library if we do 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.569
 double click on any of these two 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.000
 drawings of a musical note we will enter 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.320
 directly to the songs that 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.770
 contains 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.220
 itunes is separated by album 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.680
 and this identifies it thanks to the data 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.490
 who have the mp3s that is also known 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.260
 as tag those data are the ones that go to 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.570
 serve to order the songs inside 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.690
 from the library when they do not exist 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.840
 said data will probably make a 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.030
 mess this we will see in a video 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.520
 later where I explain how to modify 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.760
 the names of the artist's songs 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.500
 among other things since I'm here not 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.959
 is the way in which the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.450
 songs this is thanks to the options 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.160
 of visualization that we saw in the video 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.680
 where it explains the itunes interface 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.720
 we noticed that this button is the one that is 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.760
 activated at this time we can 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.560
 select between the four different 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.170
 visualization forms I'm going to click 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.450
 in the first one we see how it changes 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.019
 the way they visualize is like 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.300
 a kind of list the second is the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.330
 that we had previously shows in 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.150
 this area the cover of the disc if it is that 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.400
 it has the name of the album in the part 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.849
 top on the bottom the name 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.530
 artist or the band as the case may be 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.689
 and on the right side we will see the list of 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.670
 all the songs ordered by the 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.620
 track number or the track number 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.780
 we also have the name of the 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.900
 songs how long each of them lasts 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.629
 a column that says artist sort of 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.670
 what musical genre is the album all this 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.609
 is going to take it as I say the ide tag that 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.980
 they have the mp3 does not mean that 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:25.189
 really be the genre which is 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.560
 indicated here because that data the 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.019
 place the person or persons who 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.420
 encode the albums then any 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.629
 name that you add there is the one that 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.909
 will appear in this column we have more 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.560
 options that are hidden and inclusive 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.959
 there are more that can be selected 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.879
 by right clicking this will already depend 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.650
 of the needs of everyone I go 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.659
 to leave the options that come 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.760
 they come by default on iTunes that are the 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.090
 what are you seeing at this moment the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.099
 third way of viewing is this 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.319
 which is the one that saves more space in the 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.510
 screen shows only the name 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.639
 of the artist and the album how are you 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.530
 watching at this moment in case 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.340
 exist 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.020
 from an album by the same artist itunes 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.620
 automatically groups them for example 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.810
 here if I had another epic album what 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.570
 what I would do is add only epic and 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.760
 by double clicking we would enter all 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.960
 the albums that we have added to the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.870
 library with that artist name I'm going 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.720
 to return this is one of the ways to 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.340
 add new albums from our 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.950
 hard drives or devices 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.560
 storage by entering the file menu 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.840
 and selecting add folder or file 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.240
 to the library whenever we want 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.820
 add new albums we can do that 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.490
 and not just a single folder can we 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.280
 add several folders at once 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.500
 we select them all we press the 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.840
 button this and they are automatically added 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.630
 all those that already have covers are going to 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.630
 appear the images of said covers 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.750
 in these boxes showing itunes and 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.790
 those who will not show them but more 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.590
 ahead we will see how to add some 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.640
 cover in case they do not have or 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.950
 including putting the original cover 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.560
 I will automatically remove 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.570
 intentionally these albums 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.300
 for some reason itunes when you start 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.580
 to delete albums warns you sometimes 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.520
 and at other times not notice how 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.710
 I eliminated a first album and did not notice 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.889
 now that he tried to eliminate this me 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.870
 this window appears I will select 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.050
 eliminate it is important to take into account 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.680
 that what eliminates itunes are the data 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.480
 from the library the album keeps it in 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.000
 its place of origin that in my case is 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.040
 on my main hard drive 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.740
 I'm eliminating them because now 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.200
 add the other one in a different way 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.540
 way to add album and it's the easiest 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.750
 for me it is through the explorer of 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.020
 windows i 'm going to make this window a bit 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.270
 smaller 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.120
 I'll put it in comparison mode and I'll 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.389
 open the windows explorer I will do what 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.960
 same with her here I have the songs 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.630
 that I added a moment ago 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.380
 we can add some or new discs 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.750
 audio to itunes directly from the 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.300
 windows explorer in a very way 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.940
 easy dragging and dropping what I'm going 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.800
 to do is only select one 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.440
 folder and once I selected it I do 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.660
 click and without releasing the mouse button 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.870
 Once dragged into this 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.810
 area let's automatically add 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.650
 the album we can do it with the number 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:44.560
 of albums that we want I will select 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:47.979
 all these and I will add see them 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.110
 how is a faster way inclusive 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:52.180
 we can do it with songs 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.639
 individual and so we wish we can 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.190
 directly select a song and 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.960
 adding them to the library in case of 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.090
 that you only want to add songs 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.880
 obviously if you want the full album 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.889
 it is advisable to add the folder 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.740
 the way I just did it I'm going to 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.289
 maximize this window what I just 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.539
 we can do it with any 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.180
 type of file that the library accepts 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.990
 of itunes not only the songs 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.950
 as well 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.990
 add videos podcast apps and 

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.810
 many other things 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.420
 iTunes will automatically place those 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.460
 files where they correspond for example 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.610
 if we drag a video, it will be placed 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.920
 in this option that says movies yet 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.750
 when you're in movies and you drag a 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.290
 audio file is automatically going to 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:44.080
 add in the corresponding section that 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.200
 is the music these are the two forms 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.030
 to add albums to the library or 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.850
 any type of file that accepts the 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.920
 same only by dragging from the 

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.810
 file explorer dropping in this 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.960
 area or by selecting file and 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:03.390
 then add file the library or 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.390
 add folder to it
