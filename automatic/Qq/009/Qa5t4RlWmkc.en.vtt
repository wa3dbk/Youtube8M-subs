what<00:00:05.570> we<00:00:05.600> call<00:00:05.690> a<00:00:05.840> project<00:00:06.500> car<00:00:06.790> it's<00:00:07.790> actually

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
what we call a project car it's actually

what we call a project car it's actually
a<00:00:08.179> veteran<00:00:08.599> of<00:00:08.750> three<00:00:08.780> different<00:00:09.710> jumps<00:00:10.040> and

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
a veteran of three different jumps and

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.799 
a veteran of three different jumps and
it<00:00:11.540> was<00:00:11.690> built<00:00:11.960> for<00:00:12.260> a<00:00:12.320> singular<00:00:12.769> purpose<00:00:12.980> to

it was built for a singular purpose to

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.320 
it was built for a singular purpose to
jump<00:00:14.809> off<00:00:15.019> a<00:00:15.050> ramp<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.160> fly<00:00:16.910> through<00:00:16.939> the<00:00:17.300> air

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
were used over 300 Dodge Chargers

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.490 
were used over 300 Dodge Chargers
various<00:00:29.869> years<00:00:30.140> from<00:00:30.380> 68<00:00:30.980> 69<00:00:31.490> and<00:00:31.789> 70<00:00:32.239> and<00:00:32.629> out

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
various years from 68 69 and 70 and out

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.630 
various years from 68 69 and 70 and out
of<00:00:33.649> that<00:00:33.800> is<00:00:33.980> about<00:00:34.220> 29<00:00:34.640> cars<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:35.720> survived

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
of that is about 29 cars that survived

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.979 
of that is about 29 cars that survived
and<00:00:37.640> when<00:00:38.180> they<00:00:38.270> did<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:38.540> movie<00:00:38.899> in<00:00:39.880> 2005<00:00:40.989> they

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
and when they did the movie in 2005 they

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.560 
and when they did the movie in 2005 they
used<00:00:42.260> 29<00:00:43.100> cars<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:43.790> out<00:00:43.880> of<00:00:44.000> that<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.180> think

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
used 29 cars and out of that I think

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.630 
used 29 cars and out of that I think
there's<00:00:44.809> about<00:00:44.930> six<00:00:45.380> of<00:00:45.500> them<00:00:45.649> left<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.250> out

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
there's about six of them left and out

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.459 
there's about six of them left and out
of<00:00:46.820> that<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.149> one<00:00:47.480> here<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:47.989> what<00:00:48.170> they<00:00:48.260> call

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
of that this one here is what they call

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.799 
of that this one here is what they call
a<00:00:48.500> sling<00:00:48.890> car<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.489> it's<00:00:50.239> been<00:00:50.300> heavily

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
a sling car and it's been heavily

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.319 
a sling car and it's been heavily
modified<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.920> do<00:00:52.070> one<00:00:52.280> thing<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:52.760> let's<00:00:52.910> jump

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
modified to do one thing and let's jump

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.299 
modified to do one thing and let's jump
off<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.660> end<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:53.899> ramp<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.440> fly<00:00:55.280> through

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
off the end of the ramp and fly through

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.520 
off the end of the ramp and fly through
the<00:00:55.610> air<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.329> General<00:00:57.020> Lee<00:00:57.170> was<00:00:57.320> known

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
the air that the General Lee was known

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.619 
the air that the General Lee was known
for<00:00:57.860> but<00:00:58.370> as<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:58.700> can<00:00:58.820> see<00:00:58.969> underneath<00:00:59.270> there

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
for but as you can see underneath there

for but as you can see underneath there
this<00:01:00.110> car<00:01:00.410> it's<00:01:00.620> been<00:01:00.800> heavily<00:01:01.070> reinforced

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
this car it's been heavily reinforced

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.209 
this car it's been heavily reinforced
with<00:01:02.449> steel<00:01:02.510> bars<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.469> there's<00:01:03.620> a<00:01:03.680> giant<00:01:04.070> hook

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:04.219 
with steel bars and there's a giant hook

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.940 
with steel bars and there's a giant hook
on<00:01:04.430> there<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.719> ramp<00:01:05.959> system<00:01:06.380> was<00:01:06.560> built

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
on there and the ramp system was built

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.039 
on there and the ramp system was built
by<00:01:07.219> a<00:01:07.249> company<00:01:07.850> called<00:01:08.029> Ghost<00:01:08.450> stunts<00:01:08.810> out<00:01:08.929> of

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
by a company called Ghost stunts out of

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.219 
by a company called Ghost stunts out of
California<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:11.119> ramp<00:01:11.659> that<00:01:11.840> they<00:01:11.990> use

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
California and this ramp that they use

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.539 
California and this ramp that they use
was<00:01:12.439> similar<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.920> what<00:01:13.039> they<00:01:13.159> used<00:01:13.340> on<00:01:13.459> the

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
was similar to what they used on the

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.090 
was similar to what they used on the
aircraft<00:01:13.909> carrier<00:01:14.029> and<00:01:14.929> as<00:01:15.139> gas-powered<00:01:15.679> I

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
aircraft carrier and as gas-powered I

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.279 
aircraft carrier and as gas-powered I
would<00:01:16.729> launch<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.029> car<00:01:17.329> took<00:01:17.659> about<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.899> second

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
would launch the car took about a second

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.980 
would launch the car took about a second
and<00:01:18.349> a<00:01:18.439> half<00:01:18.469> to<00:01:18.939> hit<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.060> ramp<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.630> go<00:01:20.840> into

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
and a half to hit the ramp and go into

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.769 
and a half to hit the ramp and go into
the<00:01:21.139> air<00:01:21.319> and<00:01:21.670> this<00:01:22.670> one<00:01:22.880> here<00:01:23.119> survived<00:01:23.569> I

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
the air and this one here survived I

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:25.269 
the air and this one here survived I
believe<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> hundred<00:01:24.499> and<00:01:24.619> seventy<00:01:25.069> foot

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.279 
believe is a hundred and seventy foot

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.879 
believe is a hundred and seventy foot
jump<00:01:25.670> which<00:01:26.389> was<00:01:26.659> quite<00:01:27.020> an<00:01:27.139> incredible<00:01:27.409> feat

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
jump which was quite an incredible feat

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:31.059 
jump which was quite an incredible feat
and<00:01:28.539> of<00:01:29.539> course<00:01:29.779> it<00:01:29.929> was<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.049> driverless<00:01:30.499> car<00:01:30.859> so

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
and of course it was a driverless car so

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:32.859 
and of course it was a driverless car so
they<00:01:31.189> took<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.459> engine<00:01:31.759> transmission<00:01:32.179> out<00:01:32.749> of

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
they took the engine transmission out of

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.129 
they took the engine transmission out of
it<00:01:33.069> for<00:01:34.069> weight<00:01:34.310> purposes<00:01:35.950> some<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:38.139> the

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:39.139 
it for weight purposes some of the the

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:42.159 
it for weight purposes some of the the
glass<00:01:39.679> has<00:01:39.919> been<00:01:39.950> taken<00:01:40.459> out<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:41.169> certainly

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:42.169 
glass has been taken out and certainly

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:44.830 
glass has been taken out and certainly
it's<00:01:42.499> been<00:01:42.709> modified<00:01:43.249> the<00:01:43.279> original<00:01:44.179> car<00:01:44.539> in

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
it's been modified the original car in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.620 
it's been modified the original car in
the<00:01:44.929> movie<00:01:45.109> was<00:01:45.499> actually<00:01:45.679> a<00:01:46.099> 69<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.299> they<00:01:47.450> had

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the movie was actually a 69 so they had

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.669 
the movie was actually a 69 so they had
to<00:01:47.779> convert<00:01:48.169> the<00:01:49.159> 70s<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:49.969> the<00:01:50.090> 68<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:51.079> have

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
to convert the 70s and the 68 to have

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.699 
to convert the 70s and the 68 to have
the<00:01:51.859> correct<00:01:52.099> taillights<00:01:52.999> on<00:01:53.239> them<00:01:53.419> as<00:01:54.409> well

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
the correct taillights on them as well

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.679 
the correct taillights on them as well
as<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.919> pusher<00:01:55.249> bar<00:01:55.429> in<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.669> front<00:01:55.939> I<00:01:56.179> think

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
as the pusher bar in the front I think

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.629 
as the pusher bar in the front I think
what<00:01:56.840> makes<00:01:57.079> this<00:01:57.289> car<00:01:57.529> so<00:01:57.559> interesting<00:01:58.309> is<00:01:58.459> it

00:01:58.629 --> 00:01:58.639 
what makes this car so interesting is it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.609 
what makes this car so interesting is it
this<00:01:59.569> is<00:01:59.779> a<00:01:59.809> part<00:02:00.079> of<00:02:00.169> moviemaking

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
cars as opposed to computer graphics so

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.990 
cars as opposed to computer graphics so
a<00:02:09.679> lot<00:02:09.829> of<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.039> stunts<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.519> you<00:02:10.610> see<00:02:10.819> in<00:02:10.909> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
a lot of the stunts that you see in the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480 
a lot of the stunts that you see in the
movie<00:02:11.269> we're<00:02:11.420> done<00:02:11.920> by<00:02:12.920> stunt<00:02:13.219> drivers

movie we're done by stunt drivers
and<00:02:14.580> certainly<00:02:15.270> makes<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> one<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.410> I

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
and certainly makes it one of the I

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.340 
and certainly makes it one of the I
think<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.730> best<00:02:17.910> action<00:02:18.240> films<00:02:18.900> of

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
think one of the best action films of

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.490 
think one of the best action films of
all<00:02:19.620> time<00:02:19.670> for<00:02:20.670> car<00:02:20.850> enthusiasts<00:02:21.500> well

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
all time for car enthusiasts well

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.040 
all time for car enthusiasts well
certainly<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.160> type<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.670> car<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.960> to

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
certainly this type of car is going to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.470 
certainly this type of car is going to
be<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.260> interest<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.860> Duke<00:02:26.640> fans<00:02:27.000> around<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
be of interest to Duke fans around the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.840 
be of interest to Duke fans around the
world<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.020> hopefully<00:02:28.920> somebody's<00:02:29.700> going<00:02:29.820> to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
world and hopefully somebody's going to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.180 
world and hopefully somebody's going to
take<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.330> possibly<00:02:30.540> restore<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:32.040> may

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
take it and possibly restore it they may

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.220 
take it and possibly restore it they may
just<00:02:32.430> leave<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.240> put<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.170> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
just leave it as is and put it in a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.310 
just leave it as is and put it in a
museum<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.550> it's<00:02:35.790> certainly<00:02:36.090> an<00:02:36.750> interesting

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
museum and it's certainly an interesting

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.260 
museum and it's certainly an interesting
piece<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.770> pop<00:02:37.980> culture<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.700> anybody<00:02:39.060> that's

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
piece of pop culture and anybody that's

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.310 
piece of pop culture and anybody that's
into<00:02:39.780> cars<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.740> has<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> soft<00:02:41.760> spot<00:02:41.970> for

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
into cars I think has a soft spot for

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.040 
into cars I think has a soft spot for
the<00:02:43.320> generally<00:02:44.330> well<00:02:45.330> as<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.570> can<00:02:45.690> see<00:02:45.840> this

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
the generally well as you can see this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.290 
the generally well as you can see this
has<00:02:46.260> been<00:02:46.470> heavily<00:02:47.070> modified<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> engine

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
has been heavily modified in the engine

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.680 
has been heavily modified in the engine
bay<00:02:49.160> importantly<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.280> has<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.420> brake

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
bay importantly it has the the brake

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.300 
bay importantly it has the the brake
systems<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.350> there<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.650> still<00:02:52.920> wanted<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
systems on there you still wanted to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.860 
systems on there you still wanted to
stop<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.940> was<00:02:54.090> obviously<00:02:54.450> done<00:02:54.660> by

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
stop and that was obviously done by

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.500 
stop and that was obviously done by
remote<00:02:55.260> control<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:56.460> generally<00:02:56.880> by<00:02:57.090> far<00:02:57.360> is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
remote control the generally by far is

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.710 
remote control the generally by far is
the<00:02:57.780> most<00:02:58.220> recognizable<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.340> all<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.210> TV<00:03:00.570> and

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
the most recognizable of all the TV and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.600 
the most recognizable of all the TV and
movie<00:03:00.840> Cars<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:02.100> right<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:02.400> there<00:03:02.550> with

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
movie Cars and it's right up there with

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.750 
movie Cars and it's right up there with
the<00:03:02.820> Batmobile<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.870> James<00:03:04.560> Bond<00:03:04.920> car<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the Batmobile and the James Bond car and

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.450 
the Batmobile and the James Bond car and
interestingly<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.590> theme<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
interestingly the the theme with the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.610 
interestingly the the theme with the
Confederate<00:03:09.240> flag<00:03:09.450> on<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.720> top<00:03:09.930> has<00:03:10.350> been

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
Confederate flag on the top has been

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.110 
Confederate flag on the top has been
done<00:03:11.190> on<00:03:11.370> everything<00:03:11.760> from<00:03:12.030> bicycles<00:03:12.720> guitars

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
done on everything from bicycles guitars

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.350 
done on everything from bicycles guitars
Ferraris<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.470> an<00:03:16.560> incredible<00:03:17.360> part

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
Ferraris it's really an incredible part

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:31.870 
Ferraris it's really an incredible part
of<00:03:18.510> pop<00:03:18.750> culture

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.640 

well<00:03:32.880> there's<00:03:33.120> fancy<00:03:33.690> cars<00:03:33.990> in<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.380> but

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
well there's fancy cars in this but

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.040 
well there's fancy cars in this but
certainly<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.220> General<00:03:35.610> Lee<00:03:35.760> touches<00:03:36.660> us<00:03:36.810> all

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
certainly the General Lee touches us all

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.170 
certainly the General Lee touches us all
and<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.800> think<00:03:37.860> every<00:03:38.340> car<00:03:38.580> collector<00:03:38.970> has<00:03:39.150> a

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
and I think every car collector has a

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.600 
and I think every car collector has a
soft<00:03:39.510> spot<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:40.080> his<00:03:40.230> heart<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.160> generally

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:04:04.180 

yeah<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:48.890> feel<00:03:49.890> like<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.100> Budweiser<00:03:50.400> right<00:03:50.940> now

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160

all right
