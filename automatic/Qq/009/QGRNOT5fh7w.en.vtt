don't<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.500> that's<00:01:43.740> gonna<00:01:43.979> take<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
don't want that that's gonna take up a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.410 
don't want that that's gonna take up a
lot<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> space<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.720> worth<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.939> if

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
lot of space it's not worth it but if

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.649 
lot of space it's not worth it but if
you<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.740> these<00:01:50.700> ones<00:01:50.970> they<00:01:51.240> should<00:01:51.270> download

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you get these ones they should download

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.670 
you get these ones they should download
pretty<00:01:52.170> fast<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:54.380> also<00:01:57.170> they<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.380> gonna

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
pretty fast and also they are not gonna

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.950 
pretty fast and also they are not gonna
take<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.219> space<00:01:59.549> this<00:02:00.240> one's<00:02:00.479> not

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
take up some more space this one's not

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.289 
take up some more space this one's not
downloading<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.799> then<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> busy<00:02:03.030> house
