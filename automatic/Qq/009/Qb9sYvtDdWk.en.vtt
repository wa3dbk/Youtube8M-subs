amputee to really figure out where to go
to<00:00:06.280> get<00:00:06.550> their<00:00:06.760> care

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
to get their care

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.539 
to get their care
many<00:00:09.269> facilities<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.980> prosthetic<00:00:11.309> and

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:11.549 
many facilities in the prosthetic and

many facilities in the prosthetic and
orthotics<00:00:11.969> field<00:00:12.210> provide<00:00:12.889> care<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> all

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
orthotics field provide care to all

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.300 
orthotics field provide care to all
different<00:00:15.240> levels<00:00:15.539> of<00:00:15.750> amputees<00:00:16.310> however

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
different levels of amputees however

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.190 
different levels of amputees however
there<00:00:17.550> are<00:00:17.640> very<00:00:17.820> few<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.570> specials

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
there are very few that have specials

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.080 
there are very few that have specials
that<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.740> provide<00:00:20.189> care<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.610> upper<00:00:20.939> limb

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
that just provide care to upper limb

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.720 
that just provide care to upper limb
patients<00:00:21.570> ativan<00:00:22.320> some<00:00:22.560> dynamics<00:00:22.980> all<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.550> do

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
patients ativan some dynamics all we do

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.820 
patients ativan some dynamics all we do
is<00:00:23.880> take<00:00:24.060> care<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.390> upper<00:00:24.630> limb<00:00:24.810> patients<00:00:25.289> this

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
is take care of upper limb patients this

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.740 
is take care of upper limb patients this
allows<00:00:26.130> us<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> unique<00:00:26.910> perspective<00:00:27.269> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
allows us to have a unique perspective a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.779 
allows us to have a unique perspective a
perspective<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.439> focuses<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
challenges of an upper limb amputee we

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.710 
challenges of an upper limb amputee we
really<00:00:35.309> need<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> take<00:00:35.730> into<00:00:35.940> consideration

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
really need to take into consideration

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.829 
really need to take into consideration
the<00:00:37.410> self-image<00:00:38.160> component<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.030> losing<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
from a functional aspect the dexterity

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.710 
from a functional aspect the dexterity
that<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.589> human<00:00:50.100> hand<00:00:50.309> has<00:00:50.549> is<00:00:50.790> very<00:00:51.299> difficult

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
that a human hand has is very difficult

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.930 
that a human hand has is very difficult
to<00:00:51.900> replace<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:52.589> we<00:00:53.190> need<00:00:53.369> to<00:00:53.430> take<00:00:53.549> all<00:00:53.760> those

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to replace and we need to take all those

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.789 
to replace and we need to take all those
things<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.239> consideration<00:00:54.479> as<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.440> craft

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
things into consideration as we craft

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.190 
things into consideration as we craft
the<00:00:56.040> appropriate<00:00:56.549> rehabilitation<00:00:57.269> plan

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.990 

most<00:01:01.200> facilities<00:01:01.620> provide<00:01:02.310> just<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
most facilities provide just the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.690 
most facilities provide just the
prosthetics<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:04.770> patients<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.460> need<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
prosthetics the patients really need a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
prosthetics the patients really need a
comprehensive<00:01:06.330> approach<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.900> includes

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
comprehensive approach that includes

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.520 
comprehensive approach that includes
case<00:01:08.580> management<00:01:09.060> therapeutic<00:01:09.870> intervention

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
case management therapeutic intervention

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.160 
case management therapeutic intervention
really<00:01:11.490> being<00:01:11.670> involved<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> R&amp;D<00:01:12.660> side<00:01:12.900> so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
really being involved on the R&amp;D side so

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
really being involved on the R&amp;D side so
each<00:01:13.320> patient<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.160> has<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.880> opportunity

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
each patient really has the opportunity

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.700 
each patient really has the opportunity
to<00:01:15.480> get<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> most<00:01:15.750> up-to-date<00:01:16.320> technology

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
to get the most up-to-date technology

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.340 
to get the most up-to-date technology
the<00:01:17.400> most<00:01:17.550> appropriate<00:01:17.910> technology<00:01:18.660> and<00:01:19.140> then

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the most appropriate technology and then

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.830 
the most appropriate technology and then
spend<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.770> lot<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.040> time<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.150> anatomy<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
spend a lot of time on the anatomy and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
spend a lot of time on the anatomy and
really<00:01:22.110> understand<00:01:22.610> what<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> means<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.210> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
really understand what it means to be in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.610 
really understand what it means to be in
a<00:01:24.420> comfortable<00:01:24.660> prosthesis<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:28.200> expedited

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
a comfortable prosthesis the expedited

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.620 
a comfortable prosthesis the expedited
fitting<00:01:28.860> process<00:01:29.310> involves<00:01:30.240> fitting<00:01:30.540> a

fitting process involves fitting a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.020 
fitting process involves fitting a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
patient on really the first day and we

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
patient on really the first day and we
cast<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.509> patient<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:33.960> fit<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.110> diagnostic

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
cast the patient and fit a diagnostic

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
cast the patient and fit a diagnostic
socket<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.660> often<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:36.750> series<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.110> diagnostic

sockets until we have an optimal fit

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.340 
sockets until we have an optimal fit
then<00:01:40.800> we<00:01:40.950> add<00:01:41.130> componentry<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.900> rest<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
then we add componentry and the rest of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.040 
then we add componentry and the rest of
the<00:01:43.440> prosthesis<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.900> fine-tune<00:01:45.900> the
