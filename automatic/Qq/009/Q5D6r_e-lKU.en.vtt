then it'll switch the main menu the
reason<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.120> does<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.569> because<00:03:21.780> forge<00:03:22.079> is

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
reason it does this is because forge is

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.979 
reason it does this is because forge is
in<00:03:22.650> beta<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.940> takes<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.420> while<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.840> get

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
in beta and it takes a while to get

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.930 
in beta and it takes a while to get
things<00:03:25.260> done<00:03:25.440> once<00:03:25.859> forge<00:03:26.160> isn't<00:03:26.639> in<00:03:26.730> beta

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.520 
things done once forge isn't in beta
things<00:03:27.540> will<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> lot<00:03:27.930> more<00:03:27.989> quicker<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
things will be a lot more quicker the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.379 
things will be a lot more quicker the
black<00:03:28.709> screen<00:03:29.010> if<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.400> happens<00:03:29.790> won't<00:03:30.090> be<00:03:30.239> as
