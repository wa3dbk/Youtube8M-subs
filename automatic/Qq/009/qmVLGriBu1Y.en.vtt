crumbling<00:00:28.180> cars<00:00:28.570> are<00:00:28.779> tumbling<00:00:29.169> out<00:00:29.290> we<00:00:29.919> have

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:30.129 
crumbling cars are tumbling out we have

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.769 
crumbling cars are tumbling out we have
the<00:00:30.430> parking<00:00:30.759> garage<00:00:31.000> on<00:00:31.239> the<00:00:31.300> right<00:00:31.509> side

the parking garage on the right side
that<00:00:31.809> crumbles<00:00:32.559> too<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.040> cars<00:00:33.250> are<00:00:33.399> tumbling

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.920 
that crumbles too and cars are tumbling
out<00:00:33.910> so<00:00:34.120> we<00:00:34.180> thought<00:00:34.270> hey<00:00:34.450> it<00:00:34.510> would<00:00:34.629> be<00:00:34.719> great

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
out so we thought hey it would be great

out so we thought hey it would be great
to<00:00:34.960> have<00:00:35.110> some<00:00:35.290> real<00:00:35.440> cars<00:00:35.770> that<00:00:36.070> you<00:00:36.160> know

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
to have some real cars that you know

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.600 
to have some real cars that you know
fall<00:00:36.489> down<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:38.469> work<00:00:38.649> with<00:00:38.829> Mike<00:00:39.280> Vezina

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610

the special effects supervisor on that

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.700 
the special effects supervisor on that
and<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:41.829> really<00:00:42.070> did<00:00:42.280> some<00:00:42.429> tests<00:00:42.820> but<00:00:43.710> again

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
and and really did some tests but again

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.279 
and and really did some tests but again
they<00:00:44.949> undoubtedly<00:00:45.539> very<00:00:46.539> very<00:00:46.870> little<00:00:47.050> and

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
they undoubtedly very very little and

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.989 
they undoubtedly very very little and
only<00:00:47.409> do<00:00:47.739> very<00:00:48.010> little<00:00:48.159> because<00:00:48.550> it's<00:00:48.730> so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:48.999 
only do very little because it's so

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:50.849 
only do very little because it's so
specific<00:00:49.480> when<00:00:50.109> their<00:00:50.260> parking<00:00:50.620> garage

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
specific when their parking garage

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.040 
specific when their parking garage
crumbles<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.489> car<00:00:51.760> cars<00:00:52.239> have<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.629> tumble<00:00:52.989> out

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
crumbles the car cars have to tumble out

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.829 
crumbles the car cars have to tumble out
in<00:00:53.260> a<00:00:53.350> very<00:00:53.679> specific<00:00:53.949> angle<00:00:54.609> so<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:55.659> know<00:00:55.780> you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
in a very specific angle so you know you

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.779 
in a very specific angle so you know you
can<00:00:56.050> drop<00:00:56.170> cars<00:00:56.440> from<00:00:56.589> a<00:00:56.679> crane<00:00:56.949> you<00:00:57.249> can<00:00:57.429> have

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
can drop cars from a crane you can have

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.479 
can drop cars from a crane you can have
carts<00:00:58.210> swirl<00:00:58.870> through<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.469> picture<00:00:59.890> but<00:01:00.219> just

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
carts swirl through the picture but just

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.189 
carts swirl through the picture but just
to<00:01:00.579> have<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:00.789> exactly<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.539> right<00:01:01.659> angle<00:01:01.870> it's

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
to have it exactly the right angle it's

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.350 
to have it exactly the right angle it's
a<00:01:02.260> huge<00:01:02.620> huge<00:01:02.859> setup<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:03.969> then<00:01:04.059> if<00:01:04.150> you<00:01:04.239> think

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
a huge huge setup and then if you think

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.240 
a huge huge setup and then if you think
about<00:01:04.629> how<00:01:04.750> much<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.050> costs<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.650> have<00:01:05.740> just<00:01:06.159> a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
about how much it costs to have just a

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.160 
about how much it costs to have just a
small<00:01:06.550> second<00:01:07.000> unit<00:01:07.270> team<00:01:07.390> shoot<00:01:07.780> this<00:01:07.990> and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
small second unit team shoot this and

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.410 
small second unit team shoot this and
then<00:01:08.290> you<00:01:08.409> can<00:01:08.560> get<00:01:08.770> maybe<00:01:09.010> whatever<00:01:09.370> two<00:01:10.299> or

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
then you can get maybe whatever two or

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.360 
then you can get maybe whatever two or
three<00:01:10.690> takes<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.200> day<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.770> you're<00:01:12.100> destroying

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
three takes a day and you're destroying

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.630 
three takes a day and you're destroying
two<00:01:12.850> or<00:01:12.940> three<00:01:13.120> cars<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.870> day<00:01:14.320> with<00:01:14.620> that<00:01:14.650> then

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
two or three cars a day with that then

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.430 
two or three cars a day with that then
after<00:01:15.970> why<00:01:16.300> it<00:01:16.360> just<00:01:16.630> doesn't<00:01:17.020> it's<00:01:17.230> not

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
after why it just doesn't it's not

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.230 
after why it just doesn't it's not
worthwhile<00:01:17.890> anymore<00:01:18.550> because<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.910> know<00:01:19.060> we

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
worthwhile anymore because you know we

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.060 
worthwhile anymore because you know we
have<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.540> build<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.810> cars<00:01:20.020> anyway<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.710> CG<00:01:20.980> you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
have to build the cars anyway and CG you

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.410 
have to build the cars anyway and CG you
have<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.310> do<00:01:21.430> that<00:01:21.640> then<00:01:21.760> we<00:01:21.820> say<00:01:22.030> well<00:01:22.180> then

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
have to do that then we say well then

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.910 
have to do that then we say well then
let's<00:01:22.630> just<00:01:22.810> do<00:01:22.930> them<00:01:23.050> all<00:01:23.170> in<00:01:23.320> CG<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:23.800> know

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
let's just do them all in CG you know

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.130 
let's just do them all in CG you know
and<00:01:24.400> that's<00:01:24.850> that's<00:01:25.120> what<00:01:25.330> happens<00:01:25.660> in<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
and that's that's what happens in the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.770 
and that's that's what happens in the
year<00:01:26.350> 2012<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.400> cataclysmic<00:01:28.180> event<00:01:28.330> will

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
year 2012 a cataclysmic event will

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.990 
year 2012 a cataclysmic event will
unfold<00:01:29.320> caused<00:01:29.770> by<00:01:29.980> an<00:01:30.100> alignment<00:01:30.460> of<00:01:30.850> the

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
recently had a discussion with it was

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.520 
recently had a discussion with it was
somebody<00:02:45.760> about<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.020> found<00:02:47.200> very

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
somebody about that and I found very

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.670 
somebody about that and I found very
fascinating<00:02:47.740> that<00:02:48.510> there<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:50.350> it's

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
fascinating that there is the it's

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.470 
fascinating that there is the it's
absolutely<00:02:51.250> absolutely<00:02:51.640> true<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.330> is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
absolutely absolutely true that that is

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.330 
absolutely absolutely true that that is
happening<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.620> that's<00:02:53.890> that's<00:02:54.100> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
happening that that's that's the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.250 
happening that that's that's the
development<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.209> also<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.720> mean<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.990> question

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
development and also I mean the question

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.480 
development and also I mean the question
that<00:02:56.320> came<00:02:56.500> up<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.860> like<00:02:56.980> with<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.220> software

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
that came up is like with the software

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.370 
that came up is like with the software
you<00:02:57.580> can<00:02:57.760> do<00:02:57.880> things<00:02:58.120> much<00:02:58.360> cheaper<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.290> on

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
you can do things much cheaper and so on

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.699 
you can do things much cheaper and so on
but<00:02:59.770> at<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> same<00:03:00.220> time<00:03:00.520> while<00:03:01.410> well<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.590> is

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
but at the same time while well that is

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.320 
but at the same time while well that is
what<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.310> is<00:03:03.340> happening<00:03:03.970> whether<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.209> would

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
what that is happening whether it would

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.750 
what that is happening whether it would
where<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.780> cost<00:03:04.990> goes<00:03:05.230> down<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
where the cost goes down the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.810 
where the cost goes down the
expectations<00:03:07.450> go<00:03:07.990> up<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:09.220> what<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.490> have<00:03:09.640> to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
expectations go up so what you have to

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.320 
expectations go up so what you have to
deliver<00:03:10.260> with<00:03:11.260> with<00:03:11.500> these<00:03:11.650> movies<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.370> you

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
deliver with with these movies is you

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.410 
deliver with with these movies is you
know<00:03:13.450> it's<00:03:13.810> somewhat<00:03:14.230> evens<00:03:14.620> out<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.420> so

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
know it's somewhat evens out and so

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.290 
know it's somewhat evens out and so
you're<00:03:16.720> always<00:03:17.310> still<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.550> same<00:03:18.760> track

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
you're always still on the same track

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.150 
you're always still on the same track
with<00:03:19.510> what<00:03:19.660> yet<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.989> have<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.500> do<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.860> have<00:03:21.010> to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
with what yet you have to do and have to

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.550 
with what yet you have to do and have to
go<00:03:21.400> after<00:03:21.820> every<00:03:22.060> project<00:03:22.360> we<00:03:22.630> think<00:03:22.870> oh<00:03:23.019> the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
go after every project we think oh the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.449 
go after every project we think oh the
next<00:03:23.739> one<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.130> be<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.310> much<00:03:24.430> easier

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
next one is going to be so much easier

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.430 
next one is going to be so much easier
because<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.510> know<00:03:25.630> now<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:25.840> know<00:03:26.050> how<00:03:26.200> to<00:03:26.230> do

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
because you know now we know how to do

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.320 
because you know now we know how to do
it<00:03:26.590> but<00:03:27.040> then<00:03:27.190> there's<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.489> whole<00:03:27.610> new<00:03:28.090> set<00:03:28.300> of

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
it but then there's a whole new set of

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.000 
it but then there's a whole new set of
challenges<00:03:28.420> because<00:03:29.080> everybody<00:03:29.530> knows<00:03:29.739> now

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
challenges because everybody knows now

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.560 
challenges because everybody knows now
how<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.310> do<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:30.880> they<00:03:30.970> say<00:03:31.120> well<00:03:31.269> we<00:03:31.450> want

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
how to do that so they say well we want

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.490 
how to do that so they say well we want
to<00:03:31.690> do<00:03:31.750> something<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.140> nobody<00:03:32.230> has<00:03:32.440> ever

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
to do something that nobody has ever

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.979 
to do something that nobody has ever
seen<00:03:32.620> before<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.790> now<00:03:33.940> you're<00:03:34.450> kind<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.720> again

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
seen before so now you're kind of again

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.270 
seen before so now you're kind of again
at<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.200> same<00:03:35.380> point<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.950> were<00:03:36.070> two

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
at the same point that you were two

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.430 
at the same point that you were two
years<00:03:36.310> ten<00:03:36.940> years<00:03:36.970> fifteen<00:03:37.660> years<00:03:37.690> ago<00:03:37.930> where

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
years ten years fifteen years ago where

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.400 
years ten years fifteen years ago where
you<00:03:38.470> have<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.860> reinvent<00:03:39.370> something<00:03:39.820> new<00:03:40.000> and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
you have to reinvent something new and

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.050 
you have to reinvent something new and
stretch<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:42.010> in<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.459> case<00:03:42.700> also<00:03:42.970> the

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
stretch the in this case also the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.120 
stretch the in this case also the

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
for for all this stuff that we had to do

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.920 
for for all this stuff that we had to do
there<00:03:57.670> was<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.790> nice<00:03:58.000> little<00:03:58.030> statistics

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
there was a nice little statistics

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.990 
there was a nice little statistics
which<00:04:00.739> is<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.130> know<00:04:01.250> doesn't<00:04:01.640> really<00:04:01.670> make

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
which is you know doesn't really make

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.589 
which is you know doesn't really make
any<00:04:02.030> sense<00:04:02.209> but<00:04:02.690> it's<00:04:02.870> also<00:04:03.530> relaxed<00:04:03.920> um<00:04:04.599> we

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
any sense but it's also relaxed um we

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.729 
any sense but it's also relaxed um we
were<00:04:05.720> talking<00:04:05.750> some<00:04:06.110> journalists<00:04:06.590> for

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
were talking some journalists for

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.430 
were talking some journalists for
example<00:04:07.160> about<00:04:07.610> the<00:04:07.970> computing<00:04:08.810> time<00:04:09.050> that<00:04:09.319> it

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
example about the computing time that it

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.170 
example about the computing time that it
actually<00:04:09.470> takes<00:04:10.069> these<00:04:10.250> days<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.819> so<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:11.030> was

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
actually takes these days and so it was

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.280 
actually takes these days and so it was
for<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.480> extra<00:04:11.720> for<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.900> three-minute

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
for the extra for the three-minute

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.160 
for the extra for the three-minute
sequence<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:14.120> LA<00:04:14.330> earthquake<00:04:14.780> it

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
sequence of the the LA earthquake it

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.840 
sequence of the the LA earthquake it
renard<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:15.620> on<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.800> single<00:04:15.920> machine<00:04:16.160> if<00:04:16.430> we

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
renard that on a single machine if we

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.699 
renard that on a single machine if we
would<00:04:16.970> render<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:17.329> on<00:04:17.450> a<00:04:17.480> single<00:04:17.810> machine<00:04:17.900> it

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
would render that on a single machine it

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.520 
would render that on a single machine it
would<00:04:18.889> be<00:04:19.040> 16<00:04:19.340> years<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:20.720> actually<00:04:20.989> do<00:04:21.109> that

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
would be 16 years to actually do that

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.440 
would be 16 years to actually do that
so<00:04:22.010> literally<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.310> think<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.700> lot<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.210> scenes

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
so literally I think a lot of the scenes

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.230 
so literally I think a lot of the scenes
that<00:04:23.570> we've<00:04:23.780> done<00:04:24.080> here<00:04:24.850> wouldn't<00:04:25.850> even<00:04:26.030> have

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
that we've done here wouldn't even have

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.260 
that we've done here wouldn't even have
been<00:04:26.300> possible<00:04:26.810> about<00:04:27.310> five<00:04:28.310> years<00:04:28.520> ago<00:04:28.850> four

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
been possible about five years ago four

00:04:29.270 --> 00:05:01.930 
been possible about five years ago four
years<00:04:29.300> ago<00:04:29.570> maybe<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.590> seems<00:04:30.889> to<00:04:31.130> me<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:32.120> worst

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.000
