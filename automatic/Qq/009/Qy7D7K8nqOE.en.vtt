00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 in this video I show you how you with 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.490
 visual kruse thus optical hints 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.219
 better reached a beach figure and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.130
 Although we have slow with here 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.800
 Oatmeal does not work for now 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.150
 world-shattering you think now wrong 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.150
 because they are already standing 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.660
 since yesterday evening here yes and me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.670
 personally I have to constantly with these 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.279
 visual irritation or with 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.439
 These visual references work and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.780
 that helps me extremely with the things 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.160
 to keep that I make myself and me 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.840
 It knows how it is when you are 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.190
 want to lose weight now you burn fat 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.110
 have new ideas for this year 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 done and so on then it is 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.809
 Of course always nice and good 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.670
 to make such progress and everything 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.770
 write down and if you are the hard one 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.780
 everyday life comes and the reality a whole 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.610
 normal life then you become easy 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.250
 very often no longer remember and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.629
 that's why it's totally legit and also 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.730
 very successful or very helpful 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.890
 If you have such visual hints you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 I just put it down here 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.710
 I know perfectly well that I am still today 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.630
 I see that my lean quark and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.619
 oatmeal and slow- eating 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 probably with a few 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.299
 yes, that's when I say that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 times see standing here all the time 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.689
 while I was thus once again with what 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.830
 to drink or something, I know 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.540
 Exactly okay , I always have that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 I have to eat in any case today 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.890
 and that goes on now let's go 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.320
 in the living room here for example gets 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.009
 The dog always eat your apple 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 and he always needs one 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.790
 tartar space free shows that it is also 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.380
 quite good for dogs 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 so that you do not have a bad smell 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.030
 have and so on that is here one 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.280
 kind of algae powder and such and such 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.009
 but constantly I forget him 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.630
 why in his feed why 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 it's always up there all the time 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 where my supplements stood and me 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.170
 so when I did eat his 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.340
 That's why I did not think so 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.829
 I always go here now 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.780
 and every time he does when I go to 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.159
 for example, find his kitchen in the morning 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.859
 and then sit down 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.269
 therefore exists and begins to age and 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.510
 even the cats on earth because he is hungry 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.160
 Yes, then I want to go eat his food 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.250
 so pick wants to pick up 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.739
 order to do all and what happens 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.569
 when I come up 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.180
 she is right in front of me and I take it 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.830
 and make and then eat 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.040
 and that is what I have everywhere in the world 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.420
 whole flat yes for example here 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.760
 is not the most important because I am yes 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.040
 yes, this evening fly to Vienna 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.890
 means I have the most important things 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.200
 the most important thing to travel is always 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.730
 Wallet width fits everything else 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.410
 can be purchased that is, these are 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.150
 the most important things and therefore me the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.069
 we do not forget we always lie 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.799
 open on the table so I'm on everyone 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.510
 case with go take with just such 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.660
 example here now the vaccination of 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.280
 hatch very important because of the small 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.680
 Bastard does not come to Vienna 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.420
 but really cool, I have here 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.519
 found 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.829
 that's what a dog board really is 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.150
 luxury and so on as much two days 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.190
 with all the other rounds together 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.959
 and so on and there I have to stop 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.069
 Give vaccination pass in time with it 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.500
 can check that he is vaccinated 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.840
 dewormed and so on and when I do that 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.859
 but now would have forgotten then 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.030
 I would not have my flight anymore 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.430
 That's why I'm lying down 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.400
 most important things the evening before 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.650
 there but back to fitness go 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.030
 Let's just go up the stairs and see what you can do 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.430
 also if we can for example 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.380
 work at home and you know you want 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.930
 train the next day then you say 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.160
 for example, the office okay 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.569
 I will not go in there now before me 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.310
 not and then you imagine yourself in the evening 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.200
 before the shoes before yes but says 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.280
 no matter what it is 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.030
 last important appointment before I leave 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.080
 go to the office first time I see mine 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.810
 sports shoes on 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.370
 of course, in this case, too 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.830
 then not to wear jeans like me 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.870
 but a training pants in the morning 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.330
 then you have the sports shoes 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:10.880
 already on or you know everything clearly 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:17.489
 I have to make my holiday today 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.750
 that means we go here on the roof me 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.299
 But it really has to be a workout 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.830
 I'll fix a door 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:29.990
 then I'm on the roof over there 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.990
 is the beautiful mediterranean sea 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.610
 the beautiful sailboat or I still do not care 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.620
 do not want to distract 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.740
 here you can really good euphonious 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.540
 yes push support hens push ups 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.580
 up there I can attach my tx and so on 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.530
 and that means I got through it 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.169
 the visual cuse through this 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.979
 I was helped by visual tips 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.860
 so to speak, my workout then too 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.330
 to go through with what I wanted to say 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.710
 I'll say the book here soon 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.090
 what did I put down there? 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.220
 because I want one more video 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.550
 wanted a visual cju again 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.800
 yes, but what's even more effective is what 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.260
 you can do that is you on the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.090
 evening I have a sale 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.400
 Lecture sometime before 100 years 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.220
 So yes, you learned that way for example 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.090
 I take coins now in this 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.090
 nobody 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:27.930
 but you would have here six euros 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.080
 each 3 2 euro pieces and they do 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.450
 you're in a pocket that's pure 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.490
 always jingles even when you are running and 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.500
 then, for example, we'll say okay 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.450
 three things that I set myself today 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.250
 so have the most important example 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.410
 to do my workout at home 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.510
 somehow the recipe to cook 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.460
 or to make that and the call or 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.820
 That and the three things to accomplish 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.430
 Example I'm not going to bed 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.520
 these three things are done and each one 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.780
 when you do one of those 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.970
 Take, for example, one of the coin from here 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.800
 one bag and do the other 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.009
 bag in the left pocket pure 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.620
 yes and the granted bed if all three 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.720
 are coins in the left pocket inside 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.970
 they are just so super small 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.409
 hints that you can always install around 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.870
 in principle the things that one before him 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.979
 and also better to reach 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.599
 you can write if you like that 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.000
 has helped video or what you so much 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.580
 whether you like such visual stimuli you 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.870
 uses or hints or to 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.250
 example on the phone you can yes 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.979
 also determined something meanwhile 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.360
 enter so because of your love move your 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.409
 Ass or no idea what any 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.120
 spoke hints 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.759
 that 's it for today anyway 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.740
 Saturday morning I will meet in Vienna 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.539
 I mean a small real estate pro 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.139
 yes one or the other will be too 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:44.120
 know 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.919
 and there I am doing in parallel 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.240
 plus small book review tomorrow 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.490
 a book review where it is not around 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.289
 fitness goes but for the people 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.490
 already a little older are among us 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.979
 and with this topic 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.259
 wanted to deal with and indeed 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:59.750
 buy or rent the whole theme 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:02.659
 all the myths and the whole 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.190
 theme for the home and what 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:06.229
 actually better for which 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.630
 situation is it really better? 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.940
 that you always buy a property 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.319
 instead of renting them even if you have them 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.620
 can buy and so on and so on 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.400
 on 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.569
 this will be live from vienna tomorrow 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.979
 I'll see if I'm still small 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:22.099
 blog if I have time otherwise 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:27.009
 We'll meet again on Monday at the 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:27.009
