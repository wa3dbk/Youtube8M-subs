00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
players as well but the difference is

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.810

that<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.680> ps3<00:00:16.980> you're<00:00:17.340> much<00:00:17.580> more<00:00:17.760> likely

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820

which<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> pretty<00:00:58.170> insane<00:00:59.000> now<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.059> first

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
which is pretty insane now the first

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.869 
which is pretty insane now the first
reason<00:01:00.510> why<00:01:01.070> xbox<00:01:02.070> players<00:01:02.309> are<00:01:02.520> generally

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
reason why xbox players are generally

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
reason why xbox players are generally
better<00:01:03.000> than<00:01:03.210> ps3<00:01:03.359> players<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
better than ps3 players is because the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
better than ps3 players is because the
dlc<00:01:05.580> comes<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:05.909> first<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> Xbox<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
dlc comes out first for the Xbox and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.760 
dlc comes out first for the Xbox and
then<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.100> ps3<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.939> pc<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> means

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
then for ps3 and pc so what that means

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.170 
then for ps3 and pc so what that means
is<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:10.950> hardcore<00:01:11.340> call<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.760> duty<00:01:11.970> players

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
is that hardcore call of duty players

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.020 
is that hardcore call of duty players
who<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.170> big-time<00:01:13.380> fans<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> series<00:01:14.250> are

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
who are big-time fans of the series are

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
who are big-time fans of the series are
more<00:01:15.390> likely<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> buy<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> xbox<00:01:16.229> version<00:01:16.530> than

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
more likely to buy the xbox version than

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.399 
more likely to buy the xbox version than
the<00:01:16.890> ps3<00:01:17.369> version<00:01:17.430> coming<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.259> then<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the ps3 version coming and then the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
the ps3 version coming and then the
second<00:01:19.710> reason<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.390> for<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> first<00:01:21.630> game

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
second reason is that for the first game

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.679 
second reason is that for the first game
that<00:01:22.560> came<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> ps3<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.939> black<00:01:24.509> ops

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that came out for the ps3 of black ops

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
that came out for the ps3 of black ops
black<00:01:25.500> ops<00:01:25.680> won<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.729> game<00:01:26.909> had<00:01:27.150> screen

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
black ops won that game had screen

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
black ops won that game had screen
tearing<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.900> frame<00:01:28.020> rate<00:01:28.200> problems<00:01:28.439> because

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
tearing and frame rate problems because

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.710 
tearing and frame rate problems because
you<00:01:29.549> could<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:29.820> install<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> game<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.600> the

blu-ray player could malfunction and
overheat<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.820> resulted<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.210> frame

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
overheat and so that resulted in frame

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
overheat and so that resulted in frame
rate<00:01:39.720> problems<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:41.070> result<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.790> lot

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
rate problems as a result of that a lot

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.789 
rate problems as a result of that a lot
of<00:01:42.270> people<00:01:42.360> who<00:01:42.630> bought<00:01:42.780> black<00:01:43.290> ops<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
of people who bought black ops for the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.980 
of people who bought black ops for the
ps3<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.520> sent<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> game<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> xbox

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
ps3 and sent out the game for the xbox

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.780 
ps3 and sent out the game for the xbox
because<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.590> didn't<00:01:47.220> want<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> take<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
because they didn't want to take the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.539 
because they didn't want to take the
risk<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> ps3<00:01:49.229> version<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.710> black<00:01:49.979> ops<00:01:50.369> 2

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
risk of the ps3 version of black ops 2

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.300 
risk of the ps3 version of black ops 2
having<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> similar<00:01:51.240> problems<00:01:52.220> then<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
having the similar problems then the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.670 
having the similar problems then the
third<00:01:53.460> reason<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.020> Xbox<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
third reason is that the Xbox is a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.499 
third reason is that the Xbox is a
higher<00:01:55.860> percentage<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.369> players<00:01:56.610> who<00:01:57.420> are

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
higher percentage of players who are

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.050 
higher percentage of players who are
fans<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.930> first-person<00:01:58.350> shooter<00:01:58.770> games

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
fans of first-person shooter games

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.429 
fans of first-person shooter games
because<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.270> Xbox<00:02:00.719> exclusives<00:02:01.350> are

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
because the Xbox exclusives are

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.219 
because the Xbox exclusives are
primarily<00:02:02.430> shooter<00:02:02.969> top<00:02:03.149> games<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.869> halo

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
primarily shooter top games like halo

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.180 
primarily shooter top games like halo
Gears<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.649> War<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.189> left<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.119> dead<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
Gears of War and left for dead and so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.430 
Gears of War and left for dead and so
because<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.720> players<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> Xbox<00:02:10.259> are

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
because of that players on the Xbox are

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.780 
because of that players on the Xbox are
more<00:02:10.590> inclined<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.099> buy<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.790> play<00:02:11.910> shoot

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
more inclined to buy and play shoot

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.509 
more inclined to buy and play shoot
games<00:02:12.969> then<00:02:13.239> players<00:02:13.569> on<00:02:13.719> the<00:02:13.780> ps3<00:02:14.519> whereas

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
games then players on the ps3 whereas

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.179 
games then players on the ps3 whereas
the<00:02:15.610> ps3<00:02:16.090> has<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> wider<00:02:17.260> variety<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.890> different

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
the ps3 has a wider variety of different

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.119 
the ps3 has a wider variety of different
types<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.549> gamers<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:20.530> fourth<00:02:20.739> reason<00:02:20.920> is

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
types of gamers the fourth reason is

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.429 
types of gamers the fourth reason is
that<00:02:21.329> because<00:02:22.329> the<00:02:22.450> Xbox<00:02:22.900> has<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.079> subscription

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
that because the Xbox has a subscription

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.069 
that because the Xbox has a subscription
subscription<00:02:24.370> fee<00:02:24.569> but<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:25.719> means<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:26.049> that

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
subscription fee but that means is that

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.559 
subscription fee but that means is that
casual<00:02:26.620> gamers<00:02:26.980> are<00:02:27.640> more<00:02:27.939> likely<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.299> not

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
casual gamers are more likely to not

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.420 
casual gamers are more likely to not
play<00:02:28.810> on<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.019> xbox<00:02:29.170> because<00:02:30.040> they<00:02:30.159> don't<00:02:30.310> want

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
play on the xbox because they don't want

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.580 
play on the xbox because they don't want
to<00:02:30.489> pay<00:02:30.640> some<00:02:30.909> sort<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.120> subscription<00:02:32.079> fee<00:02:32.260> to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
to pay some sort of subscription fee to

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.460 
to pay some sort of subscription fee to
plug<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.129> 3<00:02:33.310> games<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:33.760> enjoy<00:02:34.379> then<00:02:35.379> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
plug in 3 games that they enjoy then the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.979 
plug in 3 games that they enjoy then the
fifth<00:02:35.650> reason<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:36.099> that<00:02:36.239> many<00:02:37.239> call<00:02:37.810> duty

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
fifth reason is that many call duty

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.809 
fifth reason is that many call duty
players<00:02:38.260> in<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.500> Xbox<00:02:38.920> our<00:02:39.099> former<00:02:39.579> halo

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
players in the Xbox our former halo

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.660 
players in the Xbox our former halo
players<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.810> myself<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:42.159> because<00:02:42.370> they

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
players like myself and so because they

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.910 
players like myself and so because they
have<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.819> halo<00:02:43.090> background<00:02:43.659> halo<00:02:44.379> those<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.709> game

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
have a halo background halo those a game

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.890 
have a halo background halo those a game
has<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.159> very<00:02:45.430> high<00:02:45.579> skill<00:02:45.879> gap<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.780> it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
has a very high skill gap and it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.629 
has a very high skill gap and it
requires<00:02:47.170> teamwork<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.799> communication<00:02:47.980> and

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
requires teamwork and communication and

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.449 
requires teamwork and communication and
so<00:02:49.329> when<00:02:49.480> they<00:02:49.569> left<00:02:49.750> halo<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.409> go<00:02:50.500> play<00:02:50.739> black

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
so when they left halo to go play black

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.530 
so when they left halo to go play black
ops<00:02:51.609> because<00:02:51.909> they<00:02:51.970> didn't<00:02:52.150> like<00:02:52.239> Halo<00:02:52.450> Reach

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
ops because they didn't like Halo Reach

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.599 
ops because they didn't like Halo Reach
they<00:02:53.379> brought<00:02:53.590> with<00:02:53.650> them<00:02:53.829> that<00:02:54.129> competitive

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
they brought with them that competitive

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.970 
they brought with them that competitive
spirit<00:02:54.639> and<00:02:55.269> that<00:02:55.540> teamwork<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.379> the<00:02:56.500> concept

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
spirit and that teamwork in the concept

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.490 
spirit and that teamwork in the concept
of<00:02:57.159> doing<00:02:57.939> call<00:02:58.120> outs<00:02:58.359> and<00:02:58.599> playing<00:02:59.349> with

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
of doing call outs and playing with

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.770 
of doing call outs and playing with
teams<00:02:59.909> they<00:03:00.909> brought<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.269> over<00:03:01.299> with<00:03:01.599> them

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
teams they brought that over with them

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.839 
teams they brought that over with them
and<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.620> whereas<00:03:02.919> they<00:03:03.010> try<00:03:03.189> harder<00:03:03.549> than<00:03:03.700> halo

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
and so whereas they try harder than halo

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.149 
and so whereas they try harder than halo
they<00:03:04.659> brought<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.049> try<00:03:05.260> our<00:03:05.409> mentality<00:03:05.739> over

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
they brought that try our mentality over

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.729 
they brought that try our mentality over
to<00:03:06.250> call<00:03:06.400> duty<00:03:06.639> I<00:03:06.989> mean<00:03:07.989> another<00:03:08.319> reason<00:03:08.620> is

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
to call duty I mean another reason is

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.339 
to call duty I mean another reason is
that<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:10.030> Xbox<00:03:10.389> comes<00:03:10.689> with<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.930> microphone

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
that the Xbox comes with the microphone

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.129 
that the Xbox comes with the microphone
whereas<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.310> ps3<00:03:12.730> does<00:03:12.879> not<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.870> because<00:03:13.989> of

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
whereas the ps3 does not and because of

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.569 
whereas the ps3 does not and because of
that<00:03:14.260> you're<00:03:14.650> more<00:03:14.829> likely<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.159> find<00:03:15.280> people

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
that you're more likely to find people

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.550 
that you're more likely to find people
with<00:03:15.669> microphones<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.419> people<00:03:17.349> are<00:03:17.440> more

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
with microphones and people are more

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.830 
with microphones and people are more
likely<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.919> play<00:03:18.159> it<00:03:18.220> play<00:03:18.370> as<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.549> team<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:19.030> to

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
likely to play it play as a team and to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.930 
likely to play it play as a team and to
call<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.470> call<00:03:20.650> us<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:20.919> stuff<00:03:21.040> like<00:03:21.159> that<00:03:21.250> and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
call you call us and stuff like that and

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.589

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
every single person and so that can be a

especially if everyone disconnects into

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.210 
especially if everyone disconnects into
the<00:03:56.079> lobby<00:03:56.260> ends<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.709> have<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:56.949> manually

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
can just hit a button single button so

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.619 
can just hit a button single button so
people<00:04:03.340> who<00:04:03.519> plan<00:04:03.729> parties<00:04:03.760> are<00:04:04.299> more<00:04:04.449> likely

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
to play on the xbox and the ps3 then

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.599 
to play on the xbox and the ps3 then
another<00:04:07.780> reason<00:04:08.109> why<00:04:08.229> is<00:04:08.290> that<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.859> found<00:04:09.489> that

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
another reason why is that I found that

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:10.830 
another reason why is that I found that
many<00:04:09.790> of<00:04:09.939> the<00:04:09.970> call<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.239> duty<00:04:10.359> players<00:04:10.599> in<00:04:10.750> the

the<00:04:38.889> Xbox<00:04:39.220> players<00:04:39.490> we<00:04:40.360> generally<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.720> find<00:04:41.050> to

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
the Xbox players we generally I find to

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.680 
the Xbox players we generally I find to
be<00:04:41.400> not<00:04:42.400> more<00:04:42.550> mature<00:04:42.909> in<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.300> sense<00:04:43.599> that

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
be not more mature in the sense that

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.080 
be not more mature in the sense that
they're<00:04:44.199> really<00:04:44.379> immature<00:04:44.940> but<00:04:45.940> they're

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
they're really immature but they're

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.730 
they're really immature but they're
older<00:04:46.389> and<00:04:46.569> they<00:04:47.080> take<00:04:47.289> gaming<00:04:47.500> more

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
older and they take gaming more

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.300 
older and they take gaming more
seriously<00:04:48.099> than<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.580> ps3<00:04:49.419> players<00:04:50.220> then<00:04:51.220> the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
seriously than the ps3 players then the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.640 
seriously than the ps3 players then the
ninth<00:04:51.520> reason<00:04:51.849> is<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.020> when<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.050> ps3<00:04:53.530> was

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
ninth reason is that when the ps3 was

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.920 
ninth reason is that when the ps3 was

they<00:05:03.849> traded<00:05:04.840> in<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.110> ps3<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.650> all<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:05.830> games

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
they traded in the ps3 and all the games

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.490 
they traded in the ps3 and all the games
and<00:05:06.159> bought<00:05:06.310> an<00:05:06.430> xbox<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:07.030> black<00:05:07.180> ops<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:08.379> so

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
and bought an xbox and black ops and so

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.680 
and bought an xbox and black ops and so
they've<00:05:08.770> been<00:05:08.800> there<00:05:09.159> ever<00:05:09.310> since<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:10.389> the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
they've been there ever since so the

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.070 
they've been there ever since so the
xbox<00:05:11.080> is<00:05:11.229> inherited<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.069> large<00:05:12.280> portion<00:05:12.639> of<00:05:12.879> the

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
xbox is inherited a large portion of the

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.680 
xbox is inherited a large portion of the
ps3<00:05:14.080> call<00:05:14.319> of<00:05:14.409> duty<00:05:14.650> addicts<00:05:15.419> then<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.539> last

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
ps3 call of duty addicts then the last

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.200 
ps3 call of duty addicts then the last
reason<00:05:16.930> is<00:05:17.199> that<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:18.250> xbox<00:05:18.729> 360<00:05:19.180> controller

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
reason is that the xbox 360 controller

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.930 
reason is that the xbox 360 controller
was<00:05:20.009> specifically<00:05:21.009> designed<00:05:21.250> for<00:05:21.520> first

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
was specifically designed for first

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.119 
was specifically designed for first
mission<00:05:22.300> shooter<00:05:22.569> games<00:05:22.780> so<00:05:23.680> if<00:05:23.800> when<00:05:24.069> you

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
mission shooter games so if when you

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.309 
mission shooter games so if when you
compare<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.550> two<00:05:24.669> controllers<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:25.360> ps3

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
compare the two controllers the ps3

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.629 
compare the two controllers the ps3
controller<00:05:26.620> is<00:05:26.770> basically<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.219> same<00:05:27.370> as<00:05:27.430> the

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
controller is basically the same as the

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.300 
controller is basically the same as the
ps1<00:05:27.909> controller<00:05:28.379> and<00:05:29.379> when<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.650> ps1<00:05:29.949> was

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
ps1 controller and when the ps1 was

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.370 
ps1 controller and when the ps1 was
invented<00:05:30.810> first-person<00:05:31.810> shooter<00:05:32.020> games<00:05:32.199> were

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
invented first-person shooter games were

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.580 
invented first-person shooter games were
not<00:05:32.529> the<00:05:32.620> dominant<00:05:32.800> market<00:05:33.599> but<00:05:34.599> when<00:05:34.960> the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
not the dominant market but when the

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.320 
not the dominant market but when the
xbox<00:05:35.889> 360<00:05:36.520> came<00:05:36.699> out<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.029> amid<00:05:37.210> the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
xbox 360 came out the amid the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.589 
xbox 360 came out the amid the
controller<00:05:37.659> for<00:05:38.380> Halo<00:05:38.620> 3<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.880> 4<00:05:40.090> first-person

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
controller for Halo 3 and 4 first-person

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.959 
controller for Halo 3 and 4 first-person
shooter<00:05:40.840> games<00:05:41.080> so<00:05:42.009> personally<00:05:42.490> I<00:05:42.580> find<00:05:42.789> the

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 
shooter games so personally I find the

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.149 
shooter games so personally I find the
xbox<00:05:43.569> controller<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:44.050> be<00:05:44.199> a<00:05:44.380> little<00:05:45.009> more

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
xbox controller to be a little more

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.529 
xbox controller to be a little more
comfortable<00:05:45.490> than<00:05:45.669> the<00:05:45.789> ps3<00:05:46.180> controller

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
comfortable than the ps3 controller

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.019 
comfortable than the ps3 controller
because<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.740> fits<00:05:48.039> into<00:05:48.190> my<00:05:48.340> hands<00:05:48.490> up<00:05:48.669> whereas

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
with the ps3 controller when I hold up

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.769 
with the ps3 controller when I hold up
hold<00:05:51.430> onto<00:05:51.639> it<00:05:51.789> for<00:05:51.849> long<00:05:52.090> periods<00:05:52.120> of<00:05:52.419> time<00:05:52.509> it
