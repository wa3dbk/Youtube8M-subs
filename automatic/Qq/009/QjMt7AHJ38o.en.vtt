here<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.760> person<00:02:43.510> who<00:02:43.570> did<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> sound

trip<00:03:04.959> for<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.320> guy<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.930> think<00:03:07.930> stuff<00:03:08.080> like

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
trip for the guy and I think stuff like

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.949 
trip for the guy and I think stuff like
that's<00:03:08.380> really<00:03:08.560> cool

the<00:03:40.790> splash<00:03:41.200> happens<00:03:42.200> that's<00:03:42.709> when<00:03:42.920> I<00:03:42.950> hold<00:03:43.190> a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
the splash happens that's when I hold a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.250 
the splash happens that's when I hold a
bed<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.420> dodge<00:03:44.599> it<00:03:44.750> almost<00:03:44.959> every<00:03:45.230> time

this<00:03:45.650> on<00:03:45.830> this<00:03:46.010> one<00:03:46.220> when<00:03:46.760> he<00:03:46.819> stares<00:03:47.060> down

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
this on this one when he stares down

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.399 
this on this one when he stares down
longer<00:03:47.569> than<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.780> other<00:03:47.900> times<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.319> means

longer than the other times it means

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.869 
longer than the other times it means
he's<00:03:48.560> gonna<00:03:48.680> learn<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.069> let<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.310> hit<00:03:49.430> him<00:03:49.610> so

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
using the kill guard graduation I

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.469 
using the kill guard graduation I
personally<00:04:43.849> don't<00:04:44.000> really<00:04:44.090> think<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.450> a

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
personally don't really think is a

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.750 
personally don't really think is a
glitch<00:04:44.750> it's<00:04:45.349> just<00:04:45.560> everybody<00:04:46.160> looks<00:04:46.370> down<00:04:46.580> on

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
glitch it's just everybody looks down on

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.060 
glitch it's just everybody looks down on
it<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.620> potentially<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.650> really<00:04:48.680> cool

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
it so a potentially a really cool

really think they missed that

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.200 
really think they missed that
I<00:05:02.020> don't<00:05:03.310> same<00:05:04.310> with<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.460> Devil<00:05:04.610> May<00:05:04.700> Cry<00:05:04.729> farm

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210

a<00:05:05.510> lot<00:05:05.750> of<00:05:05.870> people<00:05:06.050> seem<00:05:06.229> to<00:05:06.260> think<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.530> the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
a lot of people seem to think that the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.120 
a lot of people seem to think that the
distorted<00:05:08.020> techniques<00:05:09.020> is<00:05:09.289> a<00:05:09.530> glitch<00:05:09.800> as<00:05:09.950> well

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
distorted techniques is a glitch as well

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.490 
distorted techniques is a glitch as well
I<00:05:10.370> think<00:05:10.580> it's<00:05:11.180> intentional<00:05:11.479> I<00:05:11.930> think<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.380> was

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
I think it's intentional I think it was

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.140 
I think it's intentional I think it was
probably<00:05:12.650> noticed<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.490> we<00:05:13.550> kept<00:05:13.729> it<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:14.000> to

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
probably noticed and we kept it in to

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.720 
probably noticed and we kept it in to
add<00:05:14.270> that<00:05:14.419> extra<00:05:14.750> piece<00:05:14.930> of<00:05:15.550> dynamic

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
add that extra piece of dynamic

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.780 
add that extra piece of dynamic
admittedly<00:05:18.450> is<00:05:18.660> real<00:05:18.870> impact<00:05:19.670> distorted<00:05:20.670> real

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790

on Devil May Cry 4 he's really tricky

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.110 
on Devil May Cry 4 he's really tricky
because<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:35.590> game<00:05:35.770> feels<00:05:36.280> almost<00:05:36.730> designed

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
get which time off the lasers you can

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.690 
get which time off the lasers you can
get<00:06:23.290> which<00:06:23.470> time<00:06:23.680> off<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:23.920> missiles<00:06:24.280> I<00:06:24.490> just

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700 
get which time off the missiles I just

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.830 
get which time off the missiles I just
wasn't<00:06:25.660> as<00:06:25.900> fortunate<00:06:26.140> enough<00:06:26.560> to<00:06:26.860> get<00:06:26.980> them

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
wasn't as fortunate enough to get them

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
believe if you do it correctly watch out

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.800 
believe if you do it correctly watch out
for<00:06:36.100> the<00:06:36.190> missiles<00:06:36.580> as<00:06:36.790> well<00:06:36.820> he<00:06:37.090> fires<00:06:37.330> those

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
for the missiles as well he fires those

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.810 
for the missiles as well he fires those
red<00:06:38.230> fireballs<00:06:38.740> and<00:06:38.920> almost<00:06:39.190> every<00:06:39.490> boss

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
red fireballs and almost every boss

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.740 
red fireballs and almost every boss
seems<00:06:40.150> to<00:06:40.270> have<00:06:42.120> there<00:06:43.120> was<00:06:43.300> the<00:06:43.390> bat<00:06:43.510> within

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
seems to have there was the bat within

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.360 
seems to have there was the bat within
there's<00:06:43.990> the<00:06:44.110> which<00:06:44.230> time<00:06:44.500> and<00:06:45.040> I<00:06:45.130> believe

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
there's the which time and I believe

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.980 
there's the which time and I believe
after<00:06:45.520> this<00:06:45.760> he's<00:06:45.910> going<00:06:46.150> to<00:06:46.300> raise<00:06:46.540> his<00:06:46.810> head

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990
