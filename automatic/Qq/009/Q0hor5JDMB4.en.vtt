at school and for students throughout
the<00:00:15.059> country<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.420> know<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.960> absolutely

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the country you know it is absolutely

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.349 
the country you know it is absolutely
brilliant<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.460> hopefully<00:00:17.940> they'll<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.180> quite

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
brilliant and hopefully they'll be quite

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.750 
brilliant and hopefully they'll be quite
a<00:00:18.390> few<00:00:18.660> more<00:00:18.840> taking<00:00:19.230> cycling<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.800> as<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> result

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
a few more taking cycling up as a result

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.670 
a few more taking cycling up as a result
of<00:00:20.880> Bradley's<00:00:21.240> success<00:00:21.660> yeah<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.230> think<00:00:22.470> that's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
of Bradley's success yeah I think that's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.170 
of Bradley's success yeah I think that's
already<00:00:22.830> happening<00:00:23.279> yeah<00:00:23.430> that's<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.029> said

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
already happening yeah that's a you said

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.189 
already happening yeah that's a you said
it's<00:00:24.330> hard<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.539> believe<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.109> this

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
it's hard to believe but is this

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.290 
it's hard to believe but is this
something<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.430> thought<00:00:26.670> might<00:00:27.090> be

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
something that you you thought might be

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.790 
something that you you thought might be
possible<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.900> someone<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.230> Bradley<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.740> think

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
possible in someone like Bradley I think

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.519 
possible in someone like Bradley I think
with<00:00:29.070> Bradley<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:30.060> not<00:00:30.599> until<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:31.470> he

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
with Bradley it was not until I think he

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
with Bradley it was not until I think he
probably<00:00:31.619> left<00:00:32.009> school<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:33.270> year<00:00:33.510> after<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
probably left school the year after I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.190 
probably left school the year after I
think<00:00:34.140> he<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.620> GB<00:00:35.550> Junius<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
think he was in the GB Junius and I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.350 
think he was in the GB Junius and I
think<00:00:37.410> he'd<00:00:37.590> done<00:00:38.340> well<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.640> Cuban<00:00:38.940> got<00:00:39.059> gold

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
think he'd done well in Cuban got gold

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
think he'd done well in Cuban got gold
and<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.989> think<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> point<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> 17

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and I think at that point there was a 17

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.639 
and I think at that point there was a 17
year<00:00:41.820> old<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.719> begin<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> sit<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.590> think

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
year old you begin to sit up and think

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.590 
year old you begin to sit up and think
this<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.190> boy<00:00:44.489> could<00:00:44.730> perhaps<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.180> somewhere

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
this this boy could perhaps go somewhere

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
this this boy could perhaps go somewhere
