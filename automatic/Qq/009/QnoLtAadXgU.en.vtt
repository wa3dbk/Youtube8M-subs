 given trust one of my principles 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.420
 it's when you get something 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.189
 must give 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.780
 so it's up to me now to do 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.400
 turn to be successful with this 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.619
 team that I've already seen a lot of 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.380
 things to the video it's a team 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.150
 with many qualities the important 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.360
 it's also the meeting that tells her 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.280
 it goes to the current feeling level 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.650
 she passed as we say that I 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.959
 felt from the first day 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.819
 until today I am surrounded by 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.370
 people who are there the passions for 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.660
 the club and for football and that's me 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.370
 I like challenges 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.440
 I know it's another world not at 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.550
 level of football but our world like 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.220
 now there are many people 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.480
 today but I'm ready to 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.610
 beat for this club because it's a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.440
 well organized club with a lot of 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.440
 heart and that's my privacy 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.130
 hello to all happy new year when I say 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.260
 I'm told it was still a 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.989
 good time with a lot of work 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.110
 it's true because we still have 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.600
 done as a step a lot of 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.220
 a lot of work 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.590
 for sure, after we took the 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.959
 decision after the season of the year 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.450
 past we learned a lot 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.700
 we took a lot ourselves 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.380
 like club like identity like 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.550
 philosophy and I think it is aillant 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.920
 did our steps toward 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.600
 today's coach then the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.730
 criteria yes it's still pretty 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:34.650
 simple philosophy methodology the way 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.800
 who will work the preparation the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.750
 way they see the soca I think that 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.780
 from the first time we 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.740
 met right now before anything 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.440
 like nobody 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.850
 he immediately showed his passion 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.640
 energy her wanting to do well and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.130
 after sokal's discussions 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.010
 could go up to early in 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.670
 in the morning if we talked about her 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.920
 capacity 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.320
 we saw things in the same way 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.930
 what is important also he has 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.530
 understood that we talk about philosophy of 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.680
 club level academy level 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.440
 of the world we have in the inter it has everything 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.109
 understood that too and in the end with with 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.280
 the team that saw him anyway he saw 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.930
 several matches matches go to 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.210
 home matches outside the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.400
 match against fiorentina and all that I 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.340
 think he's been so excited about 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.980
 to have a team like that for for 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.450
 lead 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.570
 we know him from the best of luck 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.760
 because he's a person you can 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.800
 see that we can work well with and 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.800

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.450
 high level staff world and then I 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.120
 also made the decision that robien me 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.820
 bind phillip is there and the cold he has 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.740
 cold his assistant doctor but also 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.720
 as empty repaired or because the 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.210
 ball turns and that's the coach 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.160
 guards and then the preparer 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.710

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.100
 work well together with this 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.200
