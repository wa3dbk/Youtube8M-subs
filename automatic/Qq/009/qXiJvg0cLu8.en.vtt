00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:26.590
 hello now let's chat 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.650
 how exactly shoot for the whole 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.600
 dynamic shooters need a comfortable 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.970
 quality mouse reaction though here 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.460
 can add and comfortable table chair and 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.050
 good computer 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.330
 difference from infantry technology is not 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.040
 the ability to instantly turn around like 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.010
 it can make shove not to be afraid 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.140
 if his great public pilot is 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.380
 the reaction is not as important as the skill exactly 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.230
 hold any vehicle on the cross 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.850
 Skill rapid fire to the fore 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.309
 coming out exactly in strained dogfight ah 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.290
 where in a split second such super dynamic 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.620
 that the newcomer wo n't understand anything at all 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.290
 dwell on management there 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.030
 many ways to control the plane i'm not 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.700
 I am going to describe joysticks and gamepads 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.550
 since the joystick I never kept in 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.520
 hand and to adjust the gamepad I do not 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.950
 had the patience they have their pluses 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.780
 and cons 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.680
 keyboard without mouse main keys 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 arrows and the famous quartet w lsd 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.120
 met some network players who 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.300
 very good fly only on 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.690
 keyboard is a matter of habit but chief 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.750
 minus 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.720
 lowest accuracy in spite of all 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.260
 on simple control finally the keyboard 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.030
 and mouse 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.490
 most popular and most 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.490
 balanced benefits and 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.340
 flawed flying method what kind of mouse 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.610
 use here is not a rule 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.400
 more expensive choose that unit 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.280
 which is perfectly held in hand and very 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.060
 convenient for you keyboard layout on 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.130
 keyboard 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.270
 I have already sorted out the first issue by 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.990
 battlefield 4 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.690
 for now just compare the two main ones 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.300
 type difference from standard and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.520
 alternative control only splash 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.470
 they and roll 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.470
 yawing on the standard stands on the buttons 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.660
 keyboards that is, we press a key and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.830
 the technique is turning with the maximum 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.360
 possible angle but the inclination of the axis 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.209
 set to horizontal mouse 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.239
 here, on the contrary, we get controlled and 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.019
 accurate roll intensity essence 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.269
 alternatives just changing their places i 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.660
 and learned to fly if you remember 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.569
 last game what are the advantages 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.850
 there is no alternative 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.910
 mouse around the table as he does not like 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.790
 never therefore quite an important turn 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.730
 and quickly and easily executed with buttons 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.980
 left hand the main advantage here 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.739
 highest accuracy in aiming 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.380
 right hand and ease since 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.569
 resemble management of foot soldiers but in the dock 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.910
 go where often need constant 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.860
 yawing we get the opposite effect and 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.730
 you have to go right 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.400
 hand on the table 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.150
 I tried to find extra keys 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.840
 on keyboard 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.049
 but no options made no way out 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.100
 here is if you have a rodent playing 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.459
 put this movement in two 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.530
 extra mouse buttons end 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.959
 I still once 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.290
 returned to standard management and here 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.670
 something happened that I did not notice I 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.400
 forgot to remove the yaw binding 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.130
 the horizontals of the mouse end up lateral 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.519
 the shift of the right hand caused a turn 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.180
 aircraft and axle and machine like 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.310
 turn in the side I was shocked i got and 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.709
 the exact cream that I like and 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.859
 good aiming accuracy 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.130
 in the form of the cockpit so I fly so far 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:02.130
 many will say that i make a fool of myself and 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.109
 other problems yes do what you want me 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.560
 I only propose a possible option 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.810
 what are the cons here when you want a little 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.569
 Shift the sight with accurate liner 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.019
 targets the plane starts to roll when 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:19.769
 it does not need me personally it does not bother 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.190
 you can click on hey where when fast 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.039
 mouse pickups and already make corrections when 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.490
 attacking helicopters and airplanes from afar I 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.710
 I use only a mouse without a keyboard 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.039
 summing up compare aiming in these 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.210
 three ways with standard using 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.509
 hell. 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.550
 or any other keyboard buttons 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:44.879
 the scope jumps left and right then not 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.419
 reaching to running across the goal itself but when 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.970
 training deficiency disappears 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.349
 alternative is the most accurate way 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.250
 aim mark moves smoothly and 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:59.220
 nice and so-called blend which i 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.590
 I use it when on the horizontal axis 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.009
 mice assigned and roll and yaw 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.889
 here the plane constantly roll to the side but 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.870
 in my humble opinion given 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.539
 the layout exactly repeats the movement 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.419
 the victim just needs to get used no 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.310
 no jumps 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.159
 back to the level of sensitivity of the mouse 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.789
 Once I exemplified my exact ones. 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.449
 settings 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.039
 but depending on the dipy mouse and 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.259
 screen resolution and generally from your 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.630
 temperaments for each player will be 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.909
 different settings for starters if your 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.430
 the sight constantly jumps irregularly 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.259
 goal your accuracy suffers then 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.810
 reduce sensitivity until you 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.490
 it will be convenient to aim at everyone 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.159
 there will be an individual level 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.770
 in the future when the hand will get used 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:49.409
 I recommend raising the device 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.330
 sensitivity advise mode 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.990
 aiming to do vertical 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.229
 bias 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.069
 that is, the pitch is just a mouse they buttons 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.860
 keyboard 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.590
 more about this and also about ways 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.690
 camera-dependent attacks and corrections 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.139
 let's talk next year at a distance 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.139
 until
