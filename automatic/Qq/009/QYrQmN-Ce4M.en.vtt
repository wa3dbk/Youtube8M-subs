00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 What do you think? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 today I will continue a video that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.960
 I did a while ago that was called 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.670
 being good and cheap exists before I do 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:22.289
 this video when some 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:27.869
 guitar lent i bought just to play 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:33.270
 same and not really cool guitars 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:43.649
 very accessible and that in a way well 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:53.180
 nice saying hobby band with some 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.180
 friends of three thousand reais 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.920
 that moment 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.409
 at the same time then 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.729
 first, I did not introduce you to 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:50.159
 shelter netview that the first arm has 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:52.770
 a very strong footprint is not cool right? 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.079
 already the shell has it has a footprint as well 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:04.799
 robust so really nice to 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:07.070
 play on her arm because there are some 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.070
 differences 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.050
 She is very close to what one has to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.080
 answer 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.590
 people who want to 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.140
 story comes up pretty cute do not you remember 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.180
 It reminds me a lot December 5th phone is 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.140
 a little smaller than it was for most fulfilled 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.400
 and went almost to a stage so minor already 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.140
 I think it's cool, very cool. 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.960
 an interesting point because it is 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.960
 the team that comes the same in the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:51.690
 such band is cool 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:54.780
 the scale is a good point is that it is not 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.270
 The soles are you quite honest do you think 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.420
 ball a little bit especially when it has 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:18.870
 that definition of jacket is that 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:30.510
 usually computers such as 77 by the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:32.690
 pressure of cockroaches in the market of 500 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.690
 real 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.050
 with the captation top does not go but what 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.370
 you do have to do not do I see 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.700
 to offer a positive point of 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.700
 Internet 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:04:24.680
 I think it's fantastic because I'm 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:24.680
 alcohol and pomegranate is there 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.440
 he answered very well and so much already 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:38.650
 that it comes from the factory 4 nobbs nor the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:41.180
 patterns bells of the exposed two trailers 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.680
 Three positions 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.590
 so the arm is glued to see the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:55.250
 side understands and gives you a fright in greater 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:05:01.820
 so this is a gibson guitar ever 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:06.650
 never going but for those who are looking for a 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.600
 guitar or from a legal level that has a 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.380
 cool finish as you have the chance and 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.820
 move is a very nice moment too 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.590
 Really cool 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:23.450
 not a 100% top finish but the 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.420
 finish above average or say well 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:32.770
 so the same right of a password 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:35.300
 would note 85 the payment of the internet 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.260
 heavy does not look like she has a weight 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.010
 cool and the classic tone is three 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.110
 points 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:51.680
 so today's tip for guitar by 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:55.190
 cheap would a shell have liked the 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.320
