screen<00:00:40.129> so<00:00:41.129> let's<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:43.190> megahorn<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.640> don't

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
screen so let's use megahorn I don't

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.430 
screen so let's use megahorn I don't
know<00:00:45.800> why<00:00:46.800> does<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:48.110> slow

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
a horn on no aircrafts can be faster so

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.020 
a horn on no aircrafts can be faster so
yeah<00:01:58.290> air<00:01:59.009> across<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> ice
