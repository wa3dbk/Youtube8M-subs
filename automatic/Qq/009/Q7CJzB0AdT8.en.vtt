00:00:00.578 --> 00:00:03.578
 Mexican Christmas vs. Hanukkah 

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:07.295
 - Hello how are you doing? 

00:00:07.627 --> 00:00:08.800
 - Well well. To you? 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.666
 - Well, you know how it is with the parties and all that. 

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.731
 - Yes, they are crazy about these days of the year. 

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:20.680
 - At least neither of you should worry about getting a tree ... I need a menorah and you ... 

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:22.379
 ... a pinata? 

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:24.761
 - No no. I have a Christmas tree ... and a piñata. 

00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:26.507
 - Do you have a Christmas tree? 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.209
 - Yes 

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.282
 - But ... you're Mexican. 

00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:34.258
 - Yes. But in Mexico we have what is commonly called "Mexican Christmas". 

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:36.179
 - I can not believe it. 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.745
 - It is fun. No snow falls but we plant a huge snowman next to each nopal. 

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:44.143
 - And is not this confusing? 

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:48.263
 - What is confusing is that you celebrate Hanukkah on a different day each year. 

00:00:48.263 --> 00:00:51.461
 And I think they do it to avoid working. 

00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:53.348
 - Yes ... that's true. 

00:00:54.282 --> 00:00:57.276
 But "Happy Hanukkah" is easy to say compared to ... 

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.618
 - I do not think it's said that way. 

00:01:06.618 --> 00:01:10.051
 - And the advantage of "Feliz Navidad" is that it is the only thing you have to say in Mexico ... 

00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:17.564
 You do not have to worry about saying "Happy Holidays" because you do not offend anyone since everyone is Catholic. 

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:19.250
 - So you're Catholic? - Do not. 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.494
 - I'm confused. 

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:24.742
 - But I like to go to midnight Mass, which is always at 9 PM. 

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:27.181
 - Is that something sexual for you or ...? 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.861
 - No. But it is possible to catch an illness because we all must kiss the same doll of the baby Jesus 

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:41.520
 which is offered by the priest. - That's scary. What color is the doll? 

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:43.910
 Before or after we kissed him? 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.870
 - Let's say earlier, less disgusting. 

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:48.250
 - Well, what color do you think it is? 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:02:01.620
 - I think ... it's the color of ... Jesus ... who was a real person ... a real figure ... a real entity ... 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.520
 - Exactly. 

00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.710
 - If I know. 

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:15.460
 Let's see, explain this to me. Santa Claus is the gringa version or have a union equivalent called Santos Claustillo? 

00:02:16.057 --> 00:02:20.720
 - No no. It is the same Santa Claus but he gives gifts attached to our traditions. 

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:24.580
 - Like what? - For the girls bring Barbies ... 

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:27.700
 ... not with a convertible car but with a donkey with glitter. 

00:02:28.776 --> 00:02:33.770
 - Makes sense. And children? - They receive action figures GI José. 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.630
 - That's much better than what I get in Hanukkah. This year they gave me a tax form, gloves ... 

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:55.570
 ... dental insurance, an old video game, a portfolio of actions, a poster of Jon Stewart, a bad cap and, of course, socks. 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:58.670
 - And they celebrate in some way? 

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:10.480
 - Aaah, of course. If you call it a party to sit in a dark room while watching Christmas shows on TV ... 

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:15.860
 - You see, we started celebrating December 12, the day of the Virgin of Guadalupe ... 

00:03:15.864 --> 00:03:19.660
 ... and the party ends on January 6, the day of the Three Kings. 

00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:24.050
 So, for four weeks, we do not work. 

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:29.580
 - Wait, four weeks without Mexicans working? Do the United States stop operating during all this time? 

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:31.630
 - What can I say: we are festive. 

00:03:32.382 --> 00:03:39.120
 - They have a rich tradition. Maybe next year we could combine it with mine and create a new party ... 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.570
 ... MexiNavikkah! 

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.310
 - I do not know ... would it require circumcision? - Probably. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 - Then I pass. 

00:03:49.764 --> 00:03:54.940
 - Look, I'll be honest: what I want are better gifts. 

00:03:55.932 --> 00:03:59.200
 - How sad. 

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:04.800
 - The next year I'll do "Festivus" ... it's the party for the rest of us!
