00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
now this is heavy and you would think oh

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.100 
now this is heavy and you would think oh
that<00:02:09.920> can<00:02:10.189> go<00:02:10.280> in<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.429> microwave<00:02:10.549> I<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.690> would

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
that can go in the microwave I I would

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.780 
that can go in the microwave I I would
think<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.620> might<00:02:12.800> be<00:02:12.860> able<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:13.670> again

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
think that it might be able to but again

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.620 
think that it might be able to but again
I<00:02:14.240> mean<00:02:14.300> if<00:02:14.599> we<00:02:14.750> flip<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.140> over

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
I mean if we flip it over

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.300 
I mean if we flip it over
and<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.020> doesn't<00:02:16.410> say<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:16.920> okay<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
and it doesn't say that it's okay in the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.450 
and it doesn't say that it's okay in the
microwave<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.880> would<00:02:18.120> not<00:02:18.680> two<00:02:19.680> reasons<00:02:20.100> one

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
microwave I would not two reasons one

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.700 
microwave I would not two reasons one
food<00:02:20.760> safety<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.600> other<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.350> safety

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
food safety and the other one the safety

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.590 
food safety and the other one the safety
of<00:02:22.890> your<00:02:23.400> plate<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.910> mean<00:02:24.030> if<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.210> like<00:02:24.360> this

microwave you're going to get cracking
on<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.950> remember<00:02:29.340> always<00:02:29.550> look<00:02:29.880> for<00:02:30.060> that
