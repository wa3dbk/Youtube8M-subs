00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.480
 so can be as 6er 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 He knows all that very cool and we 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 also new photo archive again so 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.910
 a series of videos and that's all 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.940
 exciting for the boys the golf gti or 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.140
 have and the video is not 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.660
 rubber rubber come on that grubinger 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.000
 and result 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.810
 in this sequence or in the next 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.720
 tomorrow, dennis competence is the race 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.460
 ends after the sale here with us and 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.110
 if you want to know what you it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 did you have a phone? 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.739
 Japan is also a car so 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.309
 You can also judge because it knows 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.530
 know is a map so what 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.570
 was first around we want general 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 various things we almost all build 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.020
 all levels around how to care for others 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.239
 gold can build around 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
 that means you can quasi your level 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.390
 raussuchen if all the things 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.030
 Test on acids tall buddy downpipe 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.550
 control unit and all that you for 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.729
 keep reasonable will test separately 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.360
 and we start right now midline 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.280
 crack series 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.470
 there is no other way and again 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.820
 no instruction no there is nothing all 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.900
 measurements are always alone in the car 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.790
 made and we make 0 200 and 100 200 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 time I think most realistic 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.869
 to really compare like the whole 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.170
 thing is running 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.170
 we are entering 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.740
 So series moderate 26 24 12 2 seconds 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.740
 from 0 to 200 billion 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.330
 420 to 200 that's pretty long
