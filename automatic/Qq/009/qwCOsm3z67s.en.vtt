 minecraft well let's say this is not 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.549
 a chapter that has to do with the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.350
 story that we want to do but that 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.330
 is more or less like a bonus like a 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.410

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.570
 of the creative world to be able to make a 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.420
 little gift so that's why it 's said 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.250

 manzanitas as he eats food like them 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.560
 I say these materials are taken from 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350
 in creative mode to be able to do this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.600
 bonus has exploded out little hearts like that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.360
 that we have a horse and we have a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.770
 cute horse very cute this horse and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.810
 We are going to put the seat and go to 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 sent here we ride it and we go 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 When we go to the village we go 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.090
 let's see what we are going to do with this 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.110
 horse and then we are going to make the bonus 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.590
 here good as I tell you this of nothing 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.750
 what to do with the story but more or less 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.429
 I'm going to comment on something good later what 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.310
 I'm going to comment because here I have a 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.619
 small problem and here I have a small 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.979
 little problem here I have a small 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.799
 I was not expecting this, my friends 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.130
 I did not expect this, there is not a way 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.350
 for the town it is a little path that does not 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.880
 it can be that can not be greater 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.920
 little road for the town so we're going to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.899
 do one neither mode nor mode if we are going to 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.329
 improvise those cows remove vaquitas 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.429
 and I thought that I do not want you to know my 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.869
 horse is that it is very complicated 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.429
 make a little road is fine 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.280
 comes deep the water is fine 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.769

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.319

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.610

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.640

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.470
