00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.950
 I have a little question a little more 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.130
 practice it is about the management of 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.710
 prayer at work to know is that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.790
 you recommend more than to impose it in fact 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.349
 as a condition to lardenne 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.880
 the maintenance the left or rather 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.560
 work prove itself and show 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 we are serious then discuss 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.109
 with line managers or 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.109
 rather do it secretly 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.689
 made 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.460
 what are we doing there are two 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.400
 solutions 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.030
 the extreme and the median we were told to 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.949
 always take the middle solution 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.400
 the extreme it would be to put that on the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.790
 balance you take me in class but that's 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.739
 stupid 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:57.040
 it's silly because the person who 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.230
 too kruth maybe through you 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.950
 person your behavior see your prayer 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.050
 she would become Muslim gold in him 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.240
 saying that's where I'm recruiting with my 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.610
 prayer where you do not recruit tulle and 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.780
 already luan of Islam 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.410
 so if only from this point of view 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.979
 this is stupid and nasty 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:21.220
 then he does not say in Islam that he 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.220
 flaw put that forward what the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.630
 contract we did not talk about europe 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.140
 we did not talk about prayer in art 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.659
 weeks that they are therefore 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.299
 from this point of view is to introduce into 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.119
 something something that has nothing to 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.590
 to actually see is to mix how to say 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.299
 it's taking bladders for 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.530
 lanterns or mixed and at home 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.210
 how do you say that with tea towels 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.210
 towels 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:55.500
 thirdly 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.500
 the black professor even said bachir 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.780
 be good announcers do not be 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.610
 people who scares away others who 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.800
 scatter people and thus facilitate 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.959
 or random sow do not weigh down and 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.990
 Fame and glory points was signal 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:22.090
 so what should I do 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:25.530
 tell them to go and with 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.020
 your imposed behavior of prayer 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.020
 was starting he has a brother who told me 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:40.470
 when he got to his job 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:43.000
 I wanted to have played at the mpt strategy 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.910
 but arriving at work 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.530
 he started 10 euros a year from 10 they 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.930
 bought I believe in a ride to 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.930
 torches let's look but he said he 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.680
 robin gibb cowardice of chocolate buns 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:02.380
 descending I'm going to distribute and wire 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.760
 blacklist because the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.080
 people originally thought they were going 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.550
 ask is what we knew them 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.630
 the name said told them little by little 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.970
 the mans do that she plays marine is 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.980
 my day of celebration and that's what I 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.080
 see nothing is finished at noon pile where the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.820
 party is what he would have earned it pays 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.920
 may even be that tomorrow there will be 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.320
 people who will follow him to play 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:36.590
 black he won everything 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:41.590
 so I advocate rather pray in 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.180
 hiding all the time while planning 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.400
 in and by the behavior for their 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.600
 make it clear that prayer and CCC 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.430
 what three minutes 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.940
 it's exactly the same as the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.250
 coffee break that has no problem but 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.470
 you know in history we do not like 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.000
 we look we do not like to look at each other 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.240
 but those who are responsible for 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.770
 this situation is not prayer 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.260
 we are afraid 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.600
 no you are afraid because 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.200
 that we think that prayer and well grows 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.350
 to kill grows to be 6 inches so everything 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.209
 what is related to Islam being 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.419
 given that for them it is Islam that you 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.669
 pushes to be someone hard of 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.580
 naughty of nour and it's all right 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.740
 who is related and moore 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.770
 by definition so what is it 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.180
 does it take in history that's not the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.639
 prayer in lace that is rock it's 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.939
 religion whose prayer is one of 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.370
 pillars that is rejected and that's a 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:44.500
 responsibility that crimes 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.710
 it was we who live here who are 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.969
 from here to show fellow citizens what 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.969
 it's really that Islam
