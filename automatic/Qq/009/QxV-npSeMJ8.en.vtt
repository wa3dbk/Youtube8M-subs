00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.369
 appearance and configuration now 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.369
 go through the rest 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.699
 The device has a 5-inch and a case screen with 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:49.280
 540 resolution at 960 viewing angles as well as 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.289
 any and without a display are excellent and those that 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.879
 pixel density is weak but plus 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.399
 such a move is a more economical expense 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.230
 battery by the way battery with this 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.850
 In consumption mode, two light lives 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.379
 of the day 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.839
 the color rendition of the device is higher than those brightness 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.199
 Kuzyaeva also could not immediately 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.199
 framework 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.950
 zopo zp 820 interface is built in fresh 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:33.789
 android 422 with brand stylish 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:53.469
 The launcher here offers a topic which 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:55.270
 alter the menu beyond recognition all 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.890
 includes gps bluetooth and wifi works 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.890
 excellent and unquestioning 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.420
 as for the 2cy capacities of the new nothing 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.069
 not invented 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:33.880
 and why create something if everything is like that 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:35.950
 the front camera works fine 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.750
 has a resolution of as much as 5 megapixels 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.670
 when you make video calls 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.380
 main 8 megapixel camera with 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.670
 a lot of settings without problems removes 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.440
 full hd video format 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.440
 and the water shots are worthy 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:57.610
 and not to be unfounded suggest 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.610
 you look at the quality yourself 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.500
 the main feature of this device 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.650
 have use of new 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.150
 quad chipset mediatek mtk 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.459
 6582 which is able to work on 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.440
 maximum frequency of 1 and 2 gigahertz 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.409
 also used modern graphics 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.299
 mali 400 mp2 ram 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.519
 developers have installed one gigabyte 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.049
 internal memory 4 free for 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.670
 user but little more than half 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.980
 This volume can be expanded without any problems. 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.989
 using micro sd cards in general and 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.640
 the producer turned out worthy powerful 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.200
 and a pretty budgetary small 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.879
 only unjustified censure 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.470
 thickness and weight of the device itself 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.510
 but for many it may even be 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.579
 plus since and picked up the magic stuff 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.280
 Well, the most important nuance protection device 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.660
