00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
one of these things down it's kind of a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.080 
one of these things down it's kind of a
big<00:00:24.800> question<00:00:24.980> really<00:00:25.310> there<00:00:25.849> was<00:00:25.970> some

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
down you go for a scoot down down the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.990 
down you go for a scoot down down the
trail<00:01:39.880> Orlando<00:01:40.880> totally<00:01:42.819> convinces<00:01:43.819> you<00:01:43.970> that

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
trail Orlando totally convinces you that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.669 
trail Orlando totally convinces you that
he<00:01:44.209> really<00:01:44.539> is<00:01:44.660> on<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.869> back<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.440> big

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
he really is on the back of this big

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.740 
he really is on the back of this big
thing<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.369> so<00:01:46.700> we<00:01:46.849> ended<00:01:47.030> up<00:01:47.149> having<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.479> shoot

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
thing and so we ended up having to shoot

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.559 
thing and so we ended up having to shoot
the<00:01:47.869> entire<00:01:48.489> McCool<00:01:49.489> sequence<00:01:49.940> with<00:01:50.209> Orlando

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
the entire McCool sequence with Orlando

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.529 
the entire McCool sequence with Orlando
in<00:01:51.140> one<00:01:51.349> day<00:01:51.619> which<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:52.910> know<00:01:53.090> for<00:01:53.390> its

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
in one day which you know for its

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.119 
in one day which you know for its
complexity<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.289> a<00:01:54.319> very<00:01:54.560> difficult<00:01:54.709> thing<00:01:55.099> to

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:55.129 
complexity is a very difficult thing to

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.029 
complexity is a very difficult thing to
do<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.670> we<00:01:56.030> worked<00:01:56.360> out<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:57.410> stuff<00:01:57.619> we<00:01:57.770> wanted

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
do and we worked out the stuff we wanted

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.160 
do and we worked out the stuff we wanted
