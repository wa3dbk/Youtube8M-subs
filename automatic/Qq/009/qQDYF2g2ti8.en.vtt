that's<00:00:33.000> why<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.180> people<00:00:33.390> don't<00:00:33.540> understand

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
that's why the people don't understand

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.100 
that's why the people don't understand
they<00:00:35.340> grab<00:00:35.610> something<00:00:36.149> sweet<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.930> makes

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
they grab something sweet and it makes

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.690 
they grab something sweet and it makes
them<00:00:37.320> feel<00:00:37.350> good<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.010> little<00:00:38.250> while<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
them feel good for a little while and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.150 
them feel good for a little while and
then<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.450> crash<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
then they get to crash because the the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.709 
then they get to crash because the the
bodies<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.890> concentration<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.040> sugar<00:00:44.600> in<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
bodies the concentration of sugar in the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.319 
bodies the concentration of sugar in the
concentration<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.559> sugar<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> blood

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
concentration of sugar in the blood

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
concentration of sugar in the blood
makes<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> pancreas<00:00:49.050> produce<00:00:49.440> more<00:00:49.710> insulin

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
makes the pancreas produce more insulin

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.639 
makes the pancreas produce more insulin
the<00:00:50.850> extra<00:00:51.360> incident<00:00:51.960> drops<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.469> blood

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the extra incident drops your blood

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.310 
the extra incident drops your blood
sugar<00:00:52.949> lower<00:00:53.160> than<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> was<00:00:53.610> initially<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
sugar lower than it was initially so the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
sugar lower than it was initially so the
point<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:56.100> sure<00:00:56.129> whenever<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.910> eat<00:00:57.090> cops

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
point is make sure whenever you eat cops

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.709 
point is make sure whenever you eat cops
eat<00:00:58.079> protein<00:00:58.859> causes<00:00:59.370> slows<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.359> absorption

eat protein causes slows the absorption

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.070 
eat protein causes slows the absorption
of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.460> carbs<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:03.059> spike<00:01:03.449> but

of the carbs and you don't spike but

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
of the carbs and you don't spike but
don't<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.409> hung<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.890> cops<00:01:05.159> cops<00:01:05.670> take

we took a simple honey and one we got
that<00:01:50.220> surge<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.790> energy<00:01:50.909> oh<00:01:51.390> man<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that surge of energy oh man this is it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.310 
that surge of energy oh man this is it
and<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.490> about<00:01:53.670> 10<00:01:53.939> minutes<00:01:54.180> later<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.630> come

down you accept some more money we hope
soon<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:58.799> train<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.490> go<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> pound

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
soon we would train and go for a pound

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.510 
soon we would train and go for a pound
of<00:02:00.240> honey<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> work<00:02:00.899> out<00:02:01.100> every<00:02:02.100> said<00:02:02.310> she

oh man we found the magic touch but
that's<00:02:10.319> because<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:11.129> surgery

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
that's because that surgery

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.810 
that's because that surgery
of<00:02:12.180> God<00:02:12.770> into<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.890> system<00:02:14.280> they<00:02:14.460> gave<00:02:14.670> you

of God into the system they gave you

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.210 
of God into the system they gave you
that<00:02:14.970> boost<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.570> energy<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> body

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that boost of energy but the body

jar honey through a workout we had to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.420 
jar honey through a workout we had to
discard<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.840> because<00:02:28.020> we<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:29.190> didn't

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
discard that because we know we didn't

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.530 
discard that because we know we didn't
know<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.640> science<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.240> it

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
we know that that was not the answer so

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.900 
we know that that was not the answer so
we<00:02:37.290> stopped<00:02:37.500> using<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.830> honey<00:02:37.980> initially

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910

this a lot these guys are reading books
and<00:04:18.640> fantasizing<00:04:19.640> I<00:04:20.060> went<00:04:21.049> through<00:04:21.290> this<00:04:21.440> like

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620

and fantasizing I went through this like
I<00:04:21.709> told<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.010> about<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.250> honey<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.610> the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
I told you about the honey in the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.180 
I told you about the honey in the
beginning<00:04:23.090> we<00:04:23.600> I've<00:04:23.900> gone<00:04:24.200> through<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.920> steps

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
beginning we I've gone through the steps

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.820 
beginning we I've gone through the steps
and<00:04:25.940> how<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.150> body<00:04:26.480> works<00:04:26.840> even<00:04:27.500> though<00:04:27.800> I

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
and how the body works even though I

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.830 
and how the body works even though I
don't<00:04:28.010> think<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.550> know<00:04:28.970> everything<00:04:29.540> because

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
don't think I know everything because

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.830 
don't think I know everything because
it's<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.260> lot<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.740> knowledge<00:04:31.070> now<00:04:31.940> in<00:04:32.240> nutrition

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
it's a lot of knowledge now in nutrition

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.870 
it's a lot of knowledge now in nutrition
as<00:04:32.990> they<00:04:33.710> have<00:04:33.800> concentrated<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.640> learned

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
as they have concentrated and learned

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.420 
as they have concentrated and learned
about<00:04:35.090> nutrition<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.620> didn't<00:04:37.010> know<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.250> we

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
about nutrition that I didn't know it we

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.970 
about nutrition that I didn't know it we
did<00:04:37.580> not<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:37.880> try<00:04:38.090> but<00:04:38.810> we<00:04:38.990> learned<00:04:39.350> a<00:04:39.440> lot<00:04:39.680> just

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
did not to try but we learned a lot just

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.810 
did not to try but we learned a lot just
from<00:04:41.050> trying<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.650> seeing<00:04:43.400> if<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.610> works

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
from trying it and seeing if it works

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.840 
from trying it and seeing if it works
and<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.900> said<00:04:45.110> we<00:04:45.470> still<00:04:45.710> we<00:04:46.400> found<00:04:46.640> the<00:04:46.760> most

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
and I said we still we found the most

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.300 
and I said we still we found the most
important<00:04:47.390> thing<00:04:47.570> in<00:04:47.690> protein<00:04:48.170> at<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.070> time

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
important thing in protein at the time

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.560 
important thing in protein at the time
because<00:04:49.610> he<00:04:49.670> didn't<00:04:49.880> have<00:04:49.970> all<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.210> protein

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
because he didn't have all the protein

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.060 
because he didn't have all the protein
powders<00:04:50.930> was<00:04:51.680> me

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
powders was me

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.730 
powders was me
so<00:04:52.520> ate<00:04:52.670> two<00:04:52.820> pounds<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.210> me<00:04:53.360> today<00:04:53.630> but<00:04:54.440> don't

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
so ate two pounds of me today but don't

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.920 
so ate two pounds of me today but don't
get<00:04:54.950> involved<00:04:55.430> in<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:55.850> complex<00:04:56.510> yourself

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
get involved in the complex yourself

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.820 
get involved in the complex yourself
with<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.170> cycle<00:04:57.530> itself<00:04:57.860> forget<00:04:58.700> about
