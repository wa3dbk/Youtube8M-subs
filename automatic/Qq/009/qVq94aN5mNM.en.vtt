miles<00:01:13.990> an<00:01:14.140> hour<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:15.040> power<00:01:15.490> supply

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
miles an hour this is a power supply

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.760 
miles an hour this is a power supply
that<00:01:15.939> I've<00:01:16.060> knocked<00:01:16.270> up<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.659> charge<00:01:16.899> electric

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
that I've knocked up to charge electric

that I've knocked up to charge electric
motor<00:01:17.920> bike<00:01:18.149> obviously<00:01:19.149> it<00:01:19.390> takes<00:01:19.479> quite<00:01:19.689> a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
motor bike obviously it takes quite a

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.969 
motor bike obviously it takes quite a
lot<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.049> power<00:01:20.170> at<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.350> charger<00:01:20.649> in<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.799> hurry

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
lot of power at the charger in a hurry

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.210 
lot of power at the charger in a hurry
and<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.420> it's<00:01:23.380> capable<00:01:23.619> of<00:01:23.890> putting<00:01:24.040> out

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
and this is it's capable of putting out

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.649 
and this is it's capable of putting out
72<00:01:24.759> volts<00:01:25.149> at<00:01:26.020> 20<00:01:26.500> amps<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:28.060> will<00:01:28.149> charge<00:01:28.420> my

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
72 volts at 20 amps so it will charge my

of<00:03:36.400> each<00:03:36.610> cell<00:03:36.880> individually<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:38.500> if<00:03:39.459> any<00:03:39.790> one

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
of each cell individually and if any one

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.229 
of each cell individually and if any one
cell<00:03:40.270> drops<00:03:40.600> below<00:03:40.810> two<00:03:41.380> point<00:03:41.590> one<00:03:41.770> volts

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
cell drops below two point one volts

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.240 
cell drops below two point one volts
which<00:03:43.239> is<00:03:43.270> considered<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.130> point<00:03:45.130> at

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
which is considered the the point at

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.970 
which is considered the the point at
which<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.580> cell<00:03:45.730> mary<00:03:45.910> chemic<00:03:46.450> damaged<00:03:46.980> it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
which the cell mary chemic damaged it

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.170 
which the cell mary chemic damaged it
will<00:03:48.239> trip<00:03:49.239> off<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:50.040> unit<00:03:51.040> which<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.610> powering

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
will trip off the unit which is powering

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.780 
will trip off the unit which is powering
the<00:03:52.390> whole<00:03:52.570> bike<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.250> power<00:03:54.430> will

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
the whole bike so the the power will

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.180 
the whole bike so the the power will
stop<00:03:55.060> drawing<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.530> batteries<00:03:56.830> thus<00:03:57.070> will

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
stop drawing and the batteries thus will

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.040 
stop drawing and the batteries thus will
be<00:03:57.220> protected<00:03:57.700> so<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.630> best<00:03:58.780> of<00:03:58.900> my<00:03:59.020> knowledge

that<00:04:13.630> are<00:04:13.720> much<00:04:13.870> much<00:04:14.050> smaller<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.770> they<00:04:14.890> won't

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
that are much much smaller so they won't

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.000 
that are much much smaller so they won't
balance<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.610> pack<00:04:15.790> at<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:17.020> fast<00:04:17.739> enough<00:04:17.859> rate
