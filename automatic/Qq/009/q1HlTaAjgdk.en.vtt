00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.890
 so we are now in front of 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.800
 kawasaki h2r so a name known h2 which 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.440
 was an emblematic motorcycle of the years 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.360
 70 from kawasaki and who did 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.300
 certainly know the brand and its 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.129
 prestige on the circuits this time 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.590
 this is the h2r so there will be a 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.239
 road declination in the spring 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.760
 next for now we have the 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.730
 version r so racing only 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.640
 intended for competition or use on 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.640
 circuit so a very tapered motorcycle with 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.910
 a completely carbon cladding 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.190
 we have a steel lattice frame a 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.970
 little as do the Italians on their 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.729
 hyper sport and a motor 999 centimeters 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.710
 cubes but that has the particularity 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.300
 to have a compressor we'll see everything 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.270
 the time on the engine how that 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.160
 so works a very uncluttered chassis a 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.320
 light weight and especially so a 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.399
 power of 300 horses that will make one 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.630
 exceptional machine 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.340
 just like its price 50 to 55 thousand euros 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.470
 available around March 2015 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.240
 so we can see that it's a 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.630
 collaboration of all the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.910
 kawasaki departments as well 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.830
 aerodynamic aeronautical injection that 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.840
 have also worked on the engine 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.209
 so this engine is a 4 cylinder in 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.830
 lines with c and 3 4 valves per cylinder 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.780
 liquid cooling injection like 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.399
 usually but its particularity is 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.959
 what we see in red there is a 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.160
 volumetric compressor so not a 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.810
 turbo as we can know 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.300
 usually on engines 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.910
 of automobiles but a compressor that goes 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.979
 compress the outside air for 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.649
 then inject it at a pressure 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.929
 greater than one bar in the cylinders 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.009
 so we increase this way the 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.240
 thermodynamic efficiency and volume 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.349
 engendered which allows one to come out 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.349
 power of 300 horses 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.590
