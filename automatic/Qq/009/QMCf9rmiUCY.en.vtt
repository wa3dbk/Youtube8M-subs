00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.769
 Crohn's disease is a chronic pathology that causes inflammation of the 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.010
 intestine and that in some cases also causes the appearance of fistulas 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.310
 when the administration of consistent conventional treatments 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.140
 Based on drugs that fail to cure fistulas, it is necessary to resort to 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.980
 operating theater 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.710
 however, this option may occasionally have adverse effects 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.750
 that's why the university clinic of Navarra has started a clinical trial 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.839
 to test the effectiveness of adult stem cells 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.480
 in these guns 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.609
 in it they also participate 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.769
 specialists from the hospital complex of Navarre and will soon be 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.679
 will incorporate to the team of doctor garcÃ­a elm of the hospital the peace of

 authors of the first trials on this treatment 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.100
 the inheritance of treatment with adult stem cells 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.320
 arises from the attempt to discover or half preceding bigeye procedure 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 surgical especially in the context crohn's disease 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.080
 in which the financing mechanisms are altered and therefore

 knowledgeable as a fecal impotent would say 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.420
 pep so much the importance of the area the quality of life the investigations 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.010
 precedents showed that the application of this type of therapies 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 they have permission from the patient to whom they subsequently 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.950
 the trial begins with the selection of the patient for the study 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.409
 at two weeks 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.439
 the plastic surgeon performs a liposuction 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.380
 in order to obtain adipose tissue stem cells that are then 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.030
 they will grow in the cell therapy laboratory of the university clinic 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.900
 Navarre 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.000
 after two weeks of culture, the necessary amount of cells is obtained 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.740
 mesenchymal and the patient is administered to the treatment in doses 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.860
 injectables of 200 million cells 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.630
 an amount much higher than that implemented in previous studies 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:23.129
 the administration of treatments is practiced in the operating room 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.439
 ambulatory and with deep sedation 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.309
 mesenchymal stem cells from fat 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.669
