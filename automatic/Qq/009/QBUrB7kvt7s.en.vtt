00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
straight and I actually used a comb

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.500 
straight and I actually used a comb
method<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.070> saw<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.789> last<00:00:24.029> time<00:00:24.359> why

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
method that I saw this last time why

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.359 
method that I saw this last time why
they<00:00:24.600> put<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> comb<00:00:25.140> through<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.830> then

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
they put the comb through and then

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.900 
they put the comb through and then
follow<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.970> Flatiron<00:00:27.480> down<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.199> hair<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
follow the Flatiron down the hair and I

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.429 
follow the Flatiron down the hair and I
would<00:00:30.300> say<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> little<00:00:31.019> straighter<00:00:31.289> than

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
would say it is a little straighter than

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.959 
would say it is a little straighter than
I'm<00:00:31.590> used<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.920> getting<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> still<00:00:32.790> get

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
I'm used to getting it but I still get

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.240 
I'm used to getting it but I still get
good<00:00:33.210> results<00:00:33.719> without<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.200> call<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.980> comb

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
good results without the call the comb

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.490 
good results without the call the comb
is<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> hard<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.110> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> awkward

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
is kind of hard it's kind of awkward

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.139 
is kind of hard it's kind of awkward
sometimes<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.489> maybe<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.910> need<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
sometimes and maybe I just need to
practice<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:39.989> again<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.190> wanted<00:00:41.370> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460

but that's just when I started going at
your<00:02:31.239> soul<00:02:31.450> once<00:02:32.049> my<00:02:32.170> hair<00:02:32.379> fully<00:02:32.769> grown<00:02:32.890> out

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
I've been about them about three years

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.440 
I've been about them about three years
this<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.709> all<00:02:35.950> mine<00:02:36.340> entry<00:02:36.640> had<00:02:36.790> no<00:02:36.939> more<00:02:37.180> perm

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.649 
this is all mine entry had no more perm
but<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.019> started<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:39.150> 2005<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.209> stopped

but I started it in 2005 I stopped

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.839 
but I started it in 2005 I stopped
getting<00:02:40.840> perms<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.590> then<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:44.220> think<00:02:45.220> I'm

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
getting perms and then it's I think I'm

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.009 
getting perms and then it's I think I'm
sorry<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.829> 2006

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
sorry in 2006

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.890 
sorry in 2006
maybe<00:02:50.019> 2000<00:02:50.530> burly<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.400> beginning<00:02:51.639> of<00:02:51.730> 2007<00:02:52.659> I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
maybe 2000 burly the beginning of 2007 I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.909 
maybe 2000 burly the beginning of 2007 I
stopped<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:54.730> August<00:02:55.260> 2007<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.349> stopped<00:02:56.709> getting

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
stopped so August 2007 I stopped getting

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.030 
stopped so August 2007 I stopped getting
perms<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:57.760> I've<00:02:58.720> been<00:02:58.870> natural<00:02:59.349> ever<00:02:59.530> since<00:02:59.889> so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
perms so I've been natural ever since so

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.899 
perms so I've been natural ever since so

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.520 
I think now it's fully natural no perms
no<00:03:04.299> trace<00:03:04.629> of<00:03:04.659> any<00:03:04.900> perms<00:03:05.169> or<00:03:05.349> anything

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.960 
the only white color at the ends is just
my<00:03:13.150> natural<00:03:13.209> hair<00:03:13.870> color<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.519> don't<00:03:15.760> know<00:03:15.879> if

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970

you can see it or not my bra strap right
now<00:03:25.169> and<00:03:26.169> as<00:03:26.379> you<00:03:26.530> can<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:44.729> and<00:03:45.729> it's<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.120> shiny

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
now and as you can see and it's so shiny

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.649 
now and as you can see and it's so shiny
so<00:03:47.549> again<00:03:48.549> I<00:03:49.180> do<00:03:49.959> though<00:03:51.030> right<00:03:52.030> here<00:03:52.449> around

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
so again I do though right here around

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.390 
so again I do though right here around
here<00:03:53.319> I<00:03:53.949> do<00:03:54.400> like<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.150> put<00:03:55.479> a<00:03:55.540> little<00:03:55.780> bit<00:03:56.019> of

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
here I do like to put a little bit of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.309 
here I do like to put a little bit of
olive<00:03:57.400> oil<00:03:57.760> or<00:03:58.150> shea<00:03:58.299> butter<00:03:58.959> because<00:03:59.109> it

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
olive oil or shea butter because it

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.960 
olive oil or shea butter because it
always<00:03:59.470> gets<00:03:59.769> dry<00:04:00.069> right<00:04:00.280> up<00:04:00.400> in<00:04:00.519> there<00:04:00.729> I

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
always gets dry right up in there I

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.170 
always gets dry right up in there I
guess<00:04:01.689> because<00:04:01.870> it's<00:04:02.169> more<00:04:02.379> exposed<00:04:02.829> so<00:04:03.819> if<00:04:04.030> I

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
guess because it's more exposed so if I

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.699 
guess because it's more exposed so if I
were<00:04:04.389> to<00:04:04.569> just<00:04:04.659> go<00:04:05.019> out<00:04:05.199> without<00:04:05.409> putting

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
were to just go out without putting

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.849 
were to just go out without putting
anything<00:04:05.979> on<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:07.109> it's<00:04:08.109> just<00:04:08.229> a<00:04:08.409> little<00:04:08.470> light

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
anything on it it's just a little light

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.119 
anything on it it's just a little light
right<00:04:09.639> there<00:04:09.699> you<00:04:09.879> kind<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.209> see<00:04:10.359> it<00:04:10.479> but<00:04:10.859> and<00:04:11.859> I

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
it starts to separate from the hair from
