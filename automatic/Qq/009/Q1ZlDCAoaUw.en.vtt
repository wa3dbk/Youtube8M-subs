00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
as good as a three by three but it's way

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859 
as good as a three by three but it's way
better<00:01:58.950> than<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.490> octo<00:01:59.880> star<00:02:00.149> cube<00:02:00.420> hold<00:02:00.750> on

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
better than the octo star cube hold on

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.840 
better than the octo star cube hold on
let<00:02:00.899> me<00:02:01.020> grab<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.950> another<00:02:02.219> 3<00:02:02.670> by<00:02:02.820> 3

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
let me grab that this is another 3 by 3

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.069 
let me grab that this is another 3 by 3
mod<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:04.020> has<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> lot<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.920> moving<00:02:05.159> pieces<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
mod that has a lot of moving pieces and

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.100 
mod that has a lot of moving pieces and
whenever<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.380> turn<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.950> face<00:02:08.599> let's<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.869> how

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
whenever you turn a face let's see how

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.630 
whenever you turn a face let's see how
do<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.590> whenever<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.250> turn<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.430> face

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
do we do this whenever you turn a face

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.670 
do we do this whenever you turn a face
like<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.959> you<00:02:12.959> can

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
like that you can

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.740 
like that you can
through<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.099> corners<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:15.359> have<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.719> say

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
through the corners and I have to say

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.420 
through the corners and I have to say
that<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:17.459> cube<00:02:18.290> right<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.620> actually<00:02:19.829> turns

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
that this cube right here actually turns

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.819 
that this cube right here actually turns
a<00:02:20.760> lot<00:02:21.060> better<00:02:21.329> than<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.500> hasn't

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
a lot better than that and it hasn't

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.199 
a lot better than that and it hasn't
even<00:02:22.890> been<00:02:23.069> played<00:02:23.489> with<00:02:23.519> I've<00:02:23.939> actually

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
even been played with I've actually

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.520 
even been played with I've actually
played<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:24.959> one<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> whole<00:02:25.319> bunch

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
played with this one a whole bunch

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.649 
played with this one a whole bunch
actually<00:02:26.400> take<00:02:26.609> it<00:02:26.730> apart<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.359> put<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.569> back

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
actually take it apart and put it back

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.199 
actually take it apart and put it back
together<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.530> stuff<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.730> that's

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
together and all that stuff so that's

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.920 
together and all that stuff so that's
probably<00:02:30.510> why<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.950> one<00:02:32.219> is<00:02:32.599> turning<00:02:33.599> as<00:02:33.719> good

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
probably why this one is turning as good

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.479 
probably why this one is turning as good
as<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.200> because<00:02:34.739> it's<00:02:34.920> popped<00:02:35.159> on<00:02:35.340> me<00:02:35.459> a

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
as it is because it's popped on me a

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.979 
as it is because it's popped on me a
couple<00:02:35.700> times<00:02:35.909> this<00:02:36.269> one<00:02:36.450> doesn't<00:02:36.689> feel<00:02:36.870> like

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
couple times this one doesn't feel like

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.110 
couple times this one doesn't feel like
it's<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.379> pop<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.709> all<00:02:37.859> but<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.790> show<00:02:39.060> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
it's going to pop at all but to show you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.020 
it's going to pop at all but to show you
the<00:02:39.599> specialties<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.920> puzzle<00:02:41.159> as<00:02:41.519> you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the specialties of this puzzle as you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.759 
the specialties of this puzzle as you
can<00:02:42.180> see<00:02:42.389> there<00:02:42.629> are<00:02:42.659> way<00:02:42.930> more<00:02:42.959> cuts<00:02:43.530> than

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
can see there are way more cuts than

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.220 
can see there are way more cuts than
just<00:02:44.040> three<00:02:44.250> by<00:02:44.370> three<00:02:44.639> cuts<00:02:45.169> definitely<00:02:46.169> i

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
just three by three cuts definitely i

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.589 
just three by three cuts definitely i
can<00:02:46.439> solve<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.709> 3<00:02:46.889> by<00:02:47.010> 3<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.639> something<00:02:47.879> else<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
can solve a 3 by 3 so something else you

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.119 
can solve a 3 by 3 so something else you
can<00:02:48.720> do<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:48.989> puzzle<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.590> move<00:02:49.919> like

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
can do in this puzzle is a move like

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.300 
can do in this puzzle is a move like
that<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:51.180> once<00:02:52.109> you<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.379> that<00:02:52.590> done<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.040> know

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
that so once you get that done you know

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.490 
that so once you get that done you know
you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.639> you<00:02:54.090> can<00:02:54.239> scramble<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.720> cube<00:02:54.989> just

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
you can you can scramble the cube just

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.179 
you can you can scramble the cube just
doing<00:02:55.919> these<00:02:56.609> turns<00:02:57.090> or<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.829> turn<00:02:59.010> it

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
doing these turns or you can turn it

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.449 
doing these turns or you can turn it
like<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.260> scramble<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.319> as<00:03:01.439> well<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.370> you

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
like that and scramble it as well so you

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.030 
like that and scramble it as well so you
can<00:03:02.669> imagine<00:03:02.760> once<00:03:03.629> you<00:03:03.750> did<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> turn<00:03:04.319> then<00:03:04.919> you

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
can imagine once you did a turn then you

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.149 
can imagine once you did a turn then you
can<00:03:05.159> turn<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.519> one<00:03:05.730> back<00:03:06.349> turn<00:03:07.349> that<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.950> it

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
can turn this one back turn that so it

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.270 
can turn this one back turn that so it
can<00:03:08.340> get<00:03:08.489> messed<00:03:08.790> up<00:03:09.030> really<00:03:10.019> quickly<00:03:10.469> and<00:03:10.889> I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
can get messed up really quickly and I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.099 
can get messed up really quickly and I
think<00:03:11.549> it's<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:11.939> be<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> blast<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.840> learn

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
think it's going to be a blast to learn

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.080 
think it's going to be a blast to learn
how<00:03:13.139> to<00:03:13.349> solve<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.159> like<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.400> said<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.790> turning

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
how to solve so like I said the turning

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.539 
how to solve so like I said the turning
on<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.329> puzzle<00:03:15.719> is<00:03:15.840> really<00:03:16.469> good<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:17.129> turns

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
on this puzzle is really good it turns

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.330 
on this puzzle is really good it turns
it's<00:03:18.030> almost<00:03:18.359> finger<00:03:18.959> trickable<00:03:19.319> but<00:03:19.919> I<00:03:20.099> would

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
it's almost finger trickable but I would

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.490 
it's almost finger trickable but I would
be<00:03:20.489> worried<00:03:20.879> because<00:03:21.030> if<00:03:21.299> this<00:03:21.419> pops<00:03:21.720> I'm<00:03:22.019> in

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
be worried because if this pops I'm in

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.800 
be worried because if this pops I'm in
bad<00:03:22.709> shape<00:03:22.739> there<00:03:23.639> are<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.819> ton<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.180> tiny<00:03:24.449> pieces

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
bad shape there are a ton of tiny pieces

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.559 
bad shape there are a ton of tiny pieces
on<00:03:24.959> here<00:03:25.199> and<00:03:25.379> I<00:03:25.889> hope<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.220> stickers<00:03:26.609> stay

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
on here and I hope the stickers stay

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.240 
on here and I hope the stickers stay
good<00:03:27.780> especially<00:03:28.079> these<00:03:28.409> small<00:03:28.709> ones<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:29.099> if

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
good especially these small ones but if

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.890 
good especially these small ones but if
not<00:03:29.459> I'll<00:03:29.669> just<00:03:29.699> super<00:03:30.150> glue<00:03:30.299> them<00:03:30.449> right<00:03:30.780> it

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
not I'll just super glue them right it

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.750 
not I'll just super glue them right it
shouldn't<00:03:31.079> be<00:03:31.199> that<00:03:31.229> big<00:03:31.439> of<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.650> deal<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.400> I'm

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
shouldn't be that big of a deal but I'm

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.819 
shouldn't be that big of a deal but I'm
super<00:03:33.209> impressed<00:03:33.299> with<00:03:33.689> this<00:03:33.810> puzzle<00:03:34.229> and<00:03:34.379> all

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.659 
I want to do now is give this thing a
scramble<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.229> see<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:37.829> can<00:03:38.010> solve<00:03:38.189> it<00:03:38.400> so

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
scramble and see if I can solve it so

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.000 
scramble and see if I can solve it so
first<00:03:39.389> I'm<00:03:39.659> going<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.079> scramble<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.859> like<00:03:40.979> a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
first I'm going to scramble it like a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.460 
first I'm going to scramble it like a
three<00:03:41.370> by<00:03:41.489> three<00:03:41.689> that<00:03:42.689> seems<00:03:42.989> like<00:03:43.169> the<00:03:43.229> most

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
three by three that seems like the most

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.740 
three by three that seems like the most
obvious<00:03:43.769> thing<00:03:44.189> to<00:03:44.220> me<00:03:44.549> I<00:03:44.759> should<00:03:45.150> probably<00:03:45.239> be

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
obvious thing to me I should probably be

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.449 
obvious thing to me I should probably be
doing<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.290> three<00:03:46.500> by<00:03:46.590> three<00:03:46.829> scramble<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.370> the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
doing the three by three scramble in the

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.890 
doing the three by three scramble in the
middle<00:03:47.699> of<00:03:47.819> all<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.180> other<00:03:48.389> stuff<00:03:48.479> though

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
middle of all this other stuff though

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.759 
middle of all this other stuff though
then<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:50.009> want<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.430> give<00:03:50.759> some<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.060> these<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.769> turn

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
then I want to give some of these a turn

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.780 
then I want to give some of these a turn
now<00:03:52.979> you<00:03:53.040> can<00:03:53.250> turn<00:03:53.430> these<00:03:53.959> 120<00:03:54.959> degrees<00:03:55.319> and

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
now you can turn these 120 degrees and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.759 
now you can turn these 120 degrees and
then<00:03:56.790> turn<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.299> 3<00:03:57.569> by<00:03:57.720> 3<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.199> that<00:03:58.409> lets

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
then turn it like a 3 by 3 and that lets

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.729 
then turn it like a 3 by 3 and that lets
it<00:03:58.949> retain<00:03:59.340> its<00:03:59.639> cubic<00:04:00.030> shape<00:04:00.590> see<00:04:01.590> what<00:04:01.709> I

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
it retain its cubic shape see what I

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.490 
it retain its cubic shape see what I
mean<00:04:02.000> like<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.509> then<00:04:03.900> it's<00:04:04.079> never<00:04:04.319> going

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
mean like that and then it's never going

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.379 
mean like that and then it's never going
to<00:04:04.560> turn<00:04:04.739> out<00:04:04.919> of<00:04:05.009> a<00:04:05.069> cube<00:04:05.370> but<00:04:05.909> you<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.180> also

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
to turn out of a cube but you can also

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.920 
to turn out of a cube but you can also
turn<00:04:06.720> them<00:04:07.019> 60<00:04:07.620> degrees<00:04:07.889> like<00:04:08.729> that<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.239> then

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
turn them 60 degrees like that and then

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.599 
turn them 60 degrees like that and then
you<00:04:10.109> can<00:04:10.259> turn<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.889> I'm<00:04:11.069> going<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.250> start<00:04:11.370> doing

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
you can turn so I'm going to start doing

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.679 
you can turn so I'm going to start doing
that<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.629> doesn't<00:04:13.169> it<00:04:14.129> shape-shifts<00:04:14.639> but<00:04:15.419> by

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
that it doesn't it shape-shifts but by

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.479 
that it doesn't it shape-shifts but by
the<00:04:15.750> videos<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.199> I've<00:04:16.440> seen<00:04:16.709> on<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.009> it

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the videos that I've seen on this it

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.420 
the videos that I've seen on this it
doesn't<00:04:17.820> technically<00:04:18.419> jumbled<00:04:18.930> so<00:04:19.799> that

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
doesn't technically jumbled so that

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.519 
doesn't technically jumbled so that
means<00:04:20.699> that<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.690> doesn't<00:04:22.229> become<00:04:22.880> locked<00:04:23.880> or

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:24.529 
means that it doesn't become locked or

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.110 
means that it doesn't become locked or
the<00:04:25.529> movement<00:04:26.039> isn't

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
the movement isn't

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.050 
the movement isn't
locked<00:04:27.240> in<00:04:27.419> anyway<00:04:28.199> so<00:04:28.229> it<00:04:28.979> seems<00:04:29.669> like<00:04:29.880> you're

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
locked in anyway so it seems like you're

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.490 
locked in anyway so it seems like you're
always<00:04:30.090> going<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.510> be<00:04:30.570> able<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.870> turn<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.290> no

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
always going to be able to turn this no

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.530 
always going to be able to turn this no
matter<00:04:31.620> what<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.889> do<00:04:32.240> get<00:04:33.240> some<00:04:33.389> of<00:04:33.479> these

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
matter what you do get some of these

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.960 
matter what you do get some of these
pieces<00:04:33.780> turned<00:04:34.199> out<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.530> there<00:04:37.940> bandage<00:04:38.940> that

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
pieces turned out of there bandage that

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.580 
pieces turned out of there bandage that
was<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.540> word<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.780> was<00:04:39.870> trying<00:04:40.139> to<00:04:40.229> think<00:04:40.350> of<00:04:40.560> it

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
was the word I was trying to think of it

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.800 
was the word I was trying to think of it
doesn't<00:04:40.949> become<00:04:41.160> bandage<00:04:41.550> good<00:04:42.060> enough<00:04:42.240> had<00:04:42.780> a

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
doesn't become bandage good enough had a

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:53.030 
doesn't become bandage good enough had a
mental<00:04:43.199> block<00:04:51.560> I'll<00:04:52.560> tell<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.770> right<00:04:52.860> now

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
mental block I'll tell you right now

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.400 
mental block I'll tell you right now
some<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.550> these<00:04:53.610> pieces<00:04:53.940> are<00:04:54.150> extremely<00:04:55.110> sharp

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
some of these pieces are extremely sharp

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.219 
some of these pieces are extremely sharp
this<00:04:56.040> is<00:04:56.190> actually<00:04:56.699> like<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.810> can<00:04:57.960> see<00:04:58.199> right

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
this is actually like you can see right

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.400 
this is actually like you can see right
there<00:04:59.150> have<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.300> be<00:05:00.330> careful<00:05:00.810> definitely<00:05:01.260> when

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
there have to be careful definitely when

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.189 
there have to be careful definitely when
you<00:05:01.560> are<00:05:01.740> scrambling<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.460> puzzle<00:05:06.139> okay<00:05:07.139> so

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
you are scrambling this puzzle okay so

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.200 
you are scrambling this puzzle okay so
I'm<00:05:07.440> going<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.680> call<00:05:07.889> that<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:08.370> sufficient

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
I'm going to call that a sufficient

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.020 
I'm going to call that a sufficient
scramble<00:05:09.870> it's<00:05:10.080> definitely<00:05:10.500> going<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.680> be

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
scramble it's definitely going to be

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.210 
scramble it's definitely going to be
sufficiently<00:05:12.030> difficult<00:05:12.570> for<00:05:12.780> me<00:05:12.990> so<00:05:13.380> I've

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
sufficiently difficult for me so I've

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.560 
sufficiently difficult for me so I've
thought<00:05:14.460> of<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.729> few<00:05:14.940> different<00:05:15.000> ways<00:05:15.270> of

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
thought of a few different ways of

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.500 
thought of a few different ways of
attacking<00:05:15.870> this<00:05:16.169> puzzle<00:05:16.639> possibly<00:05:17.639> getting

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
attacking this puzzle possibly getting

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.450 
attacking this puzzle possibly getting
it<00:05:18.630> back<00:05:18.750> into<00:05:18.960> cube<00:05:19.260> shape<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.800> then<00:05:20.010> trying

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
it back into cube shape and then trying

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.890 
it back into cube shape and then trying
to<00:05:20.550> find<00:05:20.789> some<00:05:20.970> commentators<00:05:21.419> for<00:05:21.600> these

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
to find some commentators for these

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.129 
to find some commentators for these
small<00:05:22.169> pieces<00:05:22.460> but<00:05:23.460> I<00:05:23.850> don't<00:05:24.419> know<00:05:24.630> I'm<00:05:24.900> going

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
small pieces but I don't know I'm going

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.960 
small pieces but I don't know I'm going
to<00:05:25.229> get<00:05:25.350> as<00:05:25.470> far<00:05:25.680> as<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:25.949> can<00:05:26.010> with<00:05:26.400> that<00:05:26.669> and

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
to get as far as I can with that and

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.570 
to get as far as I can with that and
I'll<00:05:27.870> be<00:05:28.050> back<00:05:28.289> it<00:05:28.590> might<00:05:28.770> be<00:05:28.949> soft<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.430> it

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
I'll be back it might be soft and it

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.430 
I'll be back it might be soft and it
might<00:05:29.760> not<00:05:30.030> see<00:05:30.330> you<00:05:30.419> guys<00:05:30.570> in<00:05:30.780> just<00:05:30.810> one

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
might not see you guys in just one

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.980 
might not see you guys in just one
second<00:05:32.099> alright<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:33.120> as<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.419> can<00:05:33.510> see<00:05:33.750> i

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
second alright so as you can see i

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.900 
second alright so as you can see i
finally<00:05:34.500> got<00:05:34.650> it<00:05:34.830> solved<00:05:35.190> here<00:05:35.460> and<00:05:35.669> you<00:05:35.760> can

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
finally got it solved here and you can

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.390 
finally got it solved here and you can
see<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.389> stickers<00:05:36.870> actually<00:05:37.400> still

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400
