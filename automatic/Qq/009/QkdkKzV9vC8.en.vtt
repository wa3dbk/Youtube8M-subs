00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:11.490
 the gentlemen and ladies and ex killer I am 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.820
 campaigns found with nick to introduce you 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.220
 a little bug need and what 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.430
 you are living and we can talk one 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.769
 moment rin opinions 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:29.599
 then this is possible 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:35.280
 anyone can do it by 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:38.610
 max lori and I go bedside and this 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.680
 bug we say consists of what you will see 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.960
 in the video and now then you take 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.950
 a semi tex that after we will show 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.520
 however the bugs consist practically the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.890
 zombies in any corner with the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 head down with a grate if 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 get in hand without throwing 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.899
 of course and you will never be immortal however 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 due to visit by a friend for 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.820
 send you a really copy them 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.420
 they will only come from you without being able 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.280
 kill 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.380
 just pull up the grenade though 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.200
 you will practically die as you have seen 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 first here are the gratings if he admits that if 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.810
 someone a shock i'm here and nothing you 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.450
 take and you have to put for example of 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.759
 this corner because it does not hold e 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 the other as well as you saw before I have 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.829
 show different angles where you can 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:41.280
 put yourself at the bottom then ideas then here 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.950
 i was playing with max which helped do 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:50.909
 this little bug that most discovered it 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.720
 reading would be for the glass discovered 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:00.210
 he is also a match I owe 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.810
 however now let's see and look here 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.760
 as you see 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.340
 look start with two zombies then 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.460
 slowly the zombies accumulate 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.110
 you can always see that it doesn't come back 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.250
 max was dead anyway he is doing 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.440
 of course the complexity was needed 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.420
 everyone's complicity remains there 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.660
 don't die not done now as we see 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.420
 they shoot me with the reyer because if 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.250
 they can't leave 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.110
 then to his or you can use it as 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.280
 tactic also to revive why not 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.260
 they will attack you because yes you can 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.740
 also revive with sieve tex in hand 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.540
 this I discovered with max now vi 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.580
 I'll see you here one of them is 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.400
 committed suicide to let you see these things 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.150
 that anyway when you were we were more 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.510
 tall maybe you put a corner of him 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.480
 because so animate maybe you don't have 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.940
 nothing you see they are ariston unpublished you are 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.120
 back with arms two hours on line e 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.010
 to protect a little and in the meantime we will dig 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.010
 a little hole for the return to fill in 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.020
 sea from the demands they saw the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.410
 followed tex and you are immune to zombies 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.500
 here is precisely 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.300
 of course not when there will be 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.120
 maybe updates the island 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.459
 perfected some game then some 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.459
 stages there will be no more people network 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.440
 they are also animating with the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:39.820
 selex is possible indeed it is naturally 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.000
 we are only at the reshuffle that has a 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.610
 very low low range so okay 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.310
 now go some rome a little 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:54.519
 of sun or love alley then sorry if 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.840
 it was not possible to put still of 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:02.650
 Furry pardoning videos of you sometimes 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.799
 really sorry 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.650
 But as soon 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.629
 we will do it just think shortly 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.489
 resign 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:16.449
 maybe we'll give you the tactics on how 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:20.109
 manage a useless team match me 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:22.240
 it looks cooler than normal because not 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.720
 give up to pay head seasons 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:33.910
 also test how to react when you are 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:35.680
 under the 2 or more goals and precisely us vi 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.789
 we will teach all this what 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.039
 we can do 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.990
 and oh well so I leave you with this 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.470
 image and the next with the next 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.470
 boat
