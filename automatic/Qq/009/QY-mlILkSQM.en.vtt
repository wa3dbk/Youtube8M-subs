 nîmes is the best promoted this season 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.599
 in league 2 such success already is more 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.730
 that the other two promoted brings together the 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.279
 nîmois who will seek to achieve a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.449

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.550
 but beware the statistics 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 indicate that Nîmes did not win the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.110
 least meeting in the Loire Atlantique 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.739
