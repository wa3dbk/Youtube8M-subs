hello<00:00:02.330> this<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.389> Dean<00:00:03.750> from<00:00:04.020> motion<00:00:04.200> media<00:00:04.470> and

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
hello this is Dean from motion media and

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.650 
hello this is Dean from motion media and
today<00:00:05.580> we're<00:00:05.759> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.940> look<00:00:06.089> at<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> technique

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
today we're going to look at a technique

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.959 
today we're going to look at a technique
for<00:00:07.140> applying<00:00:07.620> decals<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:09.230> vehicles<00:00:10.610> in<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.790> way

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
for applying decals to vehicles in a way

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.990 
for applying decals to vehicles in a way
where<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.509> can<00:00:13.019> keep<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.679> decals<00:00:14.130> really

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
where we can keep the decals really

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.760 
where we can keep the decals really
high-res<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.809> close-ups<00:00:16.289> instead<00:00:16.680> of

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
high-res for close-ups instead of

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.070 
high-res for close-ups instead of
incorporating<00:00:17.490> them<00:00:17.670> into<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.449> really

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
incorporating them into a really

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.980 
incorporating them into a really
massively<00:00:19.619> huge<00:00:20.070> map<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.689> here

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
massively huge map so you can see here

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.040 
massively huge map so you can see here
I've<00:00:22.109> modeled<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> bike<00:00:22.859> from<00:00:23.130> Akira<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
I've modeled the bike from Akira and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.630 
I've modeled the bike from Akira and
I've<00:00:25.050> put<00:00:25.289> various<00:00:25.680> decals<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.640> here's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I've put various decals on so here's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.919 
I've put various decals on so here's
what<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> geometry<00:00:30.029> looks<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> can

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
what the geometry looks like and you can

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.780 
what the geometry looks like and you can
see<00:00:31.170> all<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> ones<00:00:31.619> selected<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.279> white<00:00:32.520> are

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
see all the ones selected in white are

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.170 
see all the ones selected in white are
the<00:00:32.899> decals<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.610> already<00:00:35.820> kind<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the decals so you can already kind of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.090 
the decals so you can already kind of
figure<00:00:36.450> out<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:36.840> doing<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.950> let's

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
figure out what I'm doing here so let's

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.770 
figure out what I'm doing here so let's
do<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.790> look<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.960> technique<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.719> I'm

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
do one and look at that technique so I'm

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.250 
do one and look at that technique so I'm
going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> select<00:00:43.820> canopy<00:00:44.820> base<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:48.260> and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
going to select canopy base here and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.160 
going to select canopy base here and
then<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.780> hide<00:00:51.780> everything

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
then I'm not going to hide everything

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.660 
then I'm not going to hide everything
else

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.770 

zoom<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:59.089> the<00:01:00.089> decal<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.690> we're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
zoom in here so the decal that we're

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
zoom in here so the decal that we're
going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.929> apply<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> case<00:01:01.769> is<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.159> will

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
going to apply in this case is this will

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.630 
going to apply in this case is this will
smiley<00:01:03.120> face<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
smiley face here so first I'm going to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.630 
smiley face here so first I'm going to
clone<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:07.880> yes

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.310 

having<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.390> mouse<00:01:12.600> issue<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.760> clone

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
having a little mouse issue here clone

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.880 
having a little mouse issue here clone
copy

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
copy

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.080 
copy
and<00:01:18.100> I'm<00:01:18.790> going<00:01:19.120> to<00:01:19.560> hide<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.800> other<00:01:20.950> one<00:01:21.130> I'm

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
and I'm going to hide the other one I'm

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.430 
and I'm going to hide the other one I'm
going<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.270> collapse<00:01:22.630> this<00:01:22.810> down<00:01:22.870> because<00:01:23.350> I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
going to collapse this down because I

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.850 
going to collapse this down because I
want<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.710> use<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.070> hi-res<00:01:24.250> one<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.680> I'm

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
want to use the hi-res one then I'm

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.740 
want to use the hi-res one then I'm
going<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.370> select<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:28.060> faces

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.410 

that<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.950> know<00:01:33.070> rough<00:01:33.310> approximation<00:01:34.060> here

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
that you know rough approximation here

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.230 
that you know rough approximation here
I'm<00:01:35.020> going<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.230> grow<00:01:35.410> those<00:01:35.650> out<00:01:37.050> then<00:01:38.050> invert

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
I'm going to grow those out then invert

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.110 
I'm going to grow those out then invert
delete<00:01:40.240> okay<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:42.490> we've<00:01:42.700> got<00:01:42.940> our<00:01:43.090> little

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
delete okay now we've got our little

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.480 
delete okay now we've got our little
area<00:01:43.600> here

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.920 

there's<00:01:48.490> some<00:01:48.730> hidden<00:01:49.030> faces<00:01:49.300> there<00:01:49.630> I'm<00:01:49.720> just

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
there's some hidden faces there I'm just

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.400 
there's some hidden faces there I'm just
going<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.140> delete<00:01:50.350> this<00:01:50.620> okay<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:53.110> right<00:01:53.230> so

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
going to delete this okay all right so

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.020 
going to delete this okay all right so
now<00:01:53.560> we<00:01:53.620> have<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.190> area<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:54.700> we're<00:01:54.820> going<00:01:54.850> to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
now we have the area that we're going to

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.790 
now we have the area that we're going to
use<00:01:55.210> we're<00:01:55.420> going<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.600> apply<00:01:55.900> some<00:01:55.930> mapping

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
use we're going to apply some mapping

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.930 
use we're going to apply some mapping
coordinates<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:58.330> then<00:01:59.290> we're<00:01:59.410> going<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.940> this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
coordinates and then we're going to this

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.910 
coordinates and then we're going to this
is<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.210> decal<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.840> just<00:02:02.170> simply<00:02:02.470> copied<00:02:02.860> a

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
is the decal I just simply copied a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.460 
is the decal I just simply copied a
previous<00:02:03.340> material<00:02:03.550> all<00:02:04.510> it<00:02:04.810> is<00:02:04.930> is<00:02:05.230> the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
previous material all it is is the

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.280 
previous material all it is is the
texture<00:02:05.890> map<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.370> an<00:02:06.490> opacity<00:02:07.000> map<00:02:07.240> so<00:02:08.229> I'm

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
texture map and an opacity map so I'm

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.520 
texture map and an opacity map so I'm
going<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.440> apply<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.869> I'm<00:02:11.320> going<00:02:11.440> to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
going to apply that and I'm going to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.860 
going to apply that and I'm going to
line<00:02:11.740> up<00:02:11.770> my<00:02:11.950> mapping<00:02:12.430> using<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.270> align<00:02:13.570> tools

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
line up my mapping using the align tools

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.710 
line up my mapping using the align tools
I'm<00:02:14.680> going<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.890> bitmap<00:02:15.310> fit<00:02:16.060> it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.100 

to<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> map<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.300> scale<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.630> into

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
to the map I'm going to scale it into

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.630 
to the map I'm going to scale it into
place<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:28.980> case<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.460> also

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
place and in this case it's also

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.480 
place and in this case it's also
slightly<00:02:29.850> rotated

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
slightly rotated

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.540 
slightly rotated
okay<00:02:33.890> then<00:02:34.890> what<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.340> do<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.330> collapse<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.900> all

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
okay then what I do is I collapse it all

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.790 
okay then what I do is I collapse it all
and<00:02:39.080> then<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.200> trim<00:02:40.440> it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
and then I trim it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.520 
and then I trim it
I<00:02:40.830> literally<00:02:41.670> just<00:02:41.850> trim<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.900> takes<00:02:43.380> a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
I literally just trim it this takes a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.140 
I literally just trim it this takes a
little<00:02:43.680> bit<00:02:43.890> longer<00:02:44.160> I'm<00:02:44.430> not<00:02:44.610> going<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.850> make

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
little bit longer I'm not going to make

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.670 
little bit longer I'm not going to make
you<00:02:45.270> sit<00:02:45.480> through<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.780> whole<00:02:45.810> thing<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.440> you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
you sit through the whole thing but you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.520 
you sit through the whole thing but you
know<00:02:47.400> basically<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.910> go<00:02:48.180> through<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.600> trim

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
know basically I go through and trim

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.750 
know basically I go through and trim
away<00:02:49.790> all<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.300> excess<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.860> if<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.250> cut<00:02:53.550> that

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
away all of the excess so if I cut that

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.330 
away all of the excess so if I cut that
face<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:55.590> know<00:02:55.740> then<00:02:56.490> I<00:02:56.640> delete<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:58.340> so

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
face you know then I delete it so

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 
face you know then I delete it so
instead<00:02:59.820> of<00:03:00.230> boring<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.350> with<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.680> I'm

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
instead of boring you with that I'm

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.080 
instead of boring you with that I'm
going<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.520> delete<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.150> one<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:05.250> we'll

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
going to delete this one and we'll

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.600 
going to delete this one and we'll
unhide<00:03:06.480> all<00:03:06.510> here<00:03:07.410> I've<00:03:07.560> already<00:03:07.830> done<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.450> and

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
unhide all here I've already done it and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.480 
unhide all here I've already done it and
the<00:03:11.610> key<00:03:11.820> thing<00:03:12.030> here<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.870> want<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.680> make

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
the key thing here is you want to make

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.550 
the key thing here is you want to make
sure<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:15.030> build<00:03:15.450> your<00:03:15.690> decals<00:03:16.080> from<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
sure you build your decals from the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.160 
sure you build your decals from the
high-res<00:03:17.330> so<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.570> see<00:03:18.720> right<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.020> our

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
high-res so you can see right now our

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.230 
high-res so you can see right now our
decal<00:03:19.470> literally<00:03:20.040> lies<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.640> same<00:03:20.880> plane

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
decal literally lies on the same plane

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.940 
decal literally lies on the same plane
as<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.690> geometry<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.530> need<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.800> add<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
as that geometry so we need to add a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.640 
as that geometry so we need to add a
push<00:03:23.310> modifier<00:03:23.730> set<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.930> slightly<00:03:25.440> off<00:03:25.620> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
push modifier set it slightly off the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.010 
push modifier set it slightly off the
surface

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
surface

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.270 
surface
we'll<00:03:28.020> grab<00:03:28.170> push<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:29.520> like<00:03:29.730> 0.05<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:31.280> then

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
we'll grab push do like 0.05 and then

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.080 
we'll grab push do like 0.05 and then
lastly<00:03:32.790> we're<00:03:33.090> going<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:34.760> turn<00:03:35.760> off<00:03:35.820> its

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
lastly we're going to turn off its

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.800 
lastly we're going to turn off its
ability<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.570> cast<00:03:36.870> shadows

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.510 

and<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.830> is<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.520> -<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> quick<00:03:42.420> render<00:03:42.810> here<00:03:42.989> and

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.580 

so<00:03:47.520> again<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> way<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.450> create<00:03:49.110> details

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
so again this is a way to create details

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.500 
so again this is a way to create details
in<00:03:50.120> decals<00:03:51.120> into<00:03:51.510> geometry<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.760> have<00:03:53.760> them<00:03:54.000> be

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
in decals into geometry and have them be

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.350 
in decals into geometry and have them be
really<00:03:55.080> high<00:03:55.349> res<00:03:55.940> thanks<00:03:56.940> we'll<00:03:57.150> see<00:03:57.180> you

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
really high res thanks we'll see you

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.810 
really high res thanks we'll see you
again<00:03:57.599> soon
