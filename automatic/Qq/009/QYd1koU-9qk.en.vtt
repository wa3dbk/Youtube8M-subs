00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 we leave agriculture now for 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.299
 focus on the other primary sector in 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 the livestock and in this way we are going to 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.320
 meet aritz gamboa a pastor of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.560
 arruazu that is still betting on another 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.680
 autochthonous race as is the latxa sheep 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.170
 Well, I'm Aritz Gamboa from Miguel and 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.760
 I'm the albazo manager here 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.730
 sakana valley 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.250
 concretely pastore masters in the valley 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.150
 of sakana and on Mount Aralar with 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.730
 we follow 5000 years and no, and 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.340
 This officer is still here, I would like to 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.850
 see how many trades last so long 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.850
 like this one 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.230
 to this model and here there are many and many 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.930
 who live this way let's say it is 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.510
 a table that has three legs 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.640
 fundamentally the central one is the sheep 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.050
 many latxa and I do not understand that the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.910
 Latxa sheep has to remain 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.129
 Latxa sheep has to remain 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.170
 rustic has to remain a 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.600
 animal that knows how to manage the environment and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.540
 have to have that instinct let's say 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.820
 I can do it like that and I focus only 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.110
 in productivity 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.479
 I will have loaded the latxa sheep I will have 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.420
 loaded the grazing then there are things 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.869
 that are above the performance 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.100
 economic only and exclusively if I 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.700
 I look at the milk that is drunk in my 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.420
 Lambs 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.659
 in the period in which they get fat or if 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.039
 to destine them for meat that milk 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.950
 transformed in that his gives me more money 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.869
 that the lamb 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.939
 but nevertheless the latxa sheep does not have 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.149
 that being does not have to stop being a 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.710
 animal that raises its lambs that is 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.659
 Linked to 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.030
 to their lambs that pull them forward 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.350
 that has that maternal instinct and that 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.690
 the time transmit that in the genes 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.210
 if I nothing nothing else was born the 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.450
 lamb would take it from the middle would not know 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.270
 select which sheep has an instinct 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.619
 adequate and maintains those characteristics 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.530
 of latxa sheep that has to maintain and 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.880
 which does not improve the herd the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.670
 we get thanks to power I do not know how 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.340
 say it of the solidarity between the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.019
 own pastors, we do not have a 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.010
 association that is called healthy association 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.519
 of the ax in Navarre in which we are 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.799
 several shepherds here in Navarre who 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.129
 we choose to improve among all this 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.780
 sheep then we based on criteria 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.530
 scientists this is done a job 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.220
 scientific 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.140
 of improvement of this sheep but always 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.950
 understanding that what I improve has 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.310
 what to do to improve the pastor next door 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.720
 and therefore if the association has 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.730
 have to take a ram that is the best 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.080
 ram that comes out of my farm I 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.510
 will carry effectively and will 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.550
 inseminate the rest of herds which is what 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.920
 that we need another pastor 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.250
 that has improved can I transmit to 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.710
 me that improvement 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.990
 the other that we have already said is also the 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.630
 environment biodiversity and then the 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.400
 culture linked to that environment to all 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.260
 the communal ones that we have those laws that 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.200
 have been written through the uses and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.940
 historical customs of those environments and 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.020
 then the third would be the cheese not 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.210
 and explained why the latxa sheep is a 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.530
 champion precisely in transforming that 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.080
 green environment that we have to our 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.870
 around in a product of a quality 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.270
 as extreme as idiazabal cheese but 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.520
 it's more if productivity is not a 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.880
 very good animal this is in amount of 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.470
 production in milk in amount of 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.610
 cheese production and quality 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.970
 production where that does not have 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.090
 competitor from the point of view of 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.130
 managing our environment this 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.080
 natural environment that has also been 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.290
 built thanks to her therefore 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.540
 if she disappears disappears this 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.520
 environment also and then that fourth leg 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.960
 what I told you there is that I 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.360
 I take away a little more importance but 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.150
 which is obviously an important leg 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.960
 it would be the pastor not the shepherding that is 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.680
 good is the way to manage those 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.680
 resources that we have 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.380
 today 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.350
 Well, those three legs that I have 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.419
 specifically explained in albi in 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.280
 arruazu our exploitation and well then 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.710
 are determined by a management 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.410
 particular let's say it would be our 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.539
 particularity on the one hand that 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.100
 births as you see we have had them 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.979
 end of October or early 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.720
 November of insemination therefore 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:44.150
 these coordinates that you see here back 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.210
 are going to be the future mothers 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.550
 and good and since the lambs are born 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.000
 until we separate them from the mother that 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.310
 milk belongs to the lambs in the 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.720
 moment we remove the lambs and 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.420
 recría do and apart from the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.120
 mothers those mothers will go on to produce 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.890
 milk with which we will make our cheese and 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.240
 we are already talking about that from 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.540
 December we will begin the campaign 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.550
 production 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.980
 we will do a production campaign in the 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.740
 which 100% of the milk that we produce 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.550
 we will transform it into cheese 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.250
 specifically the denomination of 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.310
 idiazabal origin idiazabal let's say that 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.849
 it's inside the cheese olympics 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.639
 well, at the top, 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.349
 and it's funny because on the other hand it's the 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.619
 cheaper denomination of origin than 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:34.740
 there is or is more accessible to the public in 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:37.020
 not because I do not want to 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.029
 that idiazabal becomes a 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.419
 product that only an elite can eat 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.939
 and once we get to June the 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.779
 sheep tamayo the sheep prepare 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:51.240
 again to receive the semen via mountain 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:53.849
 natural or via insemination and already in the 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.649
 mount the sheep will take advantage of the resources 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:59.180
 that you have in that environment to start 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:01.639
 breed that effect that embryo 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.340
 that will be the future lamb that can be 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.250
 the future mother 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.199
 the future lamb to the chilindrón del 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.340
 dish of any of our houses the 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:14.680
 lamb sanz this grazing model does not 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.380
 can be understood without the latxa sheep 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.270
 you can understand 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.920
 spaces like aralar alvin and urbasa or the 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.080
 natural environment the biodiversity that 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.570
 we have around us and I do not know 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.020
 can understand without another product that has 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.880
 emerged from that link that is cheese and 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.530
 in this case the idiazabal cheese that 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.910
 we believe it is very important 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.420
 besides that it has a recognition 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.420
 international 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.270
 very important 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.610
 this someone said it and said it very well 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:49.400
 is that a doctor will need it 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.650
 even once a day 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.270
 a school we need a teacher 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.940
 we need it every day 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.789
 practically not but is that a 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.460
 farmer we need 3 minimum 3 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:04.639
 times a day in our lifetime my 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.380
 work I like a lot because it links me 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.669
 to the earth because it allows me to live in 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.650
 arruazu that I think is the best 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:15.290
 good people of the earth of the world 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.020
 because it allows me to live off the earth and 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:21.620
 with the earth looking at the sky if it rains 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.479
 it does not rain and it's more it's not that it allows me 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.910
 to live on it is that it also forces me to 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:28.039
 live it every day and I think 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.259
 that few people have that luck then 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:32.919
 good that I'm going to say to you is the 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:32.919
 best trade
