do not end up knowing how fast ten

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.649 
do not end up knowing how fast ten
percent<00:01:46.259> gets<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:48.180> less<00:01:48.240> have

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
percent gets you you more or less have

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.510 
percent gets you you more or less have
two<00:01:49.049> hundred<00:01:49.320> levels<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.189> give<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
two hundred levels if you give this to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.960 
two hundred levels if you give this to
your<00:01:50.700> character<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.210> away<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.970> guess

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
your character right away you I guess

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.639 
your character right away you I guess
you<00:01:54.000> could<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.390> saying<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.960> every<00:01:55.170> 10<00:01:55.320> levels

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you could be saying for every 10 levels

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.249 
you could be saying for every 10 levels
you're<00:01:55.770> skipping<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.189> level<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.630> you're

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you're skipping one level so you're

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.440 
you're skipping one level so you're
technically<00:01:58.649> skipping<00:01:59.070> twenty<00:01:59.340> levels<00:01:59.490> I'm

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
technically skipping twenty levels I'm

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.859
