sometimes you'll get these icy dragon
scales<00:01:48.590> sometimes<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:50.040> sometimes

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
scales sometimes you get more sometimes

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.630 
scales sometimes you get more sometimes
you<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.729> less<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:52.680> boring<00:01:53.009> leather<00:01:53.280> sells

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
for about fifty go the stack and the icy

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
to remember like 40 old stack and so it

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.350 
to remember like 40 old stack and so it
I'm<00:02:02.340> een<00:02:02.520> you're<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> make

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
I'm een you're not really going to make

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450 
I'm een you're not really going to make
a<00:02:03.390> whole<00:02:03.659> lot<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.960> money<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.310> main

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
a whole lot of money here the main

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.039 
a whole lot of money here the main
reason<00:02:05.790> I'm<00:02:05.909> showing<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.600> because<00:02:06.869> it's

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
reason I'm showing this is because it's

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.589 
reason I'm showing this is because it's
a<00:02:07.110> very<00:02:07.140> fast<00:02:07.590> way<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.030> make<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
a very fast way to like I just make a

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.110 
a very fast way to like I just make a
get<00:02:09.869> borean<00:02:10.229> leather<00:02:10.259> period<00:02:11.190> now<00:02:11.730> another

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
get borean leather period now another

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.910 
get borean leather period now another
option<00:02:12.660> here<00:02:12.870> obviously<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.500> doing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
option here obviously is doing

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
option here obviously is doing
oculus<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.060> also<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.750> give

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
oculus but this also is going to give

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.360 
oculus but this also is going to give
you<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.020> couple<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.410> other<00:02:16.560> things<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:17.130> with

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you a couple of other things like with

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.220 
you a couple of other things like with
frost<00:02:17.670> weed<00:02:17.910> cloth<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.480> everything<00:02:18.810> else<00:02:19.020> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
frost weed cloth and everything else and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.559 
frost weed cloth and everything else and
so<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:20.069> also<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> little<00:02:21.180> bit<00:02:21.300> quicker

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
so it's also like a little bit quicker

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.420 
so it's also like a little bit quicker
in<00:02:21.870> terms<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.349> runs<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.250> can

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
in terms of the runs because you can

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.860 
in terms of the runs because you can
just<00:02:23.459> run<00:02:23.819> through<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.480> agri

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
just run through here and agri

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.809 
just run through here and agri
everything<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.319> AOE<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.709> down<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.700> also

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
everything in AOE it down it's also

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.979 
everything in AOE it down it's also
pretty<00:02:27.090> cool<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.510> do<00:02:27.660> too<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.989> would

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
pretty cool to do too and so I I would

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.360 
pretty cool to do too and so I I would
say<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.440> probably<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.220> those

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
say this is probably like one of those

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.040 
say this is probably like one of those
efficient<00:02:32.970> ways<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.150> farm<00:02:33.600> borean<00:02:34.020> leather

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
efficient ways to farm borean leather

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.699 
efficient ways to farm borean leather
but<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:36.090> said<00:02:36.209> before<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.720> oculus<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.380> also

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
but as I said before the oculus is also

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.650 
but as I said before the oculus is also
a<00:02:37.739> really<00:02:38.069> good<00:02:38.220> place<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.420> don't

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
a really good place that I just don't

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.090 
a really good place that I just don't
really<00:02:39.780> think<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:40.260> quite<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.680> good<00:02:40.800> as<00:02:40.950> this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
really think it's quite as good as this

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.309 
really think it's quite as good as this
just<00:02:41.489> because<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.060> rate<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.600> respawns

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
just because of the the rate of respawns

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.470 
just because of the the rate of respawns
and<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.830> we're<00:02:44.340> not<00:02:44.459> only<00:02:44.640> respawns<00:02:45.150> but

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
and all that we're not only respawns but

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.229 
and all that we're not only respawns but
i<00:02:45.510> guess<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:45.870> resets<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
i guess like resets that you can do and

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.940 
i guess like resets that you can do and
you<00:02:48.239> want<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.450> be<00:02:48.540> careful<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.440> not<00:02:49.680> die

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
you want to be careful here and not die

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.620 
you want to be careful here and not die
like<00:02:50.370> right<00:02:50.610> here<00:02:50.790> as<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.030> see<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.269> get

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
like right here as you can see I get

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.259 
like right here as you can see I get
very<00:02:51.900> very<00:02:52.170> well<00:02:52.470> health<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.060> are

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
very very well health and if you are

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.900 
very very well health and if you are
rogue<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.080> cloak<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.530> shadows<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:56.459> the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
rogue you can cloak of shadows the the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.030 
rogue you can cloak of shadows the the
debuff<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.600> idea<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.260> big<00:02:58.440> guys<00:02:58.650> will<00:02:58.860> put

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
debuff that idea the big guys will put

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.190 
debuff that idea the big guys will put
me<00:02:59.220> buff<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.730> it's<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.390> curse<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.840> mending

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
me buff on you it's a curse of mending

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.900 
me buff on you it's a curse of mending
and<00:03:01.380> whenever<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.130> hit<00:03:02.280> something<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.790> have

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and whenever you hit something you have

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.520 
and whenever you hit something you have
a<00:03:02.940> chance<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.330> healing<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.720> whatever<00:03:04.350> you're

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
a chance of healing that whatever you're

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.100 
a chance of healing that whatever you're
hitting<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.519> it's<00:03:06.120> real<00:03:06.390> simple<00:03:06.600> you

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
hitting and so it's real simple you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.110 
hitting and so it's real simple you
justyou<00:03:07.410> cloak<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.130> shadows<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.519> take<00:03:08.790> that

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
justyou cloak of shadows and take that

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.080 
justyou cloak of shadows and take that
off<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:10.319> as<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:10.950> said<00:03:11.100> before<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.880> got

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
off and so as I said before like I got

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.850 
off and so as I said before like I got
about<00:03:12.590> 30<00:03:14.390> boring<00:03:15.390> leather<00:03:15.600> /<00:03:15.870> run<00:03:16.110> sometimes

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
about 30 boring leather / run sometimes

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.580 
about 30 boring leather / run sometimes
about<00:03:17.100> sometimes<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.700> mean<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.329> was<00:03:18.420> like<00:03:18.510> 25<00:03:19.140> to

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
about sometimes I mean it was like 25 to

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.800 
about sometimes I mean it was like 25 to
40<00:03:20.010> honestly<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.239> nice<00:03:21.359> i<00:03:21.510> got<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> little

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
40 honestly it's a nice i got a little

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.050 
40 honestly it's a nice i got a little
bit<00:03:22.019> more<00:03:22.200> on<00:03:22.500> top<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.769> some<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.670> z<00:03:23.850> dragon

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
bit more on top of some like I z dragon

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.210 
bit more on top of some like I z dragon
scales<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.780> stuff<00:03:24.959> like<00:03:25.079> that<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.500> so

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
scales and stuff like that and so

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.849 
scales and stuff like that and so
compared<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.420> guess<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.780> could<00:03:27.900> say<00:03:28.109> oculus

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
compared to I guess you could say oculus

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.240 
compared to I guess you could say oculus
this<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.090> probably<00:03:30.420> I'd<00:03:30.840> say<00:03:30.870> fifteen<00:03:31.859> percent

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
this is probably I'd say fifteen percent

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.030 
this is probably I'd say fifteen percent
better<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.890> really<00:03:34.890> good

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
better and so if you have really good

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.720 
better and so if you have really good
gear<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.609> also<00:03:36.890> borean<00:03:37.890> leather<00:03:37.920> can<00:03:38.579> be

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
gear and also borean leather can be

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.009 
gear and also borean leather can be
really<00:03:38.970> expensive<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.630> auction<00:03:39.780> house

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
really expensive on the auction house

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.680 
really expensive on the auction house
because<00:03:40.410> not<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> lot<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:40.859> people<00:03:40.980> are<00:03:41.690> there

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
because not a lot of people are there

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.509 
because not a lot of people are there
aren't<00:03:42.840> really<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.140> lot<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.440> very<00:03:43.650> easy<00:03:43.980> farming

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
aren't really a lot of very easy farming

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.699 
aren't really a lot of very easy farming
spots<00:03:44.820> for<00:03:45.090> borean<00:03:45.390> leather<00:03:45.440> outside<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.560> like

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
spots for borean leather outside of like

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.370 
spots for borean leather outside of like
oculus<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.400> some<00:03:47.519> other<00:03:47.640> stuff<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.870> it

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
oculus and some other stuff and so it

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.349 
oculus and some other stuff and so it
people<00:03:50.250> might<00:03:50.430> not<00:03:50.549> really<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.150> on<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
people might not really have it on the

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.120 
people might not really have it on the
auction<00:03:51.480> also<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.959> lot<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.470> if<00:03:52.859> you're<00:03:52.980> trying

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.560 
auction also a lot and if you're trying
to<00:03:53.220> level<00:03:53.519> whether<00:03:53.670> working<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.180> can<00:03:54.299> be<00:03:54.390> real

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
to level whether working it can be real

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.060 
to level whether working it can be real
pain<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.900> ass<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.140> do<00:03:55.470> if<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.950> don't

really uh if you have to farm all this

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.660 
really uh if you have to farm all this

between like this an oculist about get
bored<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.829> one<00:04:08.010> or<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.220> other<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.609> as<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.600> can

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
bored of one or the other but as you can

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.569 
bored of one or the other but as you can
see<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.319> long<00:04:10.470> as<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.709> don't<00:04:10.920> kill<00:04:10.980> south<00:04:11.340> area

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
see as long as you don't kill south area

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.099 
see as long as you don't kill south area
and<00:04:11.940> south<00:04:12.120> here<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.420> has<00:04:12.569> three<00:04:12.810> million

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
and south here and has three million

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.520 
and south here and has three million
health<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:15.720> really<00:04:16.079> kind<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.500> to

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
health and so you really kind of have to

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.949 
health and so you really kind of have to
try<00:04:16.889> to<00:04:16.950> kill<00:04:17.280> him<00:04:17.489> now<00:04:18.060> whenever<00:04:18.329> Ward's<00:04:18.840> or

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
try to kill him now whenever Ward's or

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.080 
try to kill him now whenever Ward's or
Draenor<00:04:19.139> comes<00:04:19.470> out<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:20.190> might<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.579> a<00:04:20.609> little

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
Draenor comes out this might be a little

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.630 
Draenor comes out this might be a little
bit<00:04:21.299> better<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.600> do<00:04:21.750> on<00:04:21.780> 25<00:04:22.440> men<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.490> make

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
bit better to do on 25 men just to make

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.760 
bit better to do on 25 men just to make
sure<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.150> don't<00:04:24.240> accidentally<00:04:24.870> kill

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
sure that you don't accidentally kill

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.590 
sure that you don't accidentally kill
too<00:04:25.950> much<00:04:26.099> stuff<00:04:26.400> basically

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
too much stuff basically

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.790 
too much stuff basically
I'm<00:04:28.500> not<00:04:28.710> really<00:04:28.890> entirely<00:04:29.310> sure<00:04:29.700> yet<00:04:30.000> but

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
I'm not really entirely sure yet but

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.290 
I'm not really entirely sure yet but
either<00:04:31.800> way<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.430> trash<00:04:32.670> should<00:04:32.910> also<00:04:33.060> be

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
either way the trash should also be

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.410 
either way the trash should also be
extremely<00:04:33.780> easy<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:33.990> kill<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:35.310> as<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.210> said

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420

long cooldowns they will reset and so as
you<00:05:08.700> can<00:05:08.820> see<00:05:09.060> here<00:05:09.360> i<00:05:09.750> just<00:05:10.170> vanished<00:05:10.980> and<00:05:11.250> my

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
you can see here i just vanished and my

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.600 
you can see here i just vanished and my
cool<00:05:12.150> down<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.660> i<00:05:13.290> think<00:05:13.890> i<00:05:14.130> don't<00:05:14.340> know<00:05:14.400> if<00:05:14.550> i

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
cool down on i think i don't know if i

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.610 
cool down on i think i don't know if i
did<00:05:14.790> use<00:05:14.940> preparation<00:05:15.480> or<00:05:15.600> not<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.140> i<00:05:16.320> think

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
did use preparation or not but i think

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.640 
did use preparation or not but i think
in<00:05:16.740> another<00:05:16.860> clip<00:05:17.250> i<00:05:17.430> use<00:05:17.700> preparation<00:05:18.360> and

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
in another clip i use preparation and

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.160 
in another clip i use preparation and
reset<00:05:19.650> my<00:05:19.890> my<00:05:20.340> preparation<00:05:20.970> cool<00:05:21.210> down<00:05:21.390> and<00:05:21.630> so

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
reset my my preparation cool down and so

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.380 
reset my my preparation cool down and so
that<00:05:22.410> is<00:05:22.590> something<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:23.010> be<00:05:23.220> aware<00:05:23.340> of<00:05:23.550> other

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
this is just kind of like a cool thing

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.150 
this is just kind of like a cool thing
to<00:05:36.150> do<00:05:36.390> I<00:05:36.600> wouldn't<00:05:37.290> really<00:05:37.410> say<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:37.770> can<00:05:38.010> make

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
to do I wouldn't really say you can make

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.890 
to do I wouldn't really say you can make
a<00:05:38.190> whole<00:05:38.430> lot<00:05:38.490> of<00:05:38.790> gold<00:05:39.000> off<00:05:39.150> of<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.390> unless

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
a whole lot of gold off of this unless

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.470 
a whole lot of gold off of this unless
your<00:05:40.170> server<00:05:40.410> just<00:05:40.740> has<00:05:40.980> a<00:05:41.010> really<00:05:41.130> bad<00:05:41.580> skinny

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
your server just has a really bad skinny

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.960 
your server just has a really bad skinny
economy<00:05:43.050> I<00:05:43.080> don't<00:05:43.320> really<00:05:43.440> know<00:05:43.650> why<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:44.730> would

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
economy I don't really know why it would

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.760 
economy I don't really know why it would
or<00:05:45.150> anything<00:05:45.420> like<00:05:45.450> that<00:05:45.600> but<00:05:45.990> that<00:05:46.470> is<00:05:46.650> an

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
or anything like that but that is an

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.950 
or anything like that but that is an
option<00:05:46.920> so<00:05:47.550> if<00:05:47.880> you<00:05:48.090> do<00:05:48.270> have<00:05:48.300> a<00:05:48.450> really<00:05:48.720> shitty

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
option so if you do have a really shitty

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.200 
option so if you do have a really shitty
skinny<00:05:49.320> economy<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.370> definitely<00:05:50.580> might<00:05:50.970> want

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
skinny economy you definitely might want

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.020 
skinny economy you definitely might want
to<00:05:51.420> go<00:05:52.230> ahead<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:52.710> try<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.010> I<00:05:53.340> guess<00:05:53.580> like<00:05:53.760> use

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
to go ahead and try and I guess like use

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.650 
to go ahead and try and I guess like use
this<00:05:55.460> strategy<00:05:56.460> I<00:05:56.910> guess<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.210> can<00:05:57.330> say<00:05:57.480> your

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
this strategy I guess you can say your

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.260 
this strategy I guess you can say your
farming<00:05:58.050> method<00:05:58.380> whatever<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:59.090> that's<00:06:00.090> the

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
farming method whatever and that's the

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.330 
farming method whatever and that's the
amount<00:06:00.450> of<00:06:00.630> a<00:06:00.840> leather<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.230> got<00:06:01.560> so<00:06:01.950> i<00:06:01.980> think

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
amount of a leather I got so i think

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.950 
amount of a leather I got so i think
i'll<00:06:02.580> probably<00:06:02.760> end<00:06:02.880> up<00:06:03.030> with<00:06:03.180> our<00:06:03.360> that<00:06:03.750> much

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
i'll probably end up with our that much

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.260 
i'll probably end up with our that much
plus<00:06:04.200> another<00:06:04.500> stack<00:06:04.920> and<00:06:05.220> so<00:06:06.620> about<00:06:08.060> 240<00:06:09.060> and

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
plus another stack and so about 240 and

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.140 
plus another stack and so about 240 and
that<00:06:10.110> took<00:06:10.290> me<00:06:10.500> about<00:06:10.740> I'm<00:06:11.550> just<00:06:11.850> trying<00:06:12.090> to

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
that took me about I'm just trying to

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.570 
that took me about I'm just trying to
think<00:06:12.950> Shh<00:06:14.660> like<00:06:15.660> 15<00:06:16.470> minutes<00:06:16.740> probably<00:06:17.100> and

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
think Shh like 15 minutes probably and

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.720 
think Shh like 15 minutes probably and
so<00:06:18.180> it's<00:06:18.540> very<00:06:18.810> easy<00:06:18.960> to<00:06:19.290> farm<00:06:19.650> leather<00:06:20.370> for

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
so it's very easy to farm leather for

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.460 
so it's very easy to farm leather for
leveling<00:06:21.450> up<00:06:21.570> leather<00:06:21.780> working<00:06:22.140> this<00:06:22.290> way

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
leveling up leather working this way

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.990 
leveling up leather working this way
especially<00:06:23.130> if<00:06:23.430> you<00:06:23.520> don't<00:06:23.670> want<00:06:23.790> to<00:06:23.850> buy<00:06:23.970> it

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
especially if you don't want to buy it

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.870 
especially if you don't want to buy it
or<00:06:24.420> as<00:06:24.870> I<00:06:24.990> said<00:06:25.170> before<00:06:25.200> if<00:06:25.890> buying<00:06:26.280> it<00:06:26.550> is<00:06:26.670> not

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
or as I said before if buying it is not

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.540 
or as I said before if buying it is not
an<00:06:27.060> option<00:06:27.450> and<00:06:27.660> so<00:06:28.110> again<00:06:28.260> the<00:06:28.740> top<00:06:29.010> two<00:06:29.220> items

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
an option and so again the top two items

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.590 
an option and so again the top two items
that<00:06:29.640> you're<00:06:29.790> going<00:06:29.940> to<00:06:30.000> get<00:06:30.180> here<00:06:30.390> or

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
that you're going to get here or

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.270 
that you're going to get here or
obviously<00:06:31.170> boring<00:06:31.560> leather<00:06:31.770> which<00:06:32.010> is<00:06:32.130> what

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
obviously boring leather which is what
