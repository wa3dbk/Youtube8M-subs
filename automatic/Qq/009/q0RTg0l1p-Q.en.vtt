00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.440 
with sex so that's one issue the other
really<00:02:23.860> important<00:02:24.430> thing<00:02:24.640> here<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.060> it's

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
really important thing here is that it's

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.100 
really important thing here is that it's
the<00:02:25.990> patient's<00:02:26.830> comfort<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.670> very<00:02:28.209> important

the patient's comfort is very important

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.140 
the patient's comfort is very important
so<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.980> not<00:02:30.160> right<00:02:30.550> or<00:02:30.700> wrong<00:02:30.730> whether

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.640 
so it's not right or wrong whether
you're<00:02:31.360> comfortable<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:31.959> uncomfortable<00:02:31.990> it's

you're comfortable or uncomfortable it's

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you're comfortable or uncomfortable it's

how you feel with your under percent

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.070 
how you feel with your under percent
true<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.940> think<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.780> true

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
true and I think that is so true

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.870
