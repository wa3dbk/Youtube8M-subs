55-gallon drum 200 liter drum I chopped

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.669 
55-gallon drum 200 liter drum I chopped
a<00:00:10.080> big<00:00:10.260> section<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> top<00:00:11.280> out<00:00:11.429> and

a big section of the top out and

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.289 
a big section of the top out and
reinforced<00:00:13.679> at<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.009> Analia<00:00:14.400> mini<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.730> that

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
reinforced at this Analia mini and that

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.420 
reinforced at this Analia mini and that
I<00:00:15.420> pulled<00:00:15.719> off<00:00:15.870> some<00:00:16.260> office<00:00:16.560> furniture<00:00:16.890> that

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
I pulled off some office furniture that

I pulled off some office furniture that
we<00:00:17.690> pulled<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.810> pieces<00:00:20.150> just<00:00:21.150> beat<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
we pulled to pieces just beat that

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630 
we pulled to pieces just beat that
around<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.289> they<00:00:22.619> could<00:00:22.830> form<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.220> shape<00:00:23.430> around

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640

inside we have a base that's made out of
the<00:00:54.870> top<00:00:55.110> part<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:55.980> wet<00:00:56.520> cloth<00:00:56.789> and

the top part of it is just wet cloth and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.110 
the top part of it is just wet cloth and
that<00:00:58.350> stopped<00:00:58.680> any<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> castings<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that stopped any of the castings and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.869 
that stopped any of the castings and
food<00:01:00.329> falling<00:01:00.809> through<00:01:01.430> just<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.579> wire<00:01:02.789> mesh

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
food falling through just some wire mesh

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.320 
food falling through just some wire mesh
support<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> weight<00:01:04.140> cross<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.920> better

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
support the weight cross a bit better

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.179 
support the weight cross a bit better
and<00:01:06.330> some<00:01:06.750> old<00:01:06.930> oven<00:01:07.350> racks<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:08.070> were

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and some old oven racks they were

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.950 
and some old oven racks they were
stainless<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.939> figured<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.840> all

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
stainless so we figured they do all

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
stainless so we figured they do all
right<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> last<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> did

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
right in there that last so all I did

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.020 
right in there that last so all I did
was<00:01:12.270> drill<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> few<00:01:12.689> holes<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.369> put

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
was drill a few holes in here and put

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.390 
was drill a few holes in here and put
some<00:01:15.210> zip<00:01:15.240> ties<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:18.330> keep<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.400> castings

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
some zip ties in to keep the castings

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.830 
some zip ties in to keep the castings
and<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> food<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> worms<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and the food and the worms out of a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.399 
and the food and the worms out of a
liquid<00:01:22.280> place<00:01:23.299> down<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> bottom<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.020> just

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
liquid place down in the bottom I just

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.499 
liquid place down in the bottom I just
had<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> grommet<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> 13<00:01:26.670> millimeter<00:01:26.880> arm

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
had a grommet with a 13 millimeter arm

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.700 
had a grommet with a 13 millimeter arm
or<00:01:28.259> about<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> half-inch<00:01:29.780> irrigation<00:01:30.810> tap<00:01:33.710> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
or about a half-inch irrigation tap that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
or about a half-inch irrigation tap that
I<00:01:34.829> just<00:01:35.040> turned<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.150> collect<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
I just turned on and off to collect the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.289 
I just turned on and off to collect the
liquid<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.130> we've<00:01:38.280> after<00:01:38.790> doing<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
liquid now that we've after doing the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.300 
liquid now that we've after doing the
bins<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> drums<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.980 
bins and the drums and that with the
worms<00:01:41.520> around<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.000> place<00:01:42.180> I've<00:01:42.689> pretty<00:01:42.899> much

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
worms around the place I've pretty much

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.569 
worms around the place I've pretty much
will<00:01:43.259> come<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> conclusion<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.340> we

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
will come to the conclusion that we

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.819 
will come to the conclusion that we
don't<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> fancy<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.799> I

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
don't need to get all that fancy what I

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.770 
don't need to get all that fancy what I
plan<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.130> doing<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.640> dumping<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> horse<00:01:48.450> the

like<00:02:08.380> such<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:09.340> won't<00:02:09.580> actually<00:02:09.729> be<00:02:09.970> attached

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
like such it won't actually be attached

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.570 
like such it won't actually be attached
to<00:02:10.539> anything<00:02:10.780> I'll<00:02:11.140> just<00:02:11.170> be<00:02:11.500> relying<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
to anything I'll just be relying on the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.810 
to anything I'll just be relying on the
weight<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.090> manure<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.990> keep<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.320> down<00:02:14.820> if

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
weight of the manure to keep it down if

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.280 
weight of the manure to keep it down if
I<00:02:15.970> drill<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.210> hole<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.720> bottom<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.170> attach

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
I drill a hole in the bottom to attach

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.870 
I drill a hole in the bottom to attach
it<00:02:17.650> all<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> liquids<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.520> going<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> fall

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
it all the liquids just going to fall

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.600 
it all the liquids just going to fall
down<00:02:18.910> through<00:02:19.270> there<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.220> pretty<00:02:21.220> much<00:02:21.400> we'll

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
down through there so pretty much we'll

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.920 
down through there so pretty much we'll
just<00:02:21.790> leave<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.090> there<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.330> don't<00:02:22.570> think<00:02:22.780> any

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
just leave that there I don't think any

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.050 
just leave that there I don't think any
worms<00:02:23.170> will<00:02:23.380> escape<00:02:23.709> but<00:02:24.100> if<00:02:24.490> there<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.030> a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
worms will escape but if there is a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.360 
worms will escape but if there is a
problem<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.840> should<00:02:25.870> be<00:02:26.170> enough<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.410> release

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
problem it should be enough to release

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.910 
problem it should be enough to release
the<00:02:27.580> any<00:02:27.700> excess<00:02:28.240> fluid<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.500> that's<00:02:29.680> pretty

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
the any excess fluid so that's pretty

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.440 
the any excess fluid so that's pretty
much<00:02:30.100> all<00:02:30.280> I'm<00:02:30.580> going<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.880> be<00:02:30.940> doing<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.300> this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
much all I'm going to be doing with this

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.650 
much all I'm going to be doing with this
one<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:32.700> don't<00:02:33.700> see<00:02:33.850> much<00:02:33.970> point<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.540> getting

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
one I don't see much point in getting

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.920 
one I don't see much point in getting
too<00:02:34.959> complicated<00:02:35.350> anymore<00:02:36.540> just<00:02:37.540> throw<00:02:37.750> them

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
too complicated anymore just throw them

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.100 
too complicated anymore just throw them
in<00:02:37.990> your<00:02:38.140> in<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.530> see<00:02:38.650> how<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:38.860> go<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.690> just

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
in your in and see how we go so I just

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.760 
in your in and see how we go so I just
saw<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.260> give<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.590> look<00:02:41.770> at<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.010> whole<00:02:42.160> thing

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
saw I give you a look at the whole thing

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.229 
saw I give you a look at the whole thing
bit<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:44.890> overkill<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.340> know<00:02:45.580> but<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:45.910> was<00:02:46.030> fun<00:02:46.209> to

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
bit of overkill I know but it was fun to

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.040 
bit of overkill I know but it was fun to
build<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:48.520> that's<00:02:49.300> going<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.510> set<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.840> back

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
build so that's going to set this back

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.580 
build so that's going to set this back
up<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.440> put<00:02:50.739> it<00:02:50.830> back<00:02:50.950> where<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.220> came<00:02:51.430> from

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
up and put it back where it came from

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.960 
up and put it back where it came from
show<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.770> worms<00:02:54.010> being<00:02:54.340> released

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
show you the worms being released

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.440 
show you the worms being released
it's<00:02:55.780> always<00:02:55.930> fun<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:56.770> so<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.910> will<00:02:58.360> have

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
it's always fun I think so I will have

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.800 
it's always fun I think so I will have
set<00:02:58.660> up<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.930> had<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.860> bit<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.130> clean-out<00:03:00.370> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
set up the had a bit of a clean-out and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.330 
set up the had a bit of a clean-out and
set<00:03:01.810> up<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.080> other<00:03:02.230> wound<00:03:02.440> farms<00:03:02.950> down<00:03:03.160> here

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
set up the other wound farms down here

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.150 
set up the other wound farms down here
the<00:03:03.550> barrels<00:03:04.110> those<00:03:05.110> two<00:03:05.350> barrels<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.860> room

for another one at the end there and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.840 
for another one at the end there and
this<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.220> other<00:03:09.340> farm

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
this is the other farm

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.390 
this is the other farm
I<00:03:09.940> put<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.270> legs<00:03:10.480> back<00:03:10.690> on<00:03:10.930> after<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.620> modified

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
I put the legs back on after I modified

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.310 
I put the legs back on after I modified
it<00:03:12.430> just<00:03:12.820> by<00:03:13.000> zipping<00:03:13.360> it<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.690> wiring<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
it just by zipping it and wiring the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.039 
it just by zipping it and wiring the
legs<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:14.739> very<00:03:15.580> flimsy<00:03:15.850> design<00:03:16.360> with<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.720> legs

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
legs on very flimsy design with the legs

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.870 
legs on very flimsy design with the legs
-<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.799> amount<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.100> weight<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.280> we<00:03:18.519> put<00:03:18.760> in

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
- the amount of weight that we put in

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.070 
- the amount of weight that we put in
them<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.269> anyway<00:03:19.480> that's<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.650> nice<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.640> sturdy

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080

my thinking with these guys is I have

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.420 
my thinking with these guys is I have
one<00:05:23.050> tray<00:05:23.289> down<00:05:23.440> there<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.919> bottom<00:05:24.099> tray

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
one tray down there the bottom tray

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.249 
one tray down there the bottom tray
needs<00:05:24.639> to<00:05:24.759> be<00:05:24.879> harvested<00:05:25.360> out<00:05:25.449> of<00:05:25.659> that<00:05:25.810> once<00:05:26.110> I

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
needs to be harvested out of that once I

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.230 
needs to be harvested out of that once I
fill<00:05:26.710> it<00:05:26.830> up<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:27.039> little<00:05:27.159> bit<00:05:27.310> more<00:05:27.550> and<00:05:27.699> all<00:05:28.000> the

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
fill it up a little bit more and all the

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.579 
fill it up a little bit more and all the
worms<00:05:28.389> mover<00:05:28.949> most<00:05:29.949> about<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.699> it'll<00:05:30.909> be<00:05:31.589> three

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:32.589 
worms mover most about so it'll be three

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.070 
worms mover most about so it'll be three
two<00:05:32.949> to<00:05:33.099> three<00:05:33.310> tiers<00:05:33.580> of<00:05:33.729> this<00:05:33.909> farm<00:05:34.210> those

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
two to three tiers of this farm those

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.550 
two to three tiers of this farm those
two<00:05:35.349> barrels<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:36.009> this<00:05:36.339> barrel<00:05:36.750> will<00:05:37.750> be

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
two barrels and this barrel will be

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.279 
two barrels and this barrel will be
eaten<00:05:38.889> over<00:05:39.250> summer<00:05:39.639> and<00:05:39.909> come<00:05:40.629> autumn<00:05:41.110> which

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
eaten over summer and come autumn which

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.619 
eaten over summer and come autumn which
is<00:05:41.440> a<00:05:41.469> one<00:05:42.339> of<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.550> peak<00:05:42.759> growing<00:05:43.089> times<00:05:43.360> for

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
is a one of the peak growing times for

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:47.279 
is a one of the peak growing times for
us<00:05:43.750> we'll<00:05:44.669> harvest<00:05:45.669> them<00:05:46.029> now<00:05:46.569> that<00:05:46.599> I<00:05:46.900> think

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
us we'll harvest them now that I think

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.600 
us we'll harvest them now that I think
I've<00:05:47.409> got<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.710> harvesting<00:05:48.189> sussed<00:05:48.460> out

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
I've got the harvesting sussed out

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.719 
I've got the harvesting sussed out
pretty<00:05:48.849> well<00:05:48.939> I'll<00:05:49.719> harvest<00:05:50.110> these<00:05:50.469> guys<00:05:51.219> and

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
pretty well I'll harvest these guys and

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.790 
pretty well I'll harvest these guys and
then<00:05:52.169> start<00:05:53.169> all<00:05:53.289> over<00:05:53.319> again

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
then start all over again

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.339 
then start all over again
