00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
for each one of these boxes and then I

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.869 
for each one of these boxes and then I
can<00:03:43.199> go<00:03:43.319> back<00:03:43.349> to<00:03:43.709> normal<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.669> kind<00:03:44.849> of

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
can go back to normal so that kind of

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.149 
can go back to normal so that kind of
sets<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.239> stage<00:03:45.540> for<00:03:45.599> this<00:03:45.959> but<00:03:46.500> now<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.829> need

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
sets the stage for this but now you need

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.369 
sets the stage for this but now you need
to<00:03:47.280> create<00:03:47.579> these<00:03:47.729> sort<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.060> zones<00:03:48.509> where<00:03:49.259> the

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
to create these sort of zones where the

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.800 
to create these sort of zones where the
computer<00:03:49.769> will<00:03:49.919> understand<00:03:50.489> when<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.449> state

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
computer will understand when that state

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.509 
computer will understand when that state
becomes<00:03:52.169> active<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.889> then<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.370> need<00:03:53.489> to

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
becomes active and then you need to

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.909 
becomes active and then you need to
hyperlink<00:03:54.120> these<00:03:54.389> to<00:03:54.659> those<00:03:54.810> zones<00:03:55.169> so<00:03:55.799> the

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
hyperlink these to those zones so the

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.610 
hyperlink these to those zones so the
way<00:03:56.009> you<00:03:56.069> do<00:03:56.220> that<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.459> by<00:03:56.609> creating<00:03:56.639> anchors

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
way you do that is by creating anchors

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.719 
way you do that is by creating anchors
you<00:03:58.620> can<00:03:58.739> see<00:03:58.889> here<00:03:59.069> I've<00:03:59.189> got<00:03:59.220> this<00:03:59.459> music

they<00:05:06.840> stay<00:05:07.140> at<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.380> top<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:08.070> they're<00:05:08.340> not

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
they stay at the top it they're not

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.950 
they stay at the top it they're not
going<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.640> scroll<00:05:08.970> away<00:05:09.150> because<00:05:09.600> then<00:05:09.810> we

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
going to scroll away because then we

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.480 
going to scroll away because then we
wouldn't<00:05:10.140> even<00:05:10.290> see<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.740> effect<00:05:11.100> happening

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
wouldn't even see this effect happening

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.610 
wouldn't even see this effect happening
so<00:05:12.420> if<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:12.630> guys<00:05:12.750> have<00:05:12.960> not<00:05:13.080> pinned<00:05:13.440> this

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
so if you guys have not pinned this

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.960 
so if you guys have not pinned this
stuff<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.070> top<00:05:14.220> of<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.400> browser<00:05:14.550> yet

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
stuff to the top of the browser yet

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.720 
stuff to the top of the browser yet
definitely<00:05:15.780> go<00:05:16.230> ahead<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.710> do<00:05:17.100> that<00:05:17.310> because

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
definitely go ahead and do that because

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.550 
definitely go ahead and do that because
without<00:05:18.000> a<00:05:18.150> pinned<00:05:18.450> it'll<00:05:18.690> it'll<00:05:18.990> just<00:05:19.200> not<00:05:19.350> be

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
without a pinned it'll it'll just not be

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.350 
without a pinned it'll it'll just not be
on<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.800> screen<00:05:20.130> and<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.910> won't<00:05:21.090> be<00:05:21.180> able<00:05:21.300> to

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
on the screen and you won't be able to

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.660 
on the screen and you won't be able to
see<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.690> effect<00:05:21.930> of<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.430> so<00:05:23.430> with<00:05:23.550> these

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
see the effect of this so with these

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.730 
see the effect of this so with these
objects<00:05:24.060> pinned<00:05:24.270> at<00:05:24.420> the<00:05:24.480> top<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:24.930> am<00:05:25.290> taking<00:05:25.650> up

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
objects pinned at the top I am taking up

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.890 
objects pinned at the top I am taking up
some<00:05:26.010> space<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:26.970> need<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.210> compensate<00:05:27.750> for

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
some space and I need to compensate for

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.140 
some space and I need to compensate for
that<00:05:28.050> space<00:05:28.380> by<00:05:28.860> scooting<00:05:29.340> these<00:05:29.460> anchors<00:05:29.940> up

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
that space by scooting these anchors up

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.120 
that space by scooting these anchors up
so<00:05:30.750> just<00:05:31.200> place<00:05:31.410> your<00:05:31.440> anchors<00:05:31.860> a<00:05:31.890> little

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
so just place your anchors a little

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.950 
so just place your anchors a little
higher<00:05:32.340> than<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.330> would<00:05:33.450> think<00:05:33.480> they<00:05:33.780> need<00:05:33.930> to

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
higher than you would think they need to

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.630 
higher than you would think they need to
be<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.290> you'll<00:05:34.380> probably<00:05:34.590> be<00:05:34.920> just<00:05:35.220> fine

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
be and you'll probably be just fine

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.640 
be and you'll probably be just fine
it<00:05:35.940> might<00:05:36.090> take<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.300> little<00:05:36.390> fine-tuning<00:05:36.660> so

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
it might take a little fine-tuning so

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.440 
it might take a little fine-tuning so
now<00:05:38.160> I'm<00:05:38.340> gonna<00:05:38.490> go<00:05:38.730> and<00:05:38.910> I'm<00:05:39.030> gonna<00:05:39.120> click<00:05:39.330> on

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
now I'm gonna go and I'm gonna click on

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.300 
now I'm gonna go and I'm gonna click on
music<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.140> I'm<00:05:40.560> going<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:40.890> choose<00:05:41.130> to

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
music and I'm going to choose to

hyperlink<00:05:41.820> that<00:05:42.090> to<00:05:42.720> my<00:05:43.020> anchor<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:43.980> I've<00:05:44.700> got

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
hyperlink that to my anchor so I've got

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.370 
hyperlink that to my anchor so I've got
to<00:05:45.090> make<00:05:45.150> sure<00:05:45.330> I'm<00:05:45.480> choosing<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:45.990> right<00:05:46.140> page

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
to make sure I'm choosing the right page

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.840 
to make sure I'm choosing the right page
because<00:05:46.680> you<00:05:46.770> can<00:05:46.920> actually<00:05:47.070> hyperlink<00:05:47.670> to<00:05:47.760> an

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
because you can actually hyperlink to an

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.970 
because you can actually hyperlink to an
anchor<00:05:48.060> on<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.210> different<00:05:48.510> page<00:05:48.690> so<00:05:49.380> this<00:05:49.770> is

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
anchor on a different page so this is

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.030 
anchor on a different page so this is
called<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.730> anchor<00:05:51.210> active<00:05:51.690> States<00:05:52.020> page<00:05:52.680> of

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.110 
anchors then come up to your manual
navigation<00:06:10.380> bar<00:06:10.560> here<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:10.980> a<00:06:11.040> hyperlink<00:06:11.880> each

one<00:06:12.450> of<00:06:12.570> these<00:06:12.660> boxes<00:06:13.290> so<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:14.460> first<00:06:14.730> thing<00:06:14.910> we

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
one of these boxes so the first thing we

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.790 
one of these boxes so the first thing we
did<00:06:15.150> we<00:06:15.330> created<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.750> active<00:06:16.170> States<00:06:16.530> for

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
did we created the active States for

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.310 
did we created the active States for
each<00:06:16.920> one<00:06:17.190> so<00:06:17.670> the<00:06:17.820> stage<00:06:18.060> has<00:06:18.270> been<00:06:18.300> set<00:06:18.480> then

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
each one so the stage has been set then

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.590 
each one so the stage has been set then
we<00:06:19.350> created<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:19.980> anchors<00:06:20.370> to<00:06:20.580> establish<00:06:21.120> when

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
we created the anchors to establish when

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.510 
we created the anchors to establish when
these<00:06:21.960> colors<00:06:22.440> will<00:06:22.650> change<00:06:22.860> when<00:06:23.250> they<00:06:23.400> will

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
these colors will change when they will

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.940 
these colors will change when they will
become<00:06:23.670> active<00:06:24.240> and<00:06:24.450> then<00:06:24.960> by<00:06:25.170> hyperlinking

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
become active and then by hyperlinking

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.010 
become active and then by hyperlinking
them<00:06:26.130> we've<00:06:26.580> made<00:06:26.820> the<00:06:26.970> connection<00:06:27.480> between

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
them we've made the connection between

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.530 
them we've made the connection between
the<00:06:28.440> button<00:06:28.770> and<00:06:28.950> the<00:06:29.730> position<00:06:30.150> on<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.300> page

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
the button and the position on the page

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.910 
the button and the position on the page
where<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.110> button<00:06:31.380> is<00:06:31.470> going<00:06:31.620> to<00:06:31.680> become

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
where the button is going to become

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.800 
where the button is going to become
active<00:06:32.310> so<00:06:32.760> now<00:06:32.850> if<00:06:32.970> we<00:06:33.000> preview<00:06:33.480> it

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
active so now if we preview it

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.800 
active so now if we preview it
I<00:06:34.280> put<00:06:35.280> music<00:06:35.610> at<00:06:35.730> the<00:06:35.790> very<00:06:35.940> top<00:06:36.150> so<00:06:36.210> music<00:06:36.690> is

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
I put music at the very top so music is

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.050 
I put music at the very top so music is
already<00:06:37.140> active<00:06:37.620> but<00:06:38.130> as<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.370> scroll<00:06:38.730> will

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
already active but as I scroll will

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.850 
already active but as I scroll will
reach<00:06:39.300> that<00:06:39.330> invisible

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
reach that invisible
