00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.889
 Welcome to the tv my name 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.889
 is markus seegert i want you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.809
 Today a set consisting of mask and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.910
 Introducing snorkels for freedivers 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.950
 and you will notice them immediately 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 that the mask in this case is that 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.230
 the judith is very much smaller 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.259
 as a normal woman and snorkeling 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.960
 mask due to the mask lies 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.730
 quite close to the eye and the inside 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.219
 volume is reduced so you can too 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 the pressure equalization in the mask how much 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.750
 perform easier than one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.440
 big conventional mask 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 class teachers is also one 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.140
 child's play 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.179
 a slight puff of air is complete 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.769
 sufficient mass can train 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.530
 be adjusted on both sides 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.909
 Here you can see the beautiful new 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.690
 Shots of Mars come by themselves 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:57.059
 really a really great story 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.309
 so that title tubing insists that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 an ergonomically shaped 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.780
 plastic pipe at the end of a 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.090
 black silicone mouthpiece is and also 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.010
 here again something special has no 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.640
 exhaust valves the clip here to the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.080
 attachment of the snowfall to the mask 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.300
 set is underwater by freediving 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.550
 rugby players used but finds 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.350
 due to its small dimensions also at 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.920
 a lot of holiday germany many 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.020
 friends 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.450
 I would be glad if ours 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.510
 liked small product presentation 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.340
 and recommend us and now 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.800
 Let's test this add directly in the water 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.800
 until next time your markus sings 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.000
 learn the free diving and with it 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.680
 welcome to darmstadt ev 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.570
 this beautiful set I put him in a 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.180
 past already presented with 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.820
 the mask judith today comes the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.830
 matching fin to the Italian 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.550
 specialist for friday equipment sack 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.040
 has developed two new fins to 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.250
 one for inexperienced or less well 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.250
 trained freediver who looks it 900 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.080
 with a medium hard leaf for the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.530
 trained freediver among them gives 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.000
 it looks classically 1000 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.220
 with a hard leaf 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.100
 The foot part of both fins is made of one 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.590
 sturdy thermoplastic it offers a 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.130
 very firm and good stop is but 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.860
 nevertheless very comfortable 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.450
 the lateral ones have imposed the same 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.270
 two tasks to the 1 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.790
 connect the football with the fin 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.220
 and on the other hand they prevent in the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.830
 use too much of the vibrate 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.930
 leaf that means the fin remains 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.090
 really nice in the line at the 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.220
 apparently the downward movement and now 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.180
 enough we tested the fin 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.239
 directly in use in the water until the same 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.340
 so here it is very 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.920
 flattered with that it looks 900 and 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.340
 mask judith and the snorkel title 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.980
 is now subjected to the practical test and 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.820
 we want to see what the set is 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.820
 actually stops 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:32.520
 very short info shoe size 44 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:36.950
 and the fins have the size 43 44 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.950
 fits perfectly without neoprene care 

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:09.349
 so tests complete and you have to 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.050
 quite clearly say the fin offers one 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.119
 really very good propulsion one 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.289
 needs relatively little power around this 

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:19.430
 good propulsion to achieve 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.800
 the football offers a very great 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.389
 good stop 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.229
 really great all around 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.770
 history 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:30.229
 the mask judith very small volume 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.169
 fits in front of everything was really good 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:38.419
 absolutely tight and they saw that 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:41.149
 under water while blowing out the mask 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.999
 was only a very short time 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:46.669
 Puff needed would be me 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.899
 happy if they liked it and 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.399
 I wish you a wonderful one 

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:52.240
 day until next time 

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:52.240
