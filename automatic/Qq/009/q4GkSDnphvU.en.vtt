00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.760 

everyone<00:00:47.240> is<00:00:47.510> James<00:00:47.810> from<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.170> fit<00:00:48.320> RV<00:00:48.590> and

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
everyone is James from the fit RV and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.050 
everyone is James from the fit RV and
I've<00:00:48.920> got<00:00:49.100> one<00:00:49.280> today<00:00:49.490> that<00:00:49.520> I<00:00:49.730> think<00:00:49.970> you're

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060

gonna<00:00:50.150> like

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
gonna like

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.180 
gonna like
now<00:00:51.080> we've<00:00:51.230> probably<00:00:51.380> all<00:00:51.620> heard<00:00:51.740> that<00:00:51.830> advice

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
now we've probably all heard that advice

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.040 
now we've probably all heard that advice
at<00:00:52.400> one<00:00:52.550> time<00:00:52.760> or<00:00:52.910> another<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.330> put<00:00:53.540> ice<00:00:53.720> cubes

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
at one time or another to put ice cubes

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.500 
at one time or another to put ice cubes
into<00:00:54.410> your<00:00:54.500> black<00:00:54.680> tank<00:00:54.950> to<00:00:55.160> scrub<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.850> out<00:00:55.970> but

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
into your black tank to scrub it out but

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.960 
into your black tank to scrub it out but
does<00:00:56.630> that<00:00:56.660> really<00:00:56.930> work<00:00:57.680> well<00:00:58.370> I<00:00:58.520> had<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.850> know

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
does that really work well I had to know

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.430 
does that really work well I had to know
so<00:00:59.420> here's<00:00:59.840> what<00:00:59.990> I<00:01:00.020> did

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
so here's what I did

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.620 
so here's what I did
I<00:01:00.470> wanted<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.130> simulate<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.880> worst<00:01:02.270> possible

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
I wanted to simulate the worst possible

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.000 
I wanted to simulate the worst possible
thing<00:01:02.900> I<00:01:03.230> thought<00:01:03.380> you<00:01:03.440> could<00:01:03.680> do<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.890> your

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
thing I thought you could do to your

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.410 
thing I thought you could do to your
black<00:01:04.160> tank<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:04.640> would<00:01:04.820> be<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.059> use<00:01:05.210> it

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
black tank and that would be to use it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.420 
black tank and that would be to use it
with<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.690> dump<00:01:05.930> valve<00:01:05.990> open<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.040> what<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.310> did

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
with the dump valve open so what I did

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.130 
with the dump valve open so what I did
is<00:01:07.790> I<00:01:07.970> took<00:01:08.030> one<00:01:08.300> of<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.450> recipes<00:01:08.840> for

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
is I took one of the recipes for

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.170 
is I took one of the recipes for
simulated<00:01:10.040> waste<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.550> bought<00:01:10.760> from<00:01:10.910> NASA

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
simulated waste that I bought from NASA

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.600 
simulated waste that I bought from NASA
and<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:11.960> mixed<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:12.350> up<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.680> I<00:01:12.740> just<00:01:12.950> drop<00:01:13.400> it

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
and I mixed it up and I just drop it

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.980 
and I mixed it up and I just drop it
right<00:01:13.640> into<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.060> tank<00:01:14.270> with<00:01:14.510> some<00:01:14.630> toilet

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
right into the tank with some toilet

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.470 
right into the tank with some toilet
paper<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.500> then<00:01:16.100> just<00:01:16.400> for<00:01:16.610> added<00:01:16.910> effect<00:01:17.330> I

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
paper and then just for added effect I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.690 
paper and then just for added effect I
smeared<00:01:17.990> some<00:01:18.050> around<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.680> sides<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.490> did

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
smeared some around the sides and I did

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.640 
smeared some around the sides and I did
some<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:19.880> my<00:01:20.090> best<00:01:20.300> highschool<00:01:20.630> toilet<00:01:21.440> paper

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
some of my best highschool toilet paper

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.790 
some of my best highschool toilet paper
wads<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.280> stuck<00:01:22.520> them<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.880> there<00:01:23.060> too<00:01:23.300> so<00:01:23.800> then

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
wads and stuck them in there too so then

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.620 
wads and stuck them in there too so then
I<00:01:24.830> took<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.369> whole<00:01:25.580> thing<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:25.970> set<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.510> out

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
I took that whole thing and set it out

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.300 
I took that whole thing and set it out
in<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.960> hot<00:01:27.110> Sun<00:01:27.140> on<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.770> piece<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.130> black

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
in the hot Sun on a piece of black

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.420 
in the hot Sun on a piece of black
fabric<00:01:28.640> for<00:01:29.090> two<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.630> half<00:01:29.660> hours<00:01:30.430> while

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
fabric for two and a half hours while

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.030 
fabric for two and a half hours while
that<00:01:31.640> was<00:01:31.790> going<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.510> built<00:01:33.080> this<00:01:33.680> test

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
that was going on I built this test

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.620 
that was going on I built this test
harness<00:01:34.400> in<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.640> back<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.119> truck<00:01:35.330> so<00:01:35.510> let

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
harness in the back of the truck so let

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.630 
harness in the back of the truck so let
me<00:01:35.690> show<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.900> that<00:01:36.110> basically<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:37.160> just<00:01:37.190> holds

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
me show you that basically it just holds

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.670 
me show you that basically it just holds
the<00:01:37.729> tank<00:01:37.940> still<00:01:38.270> while<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:38.720> go<00:01:39.020> driving<00:01:39.320> about

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
the tank still while I go driving about

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.520 
the tank still while I go driving about
I<00:01:39.979> also<00:01:40.550> set<00:01:40.940> up<00:01:40.970> not<00:01:41.300> just<00:01:41.570> one<00:01:41.869> but<00:01:42.470> two

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
I also set up not just one but two

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.040 
I also set up not just one but two
cameras<00:01:43.430> so<00:01:43.940> we<00:01:44.210> can<00:01:44.360> see<00:01:44.450> exactly<00:01:44.780> what's

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
cameras so we can see exactly what's

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.140 
cameras so we can see exactly what's
going<00:01:45.229> on<00:01:45.440> when<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.830> ice<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:45.979> in<00:01:46.369> here<00:01:46.610> and

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
going on when the ice is in here and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.880 
going on when the ice is in here and
that's<00:01:47.330> about<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.020> test<00:01:48.229> rig<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:48.710> now

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
that's about it for the test rig so now

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.859 
that's about it for the test rig so now
since<00:01:49.220> I'm<00:01:49.400> not<00:01:49.580> allowed<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:50.030> use<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.660> ice

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
since I'm not allowed to use the ice

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.719 
since I'm not allowed to use the ice
from<00:01:51.259> in<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.560> kitchen<00:01:51.979> we're<00:01:52.399> gonna<00:01:52.490> go<00:01:52.670> to

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729

from in the kitchen we're gonna go to
Dan's<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.270> pick<00:01:53.390> up<00:01:53.539> some<00:01:53.750> ice

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:04:10.190

inside the tank first thing to notice is
that<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.270> only<00:04:25.479> stuff<00:04:25.750> that's<00:04:25.930> been<00:04:26.139> knocked

that the only stuff that's been knocked
off<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.740> sides<00:04:26.979> is<00:04:27.280> just<00:04:27.850> where<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.150> ice<00:04:28.509> and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
off the sides is just where the ice and

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.450 
off the sides is just where the ice and
water<00:04:28.840> got<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.320> obviously<00:04:29.860> didn't<00:04:30.160> get<00:04:30.220> any

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
water got to obviously didn't get any

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.580 
water got to obviously didn't get any
higher<00:04:30.759> up<00:04:31.060> on<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.360> sides<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.199> tank<00:04:32.410> than

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
higher up on the sides of the tank than

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.499 
higher up on the sides of the tank than
where<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.860> ice<00:04:32.979> cut<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.970> next<00:04:34.210> thing<00:04:34.360> to

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
where the ice cut the next thing to

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.300 
where the ice cut the next thing to
notice<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.169> large<00:04:35.380> lump<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:36.039> stuff

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
notice is that the large lump of stuff

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.700 
notice is that the large lump of stuff
that<00:04:36.520> was<00:04:36.669> inside<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.090> tank<00:04:37.479> is<00:04:38.110> still<00:04:38.470> there

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
that was inside the tank is still there

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.230 
that was inside the tank is still there
it<00:04:39.009> didn't<00:04:39.310> go<00:04:39.490> away<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.729> ice<00:04:39.849> and<00:04:40.030> doubled

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
it didn't go away the ice and doubled

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.730 
it didn't go away the ice and doubled
away<00:04:40.360> at<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.570> edges<00:04:40.720> of<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.080> but<00:04:41.349> by<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.680> large

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
away at the edges of it but by and large

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.879 
away at the edges of it but by and large
it's<00:04:42.099> still<00:04:42.340> there<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:43.229> with<00:04:44.229> that<00:04:44.380> said<00:04:44.650> I'm

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
it's still there so with that said I'm

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.890 
it's still there so with that said I'm
gonna<00:04:45.610> fill<00:04:45.910> up<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.030> tank<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.389> let's<00:04:46.570> see

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
gonna fill up the tank and let's see

00:04:46.900 --> 00:05:09.600 
gonna fill up the tank and let's see
what<00:04:47.050> happens

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.010 

and<00:05:10.610> then<00:05:10.849> has<00:05:11.000> slowed<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.270> a<00:05:11.449> trickle<00:05:11.539> let's

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
and then has slowed to a trickle let's

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.760 
and then has slowed to a trickle let's
have<00:05:12.139> a<00:05:12.169> look<00:05:13.780> so<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:17.240> water<00:05:17.539> actually<00:05:18.259> did

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
have a look so the water actually did

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.050 
have a look so the water actually did
take<00:05:18.949> some<00:05:19.189> things<00:05:19.400> off<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.669> side<00:05:19.849> like<00:05:20.030> that

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
take some things off the side like that

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.610 
take some things off the side like that
giant<00:05:20.569> wad<00:05:20.780> of<00:05:20.990> toilet<00:05:21.199> paper<00:05:23.349> but<00:05:24.349> other<00:05:24.500> than

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
giant wad of toilet paper but other than

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.550 
giant wad of toilet paper but other than
that<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:25.039> looks<00:05:25.069> about<00:05:25.669> like<00:05:25.729> I<00:05:26.389> would<00:05:27.080> expect

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
that it looks about like I would expect

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.020 
that it looks about like I would expect
so<00:05:30.560> what<00:05:30.830> can<00:05:30.949> I<00:05:31.039> conclude<00:05:31.280> from<00:05:31.669> all<00:05:31.849> this

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
so what can I conclude from all this

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.179 
so what can I conclude from all this
nonsense<00:05:32.599> well<00:05:33.319> I<00:05:33.349> really<00:05:33.860> thought<00:05:34.009> I<00:05:34.039> was

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
nonsense well I really thought I was

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.040 
nonsense well I really thought I was
gonna<00:05:34.310> completely<00:05:34.879> disprove<00:05:35.629> the<00:05:35.870> whole

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
gonna completely disprove the whole

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.679 
gonna completely disprove the whole
scrubbing<00:05:36.860> ice-cubes<00:05:37.310> advice<00:05:37.909> but<00:05:38.479> as<00:05:38.599> you

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:38.689 
scrubbing ice-cubes advice but as you

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:40.360 
scrubbing ice-cubes advice but as you
saw<00:05:38.840> in<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:38.990> video<00:05:39.229> you<00:05:39.439> really<00:05:39.560> can<00:05:39.919> get<00:05:40.159> kind

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
saw in the video you really can get kind

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.070 
saw in the video you really can get kind
of<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.520> limited<00:05:40.969> tank<00:05:41.270> cleaning<00:05:41.539> action<00:05:41.960> by

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
of a limited tank cleaning action by

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.990 
of a limited tank cleaning action by
dumping<00:05:42.439> ice<00:05:42.560> down<00:05:42.800> there<00:05:42.860> but<00:05:43.849> this<00:05:43.939> is

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
dumping ice down there but this is

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.939 
dumping ice down there but this is
subject<00:05:44.419> to<00:05:44.449> a<00:05:44.509> few<00:05:44.750> caveats<00:05:44.960> and<00:05:45.500> the<00:05:45.650> first

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
subject to a few caveats and the first

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.309 
subject to a few caveats and the first
one<00:05:46.189> of<00:05:46.279> these<00:05:46.400> is<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:46.759> use<00:05:47.300> this<00:05:47.449> as<00:05:47.599> an<00:05:47.719> excuse

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
one of these is I use this as an excuse

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.499 
one of these is I use this as an excuse
to<00:05:48.349> drive<00:05:48.740> like<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.009> complete<00:05:49.550> lunatic

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
to drive like a complete lunatic

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.089 
to drive like a complete lunatic
I<00:05:50.539> really<00:05:51.139> am<00:05:51.229> surprised<00:05:51.590> I<00:05:51.740> didn't<00:05:51.979> get

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
I really am surprised I didn't get

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.029 
I really am surprised I didn't get
pulled<00:05:52.370> over<00:05:52.900> boy<00:05:53.900> you<00:05:54.050> didn't<00:05:54.500> see<00:05:54.650> is<00:05:54.860> the

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
pulled over boy you didn't see is the

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.369 
pulled over boy you didn't see is the
other<00:05:55.189> 58<00:05:55.849> minutes<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.389> video<00:05:56.509> with<00:05:57.169> the<00:05:57.259> ice

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379 
other 58 minutes of video with the ice

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.350 
other 58 minutes of video with the ice
cubes<00:05:57.740> just<00:05:57.830> basically<00:05:58.250> sitting<00:05:58.729> still<00:05:59.090> in

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
cubes just basically sitting still in

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.969 
cubes just basically sitting still in
the<00:05:59.449> tank<00:05:59.659> and<00:05:59.900> not<00:06:00.080> moving<00:06:00.439> even<00:06:00.710> on<00:06:00.830> some

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
the tank and not moving even on some

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.790 
the tank and not moving even on some
pretty<00:06:01.099> curvy<00:06:01.490> roads<00:06:02.020> so<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.139> first<00:06:03.349> caveat

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
pretty curvy roads so the first caveat

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.409 
pretty curvy roads so the first caveat
is<00:06:04.159> if<00:06:04.279> you<00:06:04.400> want<00:06:04.580> to<00:06:04.639> get<00:06:04.729> the<00:06:04.849> ice<00:06:04.939> to<00:06:05.150> climb

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
is if you want to get the ice to climb

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.300 
is if you want to get the ice to climb
the<00:06:05.569> walls<00:06:05.750> of<00:06:05.960> your<00:06:06.110> tank<00:06:06.319> you<00:06:06.830> need<00:06:06.979> to<00:06:07.069> drive

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
the walls of your tank you need to drive

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.339 
the walls of your tank you need to drive
like<00:06:07.520> a<00:06:07.550> jerk<00:06:07.909> maybe<00:06:08.659> you<00:06:08.750> need<00:06:08.870> to<00:06:08.990> ask<00:06:09.139> your

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
like a jerk maybe you need to ask your

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.100 
like a jerk maybe you need to ask your
spouse<00:06:09.620> if<00:06:09.979> that<00:06:10.340> applies<00:06:10.759> to<00:06:10.789> you

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
spouse if that applies to you

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.990 
spouse if that applies to you
the<00:06:12.440> second<00:06:12.800> condition<00:06:12.949> is<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:13.610> after<00:06:13.879> use

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
the second condition is the after use

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.089 
the second condition is the after use
just<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.360> right<00:06:14.389> amount<00:06:14.900> of<00:06:15.050> ice<00:06:15.229> this<00:06:15.919> is

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
just the right amount of ice this is

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.589 
just the right amount of ice this is
something<00:06:16.400> else<00:06:16.550> you<00:06:16.610> didn't<00:06:16.909> see<00:06:17.089> but<00:06:17.360> you

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
something else you didn't see but you

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.329 
something else you didn't see but you
know<00:06:17.690> if<00:06:17.810> you<00:06:17.900> put<00:06:18.080> in<00:06:18.169> too<00:06:18.379> much<00:06:18.409> ice<00:06:18.800> it<00:06:19.099> just

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:19.339 
know if you put in too much ice it just

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:20.829 
know if you put in too much ice it just
kind<00:06:19.490> of<00:06:19.520> packs<00:06:19.789> in<00:06:20.000> place<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.449> doesn't<00:06:20.599> move

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:20.839 
kind of packs in place and doesn't move

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.839 
kind of packs in place and doesn't move
around<00:06:21.110> even<00:06:21.800> if<00:06:21.889> you<00:06:21.979> drive<00:06:22.159> like<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.430> stuntman

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
around even if you drive like a stuntman

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.850 
around even if you drive like a stuntman
the<00:06:23.569> right<00:06:23.839> amount<00:06:24.110> of<00:06:24.199> ice<00:06:24.319> is<00:06:24.560> something

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
the right amount of ice is something

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.200 
the right amount of ice is something
that<00:06:24.979> just<00:06:25.129> kind<00:06:25.339> of<00:06:25.460> covers<00:06:25.759> the<00:06:25.789> bottom<00:06:26.029> of

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
that just kind of covers the bottom of

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.430 
that just kind of covers the bottom of
the<00:06:26.270> tank<00:06:26.419> and<00:06:26.629> maybe<00:06:26.750> a<00:06:26.839> little<00:06:26.960> bit<00:06:27.199> more

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
the tank and maybe a little bit more

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.829 
the tank and maybe a little bit more
than<00:06:27.680> that<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.639> third<00:06:28.879> thing<00:06:29.180> is<00:06:29.240> is<00:06:29.659> that<00:06:29.719> you

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:29.839 
than that the third thing is is that you

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.209 
than that the third thing is is that you
need<00:06:29.930> to<00:06:29.990> use<00:06:30.139> the<00:06:30.259> right<00:06:30.379> amount<00:06:30.529> of<00:06:30.800> water

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219 
need to use the right amount of water

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.610 
need to use the right amount of water
you<00:06:31.759> want<00:06:31.879> the<00:06:32.060> ice<00:06:32.210> sliding<00:06:33.020> around<00:06:33.139> on<00:06:33.500> the

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
you want the ice sliding around on the

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.110 
you want the ice sliding around on the
bottom<00:06:33.860> of<00:06:33.919> the<00:06:34.009> tank<00:06:34.219> but<00:06:34.490> not<00:06:34.639> necessarily

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
bottom of the tank but not necessarily

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.879 
bottom of the tank but not necessarily
floating<00:06:35.779> because<00:06:35.930> once<00:06:36.229> the<00:06:36.319> ice<00:06:36.440> starts<00:06:36.740> to

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
floating because once the ice starts to

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.219 
floating because once the ice starts to
float<00:06:37.339> then<00:06:37.969> anything<00:06:38.509> under<00:06:38.750> the<00:06:38.870> level<00:06:39.020> of

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
float then anything under the level of

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:41.649 
float then anything under the level of
the<00:06:39.289> ice<00:06:39.409> I<00:06:39.800> mean<00:06:40.279> you<00:06:40.339> might<00:06:40.490> as<00:06:40.520> well<00:06:40.969> just<00:06:41.479> be

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
the ice I mean you might as well just be

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:44.649 
the ice I mean you might as well just be
soaking<00:06:42.379> it<00:06:42.669> and<00:06:43.669> I<00:06:43.849> guess<00:06:44.000> the<00:06:44.150> fourth<00:06:44.419> thing

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
soaking it and I guess the fourth thing

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:46.779 
soaking it and I guess the fourth thing
is<00:06:44.839> that<00:06:45.560> even<00:06:45.740> if<00:06:45.919> you<00:06:46.009> do<00:06:46.159> get<00:06:46.339> a<00:06:46.370> limited

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
is that even if you do get a limited

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.159 
is that even if you do get a limited
scrubbing<00:06:47.240> action<00:06:47.389> with<00:06:47.689> the<00:06:47.779> ice<00:06:47.900> in<00:06:48.080> the

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
scrubbing action with the ice in the

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.709 
scrubbing action with the ice in the
tank<00:06:48.379> it's<00:06:48.860> just<00:06:49.279> not<00:06:49.460> that<00:06:49.669> great<00:06:49.909> by<00:06:50.539> now

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
tank it's just not that great by now

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.209 
tank it's just not that great by now
I've<00:06:50.930> seen<00:06:51.169> enough<00:06:51.409> of<00:06:51.529> these<00:06:51.650> things<00:06:51.919> to<00:06:52.099> know

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
I've seen enough of these things to know

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:54.100 
I've seen enough of these things to know
that<00:06:52.430> what<00:06:52.550> I<00:06:52.580> saw<00:06:52.879> with<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.180> ice<00:06:53.330> is<00:06:53.839> only

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
that what I saw with the ice is only

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.480 
that what I saw with the ice is only
marginally<00:06:54.469> better<00:06:54.949> than<00:06:55.189> what<00:06:55.310> you're<00:06:55.400> gonna

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
marginally better than what you're gonna

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.790 
marginally better than what you're gonna
get<00:06:55.669> was<00:06:55.819> just<00:06:56.029> water<00:06:56.270> alone<00:06:56.750> in<00:06:57.379> fact<00:06:57.589> when<00:06:57.740> I

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
get was just water alone in fact when I

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.170 
get was just water alone in fact when I
went<00:06:57.949> to<00:06:58.009> clean<00:06:58.219> the<00:06:58.339> tank<00:06:58.460> I<00:06:58.639> didn't<00:06:58.879> I<00:06:58.969> didn't

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
went to clean the tank I didn't I didn't

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.749 
went to clean the tank I didn't I didn't
scrub<00:06:59.449> it<00:06:59.659> I<00:06:59.930> didn't<00:07:00.289> you<00:07:00.889> know<00:07:00.919> spray<00:07:01.400> it<00:07:01.610> I

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 
scrub it I didn't you know spray it I

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.159 
scrub it I didn't you know spray it I
just<00:07:01.819> used<00:07:02.120> the<00:07:02.210> garden<00:07:02.479> hose<00:07:02.629> and<00:07:02.659> rinsed<00:07:03.080> it

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.169 
just used the garden hose and rinsed it

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.679 
just used the garden hose and rinsed it
out<00:07:03.259> but<00:07:03.439> wasn't<00:07:03.589> stuck<00:07:03.919> on<00:07:04.099> that<00:07:04.279> hard<00:07:04.520> so<00:07:05.300> why

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:05.689 
out but wasn't stuck on that hard so why

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:07.240 
out but wasn't stuck on that hard so why
the<00:07:05.750> scrubbing<00:07:06.169> is<00:07:06.259> so<00:07:06.409> weak<00:07:06.620> is<00:07:06.830> pretty

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
the scrubbing is so weak is pretty

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.769 
the scrubbing is so weak is pretty
obvious<00:07:07.759> when<00:07:07.909> you<00:07:08.000> stop<00:07:08.210> to<00:07:08.360> think<00:07:08.389> about<00:07:08.599> it

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:08.779 
obvious when you stop to think about it

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:10.719 
obvious when you stop to think about it
consider<00:07:09.650> how<00:07:09.860> much<00:07:09.979> force<00:07:10.250> it<00:07:10.400> takes<00:07:10.550> to

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:10.729 
consider how much force it takes to

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:13.149 
consider how much force it takes to
slide<00:07:11.060> a<00:07:11.300> wet<00:07:11.719> ice<00:07:11.960> cube<00:07:12.319> across<00:07:12.740> a<00:07:12.949> wet

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.159 
slide a wet ice cube across a wet

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:19.210 
slide a wet ice cube across a wet
surface

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.920 

not<00:07:20.220> that<00:07:20.430> much<00:07:20.699> well<00:07:21.300> it<00:07:21.360> takes<00:07:21.539> the<00:07:21.659> same

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
not that much well it takes the same

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.170 
not that much well it takes the same
amount<00:07:21.960> of<00:07:22.319> force<00:07:22.590> to<00:07:22.830> stop<00:07:23.370> that<00:07:23.580> Ice<00:07:23.789> Cube

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
amount of force to stop that Ice Cube

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.909 
amount of force to stop that Ice Cube
and<00:07:24.330> even<00:07:24.870> less<00:07:25.139> to<00:07:25.349> get<00:07:25.469> it<00:07:25.560> to<00:07:25.680> change

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 
and even less to get it to change

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.129 
and even less to get it to change
direction<00:07:26.340> so<00:07:27.030> if<00:07:27.150> anything<00:07:27.389> is<00:07:27.659> stuck<00:07:27.930> under

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
direction so if anything is stuck under

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.679 
direction so if anything is stuck under
the<00:07:28.259> tank<00:07:28.469> harder<00:07:28.770> than<00:07:28.949> that<00:07:29.789> it's<00:07:30.539> gonna

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:30.689 
the tank harder than that it's gonna

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:32.360 
the tank harder than that it's gonna
push<00:07:30.960> the<00:07:31.110> ice<00:07:31.319> and<00:07:31.680> not<00:07:31.860> the<00:07:32.039> other<00:07:32.159> way

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
push the ice and not the other way

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.980 
push the ice and not the other way
around<00:07:32.400> now<00:07:33.270> I<00:07:33.330> know<00:07:33.419> we're<00:07:33.629> talking<00:07:33.810> about

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
around now I know we're talking about

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.330 
around now I know we're talking about
more<00:07:34.229> than<00:07:34.379> one<00:07:34.500> ice<00:07:34.680> cube<00:07:34.830> but<00:07:35.099> even<00:07:35.280> if

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 
more than one ice cube but even if

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.770 
more than one ice cube but even if
you've<00:07:35.430> got<00:07:35.520> a<00:07:35.550> dozen<00:07:35.729> ice<00:07:35.969> cubes<00:07:36.270> to<00:07:36.419> line<00:07:36.599> up

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 
you've got a dozen ice cubes to line up

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.450 
you've got a dozen ice cubes to line up
and<00:07:36.900> hit<00:07:37.020> the<00:07:37.110> target<00:07:37.289> it's<00:07:37.680> still<00:07:37.889> a<00:07:37.919> very<00:07:38.159> low

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 
and hit the target it's still a very low

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.300 
and hit the target it's still a very low
friction<00:07:38.789> environment<00:07:39.539> so<00:07:40.409> what<00:07:40.590> am<00:07:40.710> I<00:07:40.979> going

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310 
friction environment so what am I going

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.730 
friction environment so what am I going
to<00:07:41.490> do<00:07:41.580> with<00:07:41.759> all<00:07:41.879> this<00:07:42.030> well<00:07:42.689> if<00:07:43.259> I<00:07:43.439> ever<00:07:43.469> feel

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 
to do with all this well if I ever feel

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.290 
to do with all this well if I ever feel
like<00:07:43.889> I<00:07:44.039> need<00:07:44.189> to<00:07:44.219> scrub<00:07:44.520> out<00:07:44.669> the<00:07:44.819> tank<00:07:45.060> I'm

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 
like I need to scrub out the tank I'm

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.510 
like I need to scrub out the tank I'm
not<00:07:45.870> gonna<00:07:46.080> use<00:07:46.319> ice<00:07:46.560> I'm<00:07:46.860> gonna<00:07:47.039> take<00:07:47.219> a<00:07:47.250> cue

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 
not gonna use ice I'm gonna take a cue

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.189 
not gonna use ice I'm gonna take a cue
from<00:07:47.639> Steph<00:07:48.030> when<00:07:48.330> she<00:07:48.449> comes<00:07:48.659> up<00:07:48.810> against<00:07:49.139> a

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 
from Steph when she comes up against a

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.080 
from Steph when she comes up against a
dirty<00:07:49.409> casserole<00:07:49.979> dish<00:07:50.190> with<00:07:50.219> stuff<00:07:50.580> baked<00:07:50.879> on

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.090 
dirty casserole dish with stuff baked on

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.420 
dirty casserole dish with stuff baked on
I'm<00:07:51.509> just<00:07:51.750> gonna<00:07:51.930> soak<00:07:52.289> it<00:07:52.440> it's<00:07:52.979> gonna<00:07:53.159> save

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.430 
I'm just gonna soak it it's gonna save

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.909 
I'm just gonna soak it it's gonna save
time<00:07:53.759> it's<00:07:54.569> gonna<00:07:54.719> save<00:07:55.020> money<00:07:55.229> on<00:07:55.440> ice<00:07:55.620> and

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 
time it's gonna save money on ice and
