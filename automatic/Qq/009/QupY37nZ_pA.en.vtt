00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.200
 welcome to cardigan kitchens today we go 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.050
 to prepare a royal or royal frosting 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.540
 icing super easy we're going to need a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.279
 egg white and 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.740
 glass is not worth home made has to 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.300
 be that we buy and it has to be for 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.309
 each clear 200 grams of sugar glass 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.750
 also food flavoring if you can 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.629
 be transparent color better and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.809
 dye in pasta accented has to be 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.440
 in pasta the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.440
 add the egg white and let's beat 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.250
 until foam as if we were going to 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.250
 ride the same thing 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.899
 in this step you can also add a 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.899
 pinch of salt 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.970
 I also saw that the clear one was very 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.250
 small egg size m and I added it 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.670
 another one of size m because it seemed very 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.190
 little so the 200 grams of sugar 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.130
 glass vale will be worth for a clear 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.960
 size l or large 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.689
 and at this point that you have already 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.880
 smoked pretty what we're going to do is 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.170
 go adding the icing sugar a little bit to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.939
 little bit 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.710
 I recommend you should do with your hand 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.320
 because if you can not fly all the sugar 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.759
 glas for the kitchen and let's go 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.500
 adding it until we have one 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.500
 texture type toothpaste 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.770
 As you can see, I have already integrated the 200 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.970
 grams of icing sugar and if needed 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.790
 then we would add another little 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.300
 this texture that I have left here 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.370
 I'm teaching it is for the filling of 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.870
 our cookies but to make 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.600
 our rimmed cookies 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.680
 we will need a glaze even more 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.680
 firm and hard 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.600
 so at this point we will put 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.360
 also the flavoring or aroma that 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.490
 more we like it to be possible that it is 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 transparent so as not to stain the color 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.390
 white of our glasa 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.390
 and we are going to integrate the taste very well 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.540
 so that our glaze is firmer and 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.810
 hard we will have to add more sugar 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.810
 glas 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.110
 and every time we notice that it costs us more 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.110
 move it 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.370
 You see how I told you before, this is for the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.299
 filling 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.610
 and here I have it ready for the delineated 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.610
 of cookies you see that it costs a lot of 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.379
 let it fall so you have to stay and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.030
 once we have this ready it would be the 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.420
 time to dye it with the color that most 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.790
 we like it always in pasta or in 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.099
 powder never liquid but lose 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.920
 consistency our glasa and this is 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.299
 everything for our cookies to be able 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.579
 decorate them I hope you liked it 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.470
 this video remember that you always have 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.560
 that having the glas covered is not like that 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.480
 would dry and it would not work I hope that you 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.980
 have liked god have served not 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.239
 you lose the next video and until the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.239
 next cooks chao
