at<00:00:03.510> Apple<00:00:03.929> we<00:00:04.380> believe<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.920> way<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.100> make<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
at Apple we believe the way to make a

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.789 
at Apple we believe the way to make a
truly<00:00:05.819> great<00:00:05.970> system<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:06.960> designed<00:00:07.259> both<00:00:07.589> the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
truly great system is designed both the

truly great system is designed both the
hardware<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.400> software<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.450> continuing

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170

innovate<00:00:10.559> them<00:00:10.740> together<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.790> Lion<00:00:12.059> we

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
innovate them together with Lion we

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.970 
innovate them together with Lion we
rethought<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.080> basic<00:00:13.440> things<00:00:13.620> we've<00:00:13.799> used

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
rethought the basic things we've used

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.440 
rethought the basic things we've used
from<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> very<00:00:14.490> beginning<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> graphic

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450

from the very beginning of a graphic
operating<00:00:15.870> system<00:00:16.230> things<00:00:16.770> like<00:00:16.920> clicking

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
operating system things like clicking

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.120 
operating system things like clicking
and<00:00:17.460> scrolling<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.359> saving<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.900> vials<00:00:19.289> but

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
and scrolling and saving of vials but

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.650 
and scrolling and saving of vials but
now<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.609> take<00:00:20.730> advantage<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> new

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
now we can take advantage of the new

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 
now we can take advantage of the new
faster<00:00:22.439> more<00:00:22.560> powerful<00:00:22.619> hardware<00:00:23.400> to

faster more powerful hardware to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
faster more powerful hardware to
completely<00:00:24.359> change<00:00:24.680> experience<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.769> using<00:00:25.859> a
