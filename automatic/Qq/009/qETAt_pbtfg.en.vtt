00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.120
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.350
 last consequence of our pocket rockets the 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.300
 we always tell you the last weeks 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.580
 presented here we have a 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.759
 a special candidate, namely the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.340
 ds3 convertible racing only as a convertible 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.590
 a very big exception in itself 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.180
 but something special anyway 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.840
 this little baby is limited 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.700
 on only 100 pieces with 207 ps it is quite 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.780
 nice and fast and the fabian shows you 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:38.510
 Now a few details the normal 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.649
 ds3 kabul we are already in the summer 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.809
 drove 150 ps is also running quite well 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.070
 forward but with 207 ps there is 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.019
 of course, again significantly better after 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.300
 ahead 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.730
 unfortunately limited accordingly 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.829
 also a bit more expensive than normal convertible 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.809
 but we also get it very nice 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.039
 Extras like these carbon applications 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.210
 which pull around the whole car and 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.409
 You do not streak little red ones 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.290
 but it definitely needs to do that 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.290
 visually sporty compared to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.579
 normal ds3 racing only 18 inch no 19 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.659
 inch rims and inside we show 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.659
 Now together something is matter 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.640
 we are now sitting ds3 racing 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:38.170
 you have to say it is actually 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.830
 Classically as used by ds3 or from 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.700
 ds3 racing accustomed we have small 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.970
 Carbon applications in this case yet 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.770
 a plaque which the number of we 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.680
 The 100 pieces have the number 46 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:02.340
 and in this case also a fabric roof 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.240
 just very nice seats have me 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.310
 but a bit too soft 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.320
 Actually, we have those 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.090
 possibility very easily in curves times 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.830
 over these flanks to slip over it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.489
 but now they are really nice 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.250
 also cut up here pretty tight and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.680
 that gives a really nice impression 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.050
 the rally feeling 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.269
 we have such little red ones here, we say 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.160
 times accessories in it one has over the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.680
 speeches little red stripes man 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.880
 has one more in the seats 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.390
 little stripes of the whole 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.340
 Repeat and that's what I think 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.140
 Such a sporty and elegant touch in the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.980
 dare not be completely black 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.110
 improve the driving impression you 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.320
 but really that is actually 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.390
 quite well 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.519
 compared to other cars that much 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.930
 also vorderachse have the power 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.769
 me the problem of this stamp so 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.769
 that if you go full throttle 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.049
 the question is just about always 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.850
 Stamping the floor is the only problem 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.930
 that we once too much power 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.799
 maybe a bit rubbery 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.430
 but that keeps within limits 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.430
 what the problem is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.410
 that he is partial to give in 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.410
 that's how stiff and so hard he is 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.720
 a little right and left jumps 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.670
 even if you are full throttle 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.490
 is already noticed draws 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.220
 just pretty strong right-left though 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:36.020
 otherwise it will be very good 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.910
 what annoys me is that a bit 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.800
 he has so little holes so short 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.570
 under 2000 tours is a small hole 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.570
 was just not clean and pervades 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.530
 especially in the first second course of 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.880
 he only misses in the second gear 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.710
 that i'm the performance in the 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.970
 second arrived and he must first 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.770
 back to a specific third 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.020
 come back is full of precedence there is 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.240
 So it's not seamless about me 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.130
 very much to the dare that the 207th 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.010
 ps has also felt like it 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.630
 very good, however, is when I open 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.080
 the badger just noticed something that 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.050
 Personally, I am very disturbed 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.010
 this windchuck what is going out 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.359
 and actually a positive one 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.390
 properties should have 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.920
 but if you give that kind of gas 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.650
 and is a nice day then 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.400
 impose themselves like that a few times 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.310
 in 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.330
 the whole thing works for me and changing table 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.020
 I'm also crazy about it 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.460
 difficult to reach agreement 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.050
 So I do not want to fly out there 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.940
 otherwise he had that 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.640
 unique feature that he not only 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.340
 in our test but also globally 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.810
 the whole class the only card with 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.870
 such a performance is and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.200
 also his strength how is it then with so 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.930
 much ruckus in quotation marks in so 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.730
 to drive a small car 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.750
 I personally like it a lot 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.860
 of course hears a lot around but 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.390
 I would also say the wind development 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.100
 I 'll say that we dare them 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.800
 is not as big as you are 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.650
 maybe you could imagine so gps 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.460
 and a bit of speed I thought so 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.930
 English 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.740
 we come to the end with it too 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.140
 Conclusion the convertible of the ds3 racing has so 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.340
 a little down time and that's it 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.050
 yes limited and also quite expensive 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.540
 So we have now in our test 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.820
 a range of 18,000 euros is the 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.680
 best 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:40.170
 the 20 and hold on to this car 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.920
 costs 38,000 and a few crushed 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.950
 entry price so there is something else 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.920
 on top of that makes them the most expensive and 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.680
 a bit difficult 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.000
 So building is almost structural 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.380
 identical with the peugeot 208 gti 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.590
 However, the chassis et cetera one 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:03.400
 a little different tuned but engine 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.350
 and transmissions are exactly the same though 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.710
 There is also an enormous amount between them 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.600
 money in between and turns 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.630
 of course the question is it so much 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.630
 money well worth to the question whether 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.590
 already said at the beginning is a bit 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.020
 the outsider because no solid roof 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.900
 is quasi the special class in the 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.110
 small special class that's why we have 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:35.670
 after the fight behind the after 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.200
 gti a united so fourth place 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.740
 Thus, this candidate lands on place 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.390
 four 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.920
 but we can do it all again 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.180
 a little revue let the 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.000
 whole little cars we tested 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.009
 have the pocket rockets and look us 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.400
 the places easy 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.400
 quite well
