suppose so your iPod Nano Touch or
iPhone<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.450> gonna<00:01:36.750> fit<00:01:36.960> much<00:01:37.320> more<00:01:37.619> snugly<00:01:38.159> in

iPhone is gonna fit much more snugly in

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.719 
iPhone is gonna fit much more snugly in
the<00:01:38.759> speaker<00:01:39.210> itself<00:01:40.220> now<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.400> annoying

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the speaker itself now it's annoying

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.530 
the speaker itself now it's annoying
however<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:43.290> charger<00:01:43.710> cable<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
however is the charger cable so it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.690 
however is the charger cable so it
doesn't<00:01:45.810> look<00:01:45.960> terrible<00:01:46.890> perhaps<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.610> this

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
doesn't look terrible perhaps in this

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
doesn't look terrible perhaps in this
video<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.329> real<00:01:48.509> life<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.869> might<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.380> an

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
video but in real life it might be an

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.830 
video but in real life it might be an
annoyance<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> little<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.570> harder

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
annoyance it's a little bit harder

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.249 
annoyance it's a little bit harder
charge<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.619> plug<00:01:53.009> into<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.490> places<00:01:54.259> because

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
charge or plug into some places because

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.889 
charge or plug into some places because
it<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.619> takes<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.189> lot<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.490> space<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
it really takes up a lot of space so you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.660 
it really takes up a lot of space so you
kind<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.409> conscious<00:01:58.950> when<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.549> buy

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
kind of to be conscious when you buy

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.880 
kind of to be conscious when you buy
this<00:01:59.729> device<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.259> cable<00:02:01.649> even

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this device because the cable even

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
this device because the cable even
though<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> brick<00:02:02.640> itself<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.390> will

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
though it's not a brick itself it will

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.430 
though it's not a brick itself it will
take<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.290> considerable<00:02:04.920> amount<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.250> space

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
take up considerable amount of space

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.680 
take up considerable amount of space
now<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.500> device<00:02:07.860> itself<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.550> speaker<00:02:08.970> looks

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
now the device itself the speaker looks

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.050 
now the device itself the speaker looks
really<00:02:10.200> nice<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:11.310> trying<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> show<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:11.910> off

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
really nice just trying to show it off

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.350 
really nice just trying to show it off
here<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:13.230> looks<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:14.100> cool<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
here it looks really cool I like the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.040 
here it looks really cool I like the
silver<00:02:15.630> trimming<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.500> sides<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:18.780> just

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
silver trimming on the sides and it just

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.140 
silver trimming on the sides and it just
looks<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.620> very<00:02:19.890> overall<00:02:20.280> sleep<00:02:20.790> device

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
looks like a very overall sleep device

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.960 
looks like a very overall sleep device
one<00:02:21.690> complaint<00:02:22.170> however<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.730> real

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
one complaint however is it's in real

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.900 
one complaint however is it's in real
life<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.360> looks<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.750> lot<00:02:25.230> smaller<00:02:25.650> than<00:02:26.100> what

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
life it looks a lot smaller than what

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.760 
life it looks a lot smaller than what
you<00:02:27.060> see<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> box

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
you see on the box

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.000 
you see on the box
maybe<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.550> just<00:02:29.640> kind<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.180> had<00:02:30.810> two<00:02:31.140> too<00:02:31.860> much

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
maybe I just kind of had two too much

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.370 
maybe I just kind of had two too much
about<00:02:32.220> high<00:02:32.400> hopes<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.120> device<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
about high hopes for this device but it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.300 
about high hopes for this device but it
doesn't<00:02:34.740> look<00:02:34.920> as<00:02:35.160> big<00:02:36.080> however<00:02:37.310> size

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
doesn't look as big however size

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.920 
doesn't look as big however size
actually<00:02:38.880> doesn't<00:02:39.360> matter<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.870> case

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
actually doesn't matter in this case

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.130 
actually doesn't matter in this case
because<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.860> actually<00:02:41.040> has<00:02:41.400> really

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
because it actually has really

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.850 
because it actually has really
impressive<00:02:43.140> sound<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.730> not<00:02:45.000> gonna<00:02:45.300> be

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
impressive sound so it's not gonna be

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.620 
impressive sound so it's not gonna be
really<00:02:46.860> silent<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.670> would<00:02:47.790> suppose<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.420> don't

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
really silent I would suppose but don't

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.360 
really silent I would suppose but don't
get<00:02:48.780> your<00:02:48.930> ha<00:02:49.080> your<00:02:49.110> hopes<00:02:49.860> up<00:02:50.070> too<00:02:50.340> high

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
get your ha your hopes up too high

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.970 
get your ha your hopes up too high
because<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.120> not<00:02:51.300> gonna<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.720> like<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.980> six

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
because it's not gonna be like a six

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.710 
because it's not gonna be like a six
point<00:02:53.280> one<00:02:53.459> surround<00:02:53.640> sound<00:02:54.150> which<00:02:54.480> I'm<00:02:54.630> gonna

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
point one surround sound which I'm gonna

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.229 
point one surround sound which I'm gonna
show<00:02:54.810> later<00:02:55.140> on<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.700> does<00:02:56.910> get<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.209> job

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
show later on but it does get the job

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.990 
show later on but it does get the job
done<00:02:57.630> which<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.380> cool<00:02:58.680> what's<00:02:59.640> cool<00:02:59.850> is<00:02:59.880> that

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
done which is cool what's cool is that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.350 
done which is cool what's cool is that
it<00:03:00.330> has<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.930> backlit<00:03:01.830> screen<00:03:02.790> meaning<00:03:03.209> it's

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
it has a backlit screen meaning it's

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.660 
it has a backlit screen meaning it's
gonna<00:03:03.510> give<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.170> pretty<00:03:04.830> good<00:03:05.160> telling<00:03:05.550> of

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
gonna give you a pretty good telling of

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.699 
gonna give you a pretty good telling of
the<00:03:05.730> time<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.300> it's<00:03:06.810> gonna<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:07.080> really<00:03:07.410> bright

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
the time and it's gonna be really bright

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.199 
the time and it's gonna be really bright
so<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.640> middle<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.000> night

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
so if it's in the middle of the night

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.759 
so if it's in the middle of the night
and<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.600> need<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.840> know<00:03:10.019> what<00:03:10.320> time<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.739> is

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
and you need to know what time it is

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.340 
and you need to know what time it is
it's<00:03:11.580> gonna<00:03:11.760> tell<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.239> pretty<00:03:12.840> accurately

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
it's gonna tell you pretty accurately

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.250 
it's gonna tell you pretty accurately
setting<00:03:14.310> up<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:15.060> hope<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.720> pretty<00:03:16.049> simple

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
setting up the I hope is pretty simple

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.930 
setting up the I hope is pretty simple
and<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.830> really<00:03:17.070> doesn't<00:03:17.310> need<00:03:17.430> much<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.790> an

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
and it really doesn't need much of an

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.140 
and it really doesn't need much of an
explanation<00:03:19.400> now<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.700> mentioned<00:03:21.030> earlier

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
explanation now like I mentioned earlier

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.470 
explanation now like I mentioned earlier
what's<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.140> big<00:03:22.459> disappointment<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:23.880> it

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
what's the big disappointment is it's it

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.720 
what's the big disappointment is it's it
doesn't<00:03:24.630> give<00:03:24.840> them<00:03:24.959> most<00:03:25.280> sound<00:03:26.280> ever<00:03:26.519> but

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
doesn't give them most sound ever but

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.990 
doesn't give them most sound ever but
it's<00:03:26.880> not<00:03:27.150> bad<00:03:27.900> by<00:03:28.230> any<00:03:28.590> means<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.760> if<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.910> have

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
it's not bad by any means so if you have

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.180 
it's not bad by any means so if you have
a<00:03:30.060> six<00:03:30.480> speaker<00:03:31.170> surround<00:03:31.350> sound<00:03:31.739> system<00:03:32.040> like

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
a six speaker surround sound system like

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.699 
a six speaker surround sound system like
I<00:03:32.340> do<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.970> not<00:03:33.180> gonna<00:03:33.299> compare<00:03:33.750> obviously

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
I do it's not gonna compare obviously

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.530 
I do it's not gonna compare obviously
but<00:03:35.579> it's<00:03:35.730> still<00:03:35.910> worth<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.360> purchase

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
but it's still worth the purchase

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.440 
but it's still worth the purchase
nonetheless<00:03:37.760> overall<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.790> would<00:03:38.910> say<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.299> is

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
nonetheless overall I would say this is

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.930 
nonetheless overall I would say this is
about<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:40.049> five<00:03:40.410> out<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.590> five<00:03:40.829> it's<00:03:41.190> an<00:03:41.340> amazing

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
about a five out of five it's an amazing

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.940 
about a five out of five it's an amazing
alarm<00:03:42.239> clock<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:43.040> charging
