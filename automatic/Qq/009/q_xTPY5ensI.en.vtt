00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.710
 Hello dear youtube inhabitants in 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.200
 this video I will tell you 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.519
 firmware android 4 2 2 for samsung 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.730
 galaxy tab 2 7 0 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.320
 I have no official firmware for it 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:24.930
 decided to put cyanogenmod 10.1 and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.599
 now tell you what came of it 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.890
 Now on your screen a screenshot of 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 antutu 7510 he issued in principle quite 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.190
 good result custom firmware 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.890
 I was given out only 6 300 there are still 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.010
 lite version ie lite game 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.280
 This firmware was laid out there by people 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.309
 screenshots up to 9000 issued antutu 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.500
 overclocking is possible in this firmware 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.920
 processor ie instead of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.260
 work two cores one gigahertz he 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.649
 two cores of 13 each 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 therefore such result as for 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.590
 performance is all really 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.920
 works much smoother than on custom 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.310
 does behave a little differently and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.260
 all the same 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.000
 the interface is completely different 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.619
 have to get used to everything gallery 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.250
 a little bit different in my opinion 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.229
 prettier but I took screenshots 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 lock in general laid out 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.950
 vkontakte facebook 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.840
 those who subscribe to me already have it all 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.290
 I saw I tested this proshivochku's 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.170
 so firstly the first impression 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.600
 really good interface and everything 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.590
 looks like on nexus 7 the only thing 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.810
 lacks 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.470
 performance gain how there is not 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.460
 Enough games 3 widgets and all that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.250
 all here is 422 the only censure 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.140
 whats up 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.200
 I do not know I have the firmware has been that 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.810
 no video player 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.690
 music player nothing at all 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.910
 I'm just pure naked android with 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:13.820
 apex launcher and everything and guide 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.250
 Well, I immediately through the Wi-Fi pulled mx 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.830
 player try to clean the toys 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.860
 keyboard alarm contact so on 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.070
 everything works perfectly acceptable even 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.500
 contact became much less frequent with an error 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.959
 fly though I don't know this is software 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.390
 mistake or what's the problem honestly say 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.030
 the most interesting thing is this this is a feature with 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.220
 notification panels when we pull 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.410
 right corner comes out like this 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.800
 tool management panel 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.739
 tablet settings when we pull out 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.140
 on the left we have this 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.920
 the panel that shows purely 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.100
 notice date and time well donâ€™t even know 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.530
 it will be convenient for someone 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.190
 this is somehow not adapted is not necessary 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.410
 getting used but basically an interesting thing 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.190
 just for those who want something 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:14.570
 newcomer will really like it 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.180
 and so double tap on the screen we call 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.840
 settings that are just millions in here 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.330
 the launcher itself and in the firmware itself and so 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.260
 the settings of the tablet itself has become much 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.340
 more 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.850
 and the interface is changed in contrast to 40 4412 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.640
 In general, from the drain and here is configured 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.640
 absolutely everything but still settings 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.239
 remained as if from the phone after all 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.950
 it's most likely ported 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.049
 firmware from some phone and just 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.600
 drove under our tablet 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.510
 but if here while cook in settings 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.019
 you can optimize well and be all 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.090
 pretty good and even downstairs 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:03.580
 writing a phone about tablet pc 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:08.970
 here android 4 2 2 RAM 774 total 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.989
 version cyanogenmod 10 1 build date 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.960
 April 27th 2013 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.140
 repack 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:22.320
 But in general, well, honestly I do not know 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.730
 even what is there to tell it naked 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.850
 android the only thing here 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.060
 apex launcher for more likelihood 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.440
 and such interesting flower beds and 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.480
 and the clan lock screen here used to be 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.370
 just like on the water you spend a finger 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.070
 here is such a circle set up 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.870
 Where can I take the application I do not know on 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.060
 the video there is bad wash it can be seen because 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.880
 lighting unlocking in the side but here i am 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.920
 made contact there were text messages that is 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.870
 Again, I repeat that this campaign with 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.160
 phone firmware and music calls 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.240
 internet and down here is all 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.090
 set up a very convenient thing 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.370
 by the way yes another interesting thing when 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.550
 so here we take out on this one 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.390
 blue lines can be made 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.690
 screen brightness adjustability is very good 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.000
 this is also for those who want something 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.000
 brand new or just brag to 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.850
 friends or something like that but 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.670
 In general, the firmware itself is very 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.080
 nice and everything works well but 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.090
 need a lot all set to it 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.750
 in general, I liked her 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:44.610
 if anyone wants to insert is installed 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:47.640
 It is easy through the recovery and by the way those who 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.580
 puts work on your tablet in that way 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.950
 which I showed and you have a recovery 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.810
 rolls back to the 3rd that is to stock 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.390
 Recovery and through this recovery this 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.510
 I will not install the firmware 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.289
 I just turned it into a brick 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:07.119
 so to speak 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:10.270
 and well, I got a little bit with him of course 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:11.139
 until you put this firmware as you see 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.589
 everything is ok 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:18.639
 what's different from the official 42 barely 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:21.159
 on the same nexus hal of the same 412 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.409
 officially when we hold the home button 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:25.960
 we do not have such a google 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.889
 although it should in fact well, that is, you can see 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:33.189
 what is this launcher there are some complaints 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:35.800
 The launcher itself is the setting here is very 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:40.509
 many different settings can be changed 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.550
 all themes download theme icon set 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.110
 font 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.939
 well, a lot of things just 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.029
 I really enjoyed it 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:51.639
 desktop settings 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:55.569
 lock screen gadgets 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:58.770
 dock panels and behavior settings folders 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.770
 gesture control 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:08.620
 you can even put widgets on the screen 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.320
 lock here's my time here 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.080
 worth the calendar and very interesting 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.590
 I am very funny too 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.050
 I liked the battery can be changed but 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:23.110
 in principle as with any cyanogen not there 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:25.120
 just choose the round rounder 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.150
 percent just drawing a battery 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.889
 interest battery 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:33.310
 Well, in general, that's all 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:36.099
 how does it differ from 412 but much 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:39.990
 more performance a little 

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:42.880
 different interface and much more 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.280
 settings for the user ie us 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.580
 everyone sets up a tablet like it 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.889
 want thank you for your attention subscribe 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.490
 I write on my channel to answer comments 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:53.490
 bye Bye
