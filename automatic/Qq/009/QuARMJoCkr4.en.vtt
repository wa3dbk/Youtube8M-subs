00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.300 
sitting there and we're probably gonna
cover<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:56.870> up<00:03:57.110> with<00:03:57.170> maybe<00:03:57.709> like<00:03:57.920> some<00:03:58.130> sort

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
cover that up with maybe like some sort

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.580 
cover that up with maybe like some sort
of<00:03:58.370> blanket<00:03:58.790> because<00:03:59.239> it's<00:03:59.900> tree<00:04:00.110> skirt<00:04:00.380> is

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
of blanket because it's tree skirt is

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.940 
of blanket because it's tree skirt is
what<00:04:01.010> they<00:04:01.340> call<00:04:01.580> it<00:04:01.730> in<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> biz<00:04:02.270> but<00:04:03.050> what

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
what they call it in the biz but what

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.710 
what they call it in the biz but what
we're<00:04:04.100> trying<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.400> do<00:04:04.610> here<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.180> where<00:04:05.570> we

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
we're trying to do here is where we

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.300 
we're trying to do here is where we
usually<00:04:05.900> have<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:06.650> camera<00:04:07.070> for<00:04:07.250> the

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
usually have the camera for the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.160 
usually have the camera for the
challenges<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.000> stuff<00:04:08.209> we're<00:04:08.840> trying<00:04:08.989> to

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
challenges and stuff we're trying to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.620 
challenges and stuff we're trying to
make<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:09.440> look<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:09.770> a<00:04:09.830> much<00:04:10.070> bigger<00:04:10.310> tree<00:04:10.760> so

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
make it look like a much bigger tree so

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.170 
make it look like a much bigger tree so
if<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.620> can<00:04:12.739> see<00:04:12.950> that<00:04:13.190> but<00:04:13.760> then<00:04:13.910> when<00:04:14.090> you

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
if you can see that but then when you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.080 
if you can see that but then when you
actually<00:04:14.330> come<00:04:14.690> over<00:04:14.720> here<00:04:15.350> once<00:04:16.250> we<00:04:16.609> figure

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
actually come over here once we figure

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.210 
actually come over here once we figure
out<00:04:17.239> what<00:04:17.780> caused<00:04:17.930> me<00:04:18.109> we<00:04:18.350> couldn't<00:04:18.680> find<00:04:18.980> a

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
out what caused me we couldn't find a

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.640 
out what caused me we couldn't find a
tree<00:04:19.580> that<00:04:19.940> was<00:04:20.000> tall<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:20.930> skinny<00:04:21.230> all<00:04:21.470> the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
tree that was tall and skinny all the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.550 
tree that was tall and skinny all the
tall<00:04:21.919> ones<00:04:22.220> were<00:04:22.910> really<00:04:22.940> really<00:04:23.480> like<00:04:23.810> girthy

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
tall ones were really really like girthy

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.040 
tall ones were really really like girthy
I<00:04:24.590> guess<00:04:24.919> yeah<00:04:25.280> they're<00:04:25.520> wide<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.840> is

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
I guess yeah they're wide and this is

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.900 
I guess yeah they're wide and this is
this<00:04:27.560> one<00:04:27.770> fits<00:04:28.070> in<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> space<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.640> we<00:04:28.880> need

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
this one fits in the space that we need

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.090 
this one fits in the space that we need
it<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.150> so<00:04:29.590> exactly<00:04:30.590> we<00:04:31.280> got<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> man<00:04:31.730> over<00:04:32.030> here

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
it to so exactly we got a man over here

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.150 
it to so exactly we got a man over here
doing<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> tree<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:36.020> know<00:04:36.860> it's<00:04:37.039> looking

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
doing the tree and I know it's looking

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.159 
doing the tree and I know it's looking
pretty<00:04:37.460> nice<00:04:37.729> what<00:04:38.000> do

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
pretty nice what do
