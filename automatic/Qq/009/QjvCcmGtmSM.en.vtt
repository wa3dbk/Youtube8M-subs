speakers<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.930> Kinect<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.440> going<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.769> pick

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
speakers and the Kinect is going to pick

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.830 
speakers and the Kinect is going to pick
up<00:03:43.130> on<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.549> and<00:03:43.760> there's<00:03:44.360> just<00:03:44.540> got<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.720> be

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
up on that and there's just got to be

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.370 
up on that and there's just got to be
like<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.110> reverb<00:03:45.830> type<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.459> echo<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.630> is<00:03:47.959> super

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
like a reverb type of echo that is super

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.800 
like a reverb type of echo that is super
duper<00:03:49.310> annoying<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.030> already<00:03:50.209> experienced

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
duper annoying and I already experienced

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.640 
duper annoying and I already experienced
that<00:03:50.989> on<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.260> ps3<00:03:51.730> with<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:53.030> PSI<00:03:53.500> cameras<00:03:54.500> or

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
that on the ps3 with the PSI cameras or

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.199 
that on the ps3 with the PSI cameras or
whatever<00:03:54.980> they're<00:03:55.250> called<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.730> it's

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
whatever they're called and it's

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.449 
whatever they're called and it's
horrible<00:03:56.570> because<00:03:56.750> I'm<00:03:57.080> talking<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.890> then<00:03:58.310> my

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
horrible because I'm talking and then my

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.250 
horrible because I'm talking and then my
voice<00:03:58.489> placed<00:03:59.150> through<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.450> TV<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.019> then<00:04:00.170> I

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
voice placed through the TV and then I

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.900 
voice placed through the TV and then I
hear<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.590> back<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.100> then<00:04:01.190> when<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.459> hear<00:04:01.670> your

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
hear it back and then when you hear your

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.060 
hear it back and then when you hear your
own<00:04:01.940> voice<00:04:02.090> in<00:04:02.690> real<00:04:02.870> time<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:03.890> like<00:04:04.040> a

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
own voice in real time just like a

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.699 
own voice in real time just like a
second<00:04:04.580> delayed<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.150> moved<00:04:05.690> on<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:06.470> makes

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
second delayed and moved on but it makes

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.979 
second delayed and moved on but it makes
it<00:04:06.920> sound<00:04:07.250> really<00:04:07.610> weird<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:08.330> then<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.540> start

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
it sound really weird and then I start

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.140 
it sound really weird and then I start
talking<00:04:09.200> weird<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.890> my<00:04:09.950> brain<00:04:10.250> can

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
talking weird and my brain can

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.970 
talking weird and my brain can
compute<00:04:11.510> that<00:04:11.720> for<00:04:12.290> some<00:04:12.470> reason<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.920> I

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
compute that for some reason and I

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.220 
compute that for some reason and I
thought<00:04:13.159> this<00:04:13.340> was<00:04:13.549> a<00:04:13.579> pretty<00:04:14.299> psycho<00:04:14.659> massage

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
thought this was a pretty psycho massage

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.069 
thought this was a pretty psycho massage
