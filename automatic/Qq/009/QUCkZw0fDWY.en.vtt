00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 ok we are sure here good day on a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.820
 115 horsepower injected yamaha engine 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.330
 which is a startup problem 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.780
 we check that we call ignition you 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.780
 can start &amp; stop 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.400
 so there is no moon and no 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.260
 injection we will check them our 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.359
 pmh sensor located here we will check them 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.410
 the AC voltage which is so we 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.969
 will check that the diet sensor 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:42.750
 returns a good signal we are in 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:47.640
 alternative here so we're going to start and we 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.430
 saw it 0404 volts which have re sensors 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.140
 work but the for this type of 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.180
 motor the signal is weak we should 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.969
 rather find themselves towards 2 volts london 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.399
 the heroes quote ok let's check the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.620
 battery wiring the power supply 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.180
 so I'm on the highest level of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.589
 the battery one is also on the most 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:13.290
 we will check them the voltage drop 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:15.240
 during the start-up phase that we saw 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.030
 we had a flight of just over a vote 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.689
 which is low on a wire 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.520
 power 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.520
 we will do the same thing on the negative side 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 I plug in the negative side so we 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.750
 start the starter so we saw 5 24 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.979
 volts which is way too much that's 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.240
 for that the battery voltage 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.329
 however correct we will repair at 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.490
 hockey wiring after replacing the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.420
 cable tomorrow what was faulty on 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.420
 resumes the voltage drop 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.680
 and that's why we also had 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.100
 around 1 flight from here v but the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.100
 car starts
