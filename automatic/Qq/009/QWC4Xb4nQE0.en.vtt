my collection this is probably the worst
old<00:03:47.940> sure<00:03:48.209> where<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.810> pull<00:03:49.260> right<00:03:49.560> now<00:03:49.799> yeah

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
but it's funnier in school yeah it was a

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.800 
but it's funnier in school yeah it was a
beautiful<00:03:53.069> card<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.940> mean<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.359> still<00:03:54.599> I

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
beautiful card and I mean it still I

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.990 
beautiful card and I mean it still I
think<00:03:54.930> collecting<00:03:55.530> value-wise<00:03:56.220> don't<00:03:56.819> like<00:03:56.970> a

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
think collecting value-wise don't like a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.660 
think collecting value-wise don't like a
five<00:03:57.389> to<00:03:57.750> ten<00:03:58.019> dollar<00:03:58.230> car<00:03:58.590> being<00:03:58.920> bandits

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
five to ten dollar car being bandits

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.270 
five to ten dollar car being bandits
it's<00:04:00.000> either<00:04:00.359> gonna<00:04:00.480> make<00:04:00.599> it<00:04:00.799> go<00:04:01.799> up<00:04:01.829> or<00:04:02.250> go

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
it's either gonna make it go up or go

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.969 
it's either gonna make it go up or go
down<00:04:02.459> no<00:04:02.940> yeah<00:04:03.239> now<00:04:03.540> long<00:04:03.870> run<00:04:04.169> I<00:04:04.500> think<00:04:04.560> you're

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
down no yeah now long run I think you're

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.830 
down no yeah now long run I think you're
right<00:04:05.100> like<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.519> value<00:04:05.940> will<00:04:06.180> be<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.479> little

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
right like the value will be a little

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.930 
right like the value will be a little
higher<00:04:07.169> just<00:04:07.859> because<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.340> has<00:04:08.489> been<00:04:08.699> banned

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
higher just because it has been banned

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.110 
higher just because it has been banned
but<00:04:09.269> I<00:04:09.479> still<00:04:09.720> think<00:04:09.959> that's<00:04:10.049> funny<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:11.120> this

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
but I still think that's funny that this

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.759 
but I still think that's funny that this
is<00:04:12.329> probably<00:04:12.449> going<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.810> be<00:04:12.900> my<00:04:13.079> only<00:04:13.290> ultra

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
is probably going to be my only ultra

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.560 
is probably going to be my only ultra
rare<00:04:13.949> pull<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.430> tins<00:04:14.669> just<00:04:15.000> because<00:04:15.299> I'm

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
rare pull of the tins just because I'm

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.830 
rare pull of the tins just because I'm
terrible<00:04:16.470> with<00:04:16.530> luck<00:04:16.949> like<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.699> it<00:04:18.630> was

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
terrible with luck like that and it was

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.510 
terrible with luck like that and it was
