00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
I'm more less likely to talk to my

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.810 
I'm more less likely to talk to my
neighbor<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.990> get<00:03:59.380> my<00:03:59.470> work<00:03:59.650> done<00:03:59.680> than<00:04:00.400> if<00:04:00.640> I

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
neighbor I get my work done than if I

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.120 
neighbor I get my work done than if I
didn't<00:04:01.480> have<00:04:01.630> it<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.380> think<00:04:02.470> if<00:04:02.680> teachers

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
didn't have it so I think if teachers

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.690 
didn't have it so I think if teachers
are<00:04:03.550> more<00:04:04.360> open<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:05.080> things<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.340> and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
are more open to things like that and

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.030 
are more open to things like that and
understanding<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.570> students<00:04:08.500> learn<00:04:08.739> in

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
understanding that students learn in

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.820 
understanding that students learn in
different<00:04:09.220> ways<00:04:09.690> then<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.720> think<00:04:11.080> that<00:04:11.290> a

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
different ways then I think that a

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.349 
different ways then I think that a
classroom<00:04:12.250> would<00:04:12.700> probably<00:04:13.530> work<00:04:14.530> better<00:04:14.860> and

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
classroom would probably work better and

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.680 
classroom would probably work better and
students<00:04:16.359> might<00:04:16.630> be<00:04:17.140> more<00:04:18.100> open<00:04:18.489> to

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
students might be more open to

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.659 
students might be more open to
suggesting<00:04:19.690> things<00:04:19.900> if<00:04:20.200> teachers<00:04:20.799> open<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.549> it

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
suggesting things if teachers open to it

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.340 
suggesting things if teachers open to it
the<00:04:22.030> thing<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.600> wish<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:23.050> that<00:04:23.080> the

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
the thing is that I wish is that the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.420 
the thing is that I wish is that the
teachers<00:04:23.970> spread<00:04:24.970> out<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:26.830> exams<00:04:27.220> like

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
teachers spread out the like exams like

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.820 
teachers spread out the like exams like
maybe<00:04:27.669> have<00:04:27.940> it<00:04:27.970> in<00:04:28.180> semesters<00:04:28.600> I'd<00:04:29.470> like<00:04:29.710> to

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
maybe have it in semesters I'd like to

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.530 
maybe have it in semesters I'd like to
try<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.520> see<00:04:30.700> how<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.120> maybe<00:04:31.300> have

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
try that to see how it is maybe have

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.110 
try that to see how it is maybe have
half<00:04:31.750> your<00:04:32.020> courses<00:04:32.500> in<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.740> year<00:04:32.980> so<00:04:33.790> you<00:04:33.940> don't

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
half your courses in a year so you don't

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.110 
half your courses in a year so you don't
have<00:04:34.330> all<00:04:34.720> eight<00:04:35.050> right<00:04:35.470> in<00:04:35.800> one<00:04:36.340> week<00:04:36.610> or<00:04:36.880> so

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
have all eight right in one week or so

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.260 
have all eight right in one week or so
one<00:04:37.570> of<00:04:37.660> our<00:04:37.750> teachers<00:04:38.080> he<00:04:38.580> he<00:04:39.580> has<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.850> due<00:04:40.150> date

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
one of our teachers he he has a due date

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.180 
one of our teachers he he has a due date
on<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.450> homework<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.020> he<00:04:41.530> knows<00:04:41.740> no<00:04:42.040> matter

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
on the homework but he knows no matter

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.610 
on the homework but he knows no matter
what<00:04:42.430> we'll<00:04:42.550> get<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.850> done<00:04:43.060> eventually<00:04:43.780> that'd

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
what we'll get it done eventually that'd

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.159 
what we'll get it done eventually that'd
be<00:04:44.800> really<00:04:44.979> cool<00:04:45.640> in<00:04:45.850> order<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.090> see<00:04:46.900> everyone

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.540 
it's sort of good feedback and tips we
even<00:04:52.270> had<00:04:52.570> some<00:04:52.600> teachers<00:04:52.900> ask<00:04:53.350> us<00:04:53.680> how<00:04:54.340> do<00:04:54.400> you

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
even had some teachers ask us how do you

even had some teachers ask us how do you
guys<00:04:54.790> like<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:55.330> learn<00:04:55.479> what<00:04:56.260> would<00:04:56.440> you<00:04:56.560> like

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
guys like to learn what would you like

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.570 
guys like to learn what would you like
to<00:04:56.950> do

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
to do

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.760 
to do
this<00:04:58.210> is<00:04:58.360> what<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.570> have<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.960> teach<00:04:59.169> how<00:04:59.620> would

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
this is what I have to teach how would

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.770 
this is what I have to teach how would
you<00:04:59.860> guys<00:05:00.010> like<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.460> learn<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:00.820> knowing<00:05:01.630> that

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
you guys like to learn it knowing that

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.110 
you guys like to learn it knowing that
we're<00:05:01.900> being<00:05:02.140> heard<00:05:02.350> like<00:05:02.590> I

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
we're being heard like I

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.850 
we're being heard like I
like<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.570> because<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.410> know<00:05:04.500> that<00:05:04.740> it's

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
like that because I know that it's

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.640 
like that because I know that it's
actually<00:05:05.340> getting<00:05:05.880> somewhere<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.660> we'll

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
actually getting somewhere and we'll

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.020 
actually getting somewhere and we'll
probably<00:05:07.979> have<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.370> an<00:05:08.520> effect<00:05:08.790> in

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
probably have to have an effect in

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.629 
probably have to have an effect in
what's<00:05:09.900> gonna<00:05:10.050> happen<00:05:10.410> it's<00:05:10.770> not<00:05:10.979> fast<00:05:11.310> a

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
what's gonna happen it's not fast a

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.070 
what's gonna happen it's not fast a
change<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.120> education<00:05:12.540> is<00:05:12.630> definitely<00:05:12.750> not

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
change in education is definitely not

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.129 
change in education is definitely not
fast<00:05:13.410> but<00:05:14.070> what<00:05:14.310> can<00:05:14.490> happen<00:05:14.669> if<00:05:15.180> people<00:05:15.930> will

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
fast but what can happen if people will

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.650 
fast but what can happen if people will
take<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.770> time<00:05:16.979> to<00:05:17.400> act<00:05:17.850> on<00:05:18.090> what<00:05:18.510> they're

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
take the time to act on what they're

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.530 
take the time to act on what they're
hearing<00:05:18.870> from<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:20.040> students<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.760> going<00:05:21.389> to<00:05:21.479> be

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
hearing from the students is going to be

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.139 
hearing from the students is going to be
quite<00:05:21.750> profound
