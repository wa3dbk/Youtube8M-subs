00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.520
 the wolf disguised as a sheep 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.140
 by 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.019
 the old wolf was in a lousy mood 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.259
 he had injured a leg he had spent a whole week locked in his lair 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.439
 unable to go hunting 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.179
 there was no food left 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.019
 and his stomach was just protesting 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.759
 to make things worse in the hostel under their noses 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.650
 I made a flock of right youngsters 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.029
 but the remnants of his last meal what consisted of a dirty skin of 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.879
 sheep and 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.980
 the few bones I had heard hundreds of times 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.080
 I have not even brought him alive 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.190
 She complained 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.890
 and kicked the peje fucked 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.980
 but in that instant 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.460
 a fantastic idea has occurred to him 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.250
 directed percent 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.450
 one would not occur to me before 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.800
 If I disguise myself as a sheep I will not need to go hunting 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.460
 I have slipped into the fold 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.460
 I would choose a lamb, a chubby 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.370
 and he threw his skin on his shoulders 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.080
 smiling perfidiously 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.520
 That afternoon 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.980
 in how much walking agencies 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.640
 I limped 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.670
 he got between the flock 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.220
 according to last night 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.370
 his stratagem worked 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.860
 the shepherd led the wolf to the fold with the sheep 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 but the old wolf kept his head down 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.060
 and bull or the huge knife that the shepherd was carrying in Egypt 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.130
 The Shepherd 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.130
 he caressed the blade of his intense knife 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 long ago with my family could not give lamb meat 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.810
 tonight I want to be at a banquet worthy of a king 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.940
 advancing on the largest animal in the fence I leave it 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.280
 when the shepherd came around the dead animal 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.110
 proved that it was his old enemy 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.990
 the wolf 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.350
 he did not leave his astonishment 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.520
 but the very good look said laughing 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.039
 this time you cheated on us but 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.119
 well thought I think I'm not going to eat you for dinner 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:14.759
 Well, even if you go in disguise 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.449
 you do not stop being a wolf
