that's all solid ice right there and you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.319 
that's all solid ice right there and you
can<00:00:45.539> finally<00:00:46.110> see<00:00:46.289> some<00:00:46.320> snow<00:00:46.829> pack<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.879> above

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can finally see some snow pack up above

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.010 
can finally see some snow pack up above
now<00:00:49.289> what's<00:00:49.620> happened<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:51.899> to

behind this roof here just above you can

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.510 
behind this roof here just above you can
see<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> roof<00:01:19.259> right<00:01:19.470> there<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:20.130> about<00:01:20.400> at

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
see the roof right there right about at

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340 
see the roof right there right about at
that<00:01:20.549> elevation<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.689> where<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.170> see

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that elevation right where you can see

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
that elevation right where you can see
the<00:01:22.470> shingles<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.100> above<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> ice<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the shingles just above the ice in the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.730 
the shingles just above the ice in the
center<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> frame<00:01:25.159> that's<00:01:26.159> where<00:01:26.759> heat

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
center of the frame that's where heat

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.580 
center of the frame that's where heat
from<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> house<00:01:29.390> actually<00:01:30.390> passes<00:01:31.049> through

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
from the house actually passes through

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.850 
from the house actually passes through
the<00:01:31.799> insulation<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.960> it's<00:01:33.960> low-level

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the insulation and it's low-level

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
the insulation and it's low-level
infrared<00:01:35.460> radiation<00:01:36.180> even<00:01:36.420> though<00:01:36.720> you've

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
infrared radiation even though you've

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.399 
infrared radiation even though you've
got<00:01:36.900> insulation<00:01:37.799> there<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.790> enough

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
got insulation there there is enough

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.429 
got insulation there there is enough
heat<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.340> pass<00:01:41.640> through<00:01:42.439> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
heat that can pass through the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.520 
heat that can pass through the
insulation<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.430> goes<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.420> actually

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
insulation it goes up and it actually

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.050 
insulation it goes up and it actually
radiates<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> underside<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
radiates right to the underside of the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.670 
radiates right to the underside of the
roof<00:01:48.390> deck<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:50.420> melts<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> snowpack<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
roof deck and it melts the snowpack and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.740 
roof deck and it melts the snowpack and
you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.610> down<00:01:53.790> farther<00:01:54.270> down<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> roof

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
you can see down farther down the roof

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
you can see down farther down the roof
where<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.380> I've<00:01:56.130> raked<00:01:56.670> away<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.329> of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
where I have I've raked away a lot of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.929 
where I have I've raked away a lot of
the<00:01:57.750> snow<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.770> farther<00:01:59.520> down<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> roof

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the snow here and farther down the roof

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.030 
the snow here and farther down the roof
though<00:02:00.090> I've<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.420> raked<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> away<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
though I've not raked it away and of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.219 
though I've not raked it away and of
course<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.490> snowpack<00:02:02.909> melts<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.960> soon

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
course that snowpack melts and as soon

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
course that snowpack melts and as soon
as<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.439> flows<00:02:05.040> down<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.820> touches<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
as it flows down and touches the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
as it flows down and touches the
ice-cold<00:02:07.020> gutter<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.500> starts<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> freeze

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
ice-cold gutter it starts to freeze

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.089 
ice-cold gutter it starts to freeze
instantly<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.470> process<00:02:10.830> continues

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
instantly and as this process continues

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.820 
instantly and as this process continues
to<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.810> ice<00:02:12.989> gets<00:02:13.290> thicker

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to go on the ice gets thicker

this<00:03:06.180> perfect<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:07.350> what<00:03:07.590> happened<00:03:07.980> here

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
this perfect so what happened here

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.300 
this perfect so what happened here
why<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.820> there<00:03:09.420> no<00:03:09.630> ice<00:03:09.959> dam<00:03:10.260> here<00:03:10.620> I'll<00:03:11.040> tell

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
why is there no ice dam here I'll tell

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.010 
why is there no ice dam here I'll tell
you<00:03:11.459> why<00:03:11.640> this<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.360> because<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.900> my

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
you why this is because this is my

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.960 
you why this is because this is my
garage<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.860> what's<00:03:14.160> happening<00:03:14.550> inside<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
garage and what's happening inside the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.970 
garage and what's happening inside the
garage<00:03:15.180> there's<00:03:15.510> no<00:03:15.690> heat<00:03:15.930> there<00:03:16.200> there's<00:03:16.740> no

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
garage there's no heat there there's no

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
garage there's no heat there there's no
heat<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.730> comes<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.570> melts<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.140> snow

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
heat that comes up and melts the snow

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.920 
heat that comes up and melts the snow
pack<00:03:19.680> which<00:03:20.400> then<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:21.180> meltwater<00:03:21.540> flows

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
pack which then that meltwater flows

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.390 
pack which then that meltwater flows
down<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.440> coat<00:03:22.680> edge<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.040> roof<00:03:23.220> and

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
down to the coat edge of the roof and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.199 
down to the coat edge of the roof and
freezes<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.989> if<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.890> want<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.280> stop<00:03:26.580> ice<00:03:26.850> dams

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
freezes so if you want to stop ice dams

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.540 
freezes so if you want to stop ice dams
you've<00:03:27.630> got<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> couple<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.170> choices<00:03:28.410> -<00:03:28.920> one<00:03:29.220> one

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
you've got a couple of choices - one one

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.570 
you've got a couple of choices - one one
thing<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.880> do<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.650> get<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.769> snow<00:03:32.040> off<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.250> roof

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
thing to do is get the snow off the roof

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.490 
thing to do is get the snow off the roof
because<00:03:33.360> if<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.600> get<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.840> snow<00:03:33.900> off<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.260> roof

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
because if you get the snow off the roof

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.680 
because if you get the snow off the roof
using<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.950> snow<00:03:35.160> break<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.880> starve<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.540> ice

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
using a snow break you starve the ice

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.479 
using a snow break you starve the ice
dam<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.350> fuel<00:03:37.620> that<00:03:37.650> they<00:03:37.980> need<00:03:38.220> so

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
dam of the fuel that they need so

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.009 
dam of the fuel that they need so
there's<00:03:38.640> there's<00:03:38.940> basically<00:03:39.269> no<00:03:39.630> water

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
there's there's basically no water

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.470 
there's there's basically no water
coming<00:03:40.410> down<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.680> roof<00:03:41.040> you<00:03:41.970> know<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.150> freeze

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
coming down the roof you know to freeze

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.820 
coming down the roof you know to freeze
at<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.690> edge<00:03:43.370> number<00:03:44.370> two<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:46.019> can<00:03:46.230> possibly

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
at the edge number two you can possibly

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.199 
at the edge number two you can possibly
and<00:03:47.040> I'm<00:03:47.100> getting<00:03:47.310> ready<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.489> experiment<00:03:48.120> with

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
and I'm getting ready to experiment with

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.880 
and I'm getting ready to experiment with
this<00:03:48.360> imagine<00:03:49.050> if<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.260> were<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.470> put<00:03:49.709> a

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
this imagine if you were to put a

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.229 
this imagine if you were to put a
radiant<00:03:50.640> barrier<00:03:51.590> underneath<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:53.100> top<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.820> the

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
radiant barrier underneath on top of the

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.240 
radiant barrier underneath on top of the
insulation<00:03:54.750> making<00:03:55.440> sure<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.739> doesn't<00:03:55.769> touch

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
insulation making sure it doesn't touch

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.580 
insulation making sure it doesn't touch
the<00:03:56.459> insulation<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.660> runs<00:03:57.930> up<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
the insulation and it runs up the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.320 
the insulation and it runs up the
underside<00:03:59.100> of<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.310> roof<00:03:59.459> leaving<00:03:59.820> an<00:03:59.910> air<00:04:00.090> gap

finally<00:04:34.170> here's<00:04:34.770> why<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.040> water<00:04:35.490> leaks<00:04:36.030> into

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
finally here's why the water leaks into

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.720 
finally here's why the water leaks into
your<00:04:36.480> home<00:04:36.720> when<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.320> water<00:04:37.620> comes<00:04:37.980> down<00:04:38.250> the

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
your home when that water comes down the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.660 
your home when that water comes down the
roof<00:04:38.970> here's<00:04:39.840> what<00:04:40.050> happens<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.620> freezes<00:04:41.550> at

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
roof here's what happens it freezes at

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.430 
roof here's what happens it freezes at
the<00:04:41.760> edge<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.240> ice<00:04:42.390> builds<00:04:42.810> up<00:04:42.930> as<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:43.200> saw

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
the edge the ice builds up as you saw

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.580 
the edge the ice builds up as you saw
earlier<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.490> creates<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.660> dam<00:04:45.960> water

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
earlier and that creates the dam water

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.440 
earlier and that creates the dam water
builds<00:04:47.040> up<00:04:47.190> behind<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.640> dam<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:48.090> water

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
builds up behind the dam and that water

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.510 
builds up behind the dam and that water
runs<00:04:48.840> underneath<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.680> shingles<00:04:50.070> remember

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
runs underneath the shingles remember

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.490 
runs underneath the shingles remember
shingles<00:04:50.940> work<00:04:51.420> because<00:04:51.870> water<00:04:52.140> flows

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
shingles work because water flows

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.730 
shingles work because water flows
downhill<00:04:52.940> but<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.150> ice<00:04:54.390> dam<00:04:54.750> causes<00:04:55.650> the

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
downhill but that ice dam causes the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.890 
downhill but that ice dam causes the
water<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:56.070> pool<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.400> run<00:04:56.910> up<00:04:57.120> underneath<00:04:57.570> the

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
water to pool and run up underneath the

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.050 
water to pool and run up underneath the
shingles<00:04:58.010> that's<00:04:59.010> why<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.340> ice<00:04:59.670> and<00:04:59.910> water

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
shingles that's why the ice and water

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.240 
shingles that's why the ice and water
shield<00:05:00.360> products<00:05:00.780> work<00:05:01.050> because<00:05:01.830> they<00:05:02.010> simply

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
shield products work because they simply

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.290 
shield products work because they simply
do<00:05:02.670> not<00:05:02.700> allow<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:04.080> water<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.560> get<00:05:05.490> inside<00:05:06.060> the
