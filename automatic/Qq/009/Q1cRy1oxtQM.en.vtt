00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
season game it was pretty fun game not a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.010 
season game it was pretty fun game not a
lot<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> opportunities<00:00:20.300> but<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.720> here

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
lot of opportunities but right here

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.320 
lot of opportunities but right here
should<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.650> been<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.830> goal<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.250> don't<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.609> but

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
should have been a goal I don't know but

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.200 
should have been a goal I don't know but
anyways<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.890> main<00:00:26.130> reason<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.580> video<00:00:26.939> is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
anyways the main reason this video is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.130 
anyways the main reason this video is
going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.830> important<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.130> because<00:00:30.140> this

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
going to be important is because this

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.220 
going to be important is because this
also<00:00:31.410> has<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.040> playoffs<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.149> well<00:00:33.719> as

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
also has the playoffs in it as well as

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.549 
also has the playoffs in it as well as
my<00:00:35.100> offseason<00:00:35.520> decisions<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:37.170> haven't

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
my offseason decisions and I haven't

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410 
my offseason decisions and I haven't
made<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.739> decision<00:00:37.920> yet<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:38.730> leaving<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.239> up

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
made that decision yet I'm leaving it up

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.319 
made that decision yet I'm leaving it up
to<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> guys<00:00:40.250> for<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.309> most<00:00:41.399> part<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.090> you

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to you guys for the most part if you

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
to you guys for the most part if you
guys<00:00:42.480> tell<00:00:42.780> me<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.530> guys<00:00:43.649> tell<00:00:43.890> me<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
guys tell me this if you guys tell me to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
guys tell me this if you guys tell me to
stay<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.460> mls<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.840> I'll<00:00:45.930> probably<00:00:46.110> say<00:00:46.559> no

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
stay at mls then I'll probably say no

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
stay at mls then I'll probably say no
because<00:00:47.039> there's<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.090> enough<00:00:48.149> coal

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because there's just not enough coal

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.479

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
this regular season game done we were

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.890 
this regular season game done we were
actually<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.640> top<00:01:32.850> team<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.509> our

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
actually like the top team in our

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920 
actually like the top team in our
conference<00:01:35.420> actually<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.479> wasn't<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.750> tie

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
conference actually it wasn't the tie

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.480 
conference actually it wasn't the tie
the<00:01:36.990> game<00:01:37.229> that's<00:01:37.409> right<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.280> penalty

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the game that's right that the penalty

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.850 
the game that's right that the penalty
kick<00:01:38.880> got<00:01:39.210> saved<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.200> i<00:01:40.229> was<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.650> win

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
kick got saved so i was actually to win

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.649 
kick got saved so i was actually to win
the<00:01:40.979> game<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.640> real<00:01:41.790> clutch<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:42.390> part

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the game so it's real clutch on my part

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.190 
the game so it's real clutch on my part
but<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:44.180> know<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.329> had<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.930> good<00:01:46.049> season

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
playoffs work is it's a home-and-home

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.490 
playoffs work is it's a home-and-home
series<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.270> it's<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> two-game<00:02:45.780> series<00:02:46.110> and

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
series so it's a two-game series and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.860 
series so it's a two-game series and
it's<00:02:47.160> based<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.550> aggregate<00:02:48.030> score<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.660> if<00:02:48.750> they

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
it's based on aggregate score so if they

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.050 
it's based on aggregate score so if they
score<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> goal<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.709> first<00:02:49.860> game<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:50.940> would

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
score a goal in the first game we would

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.580 
score a goal in the first game we would
have<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.300> score<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.600> goal<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.080> second<00:02:52.470> game

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590

in<00:02:52.830> order<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.130> tie<00:02:53.310> them<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.480> basically

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
in order to tie them and it basically

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.830 
in order to tie them and it basically
just<00:02:55.020> be<00:02:55.290> based<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.070> total<00:02:56.489> goals<00:02:56.820> scored<00:02:57.270> so

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
just be based on total goals scored so

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.570 
just be based on total goals scored so
if<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.050> ended<00:02:58.200> up<00:02:58.320> losing<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:58.830> three<00:02:59.100> nil<00:02:59.310> in

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
if you ended up losing like three nil in

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.310 
if you ended up losing like three nil in
the<00:02:59.850> first<00:03:00.060> game<00:03:00.300> you'd<00:03:00.570> have<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.840> score<00:03:01.050> four

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
the first game you'd have to score four

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.660 
the first game you'd have to score four
goals<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.830> next<00:03:02.040> game<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.310> be<00:03:02.430> able<00:03:02.520> to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
presentation is that it wasn't really

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.020 
presentation is that it wasn't really
that<00:03:09.660> different<00:03:10.400> but<00:03:11.400> right<00:03:11.550> here<00:03:11.700> they<00:03:11.850> get<00:03:12.000> a

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
that different but right here they get a

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.590 
that different but right here they get a
corner<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:13.200> was<00:03:13.560> defended<00:03:14.010> pretty<00:03:14.250> well<00:03:14.600> but

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
corner I was defended pretty well but

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.120 
corner I was defended pretty well but
