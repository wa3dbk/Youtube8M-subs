inches now why would you have a V funnel

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.820 
inches now why would you have a V funnel
that<00:01:57.340> incidentally<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:58.420> very<00:01:59.320> compatible

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
that incidentally is very compatible

now<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.189> way<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.819> reason<00:02:16.120> why<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.680> because

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
now the way is the reason why is because

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.449 
now the way is the reason why is because
the<00:02:18.609> throat<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.480> bee<00:02:19.920> funnel<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.069> two

pipe<00:03:10.959> for<00:03:11.200> example<00:03:11.620> will<00:03:11.950> go<00:03:12.159> right<00:03:12.340> inside

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
pipe for example will go right inside

but<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.329> down<00:03:13.540> pipe<00:03:13.870> goes<00:03:14.169> inside<00:03:14.919> what<00:03:15.310> I've

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
but the down pipe goes inside what I've

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.970 
but the down pipe goes inside what I've
got<00:03:15.849> here<00:03:15.879> which<00:03:16.389> is<00:03:16.569> called<00:03:16.840> they<00:03:17.470> drain

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
got here which is called they drain

way off to the storm sewer goes it's

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.719 
way off to the storm sewer goes it's
just<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:36.849> easy<00:03:37.379> but<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.560> drain<00:03:38.889> guard<00:03:39.280> what

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:39.729 
just that easy but the drain guard what

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:43.229 
just that easy but the drain guard what
does<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.209> do<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:41.709> drain<00:03:42.099> guard<00:03:42.459> because<00:03:42.729> of

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
does it do the drain guard because of

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.930 
does it do the drain guard because of

pipe and into the drain guard and look

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.069 
pipe and into the drain guard and look
what<00:03:59.859> the<00:03:59.979> drain<00:04:00.220> guard<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.919> screened

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
what the drain guard is it's a screened

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.330 
what the drain guard is it's a screened
little<00:04:05.079> bucket<00:04:06.090> with<00:04:07.090> holes<00:04:07.359> in<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.870> add<00:04:08.340> after

the<00:04:12.189> drain<00:04:12.489> guard<00:04:14.729> take<00:04:15.729> them<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.060> little

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
the drain guard take them a little

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.589 
the drain guard take them a little
bucket<00:04:16.509> out<00:04:17.669> don't<00:04:18.669> both<00:04:18.909> the<00:04:19.120> leaves<00:04:19.329> and
