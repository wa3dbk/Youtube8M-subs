00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
ok I see about this in the corner I

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.300

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
so maybe you're trying that you have to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.940 
so maybe you're trying that you have to
train<00:01:51.479> them<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> different<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.640> horses<00:01:54.950> can

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950

be<00:01:56.009> convinced<00:01:56.700> they're<00:01:56.939> small<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:58.079> because

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
be convinced they're small one because

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.289

is not this is the food we have a lot of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.030 
is not this is the food we have a lot of
time<00:03:07.569> so<00:03:08.569> that's<00:03:08.750> about<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.049> basically<00:03:09.829> what<00:03:10.010> I

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
time so that's about it basically what I

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.680 
time so that's about it basically what I
did<00:03:10.160> about<00:03:10.430> five<00:03:10.790> minutes<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.299> how<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.510> get<00:03:11.629> a

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
did about five minutes is how to get a

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.119 
did about five minutes is how to get a
bunch<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:11.989> different<00:03:12.079> angles<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.680> we're

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
bunch of different angles and we're

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.800 
bunch of different angles and we're
working<00:03:13.340> for<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.819> one<00:03:14.090> particular<00:03:14.239> shot

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
working for that one particular shot

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.140 
working for that one particular shot
that<00:03:15.079> would<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.769> good<00:03:15.950> postcard<00:03:16.609> shot<00:03:16.819> what<00:03:17.120> I

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that would be good postcard shot what I

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.699 
that would be good postcard shot what I
call<00:03:17.389> so<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.630> take<00:03:17.840> thirty<00:03:18.200> forty<00:03:18.590> four

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
call so you take thirty forty four

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.620 
call so you take thirty forty four
different<00:03:19.010> angles<00:03:19.310> take<00:03:20.030> some<00:03:20.180> foreground

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
different angles take some foreground

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.960 
different angles take some foreground
framing<00:03:21.049> types<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.410> high<00:03:21.560> angles<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.819> go

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
framing types of high angles and you go

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.140 
framing types of high angles and you go
for<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.239> shot<00:03:23.859> hopefully<00:03:24.859> will<00:03:25.730> yield<00:03:25.970> the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
for the shot hopefully will yield the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.180 
for the shot hopefully will yield the
best<00:03:26.299> usually<00:03:27.230> with<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.470> ten<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.799> twenty<00:03:28.069> two

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
best usually with a ten to twenty two
