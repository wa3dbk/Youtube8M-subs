 dust pollens allergens and hairs 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.020
 of animals millions of robot 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.820
 vacuum roomba were sold in the 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.380
 whole world 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.320
 the powerful suction of rumba cleans

 vacuum cleaner adapts automatically to 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060
 different types of soil during its

 displacement 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.420
 the patented cleaning system in 3 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.970
 rumba steps can suck

 cleans the walls 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.020
 then two reverse-rotation brushes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.239
 get dirty dirt these 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.190
 residues finally everything is powerfully 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.660
 inspired in the tray or the filters in 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 dust prison and all the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.870
 fine particles rumba sucks under the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.159
 beds and hard-to-reach areas 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.409
 unlike the old broom vacuum 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.970
 rumba cleans tight spaces 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.800
 but also under and around furniture 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.390
 rumba also uses wolf technology 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.549
 hall high to suck along the walls

 examine the environment more than 60 times 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 per second using multiple 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.119
 sensors and dozens of program the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.830
 bumper the tactile sensitivity of 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.420
 rumba dampens the contacts between the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.430

 hepa rumba filters imprisons the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
 fine particles that's reducing the

 vacuum cleaner pick up big stock 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.700
 quantities of hair and hair plush 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.250
 of tissue and other residues so it has 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.619
 no need to be emptied and frequently 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 sophisticated detection technology 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.950
 other details of rumba uses some 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.380
 optical and acoustic sensors for

 the intense cleaning function ps is 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.820
 in the cleaning process of the robot vacuum cleaner 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.740
 allows him thanks to his displacement 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.240
 repeat from front to back to clean 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.730
 thoroughly same reasons most 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.959
 dirty for salt accumulations is 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.150
 more localized the way of cleaning 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.680
 targeted clean rumba spot made 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.680
 quickly disappear the residues 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.430
 with these special sensors the robot 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.480
 vacuum cleaner detect life the stairs and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.579
 impractical rumba waves spire when

 the old complete cleaning or targeted and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.019
 to drive the robot vacuum cleaner in the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.769
 piece with rumba nothing is ever 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.079
 left to chance 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.700
 when the bin is painted a light 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.879
 light tells you it needs to be

 carefully several pieces the wall 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.359
 virtual virtual lighthouse ensures that 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.729
 the robot vacuum cleaner has completely finished 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.250
