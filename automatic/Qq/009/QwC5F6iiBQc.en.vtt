probably my most played game mode for a
while<00:00:47.340> there<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.629> played<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> bunch<00:00:49.050> here

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
on strike zone I never knew that if you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.700 
on strike zone I never knew that if you
were<00:00:51.539> used<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.780> come<00:00:51.960> behind<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.350> statute

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
were used to come behind this statute

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
were used to come behind this statute
you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.980> almost<00:00:53.160> essentially<00:00:53.699> spawn<00:00:54.180> kill

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you can almost essentially spawn kill

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
you can almost essentially spawn kill
people<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:55.829> popping<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
people as they are popping up and it is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.790 
people as they are popping up and it is
ridiculous<00:00:57.570> because<00:00:57.629> he<00:00:58.079> kills<00:00:58.320> these<00:00:58.440> people

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
ridiculous because he kills these people

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.049 
ridiculous because he kills these people
they<00:00:58.949> realize<00:00:59.309> where<00:00:59.489> he's<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.730> by<00:00:59.879> watching

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
they realize where he's at by watching

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.580 
they realize where he's at by watching
the<00:01:00.270> killcam<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.899> everyone<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.410> kind

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590

coming from and of course there's a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.870 
coming from and of course there's a
couple<00:01:07.470> funny<00:01:07.770> moments<00:01:08.220> where<00:01:08.340> people<00:01:08.369> kind

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
couple funny moments where people kind

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.840 
couple funny moments where people kind
of<00:01:09.030> spawn<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.420> directly<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.049> him<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.850> that's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
of spawn like directly in him and that's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.030 
of spawn like directly in him and that's
just<00:01:12.030> kind<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.390> blitz<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.530> weird<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.950> me

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
demolition was kind of torch for being a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.429 
demolition was kind of torch for being a
spawn<00:01:18.240> trapping<00:01:18.509> game<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:18.990> he<00:01:19.110> gets<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> Kem
