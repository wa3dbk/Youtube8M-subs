00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.389 
with any spindle turning you want to
work<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> end<00:01:42.720> by<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> tailstock<00:01:43.860> back

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
work from the end by the tailstock back

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.940 
work from the end by the tailstock back
because<00:01:44.940> if<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.330> make<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> thin<00:01:45.960> now<00:01:46.200> this

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
because if you make this thin now this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.530 
because if you make this thin now this
will<00:01:47.130> probably<00:01:47.280> break<00:01:47.610> or<00:01:47.850> wobble<00:01:48.210> too<00:01:48.360> much

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
will probably break or wobble too much

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.430 
will probably break or wobble too much
while<00:01:48.720> you're<00:01:48.750> turning<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.229> we're<00:01:49.320> gonna

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440

just gonna be an icicle you know that
long<00:01:56.880> tapered<00:01:57.660> shape<00:01:58.910> it's<00:01:59.910> a<00:02:00.030> great<00:02:00.210> project

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
long tapered shape it's a great project

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.050 
long tapered shape it's a great project
for<00:02:00.720> tool<00:02:01.050> control<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:02.220> it's<00:02:02.429> purple<00:02:02.670> hearts

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
for tool control now it's purple hearts

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.359 
for tool control now it's purple hearts
a<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.479> brittle<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.410> chippy<00:02:04.830> but

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
tapering this I'm gonna take my tool

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.190 
tapering this I'm gonna take my tool
rest<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.670> just<00:02:22.940> turn<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.480> at<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.720> angle<00:02:24.170> that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
rest and just turn it at the angle that

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.710 
rest and just turn it at the angle that
I<00:02:24.349> want<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:25.280> way<00:02:25.489> my<00:02:25.670> finger<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:26.270> we'll

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
I want that way my finger now we'll

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.330 
I want that way my finger now we'll
follow<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.349> angle<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:27.860> it's<00:02:28.010> easier<00:02:28.280> to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
follow this angle and it's easier to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:45.610 
follow this angle and it's easier to
make<00:02:28.550> that<00:02:28.580> shape<00:02:43.900> now<00:02:44.900> if<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.140> tapers<00:02:45.590> a

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
make that shape now if you tapers a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.199 
make that shape now if you tapers a
little<00:02:45.890> bumpy<00:02:46.190> don't<00:02:46.580> worry<00:02:46.790> about<00:02:46.970> it

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
want to start rounding the end here

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.530 
want to start rounding the end here
because<00:02:54.799> this<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.160> gonna<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.670> ball<00:02:55.910> on<00:02:56.360> the

because this is gonna be the ball on the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.270 
because this is gonna be the ball on the
end<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:57.080> remember<00:02:57.319> we've<00:02:57.620> got<00:02:57.799> that<00:02:58.010> hole

drilled<00:02:58.640> in<00:02:58.760> there<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.569> hole<00:02:59.930> probably<00:03:00.380> goes

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
drilled in there that hole probably goes

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.050 
drilled in there that hole probably goes
about<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:00.980> deep<00:03:01.280> right<00:03:01.519> here<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:01.819> I've<00:03:01.910> got

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
about this deep right here so I've got

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.949 
about this deep right here so I've got
to<00:03:02.209> get<00:03:02.330> as<00:03:02.450> close<00:03:02.569> as<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.900> can<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
to get as close as I can to that to the

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.500 
to get as close as I can to that to the
jaws<00:03:06.260> here<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:07.069> make<00:03:07.220> this<00:03:07.370> shut<00:03:07.730> if<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.239> bump

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
jaws here to make this shut if you bump

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.100 
jaws here to make this shut if you bump
that<00:03:08.660> don't<00:03:08.900> worry<00:03:09.080> about<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.440> that's<00:03:09.769> life

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
just don't cut into it like that now if

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.339 
just don't cut into it like that now if
you<00:03:14.209> cut<00:03:14.330> into<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.630> like<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.780> that's<00:03:15.049> a<00:03:15.200> bad

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
you cut into it like that that's a bad

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.770 
you cut into it like that that's a bad
you<00:03:15.530> anyway<00:03:16.099> back<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.000> smaller<00:03:17.269> tool<00:03:17.510> side

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
you anyway back to the smaller tool side

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.330 
you anyway back to the smaller tool side
a<00:03:17.870> little<00:03:17.989> more<00:03:18.170> room<00:03:19.180> okay

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.050 

we'll<00:03:22.760> work<00:03:22.940> our<00:03:23.090> way<00:03:23.120> back<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:24.550> think<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:25.790> I

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
we'll work our way back I think so I

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.790 
we'll work our way back I think so I
don't<00:03:26.390> want<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.870> finish<00:03:27.050> this<00:03:27.319> cut<00:03:27.530> yet

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
don't want to finish this cut yet

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.250 
don't want to finish this cut yet

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
because I'm going to sand this now and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:48.820 
because I'm going to sand this now and
clean<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.800> up

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830

now<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.550> we've<00:03:49.670> sanded<00:03:50.090> it's<00:03:50.270> time<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.600> park

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
now that we've sanded it's time to park

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.160 
now that we've sanded it's time to park
this<00:03:51.050> off<00:03:51.460> I'm<00:03:52.460> gonna<00:03:52.790> make<00:03:53.510> some<00:03:53.690> little<00:03:53.870> cuts

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
this off I'm gonna make some little cuts

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.680 
this off I'm gonna make some little cuts
in<00:03:54.320> like<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.620> I'm<00:03:54.830> using<00:03:55.040> my<00:03:55.480> finger<00:03:56.480> up

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
in like this I'm using my finger up

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.360 
in like this I'm using my finger up
against<00:03:56.960> the<00:03:57.080> two<00:03:57.230> RS<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.800> just<00:03:58.040> lightly

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
against the two RS and just lightly

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.890 
against the two RS and just lightly
touching<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:58.970> wood<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.330> give<00:03:59.450> this<00:03:59.570> a<00:03:59.630> little

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
touching the wood to give this a little

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.080 
touching the wood to give this a little
support<00:04:02.260> we're<00:04:03.260> gonna<00:04:03.470> round<00:04:04.010> this<00:04:04.340> off<00:04:04.520> a<00:04:04.550> bit

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
support we're gonna round this off a bit
