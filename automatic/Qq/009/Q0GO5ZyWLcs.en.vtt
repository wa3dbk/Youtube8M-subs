in<00:01:14.880> standstill<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> match<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.080> i<00:01:16.110> think

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
in standstill with a match so i think

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.530 
in standstill with a match so i think
that's<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:17.729> statistics<00:01:18.360> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that's that's pretty good statistics you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.810 
that's that's pretty good statistics you
know<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.259> would<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> 60<00:01:20.220> winner<00:01:20.400> center

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
know if it would be a 60 winner center

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.230 
know if it would be a 60 winner center
and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.390> would<00:01:21.570> lose<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> match<00:01:22.700> or<00:01:23.700> win<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and I would lose that match or win this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
and I would lose that match or win this
match<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.689> way<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.200> would<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.890> think

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
match this way that would be I think

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.929 
match this way that would be I think
that<00:01:27.030> would<00:01:27.119> suck<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.570> bit<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.850> do<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that would suck a little bit more do you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.920 
that would suck a little bit more do you
think<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> things<00:01:30.600> that's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
think that's one of the things that's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
think that's one of the things that's
changed<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.560> opposed<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> maybe<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> year<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.520> 18

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
changed as opposed to maybe a year or 18

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.149 
changed as opposed to maybe a year or 18
months<00:01:32.880> ago<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.600> get<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.409> these

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
months ago that you get out of these

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.740 
months ago that you get out of these
situations<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:36.650> yeah<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.860> sure<00:01:38.750> before

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
situations now yeah for sure before

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.020 
situations now yeah for sure before
maybe<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.049> would<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.470> give<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> go<00:01:41.460> home<00:01:41.579> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
maybe I would just give up and go home I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.300 
maybe I would just give up and go home I
was<00:01:42.750> kind<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.020> thinking<00:01:43.079> there's<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.740> flight

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.510 
was kind of thinking there's a flight
straight<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.850> Minsk<00:01:45.180> around<00:01:45.689> 30<00:01:46.189> tomorrow<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
straight to Minsk around 30 tomorrow so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.560 
straight to Minsk around 30 tomorrow so
I<00:01:47.729> could<00:01:48.329> catch<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.909> I<00:01:50.909> didn't<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I could catch that but I didn't want to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.200 
I could catch that but I didn't want to
leave<00:01:51.750> too<00:01:51.899> soon

another<00:01:59.210> unexplained<00:02:00.080> explanation<00:02:00.980> for<00:02:01.190> that

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
another unexplained explanation for that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.160
