have this like droopy satchel thing that

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.380 
have this like droopy satchel thing that
you're<00:03:38.470> hanging<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.220> don't<00:03:39.760> like<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.030> it's

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.810 
hasn't yet but I think they could have
coated<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> little<00:03:46.720> bit<00:03:47.160> anyway<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.220> we'll

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
coated it a little bit anyway so we'll

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.819 
coated it a little bit anyway so we'll

cute<00:04:04.600> fully<00:04:04.870> loaded<00:04:05.170> these<00:04:05.709> are<00:04:05.890> considered

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
cute fully loaded these are considered

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.860 
cute fully loaded these are considered
to<00:04:06.459> be<00:04:06.489> pockets<00:04:07.030> but<00:04:07.329> they're<00:04:07.450> kind<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.720> tight

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
to be pockets but they're kind of tight

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.289 
to be pockets but they're kind of tight
tight<00:04:08.530> like<00:04:08.739> your<00:04:08.890> jeans<00:04:09.160> would<00:04:09.459> be<00:04:09.670> if<00:04:09.910> you

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
tight like your jeans would be if you

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.210 
tight like your jeans would be if you
have<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.600> fully<00:04:10.750> loaded<00:04:11.079> if<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:12.010> fully

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
have it fully loaded if it is fully

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.340 
have it fully loaded if it is fully
loaded<00:04:12.459> it<00:04:12.820> holds<00:04:13.150> its<00:04:13.299> shape<00:04:13.359> if<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:14.170> not

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
loaded it holds its shape if it's not

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.140 
loaded it holds its shape if it's not
fully<00:04:14.590> loaded<00:04:14.859> then<00:04:15.190> it's<00:04:15.340> quite<00:04:15.549> droopy<00:04:15.940> but

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
fully loaded then it's quite droopy but

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.340 
fully loaded then it's quite droopy but
you<00:04:16.239> might<00:04:16.419> be<00:04:16.539> able<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.720> fit<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:16.930> bottle<00:04:17.260> in

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
you might be able to fit a bottle in

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.509 
you might be able to fit a bottle in
there<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.680> think<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:19.200> could<00:04:20.200> maybe<00:04:20.350> fit<00:04:20.620> socks<00:04:21.220> or

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
there I think I could maybe fit socks or

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.300 
there I think I could maybe fit socks or
some<00:04:22.300> baby<00:04:23.229> legs<00:04:23.500> or<00:04:23.710> something<00:04:24.039> like<00:04:24.130> that

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
some baby legs or something like that

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.100 
some baby legs or something like that
and<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.180> other<00:04:25.270> problem<00:04:25.660> these

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
and this is the other problem these

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.680 
and this is the other problem these
snaps<00:04:26.440> pop<00:04:27.250> off<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.849> then<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.419> have<00:04:28.539> that

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
snaps pop off and then you have that

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.630 
snaps pop off and then you have that
shape<00:04:28.990> which<00:04:29.530> isn't<00:04:29.710> very<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:30.039> try

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
shape which isn't very a try

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.490 
shape which isn't very a try
so<00:04:30.790> like<00:04:31.510> this<00:04:31.660> snaps<00:04:31.840> barely<00:04:32.230> hold<00:04:32.380> together

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
so like this snaps barely hold together

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.170 
so like this snaps barely hold together
