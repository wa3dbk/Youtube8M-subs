00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
with either speaker they both do the job

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.060 
with either speaker they both do the job
well<00:06:39.669> enough<00:06:39.700> to<00:06:40.450> my<00:06:40.600> ears<00:06:40.900> the<00:06:41.350> Patriot

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
well enough to my ears the Patriot

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.740 
well enough to my ears the Patriot
sounds<00:06:42.400> a<00:06:42.520> little<00:06:42.730> brighter<00:06:43.030> than<00:06:43.450> the<00:06:43.630> B

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
sounds a little brighter than the B

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.320 
sounds a little brighter than the B
garriga's<00:06:44.230> and<00:06:44.530> I<00:06:44.560> would<00:06:45.490> say<00:06:45.790> a<00:06:46.000> little

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
garriga's and I would say a little

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.400 
garriga's and I would say a little
smoother<00:06:46.930> sounding<00:06:47.470> than<00:06:47.620> the<00:06:47.740> B<00:06:47.860> Guerra<00:06:48.240> does

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
smoother sounding than the B Guerra does

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.719 
smoother sounding than the B Guerra does
when<00:06:50.410> the<00:06:50.500> speaker<00:06:50.830> breaks<00:06:51.040> up<00:06:51.250> the<00:06:51.280> Eminence

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
when the speaker breaks up the Eminence

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:54.180 
when the speaker breaks up the Eminence
isn't<00:06:52.210> quite<00:06:52.600> as<00:06:52.750> harsh<00:06:53.050> as<00:06:53.440> that<00:06:53.830> you<00:06:53.919> Guerra

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
isn't quite as harsh as that you Guerra

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.950 
isn't quite as harsh as that you Guerra
is<00:06:54.430> I<00:06:54.729> would<00:06:54.940> say<00:06:55.060> I<00:06:55.090> like<00:06:55.360> the<00:06:55.479> Patriot<00:06:55.900> a
