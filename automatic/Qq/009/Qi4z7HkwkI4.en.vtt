in<00:00:07.939> the<00:00:08.029> first<00:00:08.300> iPhone<00:00:08.510> release<00:00:09.019> there

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290

they're<00:00:09.500> getting<00:00:09.740> close<00:00:10.010> we<00:00:10.220> think<00:00:10.340> it'll

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
they're getting close we think it'll

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:11.860 
they're getting close we think it'll
probably<00:00:10.519> be<00:00:10.790> like<00:00:10.820> a<00:00:10.970> month<00:00:11.120> or<00:00:11.510> two

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
probably be like a month or two

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.869

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
we are hoping you really turned it into

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.730 
we are hoping you really turned it into
a<00:03:21.300> major<00:03:21.570> part<00:03:21.960> of<00:03:22.020> our<00:03:22.140> software<00:03:22.500> going

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
a major part of our software going

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.410 
a major part of our software going
forward<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.370> now<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.000> sort<00:03:24.270> of<00:03:24.360> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
forward but for now it's just sort of a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.070 
forward but for now it's just sort of a
little<00:03:25.130> kind<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.310> functional<00:03:26.730> preview<00:03:27.240> but

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
little kind of functional preview but

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.570 
little kind of functional preview but
anyway<00:03:28.380> we<00:03:28.500> think<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.860> really<00:03:29.100> cool<00:03:29.280> thing

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
anyway we think it's a really cool thing

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.110 
anyway we think it's a really cool thing
to<00:03:29.850> have

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.790 
to have
so<00:03:30.720> one<00:03:30.870> final<00:03:31.050> thing<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.530> show<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.680> is

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
so one final thing to show you is

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.640 
so one final thing to show you is
landscape<00:03:32.550> mode<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.690> can<00:03:33.840> see<00:03:34.020> I've<00:03:34.170> rotated

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
landscape mode you can see I've rotated

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.230
