00:00:03.426 --> 00:00:04.846
&gt;&gt;Ameer: Managing game play is just

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:07.166
like managing other learning
activities in your classroom.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:08.826
You'll know you're on the right track

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:11.706
when you see your students
helping each other, having fun,

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.416
and reflecting on what they're learning.

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:17.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So mark it first, good, good.

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:24.296
&gt;&gt;Student: So I get one, nine, so
yellow gets one and I get one number,

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:28.936
it's only the mushroom, so I only
have one oh, that's the nine.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.956
&gt;&gt;So you got those.

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:32.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Who's the game master?

00:00:32.076 --> 00:00:32.426
&gt;&gt;Student: I am.

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:36.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, then Cole, you
shouldn't even be doing this.

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:38.566
&gt;&gt;Ameer: So how do you manage game play?

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:43.436
Step one, think about how
you manage your classroom.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.516
A game isn't some sort of
special zone where anything goes.

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:49.036
Before using a game, think about rules

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:51.156
and procedures you already
have in your classroom.

00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:53.556
Leverage those to manage game play.

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:57.126
For example, what are your rules
for cleanup after an activity?

00:00:57.706 --> 00:01:00.066
Review those rules with your
students and apply them here.

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:02.826
Step two, everyone plays a role.

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:05.156
Depending on the type
of game you're using,

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:06.746
you may want to create student roles.

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:09.996
One role may be a material
manager who hands out,

00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:11.856
organizes and collects game pieces.

00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:16.306
Other roles could be a time
keeper, note taker or scorekeeper.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.976
Step one, be a facilitator
not a firefighter.

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:25.236
Even if the answer to a question is a
simple yes or no, guide your students

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:26.776
to discover the answer on their own,

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:30.836
and if several students have the
same question, stop game play

00:01:30.836 --> 00:01:33.046
and have a quick class
discussion about that question.

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:35.886
Step two, iterate and improvise.

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.436
If there's a common concern that
develops, go ahead and make changes

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:40.666
to the game right then and there.

00:01:41.086 --> 00:01:43.666
Who knows, you might create
a unique game that opens

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.996
up new learning for your students.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.406
Step three, be a cheerleader.

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:51.356
Support students in their
learning through game play.

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:54.686
Keep an eye out for great moves or
successful strategies that occur

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:55.916
and share them with the class.

00:01:56.726 --> 00:01:58.536
Step four, wrap it up.

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:02.696
Plan ahead for the possibility that your
students might not fully finish the game

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:06.346
by the end of class, so make sure you're
clear on how you'll return to the game.

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.066
Gather feedback.

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:11.986
For example, ask your students what they
learned from the game, what they liked

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:14.476
and disliked, and what they
might change about the game.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:15.626
Thanks for watching.

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:18.086
Now go ahead and try
it in your classroom.

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:22.396
Next, to learn how to assess student
learning during and after game play,
