houses under construction and what they

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.060 
houses under construction and what they
do<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> brick<00:01:21.740> after<00:01:22.690> they<00:01:23.690> put<00:01:24.070> the

parching<00:01:25.790> on<00:01:25.970> top<00:01:26.350> it's<00:01:27.350> called<00:01:27.710> kabocha<00:01:32.410> but

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
parching on top it's called kabocha but

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.120 
parching on top it's called kabocha but
before<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:35.570> could<00:01:35.780> be<00:01:35.979> purging<00:01:36.979> on<00:01:37.570> they

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
before it could be purging on they

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.690 
before it could be purging on they
splash<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.399> with<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.850> cement<00:01:42.340> with<00:01:43.340> cement

splash it with the cement with cement

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.080 
splash it with the cement with cement
mix<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:46.300> that<00:01:47.300> allows<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.310> forging<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.520> stick

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
mix and that allows the forging to stick

you're<00:03:02.250> wondering<00:03:02.670> well<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.989> could<00:03:04.829> hold<00:03:05.160> it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
you're wondering well they could hold it

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.080 
you're wondering well they could hold it
so<00:03:06.510> they<00:03:07.079> can<00:03:07.320> stick<00:03:08.190> boards<00:03:08.609> through<00:03:08.880> to

so they can stick boards through to

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.960 
so they can stick boards through to
great<00:03:09.299> flat<00:03:09.540> forms<00:03:09.930> kind<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.970> wooden

process the parching it also gets mixed

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.759 
process the parching it also gets mixed
into<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:43.350> other<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:44.310> finds<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.769> it's

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
into the the other this finds and it's

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.259 
into the the other this finds and it's
very<00:03:47.069> fine<00:03:47.400> sand<00:03:48.019> this<00:03:49.459> only<00:03:50.459> uses<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.180> they

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
very fine sand this only uses that they

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.490 
very fine sand this only uses that they
want<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.480> use<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.630> little<00:03:51.930> bit<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.139> this<00:03:52.200> into

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
want to use a little bit of this into

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.660 
want to use a little bit of this into
the<00:03:52.730> volkl<00:03:53.730> process<00:03:55.040> they're<00:03:56.040> actually<00:03:56.400> the

the volkl process they're actually the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.190 
the volkl process they're actually the
interior<00:03:57.180> walls<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.630> is<00:03:57.780> only<00:03:57.930> clear

Foundation upper support also to the
pillars<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:35.139> was<00:04:35.800> talking<00:04:36.220> about<00:04:36.310> earlier<00:04:36.729> in

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
pillars I was talking about earlier in

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.370 
pillars I was talking about earlier in
the<00:04:37.330> fence<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:42.310> coarse<00:04:42.639> sand<00:04:43.199> is<00:04:44.199> not

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
the fence and this coarse sand is not

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.830 
the fence and this coarse sand is not
much<00:04:44.560> left<00:04:45.360> this<00:04:46.360> goes<00:04:46.690> into<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:48.630> laying<00:04:49.630> of

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
much left this goes into the laying of

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:59.760 
much left this goes into the laying of
the<00:04:49.960> bricks<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:56.470> of<00:04:56.949> course<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:58.320> think<00:04:59.320> what

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
the bricks and of course I think what

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.230 
the bricks and of course I think what
really<00:05:00.190> makes<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:01.210> stick<00:05:01.660> good<00:05:02.080> sometimes

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
really makes it stick good sometimes

really makes it stick good sometimes
some<00:05:04.240> dog<00:05:04.810> poo<00:05:05.229> mixed<00:05:06.070> in<00:05:06.250> there<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.870> let's<00:05:08.229> not

some dog poo mixed in there so let's not
get<00:05:08.800> confused<00:05:09.450> this<00:05:10.450> is<00:05:10.660> not<00:05:10.870> India<00:05:11.139> we<00:05:11.800> do<00:05:11.950> not

you

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.260 

in<00:06:05.550> some<00:06:05.850> houses<00:06:06.060> they<00:06:06.390> don't<00:06:06.570> bother

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.780 

so<00:06:14.070> hopefully<00:06:15.070> you<00:06:15.190> know<00:06:15.220> a<00:06:15.370> little<00:06:15.610> bit<00:06:15.730> more

so hopefully you know a little bit more
about<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.570> process<00:06:19.560> and<00:06:21.419> how<00:06:22.419> to<00:06:23.290> build<00:06:23.800> with

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
about the process and how to build with

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.650
