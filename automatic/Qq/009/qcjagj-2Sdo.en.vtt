00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.250
 this gentleman has here 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.760
 I do not know 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.360
 the ex-boyfriend you look at but 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.989
 the place 

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:09.899
 in a distant Mexico 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:11.419
 the fleeting 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.239
 a beautiful fishing village located in one of the most beautiful places in the 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:17.189
 central coast of cantabria 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.919
 of these wonderful fine sand beaches 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.550
 edgar of the summer attract thousands of visitors converting the estuary 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.149
 of suances in one of the main tourist attractions of 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.069
 Cantabria 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.970
 this does not mean that the economy can do something grant 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.570
 so the responsibility not organic gardens okabe 2 of decks to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.470
 0 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.530
 so the farmland 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.740
 workshop 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.470
 as they call them out yesterday they have always been very abundant 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.470
 and the agricultural and livestock fanatic a habitual activity 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.310
 and although I do not have the pleasure of meeting him in person, he considers him a friend because 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.210
 thanks to her I started with this project which for me has been a whole 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.910
 adventure 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.110
 for those who do not know the center 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.910
 My name is Ivan Miranda 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.640
 you can call me ya cariño emaná 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.010
 if you like yes no then no 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 but 28 years recently fulfilled by work like living in a nightclub 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.910
 lives in Tijuana the city considered the most visited property in the world 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.490
 20 minutes from the city of San Diego California 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.990
 the United States 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.460
 July for the fourth 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.439
 this city has become 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.829
 in the industrial political city with a very busy life 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.750
 and a diversity of races and social cultures 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.670
 amazing 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 a few people of my age and with the style of Iran 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.630
 as it is said barenboim in quotation marks would not occur to him 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.590
 an idea that thanks to my spend more ran anl 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.640
 one day my mother accompanies markets and in the distance you hear how people 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.360
 complained about the high prices of vegetable vegetables and the occasional 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.420
 fruit 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.920
 which left me with an idea in my head and since I'm a very restless guy 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.839
 when to the national average political unit some 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.839
 and put on an onslaught 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:18.839
 was the tape I was with the ceoe look at us interesting videos I realized that 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:24.569
 could win with very little but very little budget get to have food to 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.180
 daily in the comfort of home and practically without being absolutely 1 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.399
 3 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:35.680
 at the beginning and a Haitian gardening store compression and guides for 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.379
 plant them 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.540
 among them there was tomato habanero chile 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.709
 lettuce goals 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.709
 i the minister who does not pass 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.329
 if it were her the beginning of all this money of this nature 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.289
 my first problem I leave absolutely nothing of gardening 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.289
 much less of orchards 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.189
 much less organic 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.359
 there is a lot less of the care that this requires 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.379
 then I dare opened my eyes 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.639
 point number one create a bancal 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.249
 let's stay is this 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.929
 again awarded della sera 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:26.319
 who in a video I explain how to build it 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.699
 with keeping it 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.379
 just like they charged to continue 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.030
 at this time the cost of the balkans the first with residents of five 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:35.980
 centimeters 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.109
 and the second 30 centimeters tall 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.459
 no doubt for me 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.459
 it is preferable the second is that it is stronger 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.559
 I am planting one of eight red green mouths 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.559
 and buds of tudela 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.279
 a first advantage of the system is the community 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:08.739
 you just have to lean a little to reach the ground in the first bench 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.439
 fresh onions wait a few days to warm up little just for 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.610
 put the tomatoes 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.280
 I think they get along with them in the second the lettuces will go with the 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.569
 green beans 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.199
 for when they grow 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.599
 the silk of the commendator lettuces 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.599
 and they will not stay if only 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.980
 the economic issue does not allow me to put in drip irrigation this year 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.030
 I will not leave for the next one although seeing what can be done in position 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.170
 completely vertical to the best and my bed very brave and used it to 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.969
 two 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.539
 the position of the terraces is relatively simple if a 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.180
 good layout and has been done 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.479
 the movement of earth is important and the work must be taken calmly 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.730
 especially in these ages in which we thank you we are afraid that to marry 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:08.779
 much 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:13.899
 because then to get up there are some protests I hope to continue 

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:17.050
 Feeling of the experience of all foreros 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.450
 of those who know more 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.139
 and that we all know 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.139
 that they do not allow themselves to transmit to them what little we know 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.419
 thank you very much to all
