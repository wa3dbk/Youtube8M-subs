00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.690
 Hello everyone, I will cook deliciously 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.150
 and mashed potatoes in our family 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.760
 the recipe we had a lot of requests 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.110
 that's why we decided to make such a video 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.640
 what we do your 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.220
 your order is not so us for this 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.029
 I need a fresh potato and already 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.330
 cleaned up 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.560
 milk, butter and salt 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.810
 first thing we need to chop 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.850
 potatoes into smaller pieces to 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.010
 he cooked faster I will do it in 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:51.500
 hands and the one who can not cut and on 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:53.030
 on the plank so as not to cut yourself if 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.130
 very very finely chop it 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.780
 the potatoes just fall apart you 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.390
 you should be about all the pieces 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.260
 the same 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.940
 sure when you clean 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.460
 check the potatoes so that there is no 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.490
 eyes because it will then ugly 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.409
 mashed sliced â€‹â€‹potatoes fill with water 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.240
 so that he completely disappeared under water 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.950
 so here we are filled with water 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.990
 Now turn on the strong gas to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.829
 faster boil water cover the pan 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.770
 lid 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:26.749
 it saves gas and time the water boils 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.999
 we add salt and mix by the way 

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:31.579
 if foam appeared then it needs to be removed 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:33.939
 cover and leave to cook 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.079
 over low heat until ready 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.209
 potato readiness can be checked 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.459
 with a knife or fork potatoes with us 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:43.459
 boiled now we need to drain the water and 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:45.200
 leave a little can be caught or 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.170
 pans or heal into a mug then what 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.279
 add I already drained the water scored a bit into 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.590
 cup now add butter than me now 

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.700

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.280
 and now the most crucial moment 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.869
 you need to be potato 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.179
 careful because you can burn 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.680
 try to knead the potatoes well 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.480
 so that there are no lumps left at the beginning 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.989
 do it without adding fluid 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.989
 because it is so much easier 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.989
 pounding 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:46.980
 add some water that we leaked 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:48.630
 and continue to push the potatoes also not 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.340
 forget to try on salt if she 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.410
 not salting it can be salted 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.970
 add 200 grams of milk can 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:05.880
 Tristan depending on the amount 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:07.560
 add potatoes to take if you 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.250
