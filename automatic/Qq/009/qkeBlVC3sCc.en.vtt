00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
track is get enough speed there to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
track is get enough speed there to
launch<00:01:44.159> myself<00:01:44.369> into<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> lake<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> hit<00:01:45.720> the

launch myself into the lake and hit the
boat<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> water<00:01:46.619> has<00:01:47.280> anyone<00:01:47.610> else<00:01:47.729> tried

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
boat on the water has anyone else tried

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.749 
boat on the water has anyone else tried
that<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.899> game<00:01:49.140> doesn't<00:01:49.470> let<00:01:49.590> me<00:01:49.770> thanks<00:01:50.729> to

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
that my game doesn't let me thanks to

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.639 
that my game doesn't let me thanks to
the<00:01:50.939> awesome<00:01:51.149> design<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.140> course<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the awesome design of this course and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490 
the awesome design of this course and
the<00:01:53.100> death<00:01:53.399> star<00:01:53.790> style<00:01:54.210> tunnel<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the death star style tunnel I think it's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.550 
the death star style tunnel I think it's
safe<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> say<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.190> track<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.789> Lando<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:58.170> only

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
safe to say this track is Lando the only

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200 
safe to say this track is Lando the only
thing<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.979> would<00:01:59.100> make<00:01:59.159> trial<00:01:59.759> mountain

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
thing that would make trial mountain

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.870 
thing that would make trial mountain
better<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.720> if<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.380> added<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.070> patch<00:02:02.549> where

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
better is if they added a patch where

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
better is if they added a patch where
when<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.090> peek<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.689> your<00:02:03.720> rear-view<00:02:04.170> mirror
