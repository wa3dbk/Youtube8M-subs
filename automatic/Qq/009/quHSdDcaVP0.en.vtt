stir this or anything like that so you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.360 
stir this or anything like that so you
put<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> butter<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.110> pan<00:00:37.829> over<00:00:38.160> low<00:00:38.190> heat

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
put the butter in pan over low heat

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.970 
put the butter in pan over low heat
it'll<00:00:41.370> fully<00:00:41.610> melt<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.660> milk<00:00:42.980> solids

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it'll fully melt and the milk solids

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.080 
it'll fully melt and the milk solids
will<00:00:44.309> start<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.700> foam<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.210> rise<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.600> top

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
will start to foam and rise to the top

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
will start to foam and rise to the top
see<00:00:48.090> here's<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> milk<00:00:49.320> solids<00:00:49.530> have

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
see here's some of the milk solids have

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.110 
see here's some of the milk solids have
rise<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:52.489> what<00:00:53.489> we're<00:00:53.610> trying<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> do

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
rise to the top what we're trying to do

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.040 
rise to the top what we're trying to do
is<00:00:55.550> remove<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.820> milk<00:00:57.329> solids<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
is remove the milk solids from the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.299 
is remove the milk solids from the
butter<00:00:58.320> by<00:00:59.280> skimming<00:00:59.640> them<00:00:59.910> off<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> top<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
butter by skimming them off the top and

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
butter by skimming them off the top and
the<00:01:02.309> water<00:01:02.609> content<00:01:02.940> from<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> butter<00:01:03.690> is

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the water content from the butter is

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.240 
the water content from the butter is
lost<00:01:04.949> through<00:01:05.309> evaporation<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.070> you're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
lost through evaporation so what you're

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.760 
lost through evaporation so what you're
left<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.920> butter<00:01:11.220> fat

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
left with is a is just just butter fat

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
left with is a is just just butter fat
which<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:14.090> make<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.420> stable<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> more

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
which will make a more stable and more

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780 
which will make a more stable and more
consistent<00:01:16.710> sauce<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.340> you're<00:01:17.460> using<00:01:17.640> your

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
consistent sauce if you're using your

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.890 
consistent sauce if you're using your
butter<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.270> sauce<00:01:18.450> making<00:01:20.630> clarified<00:01:21.630> butter

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
butter for sauce making clarified butter

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.590 
butter for sauce making clarified butter
also<00:01:22.290> has<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> higher<00:01:22.770> smoke<00:01:23.220> point<00:01:23.600> than

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
also has a higher smoke point than

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.130 
also has a higher smoke point than
butter<00:01:25.970> that<00:01:26.970> has<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> milk<00:01:27.450> solids<00:01:27.659> still<00:01:28.020> in

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
butter that has the milk solids still in

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.609 
butter that has the milk solids still in
it<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> makes<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> more<00:01:29.670> ideal<00:01:30.030> for

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
it so it makes it more ideal for

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:39.429 
it so it makes it more ideal for
sauteing<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:32.900> frying

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.460 

it's<00:01:40.439> very<00:01:40.619> carefully<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:42.140> foamy<00:01:43.140> white

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it's very carefully as these foamy white

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
it's very carefully as these foamy white
milk<00:01:43.740> solids<00:01:44.009> rise<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> top<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.060> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
milk solids rise to the top you just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.319 
milk solids rise to the top you just
skim<00:01:45.659> them<00:01:45.780> off<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> slotted<00:01:46.920> spoon<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
skim them off with a slotted spoon or a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.200 
skim them off with a slotted spoon or a
skimmer<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.750> put<00:01:51.930> them<00:01:52.020> aside<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.320> discard

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:06.180 

again<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.540> done<00:01:57.689> over<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:58.860> low<00:01:59.009> heat

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.460 

you'll<00:02:07.180> probably<00:02:07.360> have<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.720> skim<00:02:08.020> it<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.200> few

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
you'll probably have to skim it a few

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.690 
you'll probably have to skim it a few
times<00:02:09.960> so<00:02:10.960> most<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.800> them<00:02:11.920> most<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.490> milks

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
times so most of them most of the milks

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.420 
times so most of them most of the milks
all<00:02:12.820> have<00:02:13.060> been<00:02:13.180> removed<00:02:13.420> here<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:15.160> end<00:02:15.340> up

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
all have been removed here you end up

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.360 
all have been removed here you end up
with<00:02:15.550> about<00:02:16.230> 75%<00:02:17.230> yield<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:20.080> other<00:02:20.200> 25%<00:02:20.740> being

with about 75% yield the other 25% being
lost<00:02:21.610> as<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.570> discarded<00:02:23.080> milk<00:02:23.230> solids<00:02:23.440> in<00:02:23.710> the

been clarified out there's still a
little<00:02:37.780> bit<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.730> milk<00:02:39.940> solid<00:02:40.330> foam

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
little bit of of the milk solid foam

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.660 
little bit of of the milk solid foam
forming<00:02:41.110> at<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.320> top<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.040> skim<00:02:45.460> this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
forming at the top you can skim this

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.170 
forming at the top you can skim this
further<00:02:46.770> or<00:02:47.770> just<00:02:47.950> carefully<00:02:48.370> ladle<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
further or just carefully ladle just the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.930 
further or just carefully ladle just the
useable<00:02:50.140> butterfat<00:02:50.560> portion<00:02:51.100> off<00:02:56.940> clarified

has a higher longer shelf life than

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.600 
has a higher longer shelf life than
regular<00:03:00.940> butter<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.010> just<00:03:03.190> continue<00:03:03.459> that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
regular butter so you just continue that
