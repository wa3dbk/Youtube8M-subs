lecture material our architecture

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.329 
lecture material our architecture
program<00:00:51.940> is<00:00:52.239> consisted<00:00:53.050> of<00:00:53.339> consecutive

program is consisted of consecutive

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.750 
program is consisted of consecutive
studio<00:00:55.269> courses<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.890> basically<00:00:57.370> it's<00:00:57.610> a<00:00:57.729> very

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
studio courses so basically it's a very

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.290 
studio courses so basically it's a very
design<00:00:58.510> oriented<00:00:59.040> program<00:01:00.180> starting<00:01:01.180> from

design oriented program starting from
first<00:01:01.600> year<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:02.199> really<00:01:02.409> get<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.799> basic

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
first year you really get the basic

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.760 
first year you really get the basic

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.850 
delineate and you go on the second year
where<00:01:09.490> you<00:01:09.610> start<00:01:09.930> developing<00:01:10.930> your<00:01:11.200> concepts

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860

and third year where you really start

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.539 
and third year where you really start
looking<00:01:13.870> at<00:01:14.049> building<00:01:14.409> systems<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.159> how<00:01:15.280> long

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
looking at building systems and how long

the<00:02:32.640> most<00:02:32.819> creative<00:02:33.000> things<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:33.599> do<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the most creative things we do the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.490 
the most creative things we do the
immeasurable<00:02:35.069> point<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.989> point<00:02:37.230> that

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500

I<00:02:47.519> think<00:02:48.060> one<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.330> most<00:02:48.510> important<00:02:48.959> things

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
I think one of the most important things

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.900 
I think one of the most important things
that<00:02:49.380> new<00:02:49.650> school<00:02:49.860> offers<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> student<00:02:50.760> is

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
that new school offers the student is

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.809 
that new school offers the student is
the<00:02:51.209> notion<00:02:51.599> of<00:02:51.840> professionalism<00:02:52.819> we're

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
the notion of professionalism we're

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.089 
the notion of professionalism we're

kind of firms and on those kind of
projects<00:03:14.489> architecture<00:03:15.269> is<00:03:15.420> not<00:03:15.630> just<00:03:15.959> about

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
projects architecture is not just about

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.879 
projects architecture is not just about
building<00:03:16.650> buildings<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:18.120> about<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:19.049> broader
