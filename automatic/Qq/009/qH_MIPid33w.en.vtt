00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.780
 approximately 97 5% of the water in 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.869
 our planet installed and only 25 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.360
 percent is sweet one of the biggest 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.060
 problems at present is the shortage 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.650
 freshwater life engine for many 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.650
 beings that inhabit the earth 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.600
 in the department of ica province of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.850
 chincha mining company milpo has 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.220
 the mining unit cerro lindo the same 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.010
 which is located 60 kilometers from the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.840
 coast in order to stock up on 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.480
 water for mining activities and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.880
 human consumption has been installed a 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.370
 plant to desalinate the water collected 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.829
 from sea 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.770
 allowing to separate the salts and obtain 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.700
 fresh water being supplied in this way 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.370
 of the liquid element 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.130
 the desalination process is a 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.740
 easy and safe simple technology for 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.020
 get fresh water from the water of 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.180
 This is achieved through the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.180
 osmosis treatment technology 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.490
 inverse 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.860
 the seawater after being pumped to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.590
 the desalination plant goes through 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.320
 microfiltration systems that allow 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.720
 eliminate the suspended particles that 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.300
 has the sea ​​water 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.800
 once the water free of impurities is 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.140
 increase the pressure by means of 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.090
 special pumps to put it in 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.000
 contact with osmosis membranes 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.300
 inverse, managing to separate the water from its 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300
 you go out 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.470
 long and its inverse is a technology 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.780
 clean as it returns to the sea as a source 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.540
 with the salts present in the water of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.060
 sea ​​through an issuer that has 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.270
 diffusers that help the dilution of the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.670
 salt in the sea with rapid assimilation 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.340
 without altering the environmental conditions 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.920
 of the marine system currently exist 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.380
 more than 15,000 desalination plants in 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.950
 the world being the Arab emigres 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.140
 spain and usa major nations 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.380
 that use this technology to 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.200
 get fresh water from the sea the plant 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.380
 The largest desalination plant in the world is 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.770
 located in ashkelon city ​​of israel and 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.690
 provides 165 thousand cubic meters of water 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.880
 sea per day 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.010
 at present the desalination is 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.750
 an alternative for the shortage of 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.470
 water resource that they are going through 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.840
 some countries desalination offers 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.200
 a clean and efficient process because no 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.870
 pollute or disturb the environment 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.450
 desalinated water in the stalin plant 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.810
 and zadora de cerros lindo is used in 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.690
 the mining and metallurgical processes for 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.150
 human consumption is counted additionally 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.490
 with a 1 liter water treatment plant 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.200
 per second capacity satisfying 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.120
 the needs of the staff 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.370
 in the mining unit are not generated 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.920
 Discharges of any kind to the river 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.379
 bump into the effluents of the various 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.010
 operations in the camp are re 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.540
 circulated to the process 100% 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.450
 fulfilling the commitment assumed in 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.849
 the environmental impact study 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.290
 shedding 0 you definitely have to 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.290
 recognize that minera milpo 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.730
 It's the first one I think that does not use water from 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.099
 the river 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.860
 and it is the first one that is carrying water 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.180
 Desalinated sea for consumption 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.269
 proper to the 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.359
 of the mining company and it seems to me quite 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:54.200
 quite well and should be an example to 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:57.769
 follow other mining companies for not this 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.500
 suddenly have problems with the 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.930
 adjacent communities in this case 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.730
 we are very calm 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.940
 the on this one 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.819
 the process that I have made a thousand bonds and 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.680
 definitely completely agree 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.750
 the effluent of the different processes 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.359
 operational units located in the unit 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.940
 mining hill cute are sent to the 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.180
 recovered water tank to later be 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.100
 reduced in the process the mine waters 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.470
 in the camp they are treated by 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.410
 treatment plants these effluents 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.780
 treated are used to irrigate areas 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.150
 Forests with the use of sea water 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.550
 desalinated in the operations of the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.830
 mining unit cerro lindo is let 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.500
 the waters of the river will continue 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.720
 being used entirely for the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.530
 agriculture and for consumption of 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.789
 nearby communities that this one 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.330
 enough responsibility to lose 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.789
 Milpo Company on the issue of 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.259
 environmental management I think it's quite 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.949
 responsibility on the part of the company 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.330
 of wanting to do things right or 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.780
 properly administer the vital 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.310
 resource and take advantage of it without harming 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.310
 the other beings that inhabit the planet 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.310
 it is the action of the present and the future
