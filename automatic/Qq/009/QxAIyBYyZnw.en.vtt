 my live experience started this year 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.969
 really on the floor I have been a player in 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.030
 basically what I've been playing 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.399
 two or three years yes yes it's a bit 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.519
 different because that's how slow the 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.730
 game this until you can see form a 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.380
 little more boring but if I really am 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.620
 today I am trying to adjust to the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.030
 differences of live poker and poker 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.340
 online I also have the happiness of being 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.660

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.040
 many people around that help me that 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.300
 I was very much advice about the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.830
 difference between why you send and 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.540
 online poker as this was done 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.430
 present in the shopper millions what 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.070
 are your expectations for the day of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.800
 morning already begins day 2 and there to deal 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.470
 to move towards the final table if the 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.620
 goal is to reach the final table the dream 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.080
 it would be to win it but the expectation is 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.180
 enjoy as much as possible and improve and 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.130
 learn from this experience because no 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.810
 they are every day 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.750
 in the plans is to continue playing 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.610
 live tournaments then it is more than everything 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.829
 take experience and learn and do what 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.210
 the best possible is the basic goal 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.950
 Do the best you can do it more 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.800
