00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 I do not think about that problem yet 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.950
 in any kind but let's see if very 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.570
 surprised and also quite hurt with 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.799
 that statement because I think it's not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.179
 true then in many things of the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.880
 who comments the federation does not have 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.770
 absolutely nothing to see in this subject 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 it is a total responsibility and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.180
 absolutely mine and I assume it with all 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.650
 the consequences because I all that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.359
 I have asked in the planning that I have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 made for this concentration the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.470
 federation has not granted any 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.290
 problem absolutely none so 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.050
 whether there is any fault or there is some 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.300
 failure in planning is ignacio 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
 quereda not the federation and angel marÃ­a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.649
 villar no longer I pose absolutely 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.230
 nothing because first it is not true that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.140
 23 players are in these dynamics and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.879
 in second place and secondly that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.870
 you have to analyze a little bit deeply 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.850
 all that topic and we'll talk about it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.370
 quietly not but it is not that there 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.230
 little physical preparation but 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.060
 our physical condition with respect to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.530
 other choices is lower 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.420
 of the federation that has to do 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.310
 absolutely the study on the subject of 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.590
 the preparation of the players is that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.590
 I really do not understand what you are pulling 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.870
 three feet to the cat always attacking the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.870
 federation I repeat that responsibility 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.310
 it is absolutely and only mine that I am the 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.710
 that you have planned and the federation has 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.810
 granted everything I asked for I do not 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.280
 I have to fight for nothing, I'm a 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.750
 disposition of the federation and the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.960
 federation, what you decide will be what 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.960
 make 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.390
 27 years without having achieved anything 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 without having achieved anything that is what 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.310
 you say is not a championship of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.439
 Europe sub-19 of 2004 three championships 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.119
 his 19 also not no for me precisely 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.350
 If you are not informed , first thing 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.770
 what to do is inform yourself before 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.869
 ask or come to say something 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.360
 with me directly because you have to 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.710
 retire at 65 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.110
 tradition and tradition when you meet them 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.110
 you do it because that same tradition
