block and you get three pieces fabric

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.840 
block and you get three pieces fabric
measured<00:00:32.360> five<00:00:33.360> by<00:00:33.930> ten<00:00:34.530> that's<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.610> YouTube

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
measured five by ten that's what YouTube

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
measured five by ten that's what YouTube
said<00:00:37.370> no<00:00:38.370> problem<00:00:38.940> no<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:39.660> never<00:00:39.840> did<00:00:40.140> give

said no problem no they never did give
us<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.680> measurements<00:00:40.910> but<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.059> was<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
us the measurements but it was in the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.200 
us the measurements but it was in the
comment<00:00:43.379> section<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.430> assumed<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.030> was

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
comment section right we assumed it was

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360 
comment section right we assumed it was
five<00:00:45.450> by<00:00:45.719> ten<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.379> had<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> copy<00:00:46.890> gave<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
five by ten so we had to copy gave the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010 
five by ten so we had to copy gave the
measurements<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:47.940> shouted<00:00:48.660> by<00:00:48.840> her

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
measurements because shouted by her

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.850 
measurements because shouted by her
boobs<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:50.030> okay<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.809> first<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:55.500> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
boobs right okay so the first time it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.330 
boobs right okay so the first time it
was<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.489> three<00:00:56.969> pieces<00:00:57.210> five<00:00:57.989> by<00:00:58.680> ten<00:00:58.949> inches

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
was all three pieces five by ten inches

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.540 
was all three pieces five by ten inches
however<00:01:00.329> when<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.020> put<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.350> together<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:02.129> just

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
however when we put it together it just

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.450 
however when we put it together it just
did<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:03.030> add<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.539> bottom<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.920> did<00:01:05.220> not

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
did not add up that bottom just did not

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.020 
did not add up that bottom just did not
add<00:01:05.790> up

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
add up

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.620 
add up
so<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:07.080> peaked<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.710> critiqued<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.570> try<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so we peaked and critiqued and try to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.130 
so we peaked and critiqued and try to
see<00:01:09.990> where<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.380> were<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.890> wrong<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> that's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
see where we were going wrong so that's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.230 
see where we were going wrong so that's
not<00:01:15.409> what's<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.619> good<00:01:18.200> okay

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.029 

so<00:01:23.240> if<00:01:23.359> you<00:01:23.479> get<00:01:23.659> three<00:01:23.929> pieces<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.500> two

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
so if you get three pieces the two

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.100 
so if you get three pieces the two
outside<00:01:25.969> pieces<00:01:26.270> will<00:01:26.869> mesh<00:01:27.409> five<00:01:28.719> by<00:01:29.719> ten

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
outside pieces will mesh five by ten

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.100 
outside pieces will mesh five by ten
inches<00:01:30.579> but<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:31.820> centerpiece<00:01:32.390> that<00:01:32.659> you're

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
inches but the centerpiece that you're

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.050 
inches but the centerpiece that you're
going<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.500> use<00:01:33.740> on<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:34.130> five<00:01:34.399> minute<00:01:34.819> block

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
going to use on this five minute block

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.559 
going to use on this five minute block
is<00:01:35.299> going<00:01:35.569> to<00:01:35.659> be<00:01:35.780> five<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:37.100> a<00:01:37.159> quarter<00:01:37.569> bike

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
is going to be five and a quarter bike

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.679 
is going to be five and a quarter bike
in<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:39.490> keep<00:01:40.490> in<00:01:40.640> mind<00:01:40.819> if<00:01:40.969> you<00:01:41.060> do<00:01:41.270> all<00:01:41.450> three

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
in I keep in mind if you do all three

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.080 
in I keep in mind if you do all three
it's<00:01:42.469> not<00:01:42.679> going<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.130> come<00:01:43.310> out<00:01:43.399> even<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.969> I

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
it's not going to come out even and I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.050 
it's not going to come out even and I
had<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.539> really<00:01:44.780> cut<00:01:45.079> it<00:01:45.229> cut<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.219> played

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
had to really cut it cut it so played

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.149 
had to really cut it cut it so played
with<00:01:47.299> it<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:47.750> middle<00:01:48.079> piece<00:01:48.289> is<00:01:48.590> going<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:48.890> be

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
with it that middle piece is going to be

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.529 
with it that middle piece is going to be
a<00:01:49.369> quarter<00:01:49.939> of<00:01:50.209> an<00:01:50.479> inch<00:01:51.579> largely<00:01:52.579> wider<00:01:53.270> right

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
a quarter of an inch largely wider right

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.529 
a quarter of an inch largely wider right
now<00:01:54.170> no<00:01:55.159> matter<00:01:55.369> what<00:01:55.640> size<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.119> use<00:01:56.329> you<00:01:56.509> can

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
now no matter what size you use you can

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.960 
now no matter what size you use you can
use<00:01:56.689> any<00:01:56.989> size<00:01:57.259> just<00:01:57.770> remember<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.549> Center

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
use any size just remember that Center

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.639 
use any size just remember that Center
needs<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.689> be<00:01:59.899> a<00:02:00.170> quarter<00:02:01.099> of<00:02:01.280> an<00:02:01.579> inch<00:02:01.789> wider

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
needs to be a quarter of an inch wider

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:13.600 
needs to be a quarter of an inch wider
so<00:02:04.689> we<00:02:05.689> have<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.079> three<00:02:06.319> pieces<00:02:12.400> with<00:02:13.400> that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
so we have the three pieces with that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.559 
so we have the three pieces with that
Center<00:02:14.000> between<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.910> I'm<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.269> going<00:02:17.480> to

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
Center between and I'm just going to

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.059 
Center between and I'm just going to
fold<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.290> center<00:02:18.620> piece<00:02:18.829> in<00:02:19.160> half<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:21.069> I'm

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
fold the center piece in half and I'm

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.900 
fold the center piece in half and I'm
going<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.730> measure<00:02:23.060> down<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:26.600> between<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.910> two

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
going to measure down in between the two

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.539 
going to measure down in between the two
outside<00:02:29.420> pieces<00:02:30.069> with<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.310> fold<00:02:31.730> at<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.359> top

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
outside pieces with the fold at the top

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.390 
outside pieces with the fold at the top
in<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.670> middle<00:02:35.079> with<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.109> fold<00:02:36.620> at<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.010> top

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
in the middle with the fold at the top

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.099 
in the middle with the fold at the top
I'm<00:02:37.700> sent<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.389> a<00:02:38.810> gene<00:02:39.109> this<00:02:39.470> in<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.180> I'm<00:02:41.930> going

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
I'm sent to a gene this in and I'm going

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.430 
I'm sent to a gene this in and I'm going
to<00:02:42.230> measure<00:02:42.440> my<00:02:42.620> bottom<00:02:43.329> match<00:02:44.329> my<00:02:44.660> edges<00:02:45.170> so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
to measure my bottom match my edges so

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440 
to measure my bottom match my edges so
raw<00:02:45.680> edges<00:02:45.950> he<00:02:46.370> mm-hmm

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
raw edges he mm-hmm

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.069 
raw edges he mm-hmm
but<00:02:47.780> keep<00:02:48.139> in<00:02:48.350> mind<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:49.239> fold<00:02:50.239> has<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.750> be<00:02:50.900> at

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079
