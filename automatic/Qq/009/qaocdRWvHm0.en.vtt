00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.800
 colonel guy mothe the famous colonel 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.360
 michel 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.700
 we will try a little bit 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.770
 spice up this video I started a 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.460
 little challenge I have to place in 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.560
 this video 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.810
 the three instruments for me to play on 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.730
 will say knives forks rider 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.230
 this is me spice up a little bit 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.470
 worry not everything is okay 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.360
 pass 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.399
 you have very well you are going very 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.320
 soon understand why then the 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.780
 knows the pilot in three attacks 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.400
 gt if they violate fouka so shot 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.320
 zucca i made two points in attack 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.640
 is the third as usual I the 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.830
 do it live I wanted to show everything from 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.240
 next but before that I show you 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.730
 the first two attacks 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.150
 it's gone it went pretty well 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.650
 the week to the most complicated but there 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.630
 it was easier this gun or 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.059
 that anigo 20 I show right away the 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.890
 attacks 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.990
 so my attacks first attack he 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.250
 an hour ago mad tyrant you attacked 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.610
 war factory so it's a level 90 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.140
 44 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.399
 zhu 80 and 95 fuzier level even I do not 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.229
 did not go with the back of the spoon 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.729
 so here we go we'll start with the 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.079
 first attack a point thanks 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.950
 puttemans all the function of the knives 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.569
 do not worry I 'm going to arrive 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.939
 so it's gone slowly from this 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:35.259
 attack it went well 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:36.969
 that's what this 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.859
 event today with the three 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.469
 rocket launcher right but only 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.119
 1 once we get drunk in some 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.530
 so that will be within reach of the rifles 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.209
 zouk so I decided to destroy 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.679
 the gunboat 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.609
 I do not remember you I remember you 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.649
 not because I've ever told you but 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.270
 I boost my health status 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.889
 troops damage the troubles and march of 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.420
 the gunboat at first I hesitated because 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:57.700
 that I think we can do it without 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.350
 month booster if you of course have a 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.509
 good level to challenge d oka so I 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.789
 decided to advance on the mouth in 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.500
 curling up the four biggest building 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.400
 defensive the most dangerous so both 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.780
 years the graves and electro cannon and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.620
 I decided to leave but 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.130
 little by little I will not let go 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.620
 and these are these four buildings 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.120
 yes even if they had miles me I 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.510
 I did not care a little bit it's not too much 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.130
 serious 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.970
 even though I do not have a lot of 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.260
 flexibility on the left when I had 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.760
 plus enough for frieze I sent them 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.300
 diversion cloakrooms during 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.300
 a few seconds 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.360
 Here it went pretty well we will 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.720
 to say even if the go the troops 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.760
 begin to die very quickly at 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.110
 cause of it from then on it's fake gifts and 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.140
 the tonga of nothing is chrome earlier 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.780
 and so that's the same point I hit 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.070
 do not write it unfortunately 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.540
 but now I got 42 1600 doing and 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.760
 two prototype pieces 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.870
 so it's great it's frankly 2-2 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.640
 threshold reaches even 3 years and more we will 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.240
 to say that for this for this attack I 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.830
 I did not have the knife under my throat 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.330
 so second attack you have who 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.660
 attack and the machined second war 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.340
 attack 95 rifle level 20 and 44 or such 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.090
 level 20 always booster I you 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.890
 shows this attack 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.280
 must I put the fork we go there 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.590
 get there so I decided to attack 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.610
 on the right 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.710
 that's because it's actually more 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.260
 of defensive buildings on the right but 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.580
 how to say that would weaken the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.330
 that's why I attacked on a 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.370
 on the right 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.630
 and what's more, it was wrong in his case 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.930
 not to be I have a lot of points of 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.390
 gunboats to save water for 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.650
 curling defensive buildings always 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.240
 the super mines that's not a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.740
 problem 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:52.709
 there I made furry creatures I did 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.880
 both camps bobos but here I am 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.720
 thinking how can I 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.700
 place the fork 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.200
 I will go there do not worry you 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.200
 go get there no problem with that 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.790
 go there a super that before - it remains 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.470
 two gun electro and a dry wind too 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.550
 I'm going to destroy them 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.740
 memories 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.000
 during this second attack I 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.550
 replaced but hole for her out of 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.810
 range of electro rhumbs spears 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.239
 rocket launcher earlier 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.220
 last year the times it's too big 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.020
 destroys the machine guns and 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.790
 minimal have raised somehow 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.440
 and from that moment on I was 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.480
 connected so you can do anything 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.160
 I had sent there flares on 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.210
 the 2 min 6 to destroy them to make 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.410
 suicide bombers 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.139
 unfortunately I was disconnected good 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.870
 that's all on its own but it 's 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.700
 still does a good good 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.330
 destruction even though I was not there the 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.240
 small troops 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:47.440
 this is simply that it's quite nice 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.780
 we see the remains era where any case 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.790
 the death camps that are destroying a 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.600
 maximum but zoukeur but in five 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.530
 seconds ago more men 1 2 3 hairs 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.470
 it's over for this second attack 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.060
 finally the third attack we can say 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.200
 that's between an attack and three 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.200
 attacks it's still a good fork 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.290
 go third attack it's gone I 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.030
 you show it right away 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.290
 I arrived here if you have any 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.520
 little challenges like that to make the video 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.400
 I think I can do it it's 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.270
 rather nice it's moving go it's gone 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.800
 for the 3rd attack 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.340
 I hope to get there otherwise I do it all 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.690
 that for nothing launches rockets 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.820
 so my door and so far has gone to 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.850
 foot I think I'm going directly 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.490
 opinion on the subject I will I succeed in 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.340
 to be quickly we will do that we are going 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.820
 do that january death toll genres and 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.390
 critters about mine violence and 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.390
 all my troops 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:49.349
 and I'm going to put them here a little bit 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:52.729
 before rather freeze game that and it's going 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.729
 directly focus the qg 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.110
 here is I focus the qg recover 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.830
 quietly it'll be done 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.759
 quiet but here it is quietly 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.080
 remained many points of 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.539
 gunboats I managed to be this 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.590
 Colonel Michel again, even though 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.060
 she has a weight and if I was by 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.039
 element of the paréage had not film 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.060
 since the first of gt paris 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.349
 that's it for this Cairo Colonial 795 of 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.520
 wood prototype parts got that 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.270
 it's not bad you're fine 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.150
 it's hopeless 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.430
 always the same speech an album of 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:27.030
 Michel said Michel of the two disappointed 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.740
 that to be fast guys will I you
