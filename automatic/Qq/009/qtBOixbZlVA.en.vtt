from<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.030> amplifier<00:01:43.909> price<00:01:44.909> point<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.270> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
from the amplifier price point on this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.789 
from the amplifier price point on this
is<00:01:45.570> also<00:01:45.929> probably<00:01:46.289> one<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.469> the<00:01:46.619> best

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is also probably one of the best

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.399 
is also probably one of the best
features<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.520> 299<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.810> about<00:01:49.020> half<00:01:49.229> as

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
features it's 299 so about half as

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.719 
features it's 299 so about half as
expensive<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.069> lot<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> other<00:01:50.490> iOS
