00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.299
 hello all my name is earl gomez and 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.259
 in today's video we're going to see how 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.629
 remove this screen to this image from 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:14.329
 lock in windows 8 there are many 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.509
 features that came focused on 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:20.119
 the touch or touch screens and this is 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.769
 one of them this screen we the 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.220
 we can this image we can 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:28.249
 configure from pc configuration 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.529
 but we can also remove it there are two 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.050
 ways with which we can remove the 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.430
 one is through group policies 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.859
 local and another is through the registration of 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.170
 windows editing the windows registry 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.120
 let's see then we show 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.570
 this 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.760
 this screen we click and we are 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.430
 in our inn computer we give you 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.250
 click and we will access where where 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.649
 we have the accounts and if we have a 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.589
 only account where you ask for the password 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.260
 from that default account this if 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.860
 we do not have any other account 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.590
 several accounts and if we have only one 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.060
 we have it with her password 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.509
 our team will access 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.580
 immediately directly and it's not going 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.580
 to ask that we are not going to see this with 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.130
 screen this lock image for this 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.800
 this we will only see when 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.770
 we have several accounts configured 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.170
 we get a single account with a password 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.460
 so let's see how we can 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.380
 set this or remove this screen 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.390
 when we should access to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.299
 desk let's do 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.579
 the menu run with windows rr more 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.610
 sister key r and the first one we're going to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.770
 see is accessing the gp edit point 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.310
 msc with this we will access 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.310
 to the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.770
 group policy editor also 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.700
 we can do looking for example 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 policies 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.070
 but let's keep looking for policies 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.480
 here in configuration let's see edit 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.210
 group directives to also be able 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.940
 we can access by this form 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.620
 here we have the local group editor 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.210
 and in it we will search in 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.090
 team configuration we are going to look 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.290
 in administrative templates panel 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.080
 control and customization here we have 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.090
 this configuration we have three 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.730
 configurations and one tells us not 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.470
 show the lock screen if 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.880
 we double click on this 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.550
 configuration will show us the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.340
 options for 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.630
 with which we can configure this 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.150
 directive 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.440
 let's wait a moment that we 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.440
 load that configuration 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.790
 and here we have tells us shows us 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.040
 screen template lock us 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.500
 He says 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.200
 that not configured tells us the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.349
 enabled or disabled 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.420
 Here he shows us help in the 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.549
 versions that are compatible as they 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.040
 we comment not only for windows 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.090
 server 2012 windows 8 or win rt that is the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.790
 Windows 8 tablet version 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.590
 here shows us a help tells us that 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.220
 if we enable 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.620
 we can have these changes and if the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.360
 enable we will not establish anything at 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.220
 just like if we do not leave it 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.230
 configured by default will show it 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.210
 for the blocking image then let's go 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.860
 to tell you enabled 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.910
 let's change here the 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.640
 the directive we are going to tell you to apply 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.860
 and accept 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.860
 yes, in those moments 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.650
 I go and I close session 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.800
 I'm closing session we're going to see that 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.800
 it will automatically show us the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.410
 to the screen where we are going to choose 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.700
 where are we going to choose our user 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.700
 let's enter our password 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.210
 as we see here he did not show us our 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.950
 login image then this 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.630
 It is one of the forms 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.630
 we can also edit or change this 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.630
 directive 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.050
 let's first disable the one that 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.710
 we had already configured to show them 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.240
 of what is the other way that we can 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.540
 carry out this configuration we are going to 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.430
 remove it 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.110
 the directive or the person the 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.670
 customization that we make that 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.700
 we just made let's tell them no 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.220
 configured let's tell you to apply 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.840
 let's corroborate here if it is 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.129
 applying the directive again 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.409
 to close session 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.899
 and we see that this appears again 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:11.249
 lock screen we access again 

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:11.249
 let's make the change now 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.890
 since 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.620
 the windows registry editor we are going to 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.200
 access here the desktop we are going to give you 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.450
 windows + r and we will select or 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.450
 let's write regedit 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.639
 we have here revenue we give you to accept 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.800
 here he asks us for an authorization inside 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.080
 of the user account control 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.110
 let's say that if we are going to do the 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.710
 default record 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.870
 it shows us like this 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:50.060
 here we will see it by default then 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.139
 let's look at hkey local machine 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.270
 let's do here 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.139
 here he's going to ask us to come in 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.270
 software we use the software 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.880
 we enter politics policies in 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.490
 policies 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.830
 we look for the microsoft folder in 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.430
 microsoft we look for windows 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.520
 and for iu on windows we're going to look for the 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.310
 custom folder but by default 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.110
 she in this folder is not defined 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.670
 then we must create it then we go 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.560
 to go to the windows folder or the 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.470
 container windows and we will tell you 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.610
 new new new key in this case are 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:32.990
 keys and let's tell him person 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:36.099
 a lesson in English we got here here 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:39.919
 and we're going to create a new word value 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:43.430
 here we are going to create a word value and you 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:48.280
 let's say for a man not 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.280
 block not block scoring 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.610
 here we have a screen block 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.930
 we are going to do it to give him enter and we are going to 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:01.370
 configure we are going to modify it 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:05.390
 the new one in the new registration key 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.860
 we give you modify here is not shown and 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.790
 tells us the value information 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:15.200
 then 0 is disabled and 1 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:18.090
 forgiveness 0 is enabled and one is 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.820
 disabled based on hexadecimal 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:25.140
 we say affect and as we see already we 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:27.450
 changed the data we can close this and 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.850
 we go again corrobar again to 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.970
 corroborate closing session let's see 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:35.910
 if it shows us the image again or not 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.910
 as we see it does not show the image 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.830
 then this is a very easy way to 

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.449
 change this image not to remove this 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.939
 image of 

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:48.520
 lock screen that comes focused 

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:50.499
 especially to touch screens and that 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:55.120
 our team that desktop computer 

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:57.550
 does not have a lot of operation does not apply 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.219
 to many things then I hope that you 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.259
 this video is very helpful and we 

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:04.620
 we see in a next occasion many 

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:04.620
 Thank you
