where you need a textured surface

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.069 
where you need a textured surface
because<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.489> probably<00:00:56.930> uncomfortable<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because it's probably uncomfortable to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.299 
because it's probably uncomfortable to
move<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.379> mouse<00:00:58.530> around<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:59.039> you're<00:00:59.160> doing

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
move your mouse around if you're doing

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220 
move your mouse around if you're doing
day-to-day<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.329> probably<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.809> awful

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
day-to-day use is probably just awful

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
day-to-day use is probably just awful
and<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.070> smooth<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:02.940> just

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
and you can see how smooth is I'm just

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.020 
and you can see how smooth is I'm just
smoothly<00:01:03.960> moving<00:01:04.379> my<00:01:04.650> mouse<00:01:05.309> around<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
smoothly moving my mouse around and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.330 
smoothly moving my mouse around and
since<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> bigger<00:01:07.290> service<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:07.950> most

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
since it's a bigger service than most

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.080 
since it's a bigger service than most
mouse<00:01:08.610> pads<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
mouse pads that you will not get in you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
mouse pads that you will not get in you
won't<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.750> hit<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.110> keyboard<00:01:13.590> will<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.100> get

won't get hit your keyboard will not get

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.679 
won't get hit your keyboard will not get
hit<00:01:14.490> while<00:01:14.790> your<00:01:14.909> mouse<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.450> there's<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
hit while your mouse because there's a

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.600 
hit while your mouse because there's a
huge<00:01:15.960> space<00:01:16.290> even<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.130> keyboard<00:01:17.340> on

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
huge space even with my keyboard on

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.820 
huge space even with my keyboard on
there<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.970> had<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> bigger<00:01:18.930> keyboard<00:01:19.170> last<00:01:19.560> time

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
there I had a bigger keyboard last time

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.219 
there I had a bigger keyboard last time
and<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.100> even<00:01:20.490> fit<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:21.479> ample<00:01:21.900> amount<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and that even fit with ample amount of

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.590 
and that even fit with ample amount of
space<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.310> here's<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
space so here's you can see the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.330 
space so here's you can see the
keyboards<00:01:24.960> way<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.680> don't

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
keyboards way out of the way you don't

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.210 
keyboards way out of the way you don't
even<00:01:26.580> notice<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.180> you're<00:01:28.130> moving<00:01:29.130> around

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
even notice it when you're moving around

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.030 
even notice it when you're moving around
with<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.610> mouse<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
with your mouse and it's just really a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.670 
with your mouse and it's just really a
great<00:01:33.890> mouse<00:01:34.890> pad<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.820> smaller

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
great mouse pad but there is smaller

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.719 
great mouse pad but there is smaller
versions<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.430> told<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> before

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.120 

so<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.539> see<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:45.020> does<00:01:45.229> fill<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.680> Razer<00:01:45.860> logo

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
so you see it does fill the Razer logo

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.340 
so you see it does fill the Razer logo
it's<00:01:46.969> kind<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.329> like<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.659> outline<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.229> Ray

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
it's kind of like the outline of the Ray

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.859 
it's kind of like the outline of the Ray
of<00:01:48.380> razer<00:01:48.770> logo<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.399> then<00:01:49.820> green<00:01:50.299> splattered

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
of razer logo and then green splattered

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.510 
of razer logo and then green splattered
all<00:01:50.930> over<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.380> which<00:01:51.500> rich<00:01:51.710> looks<00:01:52.070> really<00:01:52.369> nice

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
all over it which rich looks really nice

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.120 
all over it which rich looks really nice
but<00:01:52.880> if<00:01:53.329> you<00:01:53.450> do<00:01:53.630> not<00:01:53.780> like<00:01:54.049> green<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.009> can

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
but if you do not like green you can

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.100 
but if you do not like green you can
just<00:01:55.490> cover<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.759> up<00:01:55.850> by<00:01:56.060> your<00:01:56.179> keyboard<00:01:56.659> if<00:01:56.869> you

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
just cover it up by your keyboard if you

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.440 
just cover it up by your keyboard if you
wanted<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.590> but<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:58.219> think<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.820> looks<00:01:58.880> very<00:01:59.060> nice

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
wanted to but I think it looks very nice

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.999 
wanted to but I think it looks very nice
I'm<00:01:59.750> not<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.990> biggest<00:02:00.259> fan<00:02:00.409> of<00:02:00.439> green<00:02:00.679> but<00:02:00.979> I

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
I'm not the biggest fan of green but I

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.590 
I'm not the biggest fan of green but I
