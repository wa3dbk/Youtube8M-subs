closed hem Hemi machine we're going to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.150 
closed hem Hemi machine we're going to
go<00:00:08.069> ahead<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.790> make<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.500> send<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.650> eight<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:10.980> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
go ahead and make a send a eight and a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.680 
go ahead and make a send a eight and a
half<00:00:11.190> inch<00:00:11.580> blink<00:00:11.940> through<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.509> it'll

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
half inch blink through it and it'll

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.450 
half inch blink through it and it'll
have<00:00:12.960> both<00:00:13.200> sides<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.830> then<00:00:13.980> we'll<00:00:14.130> go<00:00:14.250> back

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
have both sides and then we'll go back

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.750 
have both sides and then we'll go back
through<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.230> pull<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.350> out<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.550> one

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
through and pull it out and do just one

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.250 
through and pull it out and do just one
side<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.710> how<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:19.770> set<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.270> position<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.930> is

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
side so how we set the position of it is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.589 
side so how we set the position of it is
down<00:00:23.010> below<00:00:23.460> right<00:00:23.850> here<00:00:26.359> you<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
down below right here you have a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
down below right here you have a
indicator<00:00:28.699> go<00:00:29.699> ahead<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.029> move<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:31.669> we're

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
indicator go ahead and move it we're

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.060 
indicator go ahead and move it we're
going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:37.850> half<00:00:38.850> inch<00:00:39.620> hem<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.860> both

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
going to do a half inch hem on both

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.619 
going to do a half inch hem on both
sides<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.640> our<00:00:41.730> n<00:00:41.940> feet<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> be

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
sides and our n feet is going to be

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.319 
sides and our n feet is going to be
eight<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> half<00:00:43.079> inches<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.649> we're<00:00:44.329> set

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
eight and a half inches so we're set

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.390 
eight and a half inches so we're set
that<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.750> eight<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> half

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.850 

just<00:00:54.150> your<00:00:54.330> guide<00:00:54.540> on<00:00:54.990> it

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:14.000 

our<00:01:02.860> on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.220 

this<00:01:14.550> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> 29<00:01:15.600> gauge<00:01:16.010> Grady<00:01:17.010> material<00:01:18.230> and

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
this is a 29 gauge Grady material and

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:26.290 
this is a 29 gauge Grady material and
you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:21.450> does<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.660> nice<00:01:23.180> teardrop

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.780 

closed<00:01:27.300> him<00:01:27.800> now<00:01:28.800> we'll<00:01:28.980> go<00:01:29.130> ahead<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.580> dial

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
closed him now we'll go ahead and dial

00:01:29.790 --> 00:02:12.190 
closed him now we'll go ahead and dial
it<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.260> do<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:31.830> side

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.830 

as<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:12.980> see<00:02:13.190> does<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> great<00:02:14.330> helm<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.660> that

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
as you can see does a great helm on that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.559 
as you can see does a great helm on that
too<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.470> backside

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.800 

no<00:02:24.569> marking<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.370> sheet<00:02:27.180> supports<00:02:27.630> down

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
no marking you have sheet supports down

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.330 
no marking you have sheet supports down
there<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.350> you're<00:02:28.470> doing<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.800> wider<00:02:29.040> piece

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
there so if you're doing a wider piece

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.580 
there so if you're doing a wider piece
you'd<00:02:29.640> probably<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.260> support<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:31.440> goes

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
you'd probably have a support that goes

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.130 
you'd probably have a support that goes
in<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.890> middle<00:02:31.920> right<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:38.360> that's<00:02:39.360> our<00:02:39.600> 36

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
in the middle right here that's our 36

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.370 
in the middle right here that's our 36
inch<00:02:40.350> wide<00:02:40.560> hemming<00:02:41.010> machines
