00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
charged batteries um rubies and gems you

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.520 
charged batteries um rubies and gems you
can<00:04:26.490> create<00:04:26.820> tools<00:04:27.120> like<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.540> can<00:04:27.660> see<00:04:27.870> they

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
can create tools like you can see they

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.090 
can create tools like you can see they
they<00:04:29.100> last<00:04:29.460> pretty<00:04:29.820> they<00:04:30.210> last<00:04:30.450> for<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.690> while

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
they last pretty they last for a while

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.220 
they last pretty they last for a while
but<00:04:32.100> they<00:04:32.220> mind<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.670> bit<00:04:32.880> faster<00:04:33.330> than<00:04:33.450> anything

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
but they mind a bit faster than anything

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.320 
but they mind a bit faster than anything
else<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.620> like<00:04:34.830> diamond<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.850> at<00:04:36.210> the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
else and like diamond that and at the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.780 
else and like diamond that and at the
same<00:04:36.480> rate<00:04:36.540> of<00:04:36.840> gold<00:04:37.080> i<00:04:37.230> guess<00:04:37.500> so<00:04:37.800> basically

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
same rate of gold i guess so basically

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.380 
same rate of gold i guess so basically
it's<00:04:39.720> a<00:04:39.960> different<00:04:40.890> resource<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.430> different

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
it's a different resource of different

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.950 
it's a different resource of different
know<00:04:43.170> some<00:04:44.040> resource<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.610> can<00:04:44.640> use<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.240> in<00:04:45.630> a

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
know some resource you can use that in a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.740 
know some resource you can use that in a
way<00:04:46.200> is<00:04:46.470> more<00:04:46.680> powerful<00:04:46.980> than<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.700> others<00:04:48.000> if

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
way is more powerful than the others if
