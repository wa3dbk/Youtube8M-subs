00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.450 
and then the Japanese Famicom disk
system<00:00:59.120> version<00:00:59.500> it's<00:01:00.500> actually<00:01:00.920> cooperative

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
system version it's actually cooperative

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
three player modes which allows three

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.580 
three player modes which allows three

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
players to play at the same time but

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
players to play at the same time but
they<00:01:06.710> didn't<00:01:06.950> do<00:01:07.040> that<00:01:07.070> for<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.400> North

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
they didn't do that for the North

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.880 
they didn't do that for the North
American<00:01:07.700> version

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.900 

yeah<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:11.920> don't<00:01:12.100> quite<00:01:12.370> understand<00:01:12.790> the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
yeah I don't quite understand the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.880 
yeah I don't quite understand the
storyline<00:01:13.360> in<00:01:13.540> this<00:01:13.690> game<00:01:13.900> but<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.560> doesn't

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
storyline in this game but that doesn't

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.230 
storyline in this game but that doesn't
really<00:01:15.010> matter<00:01:15.220> because<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:15.970> game<00:01:16.210> is

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
really matter because this game is

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.950 
really matter because this game is
 awesome

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 

now<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.400> game<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
now as you can see this game is a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.670 
now as you can see this game is a
scrolling<00:01:24.479> shooter<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.170> interesting

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
scrolling shooter but the interesting

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.410 
scrolling shooter but the interesting
thing<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:26.010> stinger<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
thing about stinger is that it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.050 
thing about stinger is that it
alternates<00:01:27.900> every<00:01:28.560> other<00:01:28.680> board<00:01:29.130> between

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
alternates every other board between

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.469 
alternates every other board between
vertical<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.080> horizontal<00:01:31.159> scrolling<00:01:32.479> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
vertical and horizontal scrolling so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.899 
vertical and horizontal scrolling so
it's<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.200> very<00:01:34.280> very<00:01:35.280> unique<00:01:35.400> game<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it's a it's a very very unique game that

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's a it's a very very unique game that
way<00:01:37.670> now<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> gameplay<00:01:39.030> breaks<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:39.750> like

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
way now the gameplay breaks down like

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.330 
way now the gameplay breaks down like
this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340

stinger<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.640> wasn't<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> very<00:03:09.150> popular<00:03:09.810> game

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
stinger it wasn't a very popular game

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.620 
stinger it wasn't a very popular game
and<00:03:10.530> God<00:03:11.250> knows<00:03:11.459> why<00:03:11.609> because<00:03:11.970> it's<00:03:12.120> it's<00:03:12.390> I

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
and God knows why because it's it's I

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.150 
and God knows why because it's it's I
think<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.930> one<00:03:13.079> of<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.230> best<00:03:13.410> scrolling

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
think it's one of the best scrolling

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.780 
think it's one of the best scrolling
shooters<00:03:14.570> ever<00:03:15.570> made

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
shooters ever made

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.990 
shooters ever made
despite<00:03:17.790> its<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.060> cutesy<00:03:18.450> appearance<00:03:20.000> it's

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
despite its a cutesy appearance it's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.750 
despite its a cutesy appearance it's
very<00:03:21.240> challenging<00:03:24.830> this<00:03:25.830> game<00:03:26.100> however<00:03:26.490> in

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
very challenging this game however in

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.230 
very challenging this game however in
Japan<00:03:27.180> was<00:03:27.540> extremely<00:03:28.170> popular<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:29.240> it's

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
Japan was extremely popular and it's

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.940 
Japan was extremely popular and it's
sold<00:03:30.510> very<00:03:30.780> well<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.260> series<00:03:31.530> went<00:03:31.740> on<00:03:31.800> to

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
sold very well the series went on to

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.670 
sold very well the series went on to
make<00:03:32.100> oh<00:03:32.310> maybe<00:03:32.910> six<00:03:33.300> or<00:03:33.450> seven<00:03:33.840> more<00:03:33.960> games<00:03:34.350> I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
make oh maybe six or seven more games I

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.920 
make oh maybe six or seven more games I
think<00:03:34.740> something<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.810> was

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
think something like that and it was

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.900 
think something like that and it was
available<00:03:37.140> on<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.560> MSX<00:03:38.250> system<00:03:38.670> for

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
available on the MSX system for

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.170 
available on the MSX system for
computers<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:40.530> our<00:03:41.160> friends<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.580> Europe<00:03:41.760> are

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
