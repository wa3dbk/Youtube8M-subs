protect us you know from failure but
that's<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.320> entrepreneurs<00:01:28.920> work<00:01:29.220> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that's not how entrepreneurs work you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.340 
that's not how entrepreneurs work you
know<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.790> old<00:01:29.970> saying<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.450> entrepreneurs

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
know that old saying that entrepreneurs

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
know that old saying that entrepreneurs
would<00:01:31.530> rather<00:01:31.710> work<00:01:31.979> 80<00:01:32.280> hours<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.030> forty

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
would rather work 80 hours and forty

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600 
would rather work 80 hours and forty
well<00:01:34.170> we'd<00:01:34.409> rather<00:01:34.619> work<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:34.890> ourselves<00:01:35.070> 80

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
well we'd rather work for ourselves 80

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.490 
well we'd rather work for ourselves 80
hours<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> work<00:01:36.570> 40<00:01:36.960> hours<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
hours and to work 40 hours on a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.340 
hours and to work 40 hours on a
nine-to-five<00:01:38.270> but<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> idea<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> we

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
nine-to-five but the idea is that we

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.539 
nine-to-five but the idea is that we
can't<00:01:40.680> allow<00:01:41.150> comments<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.689> ideas<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:44.040> take

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
can't allow comments and ideas to take

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.609 
can't allow comments and ideas to take
host<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.119> our<00:01:45.240> minds<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.229> happens

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
host in our minds because what happens

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.399 
host in our minds because what happens
is<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> movie<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
is just like in this movie you know the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.380 
is just like in this movie you know the
little<00:01:49.590> baby<00:01:49.920> survives<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.790> grows<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.030> it

avenges its mother and a lot of those
movies<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.350> see<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:55.829> how<00:01:56.369> these

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
movies that you see and that's how these

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.910 
movies that you see and that's how these
ideas<00:01:57.060> start<00:01:57.390> out<00:01:57.540> they<00:01:57.719> basically<00:01:58.200> fester<00:01:58.799> in

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
ideas start out they basically fester in

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.219 
ideas start out they basically fester in
your<00:01:59.070> mind<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.460> they're<00:01:59.579> small<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.149> first<00:02:00.229> but

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
your mind and they're small at first but

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.810 
your mind and they're small at first but
if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.439> allow<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.130> stay<00:02:02.369> there<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.640> you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
if you allow them to stay there and you

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.569 
if you allow them to stay there and you
don't<00:02:03.030> eradicate<00:02:03.810> them<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.070> they<00:02:05.100> grow

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
don't eradicate them you know they grow

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.670 
don't eradicate them you know they grow
and<00:02:05.729> eventually<00:02:06.240> start<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.869> take<00:02:07.140> over<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and eventually start to take over and

and eventually start to take over and
then<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.399> saw<00:02:08.940> yourself<00:02:09.000> getting<00:02:09.539> closer<00:02:09.840> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
then you saw yourself getting closer you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.869 
then you saw yourself getting closer you
to<00:02:10.259> your<00:02:10.410> dream<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.920> now<00:02:11.370> there's<00:02:11.610> starting

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
really sometimes have to let it go

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.990 
really sometimes have to let it go
because<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.430> don't<00:02:51.580> want<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.790> sit<00:02:51.970> there

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000

defending what you're doing all the time

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970 
defending what you're doing all the time
so<00:02:54.880> that's<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.240> best<00:02:55.450> way<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.560> can<00:02:56.710> keep

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
so that's the best way that you can keep

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.370 
so that's the best way that you can keep
that<00:02:57.040> there<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:58.660> know<00:02:58.780> allow<00:02:59.200> yourself

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
that there and you know allow yourself

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.440 
that there and you know allow yourself
to<00:02:59.830> keep<00:03:00.040> your<00:03:00.280> dreams<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.850> not<00:03:00.970> let<00:03:01.240> other

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
to keep your dreams and not let other

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.180 
to keep your dreams and not let other
people<00:03:01.930> snatch<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.440> away<00:03:02.500> because<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.980> lot<00:03:03.160> of

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
people snatch it away because a lot of

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.040 
people snatch it away because a lot of
times<00:03:03.430> they<00:03:03.580> don't<00:03:03.610> mean<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.120> in<00:03:04.210> any<00:03:04.660> kind<00:03:04.990> of

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
times they don't mean it in any kind of

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.200 
times they don't mean it in any kind of
bad<00:03:05.260> way<00:03:05.560> it's<00:03:05.800> just<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.340> because<00:03:07.000> they're

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
bad way it's just that because they're

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.580 
bad way it's just that because they're
not<00:03:07.360> doing<00:03:07.600> at<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.840> lot<00:03:07.990> of<00:03:08.110> times<00:03:08.350> they<00:03:08.560> don't

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
not doing at a lot of times they don't

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.230 
not doing at a lot of times they don't
want<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.190> do<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.460> or<00:03:09.550> don't<00:03:09.640> think<00:03:10.000> that

want you to do it or don't think that
you<00:03:10.360> can<00:03:10.570> do<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.990> hope<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.260> found<00:03:11.410> this

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
of a twist there because I don't think

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.390 
of a twist there because I don't think
you<00:03:17.110> probably<00:03:17.260> knew<00:03:17.620> how<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:18.010> going<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.220> go
