00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the steering wheel dashboard the only

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
the steering wheel dashboard the only
difference<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.079> powered<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
difference is how it's powered so the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.050 
difference is how it's powered so the
car<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.370> now<00:00:50.670> powered<00:00:50.969> by<00:00:51.120> batteries<00:00:51.329> okay
