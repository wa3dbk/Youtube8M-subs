00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.790
 researchers from Pará and Ceará found that the Amazon has the largest 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.360
 underground water reservoir of the planet the aquifer at the foot of the ground already 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.709
 was known to the scientists they just did not know what was so great about 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.709
 reportage is by daniela assayag 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.689
 min nowhere is it so easy to take out the refrigerator 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.439
 all fresh water in the 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.919
 everything is in the amazon seems very 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.820
 oldest and most classic here 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.020
 concentration from video defense 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.280
 underground 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.730
 there are giant sides of drinking water called baggers so far the largest 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.470
 of the planet was the Guarani that spreads across Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.830
 one more group of researchers has just revealed she preferred the caution of the floor 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.450
 which stretches across the Amazon para acre and amapá is almost everything sometimes bigger 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.650
 this represents a moment of now of 86 thousand cubic kilometers 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.920
 if we compare with the block in which the Guarani for example he tried 45 thousand 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.460
 cubic kilometers most of the Guaraní aquifer in southern Brazil 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.310
 is in possession of the folder 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.400
 already a lecture in the Amazon has land for some other 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.020
 when you spent an afternoon 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.430
 penetrate easily paulo 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.320
 the area makes a kind of 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.720
 natural filter 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.079
 the water of the underground reservoir then comes to comment 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.510
 good to drink 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.390
 sand drilling is easy and cheap 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.400
 the post also needs treatment plant 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.090
 in the house of Marcier the water went straight to the tap after drinking at last 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.630
 year 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.830
 since the particular fossati as physical therapy 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.440
 we had a pool to supply 40% of the vandal population 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 but most of the city 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.420
 you can supply all cities within the scheme in the amazon 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.350
 with the permission without any problem to stop using these murky waters 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.420
 are all contaminated 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.220
 you can override that expected on the theme 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.180
 now researchers want help from the national water agency and the bank 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.800
 world 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.080
 to complete the study the planet threatened by heating the aquifer 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.380
 alter the floor is a strategic reserve to resume this sector to 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.430
 population of the world 300 or 400 years
