00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you can fold

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.460 
you can fold
back<00:02:20.430> up<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.760> put<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> pan<00:02:21.209> get<00:02:21.540> back

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
back up and put it in the pan get back

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.930 
back up and put it in the pan get back
in<00:02:22.650> there<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.190> mean<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.459> not<00:02:23.640> going<00:02:23.819> to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
in there but I mean it's not going to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.699 
in there but I mean it's not going to
fit<00:02:24.120> perfectly<00:02:24.360> just<00:02:24.959> because<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:25.410> kind<00:02:25.620> of

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
fit perfectly just because it's kind of

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.759 
fit perfectly just because it's kind of
like<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:27.360> know<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.930> material<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.470> not<00:02:28.620> like

like a you know the material is not like

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:35.300 
like a you know the material is not like
smooth<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.480> smooth<00:02:30.750> but<00:02:34.040> does<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.069> go

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
smooth and it is smooth but does it go

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.400 
smooth and it is smooth but does it go
bad<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.730> quite<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.090> well<00:02:36.269> right<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:37.319> know

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
