00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:11.219
 the materials that we are going to need 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.219
 they are a piece of hard cardboard 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.370
 a ball of cork which 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.740
 used to roast dates 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:26.100
 scissors or paint of the color that you want 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.010
 and glue and a brush to put the 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.970
 glue 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.970
 let's take out 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.700
 a large one cardboard circle 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.700
 and three little ones 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780
 Y 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.720
 and this is going to be the top of the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.720
 pacifier that if you look 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.609
 the big circle cut good so what 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.059
 what are we going to do first before we paste 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.090
 we're going to paint it, I'm going to paint it 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.470
 of rose 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.390
 because it's going to be a detail for 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.550
 from girl to girl 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.180
 so what I do is put it 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.380
 on top of a magazine a paper 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.420
 to make it easier to paint 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.420
 nothing happens if the background is stained 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.590
 we would paint it on one side and then on 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.590
 the other 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.070
 the little ball also the little ball there is also 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 what to paint 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.190
 we would let it dry we would give it the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.920
 back and we would paint the other side 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.750
 exactly the same 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.630
 once we have painted all the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.830
 pieces what you have to do is paste two 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.830
 of the small circles 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.750
 and put them here in the middle 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.230
 ah 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.460
 another of the circles that we have cut 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.970
 we're going to put them on the other side 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.970
 ah 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.600
 and the little ball 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.150
 we have painted 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.160
 we're going to put it on the side where we've 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.360
 put the circles 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.360
 both together 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.210
 and this has given me contracts 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.270
 and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.099
 this must be left to dry 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.989
 and give him a little paint job again 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.920
 so everything is the same because 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.860
 example the sides are unpainted 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.400
 then let's leave it 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.730
 what do I know a little and let's paint it 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.150
 another capita of rose in this case or blue 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.879
 if you celis for children 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.450
 once we have painted everything as 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:30.470
 You see, everything is painted, let's put 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.980
 the name of the girl's baby or 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.440
 child above with a black marker a 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.020
 black pen like you like us 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.000
 and we can use both ways to 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.820
 decorate a party for example the baby 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.330
 shower or christening or whatever you want 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.830
 party at home or we will take a 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.830
 circle of a transparent paper 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.030
 to put it why 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.740
 the detail of the gift 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.740
 we can have some caramelitos 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.640
 You see we put a little bit up here 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.640
 and we are going to close it 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.010
 very little 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.340
 and so we would be closed with the 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.070
 lacito and ready then to give it of 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.170
 detail to our guests because I hope 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.200
 that you liked it, leave me a like if 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.220

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.220
