00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.060
 good afternoon my name is nikolai i am 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.000
 manager for the sale of tires in the auto complex 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.760
 series today we will talk about 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.070
 how to choose a winter tire that 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.720
 better studded non-studded 1 h 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.190
 I propose to consider with you 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.490
 why can't you plan anyway 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.490
 summer tire in winter here is all about 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.100
 composition of rubber due to which the summer 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.900
 tire at negative temperatures 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.820
 just dubeet accordingly all of her 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.600
 characteristics are reduced almost 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.400
 reduced to zero 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.260
 increases braking distance decreases 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.060
 car handling according to 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.460
 this will make you less safe 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.710
 feel in your car 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.930
 winter tires in turn is different from 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.760
 summer it was the composition of the rubber band went on 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.329
 budget group retains its properties 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.149
 coupling characteristics and handling up to 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.000
 temperature -20 degrees respectively 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.980
 premium tires retain their these 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.050
 properties then much lower 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.610
 negative temperatures will talk to 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.560
 you about how studded rubber 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.930
 different from mishukov not or in 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.610
 Velcro studded studded 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.979
 rubber has improved performance 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.799
 when operating on ice and rolled 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.990
 snow and well behaved on the pavement 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.750
 braking distance on studded tires with 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.360
 speeds up to 50 now is 30 32 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.799
 meters at non-studded rubber brake 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.420
 the path is at the same speed 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.689
 somewhere around 40 50 on summer tires 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.770
 braking distances 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.360
 increased to 60-80 meters necked 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.280
 tires despite the lack of spikes 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.680
 is all such winter tires and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.640
 allows you to safely operate your 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.049
 vehicles 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.140
 advantages studless tires 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.180
 The following is this tire 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.360
 more comfortable due to the fact that she does not 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.060
 noisier softer due to lack 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.210
 spikes and allows you to operate the machine 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.829
 at higher speeds studless 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.450
 tires are still recommended when 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.430
 operation of the machine in large 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.909
 metropolitan areas such as Moscow 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.100
 where everything is cleaned you are members all roads 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.950
 constantly knocked down quiet and we exploit 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.830
 the car is mainly on asphalt without 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.680
 icing 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.270
 in our lane in our operation 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.970
 the city of Vladimir is still recommended 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.250
 use studded tire when our 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.470
 dense streams brought by yards and 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.900
 Roads are better than tires 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.390
 I propose to consider a good option 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.000
 non-studded tires from michelin 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.150
 This model is called x-ice north 3 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.550
 at 7 percent this model has 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.660
 shortened stopping distance on ice and on 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.850
 17 percent 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.090
 improved characteristics when accelerating 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.590
 ice all these characteristics 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.800
 provided by the fact that the manufacturer on 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.470
 this model applied but figurative 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.440
 lamellas that increase the amount for 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.080
 cling edges and micro pump for 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.130
 water drainage cost of this tire in 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.670
 Amount 205 55 16 for the month of September 14 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.200
 year is 6000 rubles as 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.980
 studded tires suggest you 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.170
 consider the manufacturer of the company 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.860
 michelin model is called x-ice north 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.570
 3 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.580
 This tire has improved 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.080
 performance on ice and 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.209
 pleasant snow due to the application 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.130
 and technology and straight here these here 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.690
 releases are called ai technology 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.360
 reception that allows you to output 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.519
 crumb out of the contact patch ensuring 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.550
 best spike engagement 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.340
 tires also have a pattern from this 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.130
 shaped sipes that improve 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.860
 gearing during acceleration and 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.600
 braking tires x-ice 3 is such 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.950
