00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.730
 you have to walk the avalanches father and 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.980
 we continue with the third part of 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.289
 special movements of live holding 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.250
 this time we will see alpha 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.740
 christi sara page and harry and finally 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.260
 abbot remember that the movements of 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.529
 charged blows are performed once 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.449
 that your vital bar flashes red and 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.309
 here I'm going to put them good I'm going to 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.559
 put some convicts to cover them 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.420
 then for them to do the nucleus 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.420
 critical and finally the blow charged 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.480
 these are good alpha movements 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.920
 has in fact three critical cores 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.260
 here we will not go I will put those that are 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.700
 those that I used is done first the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.010
 convicted that and then 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.680
 they are done in the two critical cores 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.860
 followed already after the blow charged 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.510
 it's pretty simple to do it 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.870
 and in fact this character has 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.550
 lots of combos to stun the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.370
 enemies 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.730
 this is the grip the takedown grip 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.730
 to the limit 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.550
 in fact they are exactly the same as 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.490
 of my case is because this character 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.360
 is a super powerful case clone 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.190
 then all movements are 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.760
 similar nothing but you see in 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.760
 transparent 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.650
 they are Chinese, I like them a lot 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.620
 the movements of this is the coup 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.800
 in the grip to the limit that are very 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.540
 similar good indeed if they are equal 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.540
 alpha because we can use it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.670
 this is Christian these are the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.810
 Christie's movements do not criticize and 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.810
 his blow charged 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.930
 this convict that I put here is 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.270
 pretty simple nothing else are 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.310
 it's three hits 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.179
 and his loaded blow is pretty chingón 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.179
 I do not like it very much 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.090
 also it is not unlocked 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.260
 many costumes why I put him that is 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.569
 the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.079
 the classic 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.560
 and this is going to be the knockdown in the grip 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.280
 the limit is also cool 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280
 drink 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.010
 as I was telling you this is one of the costumes 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.620
 classic I like it a lot because it's 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.739
 malita and open and teach 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.670
 its attributes and this is going to be the hit 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.670
 in the grip to the limit 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.750
 this has been 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.170
 the super bowl step that gives them already 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.170
 auction 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.519
 this will be and here are her boyfriend 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.379
 critical and his blow charged this is one 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.120
 of the characters that come from virtua 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.440
 fighter faith like shakira 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.590
 also has 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.880
 then several combos to stun anything else 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.400
 that the truth to me is a 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.120
 character very difficult to use or not 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.599
 I find him a lot 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.170
 how to make mistakes but the cis 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:20.099
 it's cool the character this is going to be the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.099
 knock down at the limit grip 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.940
 he also seemed like guy fight free 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.840
 how did this character tell you if he has 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.730
 it's cool to use but the truth is not 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.550
 it's from my favorite characters this is going to 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.560
 be the hit in the grip to the limit 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.280
 and he puts a super mega skate sasso 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.280
 against the floor 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.140
 I no longer have many costumes 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.990
 this is the other character page an 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.520
 also comes from factor factor five and 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.100
 fact is in this character I liked 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.530
 quite a thought that good at the beginning 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.870
 too half xavi already but then already a 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.550
 once I started using them and if you have 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.400
 very chingones movements this is 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.440
 a blow loaded and put but in 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.590
 general is very ideal to the little one to 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.410
 to use it, I quite liked your way of 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.889
 Fight 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.510
 and for you it's not going to be him 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.220
 the take down take it 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.190
 It's cool 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.520
 and has very chunky blows for example 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.970
 that kick with which the star gives me 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.770
 enough and this is going to be the blow that 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.770
 he also puts a little leg 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.380
 it looks very cool as the potato is in the 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.180
 air 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.820
 then it's also from virtua fighter 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.460
 faith is called page and 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.230
 Rick is from the new characters here 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.720
 is his critical block and his hit 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.700
 loaded this is also a character that 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.470
 I super mega charm that is has a 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.180
 chingo of movements well perrones 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.880
 devastating 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.590
 in general it looks very very cool indeed 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.389
 the other day I put on facebook a 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.289
 photography where I made a comparison 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.540
 between this guy and jake de racing and vélez 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.180
 six 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.210
 I find it quite like that is 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.520
 physically they look very similar but 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.870
 this character is as I tell you very 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.610
 chingón this is going to be the demolition 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.610
 it's cool they missed their heads 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.999
 and that's how they are so badass that is 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.310
 has a few combos of many hits 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:39.409
 although obviously they are difficult to 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.479
 connect all goes 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.030
 I really like this character this is going to 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.110
 be him 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.580
 knock 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.580
 with the super kick too 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.919
 this girl the character pleased me 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.569
 quite a very good addition to the 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.629
 saga I hope you keep putting it in 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:03.120
 future games and finally we have to 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:05.669
 more a single critic and his blow charged 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.440
 this character the truth to me I do not 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.320
 I liked it very much but also while 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.180
 I was using it I found many many 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.070
 benefits what I do not like is more 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.130
 well its its appearance like this like that 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.010
 it's half a sucker but in 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:23.220
 definitive its its combos and its attacks 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.320
 They are very good from that 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.910
 I've seen several videos where where they do 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.760
 tournaments and they use a lot to this 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.250
 character and they make a few mega combos that 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.480
 usually very chingones and the worst is 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.100
 that their homes are 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.580
 so in block speak 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.430
 and if they do enough damage that was the 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.700
 knock down in the grip to the limit is 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:51.460
 cool as it makes a rare breaker 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:55.240
 and finally this is the blow 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:57.190
 taking a good guillotine this was the 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.560
 Last character for this occasion 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.460
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.460
 Well, see you there
