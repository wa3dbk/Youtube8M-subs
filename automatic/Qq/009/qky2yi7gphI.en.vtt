00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.810
 for this traveling market exhibition locations have been chosen from the big one 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.880
 historical value 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.010
 favorite fish not to rely on the more classic ristic policy 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.700
 some different was instead made by the other art fair held in 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.260
 contemporary at the urine congress building 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.650
 which involved as many 50 galleries in fierce competition with those 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.510
 summon the dairy 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 the opinion leaders of the sector have however promoted from go to contemporary 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.390
 indicated sparkling event in step with the times an interesting combination 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.270
 between ancient and contemporary 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.660
 the inaugural evening was held for the invited collectors the public, 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.680

 unrefined politicians rutelli bonino is also involved 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.760
 the critics bonito itrana olive 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.350
 but how the gallery owners saw the choice of setting up prestigious ones 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.830
 historic homes 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.880
 in the meantime I don't think it's a fair I don't think it has reached yet 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.640
 let's say a large number so to be able to finish at the fair 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 is an exhibition 1 interesting exhibit 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 this place is particularly interesting 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.450
 I personally decided on the basis of the wall 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.169
 I have 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:26.079
 piazza irnerio roma regarding the market especially with the content 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:28.440
 20 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.599
 I would say enough 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.599
 fuck right now 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.289
 an interesting potential 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.289
 exist quality institution mister I love 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.109
 yes. I am 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.779
 goods 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.229
 pooh 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.379
 Hey 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.359
 contemporary art market list 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.249
 but to say that journalism is wrong in trusting only homes 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:19.959
 of auctions that are 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.389
 naturally important element but punches with the market vision of 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.919
 partial auctions 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.809
 I would invite all journalists to reflect more seriously 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.179
 on a market that is much more 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.089
 It is true that 2007 was a very good year for listing auctions 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.169
 It is true that he was very good 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.709
 we private 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.269
 in 2008 however I believe that there will be a slight reflection 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.819
 a slight downturn is a southern repositioning 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:57.469
 first choice actors the names of the galleries in life 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:01.269
 bacardi at the fontina of San Gimignano from the pupils madara uchiha 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.779
 from you nannini 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:07.259
 it remains only to ascertain whether the beautiful impressions found are being riders 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.970
 also sold on the market 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.340
 because it is after all it is always a fair
