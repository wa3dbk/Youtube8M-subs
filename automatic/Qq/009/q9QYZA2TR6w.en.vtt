here<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.440> building<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:07.980> guess<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.849> just

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
here is to building I guess it's just

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.350 
here is to building I guess it's just
this<00:00:09.179> abandoned<00:00:09.750> parking<00:00:09.929> lot<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:11.360> there's

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
this abandoned parking lot that there's

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.690 
this abandoned parking lot that there's
nothing<00:00:12.960> i<00:00:13.259> mean<00:00:13.650> i<00:00:13.830> think<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.160> there's<00:00:14.580> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
nothing i mean i think was there's a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.099 
nothing i mean i think was there's a
grocery<00:00:14.880> store<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.360> used<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.719> there<00:00:15.900> and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
grocery store that used to be there and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.330 
grocery store that used to be there and
I<00:00:16.139> think<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> parking<00:00:16.980> lots<00:00:17.100> for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
I think that's what the parking lots for

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.980 
I think that's what the parking lots for
but<00:00:17.520> obviously<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.359> grocery<00:00:18.630> starts<00:00:18.869> out

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
but obviously that grocery starts out

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.150 
but obviously that grocery starts out
there<00:00:19.170> anymore<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.619> there's<00:00:19.770> nothing<00:00:19.890> this

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
there anymore so there's nothing this

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.189 
there anymore so there's nothing this
particle<00:00:20.520> has<00:00:20.609> been<00:00:20.820> used<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.150> anything<00:00:21.330> but

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
particle has been used for anything but

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.660 
particle has been used for anything but
I<00:00:22.260> guess<00:00:22.439> they're<00:00:22.619> building<00:00:23.039> something<00:00:23.310> right

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
I guess they're building something right

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.970 
I guess they're building something right
now<00:00:23.699> which<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.119> awesome<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.529> wonder<00:00:25.830> what
