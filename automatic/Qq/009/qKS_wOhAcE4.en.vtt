00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.410
 and this e but of course of course it's 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.270
 a pleasure to see her again 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.699
 I am told that she has become a 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.320
 huge star in england for 30 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.449
 years I managed to avoid it I'm away 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 very well it seems that she is the one who 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.140
 must give you the honor prize to 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.650
 Saturday evening ceremony qualis 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.650
 first life 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.859
 you are beautiful this is practically 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.180
 not changed 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.270
 I wish I could return you the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.270
 compliment 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.170
 did not want you to imagine 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.990
 that I'm doing this in memory of our 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.010
 little romance but I will not care 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.010
 wade little three monsters 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.440
 I was often asked why I 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.200
 renounced to cinema after working 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.710
 with you say that the answer is in 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.930
 the question 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.030
 I was drunk and it was Brussels 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.220
 my actress it's me who made it 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.300
 finally decided to do not care ap if I had 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.590
 not been there should not delay in banville 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.759
 it is important to avoid any contact with 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.300
 him otherwise we risk a total tocard 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:14.560
 beautiful gorgeous good sense she 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.369
 still comes to demolish you in front of 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.690
 400 people 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.800
 but why do you believe that a woman 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.410
 either to taste so bad to piss off 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.300
 a man judging by the way you 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.729
 react to all this I would say that you 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:30.060
 so you're always there you say no matter 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:32.020

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 Alice is what you would be obliging 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.330
 to kindly pass me the salt to go 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.550
 if you see, we 'll have to escape 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.430
 his thirty years pass me salt 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:47.040
 when our hearts cool for all with 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.720
 deposits but these shelters I want to hold 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.630
 hot for wrestling left without 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170
