00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.070
 He looked 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.939
 I have come very well in the introduction 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.799
 of the video appeared this clip in which 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.720
 let's learn how to make a bridge now 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.460
 tour for all of us who play sky 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.200
 wars and well I decided to do this 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.869
 because I actually see that many 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.610
 Minecraft people are used many 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.950
 cheating and good actually because 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.200
 we make one even if we do not have 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.360
 Real this but I know that with this picture 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.030
 green that itself is quite efficient and that 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.950
 really is not at all so 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.659
 first let's see what we're going to do 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.580
 Half the bridge we will not do 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.130
 all the bridge of our adversary 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.200
 but they only show our half of the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.600
 bridge and good we're going to do it type 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.909
 sure because we do this because if not 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.640
 may the trap be skipped and not fall 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.250
 in it so and good nothing else 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.200
 we put this and good now in caval 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.720
 where we finished and we are going to put here 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.810
 a 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.700
 what's this called a ladder and good 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.440
 here we are going to put the block and we are going to 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.170
 put the other ladder and good after 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.800
 of the two stairs we do as you see 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.080
 here we put more security and here back 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.610
 of the two stairs will go where he goes 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.710
 to fall that is going to be the price and 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.650
 be careful there, do not try it at home 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.440
 I 'm not going to do that and well in 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.380
 actually let's see what we're going to do here 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.780
 put the last and mono would be the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.500
 last staircase as you see two stairs 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.600
 the precipice and another staircase as you see 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.340
 what a joke to see if he left me jane 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.650
 seymour then let's put here 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.690
 only for us to avenge ourselves 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.150
 when the adversary comes or the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.650
 opponent or our enemy come to us 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.690
 let's move away from the bridge because if not 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.390
 is not going to want to happen then we're going to 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.660
 see now the view that he is going to have and 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.330
 good as you see here it is not noticeable at all 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.090
 where is the hole where is the 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.470
 trap and good as they look good I'm going 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.590
 to do if I if it were me I would 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.350
 a safe bridge because actually 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.310
 well there we are going to remove this blog that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:11.220
 we lack if it were like they see going to 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.690
 run away and when you see that it's not going to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.350
 see but we 're going to see what 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.820
 way there is a hole then there goes to 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.600
 drop the then as you see from here 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.250
 up it looks good 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.320
 and well, it's really not going to have anything 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.270
 to do something else other than jumping 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.340
 that hole then there if we 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.410
 I have to leave us so 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.260
 I suggest that you hide because if we 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.730
 go on let's say at the tip of the bridge there 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.160
 will want to pass because you're going to see 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.020
 that something or something is working 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.540
 with these stairs and all that is still 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.850
 As you can see, it 's pretty easy and good 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.470
 down that stairs always put on 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.270
 the last staircase always put a 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.380
 block of wood because if it's not it's going to 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.660
 can camouflage let's say 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.540
 what would be the bridge and good here 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.200
 dismissal if you liked leave me your like in 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.610
 water positively so that in those in 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.760
 the following videos I come to you 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.050
 bringing as more traps do not be with 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.760
 networks because the rest is not in 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.990
 multiplayer but we do not have anything else 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.000
 in single player with the mod 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.830
 and well actually the truth that to me 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.080
 I liked it a lot already I've tried it 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.360
 sky wars and if it works 100% yes 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.459
 it works not all people fit 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.440
 because there are many people who know about 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.030
 that today there are many people who 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.030
 cheats on our website are called 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.650
 chapel so nothing else up here 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.780
 dismissal as always do not forget 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.250
 anything of doubt or with things that 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.290
 They want to always send me this lie 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.190
 steal from bhd and see you in the next 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.190
 areas
