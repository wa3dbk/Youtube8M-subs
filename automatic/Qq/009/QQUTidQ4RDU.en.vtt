 multivitamins and omega-3 fatty acids 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.570
 when we go on a diet we often 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.580
 cut out your diet and make it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.649
 less diverse and some it 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.800
 generally not varied in principle 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.720
 life so this can all affect so 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.759
 or otherwise on the functioning of our 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.990
 organs that is they will not 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.080

 micro matrons clients and a wife of the world 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.780
 acid so here to avoid this 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.270

 our body is not able to accumulate 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.230
 vitamins every five hours they are required 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.350
 him again 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.540
 it's impossible to eat them during the summer and 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.060
 so that you nazimom body and therefore 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.730
 cyclical roofing is also unnecessary 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.470

 there is protein on it and when we 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.650
 dieting it is advisable to increase 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.420
 the amount of protein in our auction 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.340
 since the body is not capable 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 use protein as energy 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.720
 effectively he only spends power on his 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.410
 recycling it will go on from good 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.080
 plus beyond that contained in the pope 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.360

 fatty lipolysis ignition key 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.300
 only happens when 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.330
 our body runs out of stock 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.550
 glycogen glycogen is carbohydrate with water 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.030
 which our bodies store in the liver and 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.280
 muscles 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.840
 this is the main source of energy like him 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.390
 ends our deal comes in 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.610

 arranged or carnitine and arginine this 2 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.620
 amino acids let's start with left carnitine 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.079
 amino acid is responsible for the transport of fat 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.400
 and the objects are sharp we have going on 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.030
 generating energy with me for 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.950
 body needs and the better 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.190

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.530
 arginine is an amino acid 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.769
 I have not spoken in previous releases 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.200
 be sure to look at arginine 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:20.220

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.590
