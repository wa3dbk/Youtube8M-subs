00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
has this bike is pretty much brand new

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.510 
has this bike is pretty much brand new
except<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.200> been<00:01:13.380> race<00:01:13.619> maybe<00:01:14.040> seven<00:01:14.430> or

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

except it's been race maybe seven or
eight<00:01:14.640> times<00:01:14.670> i<00:01:15.150> think<00:01:15.390> brad<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:15.960> seven

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
eight times i think brad is one seven

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.270 
eight times i think brad is one seven
out<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> eight<00:01:16.590> times<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.280> bike<00:01:17.549> already

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
out of eight times on this bike already

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.969 
out of eight times on this bike already
he<00:01:20.280> didn't<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.570> Nationals<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.890> up

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
accommodate the 5 inch tire the rear end

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.219 
accommodate the 5 inch tire the rear end
of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> bike<00:01:46.409> also<00:01:46.979> has<00:01:47.220> thru<00:01:48.000> axle<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:49.110> he

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
of the bike also has thru axle that he

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.039 
of the bike also has thru axle that he
actually<00:01:49.500> custom-made<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.670> hump<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.180> so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
actually custom-made this hump for so

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.249 
actually custom-made this hump for so
you<00:01:52.140> cut<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.590> part<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:55.219> 240<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.430> DT<00:01:57.329> hub<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you cut a part of a 240 of DT hub and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.760 
you cut a part of a 240 of DT hub and
made<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.560> wider<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> two

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
made it wider and so I like the two

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.389 
made it wider and so I like the two
first<00:02:02.009> thru<00:02:02.369> axle<00:02:02.549> rear<00:02:03.030> hub<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:04.399> it

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
first thru axle rear hub you can get it

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.370 
first thru axle rear hub you can get it
also<00:02:05.759> has<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.180> short<00:02:06.450> chain<00:02:06.780> stay<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.140> we

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
also has a really short chain stay so we

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.040 
also has a really short chain stay so we
had<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.560> bend<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> seat<00:02:08.069> tube<00:02:08.099> here<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.050> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
had to bend the seat tube here and the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.570 
had to bend the seat tube here and the
fat<00:02:10.229> tire<00:02:10.500> people<00:02:10.950> think<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
fat tire people think that the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.430 
fat tire people think that the
short-chain<00:02:11.910> state<00:02:12.420> gives<00:02:12.660> you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
short-chain state gives you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.160 
short-chain state gives you
