sometimes I get bored of working on my
hands<00:01:08.340> i<00:01:09.530> think<00:01:10.530> i<00:01:10.560> might<00:01:10.680> get<00:01:10.799> reawaken<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
hands i think i might get reawaken the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.749 
hands i think i might get reawaken the
spirit<00:01:12.150> if<00:01:12.330> i<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.630> kids<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.259> day<00:01:13.290> i<00:01:13.759> think

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
spirit if i have kids one day i think

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.149 
spirit if i have kids one day i think
i'd<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.229> make<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.440> seemed<00:01:16.710> really<00:01:16.920> normal

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
i'd like to make it seemed really normal

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.469 
i'd like to make it seemed really normal
to<00:01:17.400> them<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.850> pick<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> up<00:01:18.330> really

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

to them so they pick it up really
quickly<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.229> would<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.380> quite<00:01:19.500> cool

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
quickly I think that would be quite cool

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.980 
quickly I think that would be quite cool
if<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.670> thought<00:01:20.850> everyone's<00:01:21.420> dad<00:01:21.690> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
if they just thought everyone's dad just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.990 
if they just thought everyone's dad just
walked<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.380> their<00:01:22.500> handset<00:01:23.009> I'd<00:01:23.759> be<00:01:23.880> quite

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
science arguing back and forth but once

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.699 
science arguing back and forth but once
experienced<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.599> my<00:03:47.599> intuition<00:03:47.840> my<00:03:48.440> heart

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
experienced it my intuition my heart

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.680 
experienced it my intuition my heart
whatever<00:03:49.220> tells<00:03:49.640> me<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.180> then<00:03:50.330> even<00:03:50.569> the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
whatever tells me and then even the

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.270 
whatever tells me and then even the
logical<00:03:51.080> side<00:03:51.140> of<00:03:51.380> my<00:03:51.440> brain<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.830> like<00:03:52.010> Tim

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
logical side of my brain is like Tim

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.770

yeah<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.549> know<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:52.970> like<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.540> will<00:03:53.660> make

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
yeah you know this like it will make

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.470 
yeah you know this like it will make

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
generally when I'm training i'll try and

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.970 
generally when I'm training i'll try and
just<00:04:06.090> eat<00:04:06.239> fruit<00:04:07.170> throughout<00:04:07.349> the<00:04:07.590> day<00:04:07.739> maybe
