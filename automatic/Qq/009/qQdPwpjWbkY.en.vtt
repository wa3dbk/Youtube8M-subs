 hours of moisture a radiant 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.049

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.390

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.150

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.740
 we come to the consistency of the bab creams 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.600
 at the normal bibi green you can 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.299
 realize that it's a relatively solid one 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.109
 Consistency is but it can be very 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.149
 distribute well 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.399
 Here you can see the consistency of the coat 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.229
 baby seen and there you can already 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.240
 find that they are compared to 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.100
 normal bibi cream very much 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.890
 liquid is now we come to 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.960
 Apply the bab krems and have for that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.240
 I use a brush and you can 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.819
 see that the normal baby cream itself 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.579
 pretty good to spread on the face but 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.619
 in the end result she is very very 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.899
 Shiny on the skin I have you 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.969
 now here again in the whole 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.520
 Close with recorded that you the 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.189
 direct comparison have in the normal 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.560
 bibi cream you can tell that 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.659
 a very very brilliant I think 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.939
 come out end I recommend you 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.039
 plus the whole thing with one 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.350
 transparent potter a little too 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.300
 so fix the durability over 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.010
 The day is given in any case 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.670
 the matte baby cream you can 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.380
 determine 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.330
 because she is very fluid 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.970
 the very product in the brush 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.310
 disappears and therefore I recommend you 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.550
 In any case, the whole thing with the fingers 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.250
 in the face 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.770
 just to save a little product 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.780
 the matt bibi green is also possible 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.980
 spread very well on the skin 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.500
 Here you can also once again the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.750
 See the end result with I think she has 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.640
 a very nice matting effect 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.440
 and of course it is not there again 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 necessary that he with a transparent 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.940
 puberty what the blinding concerned 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.310
 I found that the normal bb 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.230
 cream can blend very well 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.780
 So here you can almost no edge 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.480
 can continue to detect each cream 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.270
 however, I found that one 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.220
 but can see a slight edge 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.920
 The whole thing is not so good 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.410
 Blend because somehow this one 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.790
 little darker though she is 14 bright 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.640
 skin type is suitable 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.500
 then we come to opacity and for it 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.630
 I have a little kohl on 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.330
 given the back of the hand to the direct 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.960
 to have a comparison and as you can see 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.170
 can 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.660
 the shiny baby cream covers well 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.610
 but it still seems a bit kajal 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.830
 so here you can get from one 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.660
 medium opacity also contribute 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.580
 I have the matte baby cream again 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.430
 a little kajal on the back of the hand 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.440
 given and you can see if I am 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.959
 she has distributed all of that very much 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.730
 Very well covers and one from the canal 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.270
 actually see almost nothing 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.370
 can 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.900
 I hope you liked the video
