00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.830
 very drastic are very good guys and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.459
 booklets and we are in a very news 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.039
 important and is that attentive because it 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:13.559
 varied to all players who use 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:17.160
 the reverse boost in call of duty 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.900
 advanced warfare attentive because you walk 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.870
 warfare like any title 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.030
 multiplayer well always or at least 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.730
 that try to provide an experience 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.090
 positive for the user community 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.400
 Well, they want to enjoy the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.130
 online without any problems 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.160
 that's why it seems good that 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.710
 some users always find the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.840
 way to make a trap 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.570
 and it goes of games in order to raise 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.629
 level or just being unfair 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.210
 really with others because of this 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.100
 michael condrey condrey has spoken to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.269
 respect and affirms that they are taking 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.339
 letters in the matter with day write has 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.739
 written a long statement where he has 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.460
 talked about the company from the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.740
 hammer game says it's very important 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.940
 for the community and it has been 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 elements such as the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.740
 matchmaking is based on the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 speed and above all the effectiveness of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.470
 the connection in order to find a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.990
 heading as fast as possible but where 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.270
 They found a recent problem because 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.300
 good that has made them that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.820
 gaming experience is something less than 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.190
 Enjoy enjoying and having fun not 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.649
 is the reverse &amp; bus what is this 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.259
 Well this technique is used by some 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.230
 users as with a high percentage of 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.840
 casualties and deaths 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.510
 dead right ratio thus accepting their 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.700
 statistics committing suicide constantly 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.590
 until you enter the algorithm that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.840
 allows access to games where there 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.820
 players with less experience in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.990
 these games obviously take 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.110
 please your skill your know how to play what 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.640
 that in essence returns from the games a 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.250
 battlefield where the team 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.170
 otherwise there is no opportunity and where 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.259
 only these players benefit 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.510
 for the experience and objects won 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.430
 condrey says he has been a victim of this 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.760
 trap and keep in mind the big problem 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.560
 what it means for the community and good 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.410
 as he has already made a statement that says 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.170
 the following have not been asked 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.250
 enough for our banning policies 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.739
 particularly now that players have 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.870
 used the reverse boosting with numerous 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.660
 suicides in multiplayer games what 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.459
 that has frustrated the community playing in 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.200
 house has been paired with players 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.810
 they do this and it's incredibly 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.060
 frustrating losing a game for not 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.459
 have the help of a partner many 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.420
 users have worried about this 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.010
 same 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.650
 there is someone who gives us a game for being 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.349
 outnumbered while a companion 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.050
 he shot grenades himself more than 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.849
 100 times our good and it affects the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.980
 individual gaming experience and in 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.950
 call of duty team is social 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.810
 competitive and we respect that part of the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.310
 competition is that the players do not 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.330
 degrade the ability to compete 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.550
 cleanly this is not different is in 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.790
 the ways that cheaters and 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.220
 busters are going to receive and we have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.950
 increased our forces in driving 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.959
 who uses in the reverse boosting nobody 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.610
 try to restrict fun with 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.769
 this policy and we are also not 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.769
 planning play styles such as trip 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.660
 shots however we have little 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.750
 tolerance with people who ruin 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.660
 experience to others through 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.940
 the traps busking and setbacks boosting or 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.130
 by means of offensive emblems in the 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.230
 game we do not like this to happen and 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.989
 We will do our best to eliminate 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.580
 these behaviors in the game well 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.680
 that this has been the letter he has written 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.860
 michael condrey are going to drive people 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.080
 make networks 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.970
 and nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.500
 information as always x favorites 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.250
 share and see you in the next 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.250
 bye
