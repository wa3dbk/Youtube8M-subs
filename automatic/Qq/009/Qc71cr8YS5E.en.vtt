hey it's bricks are on my scooter and

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.320 
hey it's bricks are on my scooter and
today<00:00:17.340> we're<00:00:17.520> gonna<00:00:17.670> look<00:00:17.789> at<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> Lego

right<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.699> Emmitt<00:00:54.000> which<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.420> came<00:00:54.629> with

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
right here is Emmitt which one came with

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.720 
right here is Emmitt which one came with

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
a poly bag yes the one on the left so

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
a poly bag yes the one on the left so
pretty<00:00:59.730> cool<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> roof<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pretty cool now the one on the roof the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.139 
pretty cool now the one on the roof the
other<00:01:01.559> side<00:01:01.829> has<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.399> piece<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.820> resistance

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
other side has the piece of resistance

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.939 
other side has the piece of resistance
we<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.140> ready<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.530> put<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> piece

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
we got this one ready to put the piece

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
we got this one ready to put the piece
of<00:01:05.129> resistance<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.080> one

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
of resistance on there but that is one

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.620 
of resistance on there but that is one
side<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.830> an<00:01:08.070> ear<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.820> left<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.270> his<00:01:09.450> other

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
side of an ear on the left is his other

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.870 
side of an ear on the left is his other
face<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.590> pretty<00:01:10.830> cool<00:01:11.070> let's<00:01:11.670> get

face so that is pretty cool let's get
this<00:01:12.000> dude<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.320> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
this dude out of here this is the one I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.050 
this dude out of here this is the one I
think<00:01:13.619> from<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> collectible<00:01:14.430> series<00:01:14.820> or

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
think from the collectible series or

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.969 
think from the collectible series or
from<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> other<00:01:15.659> sets<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.830> got

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
from one of the other sets and I got

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
from one of the other sets and I got
them<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.220> mixed<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.820> don't<00:01:17.970> remember<00:01:18.210> but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
them all mixed up I don't remember but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.980 
them all mixed up I don't remember but
the<00:01:19.680> main<00:01:19.860> thing<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> different

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
the main thing is we do get a different

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
the main thing is we do get a different
expression<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.830> rest<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.790> him<00:01:24.270> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
expression for in it so rest of him is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.310 
expression for in it so rest of him is
the<00:01:24.780> same<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:27.080> new<00:01:28.080> face

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the same but we have this new face

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.670 
the same but we have this new face
alright<00:01:28.920> here<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.340> completed<00:01:30.030> set<00:01:30.680> we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
alright here is the completed set we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.370 
alright here is the completed set we
have<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.400> rock<00:01:33.119> formation<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.020> hiding

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
have the rock formation that is hiding

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
have the rock formation that is hiding
the<00:01:34.500> piece<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.860> resistance<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the piece of resistance we have in it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:47.340 
the piece of resistance we have in it
this<00:01:36.540> coffee<00:01:36.840> cup<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:39.060> how<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.450 

so<00:01:48.310> that's<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.700> piece<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:48.909> resistance<00:01:50.280> yes<00:01:51.280> I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
so that's the piece of resistance yes I

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.100 
so that's the piece of resistance yes I
should<00:01:51.520> turned<00:01:51.909> it<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.210> other<00:01:52.360> way<00:01:52.479> I'm

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
should turned it the other way I'm

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.550 
should turned it the other way I'm
supposed<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.590> feel<00:01:53.740> like<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:55.410> but<00:01:56.410> it

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
supposed to feel like that but it

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.050 
supposed to feel like that but it
doesn't<00:01:56.860> matter<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.160> whole<00:01:57.280> rock<00:01:57.490> formation

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
doesn't matter the whole rock formation

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.390 
doesn't matter the whole rock formation
falls<00:01:58.300> apart<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:59.140> me<00:01:59.290> gets<00:01:59.470> knocked<00:01:59.680> over<00:01:59.890> by

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
falls apart and me gets knocked over by

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.630 
falls apart and me gets knocked over by
the<00:02:00.460> giant<00:02:00.790> hand<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.850> how<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.090> works

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the giant hand that's how it works

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.749 
the giant hand that's how it works
you<00:02:06.640> piece<00:02:07.150> of<00:02:07.300> resistance<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:08.050> he<00:02:08.200> found<00:02:08.440> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you piece of resistance so he found it

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.720 
you piece of resistance so he found it
and<00:02:09.759> will<00:02:10.030> stick<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.479> on<00:02:10.570> his<00:02:10.690> back<00:02:11.730> it's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and will stick it on his back it's

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.720 
and will stick it on his back it's
supposed<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.000> go<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.330> this
