the continuation to the previous parts
of<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.279> video<00:00:05.609> so<00:00:06.299> again<00:00:06.629> in<00:00:06.750> front<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.049> me<00:00:07.140> I

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
of this video so again in front of me I

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.879 
of this video so again in front of me I
have<00:00:07.440> my<00:00:07.589> Rockford<00:00:08.010> Fosgate<00:00:08.189> p2<00:00:09.469> as<00:00:10.469> well<00:00:10.710> as

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
have my Rockford Fosgate p2 as well as

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.360 
have my Rockford Fosgate p2 as well as
my<00:00:11.160> kicker<00:00:11.639> cv<00:00:12.420> r12<00:00:12.990> now<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:13.799> happened<00:00:14.160> was<00:00:14.309> I

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
my kicker cv r12 now what happened was I

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.210 
my kicker cv r12 now what happened was I
wired<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.360> subwoofer<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.139> series<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:17.010> both

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
wired this subwoofer in series with both

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.560 
wired this subwoofer in series with both
the<00:00:17.369> voice<00:00:17.520> coil<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> increased<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the voice coil so I increased the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.380 
the voice coil so I increased the
impedance<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> forums<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.970> also

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
impedance to forums and this was also

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.179 
impedance to forums and this was also
this<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.750> originally<00:00:22.230> wired<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.650> series<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
this was originally wired in series to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.429 
this was originally wired in series to
increase<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.730> 4<00:00:23.970> ohms<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.480> connected<00:00:25.320> them

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
increase it to 4 ohms I connected them

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.070 
increase it to 4 ohms I connected them
to<00:00:25.619> my<00:00:25.769> amplifier<00:00:26.070> both<00:00:26.820> boxes<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.449> series<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
to my amplifier both boxes in series and

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.410 
to my amplifier both boxes in series and
I<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.380> pushing<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.699> quite<00:00:29.910> well<00:00:30.150> but

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
I was pushing this one quite well but

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
I was pushing this one quite well but
this<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.960> barely<00:00:31.230> hitting<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:32.130> not

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
this one was barely hitting I was not

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.459 
this one was barely hitting I was not
sure<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.600> what<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> did<00:00:34.170> was

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
sure what was going on so what I did was

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.740 
sure what was going on so what I did was
I<00:00:34.680> wired<00:00:35.160> both<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.730> these<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.239> parallel

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
I wired both of these up in parallel

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.040 
I wired both of these up in parallel
with<00:00:36.930> my<00:00:37.079> amplifier<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.950> each<00:00:38.270> each<00:00:39.270> subwoofer

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
with my amplifier so each each subwoofer

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.040 
with my amplifier so each each subwoofer
was<00:00:40.230> being<00:00:40.829> driven<00:00:41.040> by<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> single<00:00:42.390> channel<00:00:42.870> on

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
was being driven by a single channel on

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.970 
was being driven by a single channel on
my<00:00:43.260> stereo

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
my stereo

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.779 
my stereo
jackhammer<00:00:44.879> MTX<00:00:45.539> audio<00:00:45.899> amplifier<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.610> what

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
jackhammer MTX audio amplifier so what

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.139 
jackhammer MTX audio amplifier so what
I've<00:00:47.910> done<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:49.280> again<00:00:50.280> these<00:00:50.579> two<00:00:50.820> subwoofers

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
I've done is again these two subwoofers

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.910 
I've done is again these two subwoofers
were<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.629> parallel<00:00:52.020> with<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.199> amplifier<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
were in parallel with that amplifier and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.100 
were in parallel with that amplifier and
what<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.460> happening<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.660> were<00:00:54.719> hitting

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
what was happening was they were hitting

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.420 
what was happening was they were hitting
well<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.559> they<00:00:55.680> were<00:00:55.739> only<00:00:55.890> getting<00:00:56.070> around

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
well but they were only getting around

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.150 
well but they were only getting around
200<00:00:56.910> watts<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.570> went<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.960> got<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.320> box<00:00:59.010> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
200 watts so I went and got the box of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.950 
200 watts so I went and got the box of
my<00:00:59.250> amplifier<00:00:59.550> again<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.600> read<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
my amplifier again and I read the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
my amplifier again and I read the
specifications<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.309> read

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
specifications on the back and I read

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.090 
specifications on the back and I read
that<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.969> 4<00:01:03.750> ohms<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.379> both<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.860> these<00:01:04.949> were

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that at 4 ohms which both of these were

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
that at 4 ohms which both of these were
wired<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> at<00:01:05.760> 4<00:01:06.299> ohms<00:01:06.450> they're<00:01:06.780> only<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
wired to at 4 ohms they're only going to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.500 
wired to at 4 ohms they're only going to
be<00:01:07.170> getting<00:01:07.380> 200<00:01:07.590> watts<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.580> 2<00:01:09.270> ohms

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
be getting 200 watts but at 2 ohms

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.380 
be getting 200 watts but at 2 ohms
they're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.110> getting<00:01:11.210> 400<00:01:12.210> watts

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
they're going to be getting 400 watts

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.320 
they're going to be getting 400 watts
which<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.670> capacity<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.909> amplifier

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
which is the capacity of this amplifier

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
which is the capacity of this amplifier
so<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.110> I've<00:01:16.200> done<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:17.009> drew<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> little

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
so what I've done is I drew up a little

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
so what I've done is I drew up a little
circuit<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> guys<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.600> case<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.900> guys

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
circuit for you guys in case you guys

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.270 
circuit for you guys in case you guys
are<00:01:19.170> interested<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.710> I'll<00:01:19.799> explain<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
are interested and I'll explain it to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490 
are interested and I'll explain it to
you<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> second<00:01:20.990> what<00:01:21.990> I've<00:01:22.080> done<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.350> I've

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you in a second what I've done is I've

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740 
you in a second what I've done is I've
wired<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.130> coils<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.790> each<00:01:24.030> sub<00:01:24.299> row<00:01:24.479> for

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
wired the coils of each sub row for

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.260 
wired the coils of each sub row for
individually<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.650> parallel<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.700> decrease<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
individually in parallel to decrease the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
individually in parallel to decrease the
impedance<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.869> 2<00:01:28.140> ohms<00:01:28.380> per<00:01:28.740> voice<00:01:28.950> coil<00:01:29.310> down

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
impedance of 2 ohms per voice coil down

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
impedance of 2 ohms per voice coil down
to<00:01:30.090> 1<00:01:30.329> ohm<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.170> wired<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> boxes<00:01:32.009> in

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to 1 ohm and then I wired the boxes in

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
to 1 ohm and then I wired the boxes in
series<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.820> double<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.509> impedance<00:01:34.020> back<00:01:34.320> up

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
series to double that impedance back up

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.859 
series to double that impedance back up
the<00:01:34.650> 2<00:01:34.799> ohms<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.360> driven<00:01:36.570> by

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the 2 ohms so that it can be driven by

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
the 2 ohms so that it can be driven by
the<00:01:36.930> amplifier<00:01:37.619> now<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.460> move<00:01:38.670> over<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the amplifier now if we move over to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.179 
the amplifier now if we move over to
this<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.689> schematic<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.890> I've<00:01:40.979> drawn

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
this little schematic that I've drawn

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.580 
this little schematic that I've drawn
over<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.570> just<00:01:42.570> gonna<00:01:42.750> let<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> camera

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
over here just gonna let the camera

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.880 
over here just gonna let the camera
focus<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.930> find<00:01:46.140> my<00:01:46.200> pencil<00:01:46.439> but

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
focus and now I can find my pencil but

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.990 
focus and now I can find my pencil but
I'm<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.310> use<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> screwdriver<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
I'm just going to use a screwdriver to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.539 
I'm just going to use a screwdriver to
point<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.329> stuff<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.829> front<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.220> me<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> have

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
point out stuff so in front of me I have

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.630 
point out stuff so in front of me I have
my<00:01:50.790> two<00:01:51.390> subwoofers<00:01:51.720> both<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.920> dual<00:01:53.460> voice

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
my two subwoofers both have dual voice

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.069 
my two subwoofers both have dual voice
coils<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> look<00:01:54.479> over<00:01:54.689> here

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
coils if you look over here

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.980 
coils if you look over here
one<00:01:55.560> voice<00:01:55.740> coil<00:01:56.130> two<00:01:56.670> voice<00:01:56.880> coils<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.540> then

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
one voice coil two voice coils and then

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.810 
one voice coil two voice coils and then
the<00:01:58.079> same<00:01:58.259> thing<00:01:58.500> applies<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> second

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the same thing applies for the second

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.149 
the same thing applies for the second
subwoofer<00:02:00.229> as<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.350> may<00:02:01.469> know<00:02:01.649> each<00:02:01.890> voice

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
subwoofer as you may know each voice

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.950 
subwoofer as you may know each voice
coil<00:02:02.520> has<00:02:02.700> its<00:02:02.969> positive<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.689> negative

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
coil has its positive and negative

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020 
coil has its positive and negative
terminals<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.979> said<00:02:05.219> before<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.969> I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
terminals so like I said before what I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
terminals so like I said before what I
did<00:02:06.210> was<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.570> bridge<00:02:06.990> these<00:02:07.200> two<00:02:07.350> terminals<00:02:07.619> on

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
did was I bridge these two terminals on

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.219 
did was I bridge these two terminals on
each<00:02:08.819> subwoofer<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> negative<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.140> going

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
each subwoofer so the negative is going

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.660 
each subwoofer so the negative is going
to<00:02:10.289> connect<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> negative<00:02:11.009> positive<00:02:11.610> is

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
to connect to the negative positive is

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.710 
to connect to the negative positive is
going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> connect<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> positive<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
going to connect to the positive and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.199 
going to connect to the positive and
then

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
then

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.520 
then
that<00:02:13.569> bridge<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.780> going<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.049> be<00:02:14.140> connected<00:02:14.469> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
that bridge is going to be connected to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.860 
that bridge is going to be connected to
the<00:02:14.620> back<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:14.859> the<00:02:14.920> box<00:02:15.069> come<00:02:15.849> on<00:02:15.969> it's<00:02:16.209> it's

it's I don't know Mike my phone is not
focusing<00:02:25.450> today<00:02:25.569> there<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.900> go<00:02:26.019> so<00:02:26.799> what<00:02:27.400> we're

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
focusing today there we go so what we're

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.250 
focusing today there we go so what we're
going<00:02:27.609> to<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:27.969> we're<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.930> start<00:02:29.170> off

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
going to do is we're going to start off

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.819 
going to do is we're going to start off
with<00:02:29.379> two<00:02:29.500> ohms

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.740 
with two ohms
you<00:02:30.159> got<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.370> remember<00:02:30.459> your<00:02:30.730> parallel<00:02:31.510> and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
you got to remember your parallel and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.000 
you got to remember your parallel and
series<00:02:32.139> laws<00:02:32.379> for<00:02:32.939> impedance<00:02:33.939> when<00:02:34.599> you<00:02:35.010> wire

series laws for impedance when you wire

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.860 
series laws for impedance when you wire
them<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.430> parallel<00:02:36.760> what's<00:02:37.299> going<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.510> happen

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
them in parallel what's going to happen

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.319 
them in parallel what's going to happen
is<00:02:38.019> you're<00:02:38.260> going<00:02:38.439> to<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.310> impedance<00:02:39.760> so

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
is you're going to have the impedance so

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.910 
is you're going to have the impedance so
in<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:40.689> case<00:02:40.930> I've<00:02:41.139> wired<00:02:41.349> this<00:02:41.530> subwoofer

so you might be asking why did I go

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.740 
so you might be asking why did I go

well<00:03:10.319> what<00:03:11.319> would<00:03:11.439> happen<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.189> you<00:03:12.370> wanted

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
well what would happen is if you wanted

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.789 
well what would happen is if you wanted
to<00:03:12.730> drive<00:03:12.969> one<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.599> your<00:03:13.810> woofers<00:03:14.139> at<00:03:14.319> 2<00:03:14.590> ohms

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.860 
to drive one of your woofers at 2 ohms
you<00:03:15.219> would<00:03:15.340> need<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.609> wire<00:03:15.819> one<00:03:16.419> of<00:03:16.540> its<00:03:16.689> voice

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
you would need to wire one of its voice

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.390 
you would need to wire one of its voice
coils<00:03:17.379> in<00:03:17.560> parallel<00:03:17.979> you<00:03:18.099> got<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.280> remember

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.969 
coils in parallel you got to remember
that<00:03:18.549> each<00:03:19.060> subwoofer<00:03:19.780> has<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.349> voice<00:03:20.530> coils

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979 
that each subwoofer has to voice coils

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.309 
that each subwoofer has to voice coils
so<00:03:21.549> you're<00:03:21.729> going<00:03:21.849> to<00:03:21.909> have<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.329> 2<00:03:22.419> ohm<00:03:23.139> load

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
so you're going to have a 2 ohm load

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.830 
so you're going to have a 2 ohm load
over<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.859> 2<00:03:24.310> ohm<00:03:24.459> load<00:03:24.639> over<00:03:24.909> here<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.150> 2<00:03:25.659> ohm

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
over here a 2 ohm load over here a 2 ohm

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.750 
over here a 2 ohm load over here a 2 ohm
load<00:03:26.049> over<00:03:26.290> here<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.889> 2<00:03:26.949> ohm<00:03:27.310> load<00:03:27.489> over

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
load over here and a 2 ohm load over

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.520 
load over here and a 2 ohm load over
here<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.180> you're<00:03:28.419> wiring<00:03:28.689> all<00:03:29.049> that<00:03:29.379> in

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
here and you're wiring all that in

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.740 
here and you're wiring all that in
parallel<00:03:29.979> so<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.729> might<00:03:31.180> not<00:03:31.329> be<00:03:31.449> able<00:03:31.569> that

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
parallel so that might not be able that

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.449 
parallel so that might not be able that
your<00:03:32.260> amplifier<00:03:32.739> might<00:03:32.919> not<00:03:33.099> be<00:03:33.220> able<00:03:33.310> to

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
your amplifier might not be able to

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.759 
your amplifier might not be able to
drive<00:03:34.359> that<00:03:34.540> kind<00:03:34.689> of<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.900> load<00:03:35.049> so<00:03:35.530> what<00:03:35.680> I've

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
drive that kind of a load so what I've

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.159 
drive that kind of a load so what I've
done<00:03:35.889> is<00:03:36.069> I've<00:03:36.340> wired<00:03:36.729> it<00:03:36.909> down<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.479> 1<00:03:37.720> ohm<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
done is I've wired it down to 1 ohm and

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.199 
done is I've wired it down to 1 ohm and
wired<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.829> down<00:03:38.979> to<00:03:39.159> 1<00:03:39.370> ohm<00:03:39.519> so<00:03:39.849> at<00:03:39.939> the<00:03:40.030> back<00:03:40.180> of

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
wired it down to 1 ohm so at the back of

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.569 
wired it down to 1 ohm so at the back of
the<00:03:40.389> box<00:03:40.629> each<00:03:41.019> subwoofer<00:03:41.680> holds<00:03:41.949> a<00:03:42.069> 1<00:03:42.340> ohm

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
the box each subwoofer holds a 1 ohm

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.839 
the box each subwoofer holds a 1 ohm
load<00:03:43.079> now<00:03:44.079> what<00:03:44.259> I've<00:03:44.379> done<00:03:44.409> is<00:03:44.560> like<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.609> said

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
load now what I've done is like I said

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.149 
load now what I've done is like I said
my<00:03:45.970> amplifier<00:03:46.359> can<00:03:46.629> do<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.109> 1<00:03:47.379> ohm<00:03:47.530> load<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.979> have

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
my amplifier can do a 1 ohm load I have

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.159 
my amplifier can do a 1 ohm load I have
two<00:03:48.400> choices<00:03:48.579> I<00:03:48.939> can<00:03:49.090> wire<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:49.509> in<00:03:49.659> series<00:03:49.989> or

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
two choices I can wire this in series or

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.439 
two choices I can wire this in series or
I<00:03:50.319> can<00:03:50.620> wire<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.979> in<00:03:51.069> parallel<00:03:51.489> as<00:03:51.669> you<00:03:52.120> can<00:03:52.239> see

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
I can wire it in parallel as you can see

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.330 
I can wire it in parallel as you can see
I've<00:03:52.659> bridged<00:03:53.259> the<00:03:53.439> negative<00:03:54.129> in<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
I've bridged the negative in the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.159 
I've bridged the negative in the
positive<00:03:54.759> terminals<00:03:55.689> from<00:03:55.780> each<00:03:55.959> box

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
positive terminals from each box

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.920 
positive terminals from each box
therefore<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.829> have<00:03:57.159> wired<00:03:57.459> in<00:03:57.669> series<00:03:57.790> why<00:03:58.720> did

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
therefore I have wired in series why did

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.990 
therefore I have wired in series why did
I<00:03:58.989> wired<00:03:59.229> in<00:03:59.439> series<00:03:59.470> if<00:04:00.009> I<00:04:00.220> were<00:04:00.370> if<00:04:00.639> I<00:04:00.729> were<00:04:00.879> to

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
I wired in series if I were if I were to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.179 
I wired in series if I were if I were to
wired<00:04:01.180> in<00:04:01.419> parallel<00:04:01.449> I<00:04:02.169> would<00:04:02.530> have<00:04:02.739> this<00:04:02.949> 1

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
wired in parallel I would have this 1

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.729 
wired in parallel I would have this 1
ohm<00:04:03.340> impedance<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:03.939> make<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.180> 0.5<00:04:04.810> ohms

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
ohm impedance and make it 0.5 ohms

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.499 
ohm impedance and make it 0.5 ohms
a<00:04:06.659> 0.5<00:04:07.659> ohm<00:04:07.870> load<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.739> most<00:04:09.729> amplifiers<00:04:10.269> are

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
a 0.5 ohm load and most amplifiers are

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:14.039 
a 0.5 ohm load and most amplifiers are
not<00:04:10.720> able<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.290> drive<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.280> 0.5<00:04:13.060> ohm<00:04:13.269> load<00:04:13.449> stable

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
not able to drive a 0.5 ohm load stable

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.110 
not able to drive a 0.5 ohm load stable
so<00:04:14.680> what<00:04:14.829> I<00:04:14.859> did<00:04:14.949> was<00:04:15.159> instead<00:04:15.519> of<00:04:15.579> using<00:04:15.879> it

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
so what I did was instead of using it

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.589 
so what I did was instead of using it
100<00:04:16.479> using<00:04:17.349> it<00:04:17.440> at<00:04:17.560> 0.5<00:04:17.889> ohms<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.699> doubled<00:04:19.329> it<00:04:19.419> to

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
100 using it at 0.5 ohms I doubled it to

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.990 
100 using it at 0.5 ohms I doubled it to
2<00:04:19.870> ohms<00:04:20.079> how<00:04:20.259> did<00:04:20.409> I<00:04:20.470> double<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.820> go<00:04:21.820> back<00:04:21.969> to

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
2 ohms how did I double it go back to

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.399 
2 ohms how did I double it go back to
your<00:04:22.240> laws<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:22.599> might<00:04:22.719> need<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.930> brush<00:04:23.110> up<00:04:23.260> on

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
your laws you might need to brush up on

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.790 
your laws you might need to brush up on
your<00:04:23.560> parallel<00:04:23.889> and<00:04:24.130> series<00:04:24.430> circuits<00:04:24.789> and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
your parallel and series circuits and

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.790 
your parallel and series circuits and
kirchoff's<00:04:26.460> laws<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:27.569> wired<00:04:28.199> them<00:04:28.349> in<00:04:28.470> series

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
kirchoff's laws I wired them in series

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.480 
kirchoff's laws I wired them in series
all<00:04:29.129> right

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
all right

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.850 
all right
so<00:04:29.699> negative<00:04:30.569> goes<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.199> positive<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.830> then

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
so negative goes to a positive and then

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.619 
so negative goes to a positive and then
the<00:04:32.370> positive<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:32.849> negative<00:04:33.090> from<00:04:33.330> here<00:04:33.539> and

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
the positive the negative from here and

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:34.760 
the positive the negative from here and
the<00:04:33.690> positive<00:04:33.840> from<00:04:34.169> here<00:04:34.229> go<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
the positive from here go to the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.249 
the positive from here go to the
amplifier<00:04:35.190> so<00:04:35.940> again<00:04:36.360> what<00:04:36.870> I've<00:04:36.990> done<00:04:37.110> is

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
amplifier so again what I've done is

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.260 
amplifier so again what I've done is
I've<00:04:37.440> just<00:04:37.470> doubled<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.340> impedance<00:04:38.789> from<00:04:39.000> one

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
I've just doubled the impedance from one

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.820 
I've just doubled the impedance from one
ohm<00:04:39.419> it's<00:04:40.020> gone<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.379> 2<00:04:40.530> ohms

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
ohm it's gone to 2 ohms

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.300 
ohm it's gone to 2 ohms

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.999 
to the other all right you don't need a
match<00:04:55.740> wattage<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:57.440> RMS<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.710> all<00:04:58.830> those

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
match wattage and RMS and all those

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.950 
match wattage and RMS and all those
ratings<00:04:59.699> you<00:05:00.120> just<00:05:00.330> need<00:05:00.449> to<00:05:00.539> match<00:05:00.690> the

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
ratings you just need to match the

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.990 
ratings you just need to match the
impedance<00:05:01.409> so<00:05:01.919> in<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:02.159> case<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.520> have<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.639> 2<00:05:02.849> ohm

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
impedance so in this case I have a 2 ohm

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.820 
impedance so in this case I have a 2 ohm
dual<00:05:03.150> voice<00:05:03.330> coil<00:05:03.659> 2<00:05:03.990> ohm<00:05:04.139> do<00:05:04.289> is<00:05:04.349> do<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.650> voice

dual voice coil 2 ohm do is do a voice
coil<00:05:05.130> this<00:05:05.460> circuit<00:05:05.849> will<00:05:06.000> work<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.389> I

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
coil this circuit will work and I

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.170 
coil this circuit will work and I
already<00:05:07.740> have<00:05:07.860> them<00:05:08.009> hooked<00:05:08.220> up<00:05:08.370> ok<00:05:09.000> I'm<00:05:09.090> going

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
already have them hooked up ok I'm going

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.249 
already have them hooked up ok I'm going
to<00:05:09.240> explain<00:05:09.509> to<00:05:09.569> you<00:05:09.720> what<00:05:09.840> I've<00:05:09.930> done<00:05:10.080> on<00:05:10.139> that

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
to explain to you what I've done on that

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.610 
to explain to you what I've done on that
subwoofer<00:05:10.970> just<00:05:11.970> so<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:12.300> can<00:05:12.449> if<00:05:13.080> you

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
subwoofer just so that you can if you

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.930 
subwoofer just so that you can if you

be able to understand if I actually show
to<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.460> on<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.669> sub<00:05:17.940> again<00:05:18.690> what<00:05:18.840> we've<00:05:18.960> done

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
to you on the sub again what we've done

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.499 
to you on the sub again what we've done
is<00:05:19.289> we<00:05:19.560> start<00:05:19.830> off<00:05:19.949> with<00:05:20.099> 2<00:05:20.280> ohms<00:05:20.520> wire<00:05:21.240> them<00:05:21.419> in

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
is we start off with 2 ohms wire them in

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.360 
is we start off with 2 ohms wire them in
parallel<00:05:21.810> dropped<00:05:22.139> into<00:05:22.380> 1<00:05:22.530> ohm<00:05:22.680> wire<00:05:23.159> them<00:05:23.340> in

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370

series both the boxes in series and we

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.040 
series both the boxes in series and we
increase<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.889> back<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.190> 2<00:05:26.340> ohms<00:05:26.520> over<00:05:27.330> here

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
increase it back to 2 ohms over here

here<00:05:49.319> I<00:05:49.680> just<00:05:50.069> finished<00:05:50.340> putting<00:05:50.490> in<00:05:50.669> the

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
here I just finished putting in the

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:51.980 
here I just finished putting in the
screws<00:05:51.060> because<00:05:51.330> I<00:05:51.360> have<00:05:51.479> to<00:05:51.569> wire<00:05:51.750> them<00:05:51.960> in

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.110 
screws because I have to wire them in
parallel<00:05:52.590> and<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:53.310> have<00:05:53.430> to<00:05:53.520> remove<00:05:53.849> it<00:05:53.969> and

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
parallel and I have to remove it and

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.640 
parallel and I have to remove it and
have<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.330> put<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.509> bit<00:05:54.659> of<00:05:54.690> glue<00:05:55.020> on<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.349> screws

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
have to put a bit of glue on the screws

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.320 
have to put a bit of glue on the screws
because<00:05:55.949> the<00:05:56.069> screws<00:05:56.669> wouldn't<00:05:57.000> stick<00:05:57.210> in

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
because the screws wouldn't stick in

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.610 
because the screws wouldn't stick in
anymore<00:05:57.509> because<00:05:57.960> I've<00:05:58.169> removed<00:05:58.529> this

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.379 
goes to this voice coil the other one
follows<00:06:28.080> it<00:06:28.409> all<00:06:28.529> the<00:06:28.650> way<00:06:28.740> around<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.430> it

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
follows it all the way around and it

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.029 
follows it all the way around and it
connects<00:06:30.690> over<00:06:30.870> here<00:06:31.349> so<00:06:31.710> that's<00:06:31.889> how<00:06:32.009> I

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
connects over here so that's how I

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.100 
connects over here so that's how I
bridge<00:06:32.370> the<00:06:32.520> two<00:06:32.639> negative<00:06:32.969> terminals<00:06:33.360> now<00:06:33.870> if

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
bridge the two negative terminals now if

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.469 
bridge the two negative terminals now if
I<00:06:34.199> look<00:06:34.380> at<00:06:34.529> the<00:06:34.710> red<00:06:35.550> terminal<00:06:35.729> my<00:06:36.029> positive

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
I look at the red terminal my positive

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.480 
I look at the red terminal my positive
ones<00:06:37.320> coming<00:06:37.560> from<00:06:37.710> the<00:06:37.830> box<00:06:38.009> this<00:06:38.310> one's

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
ones coming from the box this one's

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
ones coming from the box this one's
going<00:06:38.639> from<00:06:38.759> the<00:06:38.849> box

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
going from the box

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.930 
going from the box
this<00:06:39.630> one<00:06:39.900> goes<00:06:40.800> to<00:06:40.830> that<00:06:41.040> red<00:06:41.190> terminal<00:06:41.430> so

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
this one goes to that red terminal so

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.790 
this one goes to that red terminal so
this<00:06:42.210> right<00:06:42.360> terminal<00:06:42.660> is<00:06:42.750> being<00:06:42.900> powered<00:06:43.470> and

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
this right terminal is being powered and

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.730 
this right terminal is being powered and
comes<00:06:44.730> all<00:06:44.910> the<00:06:45.000> way<00:06:45.090> over<00:06:45.300> here<00:06:45.350> and<00:06:46.350> it

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
comes all the way over here and it

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.500 
comes all the way over here and it
connects<00:06:47.040> in<00:06:47.190> here<00:06:47.430> so<00:06:47.910> that's<00:06:48.030> how<00:06:48.150> I<00:06:48.180> bridge

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
connects in here so that's how I bridge

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.270 
connects in here so that's how I bridge
the<00:06:49.220> the<00:06:50.220> two<00:06:50.760> voice<00:06:51.420> coils<00:06:51.840> on<00:06:51.960> this<00:06:52.280> dual

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
the the two voice coils on this dual

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.730 
the the two voice coils on this dual
voice<00:06:53.430> coil<00:06:53.700> subwoofer<00:06:54.240> all<00:06:54.990> right<00:06:55.110> so<00:06:55.350> I<00:06:55.380> hope

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
voice coil subwoofer all right so I hope

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.650 
voice coil subwoofer all right so I hope
