00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
the art style and the fact that it

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.609 
the art style and the fact that it
didn't<00:00:31.390> have<00:00:31.420> the<00:00:31.570> black<00:00:31.750> outline<00:00:32.020> like<00:00:32.439> the

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
didn't have the black outline like the

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.529 
didn't have the black outline like the
original<00:00:33.070> though<00:00:33.579> to<00:00:33.640> be<00:00:33.879> honest<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.360> art

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
original though to be honest the art

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.270 
original though to be honest the art
style<00:00:34.749> doesn't<00:00:35.079> bother<00:00:35.350> me<00:00:35.499> that<00:00:35.769> much<00:00:35.949> I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
style doesn't bother me that much I

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.680 
style doesn't bother me that much I
thought<00:00:36.640> it<00:00:36.760> was<00:00:36.879> still<00:00:37.089> fitting<00:00:37.449> for<00:00:37.570> the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
thought it was still fitting for the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.989 
thought it was still fitting for the
series<00:00:38.050> though<00:00:38.620> I<00:00:38.649> can<00:00:38.980> see<00:00:39.010> why<00:00:39.399> people<00:00:39.820> don't

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:39.999 
series though I can see why people don't

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.910 
series though I can see why people don't
like<00:00:40.149> it<00:00:40.480> because<00:00:40.749> things<00:00:41.079> tend<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.440> run<00:00:41.679> into

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
like it because things tend to run into

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.529 
like it because things tend to run into
each<00:00:41.949> other<00:00:42.249> a<00:00:42.309> lot<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:43.059> makes<00:00:43.269> things

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
each other a lot and it makes things

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.000 
each other a lot and it makes things
look<00:00:43.719> a<00:00:43.809> little<00:00:43.839> bit<00:00:44.170> messy<00:00:44.320> there's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
look a little bit messy there's

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.470 
look a little bit messy there's
something<00:00:45.399> else<00:00:45.550> in<00:00:45.699> the<00:00:45.789> presentation

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
something else in the presentation

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.959 
something else in the presentation
though<00:00:46.719> that<00:00:47.019> is<00:00:47.140> much<00:00:47.440> much<00:00:47.710> worse<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.429> that

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
though that is much much worse and that

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.149 
though that is much much worse and that
is<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.210> music<00:00:49.659> the<00:00:50.140> music<00:00:50.319> is<00:00:50.710> a<00:00:50.739> huge

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
is the music the music is a huge

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.309 
is the music the music is a huge
downgrade<00:00:51.760> every<00:00:52.390> level<00:00:52.629> has<00:00:52.929> the<00:00:53.079> same

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
downgrade every level has the same

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:54.989 
downgrade every level has the same
melody<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.010> just<00:00:54.190> has<00:00:54.339> different<00:00:54.699> themes

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
melody and it just has different themes

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.090 
melody and it just has different themes
to<00:00:55.149> that<00:00:55.359> melody<00:00:55.749> like<00:00:55.989> in<00:00:56.140> Rio<00:00:56.319> she<00:00:56.409> story<00:00:56.800> or

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
Super Mario World I wouldn't mind it

00:00:59.199 --> 00:00:59.579 
Super Mario World I wouldn't mind it
that<00:00:59.229> much

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
that much

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.799 
that much
if<00:00:59.859> the<00:01:00.100> instruments<00:01:00.850> weren't<00:01:01.149> grading<00:01:01.690> as

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
if the instruments weren't grading as

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.599 
if the instruments weren't grading as
hell<00:01:02.050> there<00:01:02.589> are<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.769> few<00:01:03.069> in<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.249> beginning

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
hell there are a few in the beginning

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.280 
hell there are a few in the beginning
that<00:01:03.760> aren't<00:01:03.969> that<00:01:04.030> bad<00:01:04.330> but<00:01:04.659> as<00:01:04.930> you<00:01:05.080> progress

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
that aren't that bad but as you progress

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.920 
that aren't that bad but as you progress
it<00:01:05.800> just<00:01:06.250> gets<00:01:06.490> kind<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.850> worse<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.479> I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
actually kind of dreaded finishing each

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.510 
actually kind of dreaded finishing each
level<00:01:10.390> because<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:11.530> theme<00:01:11.799> they<00:01:12.009> have<00:01:12.250> for

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
level because the theme they have for

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
design the same thing when going from

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.940 
design the same thing when going from

2<00:01:48.280> where<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.880> levels<00:01:49.210> were<00:01:49.329> so<00:01:49.630> different

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
2 where the levels were so different

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.109 
2 where the levels were so different
from<00:01:50.200> one<00:01:50.439> another<00:01:50.679> but<00:01:51.189> this<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.700> just<00:01:51.880> feels

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
from one another but this it just feels

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.249 
from one another but this it just feels
like<00:01:52.240> they're<00:01:52.390> trying<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.659> do<00:01:52.810> Yoshi's<00:01:53.140> Island

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
like they're trying to do Yoshi's Island

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.550 
like they're trying to do Yoshi's Island
again<00:01:53.710> but<00:01:54.490> worse<00:01:55.090> though<00:01:55.689> my<00:01:55.929> main<00:01:56.200> problem

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
again but worse though my main problem

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.469 
again but worse though my main problem
with<00:01:56.859> this<00:01:56.979> game<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.280> how<00:01:57.549> Yoshi<00:01:57.880> controls

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
with this game is how Yoshi controls

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.810 
with this game is how Yoshi controls
Yoshi<00:01:59.200> doesn't<00:01:59.590> feel<00:01:59.740> as<00:01:59.950> natural<00:02:00.219> or<00:02:00.670> as

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
Yoshi doesn't feel as natural or as

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.999 
Yoshi doesn't feel as natural or as
quick<00:02:01.119> as<00:02:01.270> he<00:02:01.390> was<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.689> original<00:02:02.259> in<00:02:02.409> fact

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
quick as he was in the original in fact

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.770 
quick as he was in the original in fact
when<00:02:03.219> you<00:02:03.340> throw<00:02:03.579> an<00:02:03.729> egg<00:02:03.909> if<00:02:04.179> you're<00:02:04.329> standing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
when you throw an egg if you're standing

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.690 
when you throw an egg if you're standing
still<00:02:05.109> he'll<00:02:05.409> take<00:02:05.619> half<00:02:05.829> a<00:02:05.859> second<00:02:06.369> he'll

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
still he'll take half a second he'll

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.190 
still he'll take half a second he'll
only<00:02:06.939> throw<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.390> immediately<00:02:07.929> if<00:02:08.080> you're

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
only throw it immediately if you're

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.749 
only throw it immediately if you're
running<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.710> was<00:02:08.890> trying<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.130> think<00:02:09.340> back<00:02:09.580> if

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
running I was trying to think back if

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.190 
running I was trying to think back if
that<00:02:09.910> was<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> same<00:02:10.360> way<00:02:10.509> Yoshi<00:02:10.750> controlled

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
that was the same way Yoshi controlled

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.690 
that was the same way Yoshi controlled
in<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.409> original<00:02:11.830> but<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.069> went<00:02:12.250> back<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.430> play

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
in the original but I went back to play

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.790 
in the original but I went back to play
it<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.000> no<00:02:13.269> he<00:02:13.659> throws<00:02:13.900> eggs<00:02:14.110> immediately<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
it and no he throws eggs immediately and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.110 
it and no he throws eggs immediately and
he<00:02:14.920> doesn't<00:02:15.069> take<00:02:15.280> half<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.489> second<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.000> take

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
he doesn't take half a second to take

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.410 
he doesn't take half a second to take
one

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
one

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.780 
one
now<00:02:16.480> despite<00:02:17.080> how<00:02:17.440> Yoshi<00:02:17.709> controls<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.550> game

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
now despite how Yoshi controls the game

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.140 
now despite how Yoshi controls the game
is<00:02:19.060> still<00:02:19.360> super<00:02:20.050> easy<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.590> had<00:02:20.950> about<00:02:21.130> 94<00:02:21.849> lives

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
is still super easy I had about 94 lives

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.089 
is still super easy I had about 94 lives
by<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.569> end<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.050> game<00:02:23.230> though<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.739> really

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
by the end of the game though I really

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.500 
by the end of the game though I really
shouldn't<00:02:24.370> complain<00:02:24.610> about<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.000> difficulty

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
shouldn't complain about the difficulty

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.360 
shouldn't complain about the difficulty
because<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:26.020> Nintendo<00:02:26.290> platformers<00:02:27.099> seem<00:02:27.280> to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
because all Nintendo platformers seem to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.699 
because all Nintendo platformers seem to
