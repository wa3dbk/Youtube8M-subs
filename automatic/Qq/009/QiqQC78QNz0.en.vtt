00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.780
 it may happen that you sink 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.390
 mature in the house is octorated and is therefore 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.800
 necessary to extract to bring to 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.810
 term this operation 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.910
 you will need a pump a 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 compressor and a parrot 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.220
 first of all disconnect the siphon of the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.050
 sink using the parrot can 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.180
 be that the latter is not in sight 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.520
 if for example the sink and column 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.640
 therefore you will have to remove this last one 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.950
 bringing the siphon to light is sometimes 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.230
 possible that the siphon is covered by 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.450
 a protection screwed the wall that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.280
 it will then be dropped using one 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.280
 wrench of the appropriate measure 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.040
 once the siphon is disconnected take 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.229
 the pump fills the compressor 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.690
 until pressure is reached 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.190
 desired to remove 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.190
 the filling in the pipe 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.420
 then insert the exhaust pipe of the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.700
 pump in the pipeline push it 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.820
 inside with strength and free the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.380
 pump pressure 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.399
 it may be that the discharge is not studied 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.229
 at first try 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.420
 therefore you will have to repeat the operation 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.619
 until the piping is free 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.659
 once this is done 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.240
 remove the pump tube is 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.509
 reconnected in siphon tightening it with 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.400
 the parrot if the sink ea 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.040
 column relocated the column to his 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.709
 place and if the siphon covered by a 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.269
 protection return to the wall 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.269
 using the wrench 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.360
 finally try the operation of the 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.360
 piping trying to download 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.800
