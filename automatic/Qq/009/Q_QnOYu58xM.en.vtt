00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hi this is Jen Smith and I'm going to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.789 
hi this is Jen Smith and I'm going to
teach<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.290> how<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.529> fly<00:00:04.830> save<00:00:05.069> ten<00:00:06.140> hey<00:00:07.140> Steph

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
teach you how to fly save ten hey Steph

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.629 
teach you how to fly save ten hey Steph
so<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.880> object<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.480> game<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:11.190> a

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
so the object of the game is to get a

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.560 
so the object of the game is to get a
phase<00:00:12.830> which<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.880> ten<00:00:15.210> different

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
phase which is one of ten different

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.000 
phase which is one of ten different
phases<00:00:15.809> such<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.190> run<00:00:17.520> or<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.000> set<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> run

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
phases such as a run or a set and a run

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.439 
phases such as a run or a set and a run
is<00:00:21.410> any<00:00:22.410> numbers<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.550> consecutive<00:00:24.060> order<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.230> 1

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
is any numbers in consecutive order so 1

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:37.250 
is any numbers in consecutive order so 1
2<00:00:32.600> 3<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.320> 1<00:00:34.530> 2<00:00:34.710> 3<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> run<00:00:36.030> because<00:00:36.989> it's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
2 3 so 1 2 3 is is a run because it's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.130 
2 3 so 1 2 3 is is a run because it's
consecutive<00:00:37.800> numbers<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.360> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> set

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
consecutive numbers or you can do a set

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.220 
consecutive numbers or you can do a set
and<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.920> set<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.430> any<00:00:41.910> numbers<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.050> are

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and the set is any numbers that are

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.810 
and the set is any numbers that are
exactly<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.770> same<00:00:43.800> such<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.789> 4<00:00:45.180> &amp;<00:00:45.829> 4<00:00:46.829> those<00:00:47.760> are

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
exactly the same such as 4 &amp; 4 those are

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.229 
exactly the same such as 4 &amp; 4 those are
obviously<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.510> set<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.460> wild<00:00:51.000> just

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
obviously a set and you have wild just

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.060 
obviously a set and you have wild just
like<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.530> had<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.920> get

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
like it you know so if you had to get

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.069 
like it you know so if you had to get
like<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> set<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.640> 3<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.000> could<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.480> set<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.840> 3

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
like a set of 3 you could do a set of 3

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.860 
like a set of 3 you could do a set of 3
your<00:00:55.500> wild<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> need<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> run<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
your wild or if you need to do a run of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.010 
your wild or if you need to do a run of
4<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> wild<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> object<00:01:00.870> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
4 you have a wild and so the object of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.299 
4 you have a wild and so the object of
the<00:01:01.109> game<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:03.019> fulfill<00:01:04.019> your<00:01:04.320> phase<00:01:04.769> my

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the game is to fulfill your phase my

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
the game is to fulfill your phase my
phase<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> run<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.600> 8<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> can

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
phase is a run of 8 and if you can

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
phase is a run of 8 and if you can
remember<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.220> run<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.119> consecutive

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
remember what a run of is consecutive

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.820 
remember what a run of is consecutive
numbers<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.960> 1<00:01:13.770> 2<00:01:13.979> 3<00:01:14.450> 4<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.930> we'll<00:01:16.680> even

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
numbers so it's 1 2 3 4 and we'll even

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.250 
numbers so it's 1 2 3 4 and we'll even
use<00:01:16.890> my<00:01:17.159> wild<00:01:17.520> 5<00:01:20.509> 7<00:01:21.509> 8<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:23.610> missing<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.000> 6

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
use my wild 5 7 8 and so I'm missing a 6

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.610 
use my wild 5 7 8 and so I'm missing a 6
but<00:01:27.250> anyway<00:01:28.090> else<00:01:28.270> if<00:01:28.480> I<00:01:28.900> had<00:01:29.080> oh<00:01:29.230> in<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.380> sec

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
but anyway else if I had oh in a sec

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.970 
but anyway else if I had oh in a sec
there<00:01:29.860> we<00:01:29.890> go<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.240> my<00:01:32.020> run<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.770> eight

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
there we go so that is my run of eight

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.800 
there we go so that is my run of eight
and<00:01:33.190> then<00:01:33.400> I<00:01:33.490> win<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> face<00:01:34.030> except<00:01:34.570> for<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.780> I

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
and then I win a face except for that I

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.960 
and then I win a face except for that I
still<00:01:35.050> have<00:01:35.200> two<00:01:35.380> cards<00:01:35.620> in<00:01:35.830> my<00:01:35.860> hand<00:01:35.980> I<00:01:36.430> didn't

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
still have two cards in my hand I didn't

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.780 
still have two cards in my hand I didn't
even<00:01:37.090> go<00:01:37.240> over<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.600> but<00:01:38.440> if<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.160> drop<00:01:39.400> these

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
even go over that but if you drop these

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.720 
even go over that but if you drop these
two<00:01:40.180> cards<00:01:40.480> as<00:01:40.810> well<00:01:40.990> let's<00:01:41.530> say<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:44.550> nine<00:01:45.550> and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
two cards as well let's say a nine and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.520 
two cards as well let's say a nine and
the<00:01:45.850> 10<00:01:46.090> then<00:01:46.510> you<00:01:46.540> get<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.870> go<00:01:46.900> out<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.380> you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
the 10 then you get to go out and you

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.140 
the 10 then you get to go out and you
want<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.770> face<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:48.430> have<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.700> do<00:01:48.820> that<00:01:48.940> ten

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
want to face and you have to do that ten

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.170 
want to face and you have to do that ten
times<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.900> then<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.560> win<00:01:50.590> Festus<00:01:51.280> instead<00:01:51.970> I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
times and then you win Festus instead I

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.790 
times and then you win Festus instead I
know<00:01:52.240> it's<00:01:52.810> insane

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
know it's insane

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.800 
know it's insane
we<00:01:54.100> don't<00:01:54.280> have<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.580> play<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.790> phase<00:01:55.060> 10<00:01:55.360> but

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
we don't have to play to phase 10 but

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.490 
we don't have to play to phase 10 but
that<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.350> how<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.560> play<00:01:56.890> phase<00:01:57.190> 10
