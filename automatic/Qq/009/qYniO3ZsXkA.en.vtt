00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
buy some be because and we didn't get

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.199 
buy some be because and we didn't get
the<00:03:37.380> rifle<00:03:38.010> looking<00:03:38.400> once<00:03:38.579> no<00:03:38.790> we<00:03:38.940> got<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
the rifle looking once no we got the

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.410

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
handguns with the co2 cartridge and I

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.559
