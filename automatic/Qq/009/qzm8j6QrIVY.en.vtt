00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello guys greetings to all good this 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.049
 video I did it because I wanted to talk a 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.690
 little of what the world would be under the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.519
 water of gta 5 since rockstar confirmed 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.740
 that there will be a world under water with 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.780
 submarines and diving equipment that is 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.090
 sure we will have some missions under the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.160
 water at the bottom of the sea ​​and that for sure 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.140
 we can walk around when we 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.689
 we want and he asks me the caves 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 submarines will be something like that because if it's 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.920
 as well as in these pictures it's going to be something 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.320
 surprisingly I would spend it in the water 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.170
 just imagine that these images are from 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760
 gta 5 the truth I would like it to be like this 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.550
 to be able to explore the aquatic world 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 explore these mysterious caves that to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.090
 you are afraid 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.520
 they imagine exploring in these areas without 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 know that we can find ourselves surrounded 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.690
 of fish and sharks that I hope there 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.030
 because that would be the sea without fish or 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.550
 sharks would be an empty sea like that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.379
 would be a city without pedestrians the weird of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 rotate has not shown images of the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.879
 underwater caves neither appeared in the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.430
 second secure trailer later will say 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.920
 something xd would not like to walk with the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.300
 lantern in this area at night or with 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.610
 storms but if you go 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.860
 we could very much die from the pressure of 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.720
 water that would be an excuse to know that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.150
 beyond there is nothing else like the sea 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.250
 infinite in this case it would not be infinite 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
 because they imagine going down and not seeing 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.050
 nothing be all dark like shit 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.640
 we left xd of good here we would be the 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.070
 three characters and the son of mechel 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 I would also like there to be boats 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.480
 at the bottom of the sea where we 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.620
 we could investigate the explore them 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.330
 even inside 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.670
 they imagine entering a ship in the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.040
 bottom of the sunken sea of ​​years ago where 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.660
 fish house would use the boat as me 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.550
 would like us to meet 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.680
 sharks where we will have to 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.810
 defend or be careful and also that 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.780
 they kill us that they eat us to the shit that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.910
 yes it would be good xd good friends this is 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.700
 what I meant to say is what they think 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.770
 of this it would not be great to explore these 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.290
 Underwater caves in search of treasures 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.720
