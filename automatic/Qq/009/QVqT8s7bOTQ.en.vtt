00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
make it through their own journey I

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.700 
make it through their own journey I
should<00:06:43.660> point<00:06:43.780> out<00:06:43.930> that<00:06:44.080> this<00:06:44.200> is<00:06:44.350> just<00:06:44.380> one

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
should point out that this is just one

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.090 
interpretation of the hero's journey
this<00:06:46.570> is<00:06:46.690> how<00:06:46.780> we<00:06:46.840> see<00:06:47.140> it<00:06:47.260> and<00:06:47.410> how<00:06:47.590> we<00:06:47.650> use<00:06:47.920> it

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
this is how we see it and how we use it

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.770 
this is how we see it and how we use it
but<00:06:48.370> even<00:06:48.640> with<00:06:48.790> a<00:06:48.820> two<00:06:49.000> parter<00:06:49.330> we<00:06:49.480> really

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
but even with a two parter we really

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.310 
but even with a two parter we really
aren't<00:06:49.930> able<00:06:50.050> to

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
aren't able to

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.110 
aren't able to
justise<00:06:50.740> I'd<00:06:51.100> recommend<00:06:51.550> the<00:06:51.670> hero<00:06:51.850> with<00:06:52.060> a

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
justise I'd recommend the hero with a

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.970 
justise I'd recommend the hero with a
thousand<00:06:52.480> faces<00:06:52.510> to<00:06:52.960> any<00:06:53.140> students<00:06:53.650> of<00:06:53.740> media

thousand faces to any students of media

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.440 
thousand faces to any students of media
the<00:06:54.370> originals<00:06:54.730> going<00:06:54.850> to<00:06:54.910> be<00:06:54.970> a<00:06:55.000> much<00:06:55.300> better

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
the originals going to be a much better

as a parable too many works today simply
cut<00:07:02.770> and<00:07:02.920> paste<00:07:03.160> the<00:07:03.400> literal<00:07:03.730> steps<00:07:04.000> but<00:07:04.360> the

it's<00:07:06.370> how<00:07:06.520> they<00:07:06.670> let<00:07:06.820> us<00:07:06.940> imbue<00:07:07.330> meaning<00:07:07.690> into

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
it's how they let us imbue meaning into

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.210 
it's how they let us imbue meaning into
our<00:07:07.990> work<00:07:08.230> that<00:07:08.470> gives<00:07:08.620> the<00:07:08.740> hero's<00:07:09.010> journey
