00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
I thought that maybe this is going to be

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.160 
I thought that maybe this is going to be
cancelled<00:02:57.590> also<00:02:57.980> but<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:59.420> wind<00:02:59.660> started<00:03:00.110> to

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
cancelled also but the wind started to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.640 
cancelled also but the wind started to
to<00:03:00.890> go<00:03:01.040> away<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:02.120> went<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.870> very<00:03:02.959> good<00:03:03.410> race

um<00:03:34.190> yeah<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:34.970> mean<00:03:35.320> yesterday<00:03:36.320> was<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.530> little

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
um yeah I mean yesterday was a little

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.410 
um yeah I mean yesterday was a little
bit<00:03:36.980> tougher<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.340> think<00:03:37.700> just<00:03:37.940> with<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.209> lack

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
bit tougher I think just with the lack

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.210 
bit tougher I think just with the lack
of<00:03:38.450> visibility<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.380> I<00:03:39.590> think<00:03:39.920> we<00:03:40.010> had<00:03:40.130> about

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
of visibility and I think we had about

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.340 
of visibility and I think we had about
the<00:03:40.430> same<00:03:40.459> tailwind<00:03:41.120> today<00:03:41.420> but<00:03:42.110> the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
the same tailwind today but the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.259 
the same tailwind today but the
visibility<00:03:42.860> was<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.010> little<00:03:43.250> bit<00:03:43.370> better<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.850> I

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
visibility was a little bit better and I

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.479 
visibility was a little bit better and I
think<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:45.019> that<00:03:45.049> that<00:03:45.440> was<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> big<00:03:45.890> key<00:03:46.459> for

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
think that that that was a big key for

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.270 
think that that that was a big key for
me<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:46.880> ended<00:03:47.269> up<00:03:47.330> crashing<00:03:47.810> yesterday<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:48.320> yeah
