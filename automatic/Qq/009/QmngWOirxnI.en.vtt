00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 hi all of us good on gamesactu 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.900
 welcome halo 3 2015 we stopped 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.250
 this time on a stand a little bit 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.430
 away from the living room which is not really 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.470
 inside the show floor we're on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.960
 our 505 games booths at which presents 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.029
 here then adrift to dream what is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.590
 it's the next game developed 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.189
 by adam horse you know him 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.679
 certainly 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.989
 it is the parent who the famous 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.910
 the famous scandal of xbox one is 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.760
 released at the time it was a 2013 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.989
 you know the famous deal with it if you 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.850
 have a bad connection at home and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.420
 bah listen change of country they change 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.309
 region 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.500
 so that was him who had a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.020
 little bit generated all the buzz buzz that has 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 then suffered for the xbox 720 at the time 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 it was still called code 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.050
 so mister d'amos left home 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.030
 microsoft he was thanked right after 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 and so at bruce and one day did not learn 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 who was commanding the development at 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.439
 start in 2014 and whose output is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.939
 scheduled for September 1, 2015 so 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.340
 see a period of development time 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.990
 fast enough fast and so the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.260
 particularity of the sad is of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.500
 to propose an experience with 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 virtual reality there we did not play 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.530
 Noah 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.840
 with looking swift so that was the dk 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.270
 2 so version 2 of the virtual headset 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.159
 oculus so it's not necessarily the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.079
 last prototype the last model so 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.039
 it's a lot less 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.119
 less convincing in terms of 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.469
 sensations what did you think 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.509
 to you their liquid comes here now 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.470
 project that made me breast and hello 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.479
 thomas screw maxime would be that at the level 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.789
 sensations they are less than 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.740
 the headphones sony I did not feel 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.960
 this feeling of dizziness then makes 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.039
 that we were in space with them that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.659
 this phenomenon of heaviness 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.979
 I really thought I had I was going 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.030
 to have helped the locker who had been in 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.690
 go out for the playroom 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.770
 it was not one if we had a 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.780
 joystick in the hands too so we 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.490
 could interact with the objects we 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.810
 could cross en route and the purpose of 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.530
 game precisely it was not to 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.030
 eat too much shock 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.680
 wayne simmonds your helmet was breaking 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.549
 then you ran out of oxygen and that's it 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.320
 obviously still currently 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.360
 exactly so in fact the story 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.880
 Adonis is a little bit a little bit 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.930
 that of gravity genre of the movie that sounds 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.930
 a lot I think they were inspired 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.880
 also of the film here it is someone who 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.370
 is all alone dive into 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.890
 the space of a station left to 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.450
 abandonment does not know what's going on 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.410
 we talked to someone from 505 games who 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.510
 made us it was a game not 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.730
 violent so it would rather be a rather 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.000
 a rather Zen atmosphere rather bull with 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.510
 and contemplative exactly contemplative 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.330
 you spoke on this side not dizziness me I 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.250
 the weirdly jacques him it's 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.360
 how to say I look very good to you 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.800
 virtual reality I know there are some 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.090
 people a lot of nausea but for the 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.310
 blow I was really nauseated I 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.330
 really feel like I'm not sure 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.090
 if it was the fact of being in space 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.170
 boost the locus headphones so the dk 2 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.620
 which was not really very good 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.750
 calibrated 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
 in any case I felt that name sounds 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.840
 nauseating and I wanted to vomit 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.830
 things that never really happen 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.530
 with virtual reality 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.330
 otherwise if not for the comfort of the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.650
 headphones I find that with elastics 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.390
 who makes this circle head is not it 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.400
 very comfortable yeah that pulls a little 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.830
 your impressions in a compression on 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.660
 the skull permanently so I hope 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.180
 that they will 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.410
 rectified shooting anyway this is the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.910
 version of bones so this version which is 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.110
 released some time ago 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.790
 hot it's been a year already 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.500
 there we are we are we are really with 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.000
 the latest versions we discovered 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.100
 others have to do with the last 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.170
 world of chips but it's true that good 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.170
 to for once was not one is not 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.210
 also bluffed calm in fact all with 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.640
 with the kitchen experience for example 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.490
 but in my opinion good here is the game out the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.440
 September 1st on pc ps 4 xbox one in 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.950
 digital version united word for our 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.629
 sleeves and 505 games 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.790
 we can play without the reality 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.250
 virtual but so I think that 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.800
 the ultimate experience is with the headphones 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.110
 it will be necessary to wait for the release of morpheus 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.090
 and xbox one that will be compatible with 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.420
 the oculus so all this will get in 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.190
 square 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.290
 will have to follow 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.970
 basin game adrift 1st september in 2015 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.760
 to this was our first impressions 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.450
 live here from los angeles very quickly 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.450
