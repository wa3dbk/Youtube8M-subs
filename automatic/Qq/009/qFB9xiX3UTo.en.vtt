00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.370 
didn't doing and they came back the
season<00:01:19.890> often<00:01:20.670> even<00:01:21.180> stronger<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
season often even stronger so I think it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.810 
season often even stronger so I think it
took<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> lot<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.890> positive<00:01:23.250> from<00:01:23.340> last<00:01:23.580> season

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
took a lot of positive from last season

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.780

I mean they're going to be they're gonna
be<00:02:16.010> massive<00:02:16.160> first<00:02:16.580> something<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.120> think<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
be massive first something I think the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.150 
be massive first something I think the
whole<00:02:18.200> club's<00:02:18.470> gotta<00:02:18.680> keep<00:02:18.800> their<00:02:18.950> feet<00:02:19.100> on

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
whole club's gotta keep their feet on

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.620 
whole club's gotta keep their feet on
the<00:02:19.310> ground<00:02:19.459> then<00:02:19.700> realized<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.209> lot<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.480> team

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
the ground then realized a lot of team

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.030 
the ground then realized a lot of team
can<00:02:20.810> probably<00:02:21.080> show<00:02:21.200> us<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.440> lot<00:02:21.560> more<00:02:21.680> respect

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
can probably show us a lot more respect

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.699 
can probably show us a lot more respect
than<00:02:22.250> they<00:02:22.400> did<00:02:22.459> last<00:02:22.610> year<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:24.560> might

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
than they did last year so on it might

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.470 
than they did last year so on it might
be<00:02:24.860> long-winded<00:02:25.130> games<00:02:25.700> then<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.209> might<00:02:26.300> be<00:02:26.450> a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
be long-winded games then it might be a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.360 
be long-winded games then it might be a
lot<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:26.660> Neil<00:02:26.870> knows<00:02:27.110> or<00:02:27.410> one<00:02:27.770> Neil's<00:02:28.040> because

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
lot of Neil knows or one Neil's because

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.160 
lot of Neil knows or one Neil's because
of<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.120> we're<00:02:29.240> going<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.450> have<00:02:29.750> gained<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.080> lot

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
of it we're going to have gained a lot

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.260 
of it we're going to have gained a lot
of<00:02:30.230> respect<00:02:30.560> from<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.740> lot<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.860> teams<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:31.370> um<00:02:31.610> I

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
of respect from a lot of teams so um I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.760 
of respect from a lot of teams so um I
think<00:02:32.360> they<00:02:32.660> cried<00:02:32.870> has<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.170> patient<00:02:33.560> and
