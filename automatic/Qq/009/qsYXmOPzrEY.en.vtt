00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.050 
to talk I mean do one more video about
you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.270> how<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> think<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> different

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
you know how I think the different

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.430 
you know how I think the different
strategies<00:01:39.060> may<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.960> into<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.229> fight

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
strategies may be going into this fight

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.930 
strategies may be going into this fight
whatever<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.640> think

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
whatever like that I think I think

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.090 
whatever like that I think I think
Marquez<00:01:42.330> has<00:01:42.479> added<00:01:42.840> some<00:01:42.869> power<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.560> think

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
Marquez has added some power I think

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.370 
Marquez has added some power I think
that<00:01:44.580> pack<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.210> maybe<00:01:45.360> feel<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.900> power<00:01:46.020> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that pack out maybe feel that power I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.870 
that pack out maybe feel that power I
think<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.920> could<00:01:47.100> even<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> difference

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
think that could even be the difference

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.640 
think that could even be the difference
in<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.150> fight<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:49.049> they<00:01:49.140> both<00:01:49.170> came<00:01:49.590> in

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
in this fight I think they both came in

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.410 
in this fight I think they both came in
there<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.159> incredible<00:01:50.729> shape<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.330> they

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
there in incredible shape I think they

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.600 
there in incredible shape I think they
both<00:01:51.600> came<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> know

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
both came in there that I think you know

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.950 
both came in there that I think you know
the<00:01:53.760> I<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:54.390> they're<00:01:54.510> both<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.900> be

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the I think they're both going to be

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810 
the I think they're both going to be
looking<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.439> some<00:01:55.560> knockout<00:01:55.890> situation<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
looking for some knockout situation and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.149 
looking for some knockout situation and
but<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.140> Marquez<00:01:58.619> that

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
but I think that you know Marquez that

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.950 
but I think that you know Marquez that
may<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.610> whole<00:01:59.880> different<00:01:59.939> situation<00:02:00.390> that

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
may be a whole different situation that

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.590 
may be a whole different situation that
plays<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.820> fight<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> mean<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.509> know

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
plays on on this fight I mean you know

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.170 
plays on on this fight I mean you know
what<00:02:03.840> happens<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.380> Marquez<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.030> get

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
what happens if Marquez is going to get

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.210 
what happens if Marquez is going to get
the<00:02:06.360> advantage<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:06.990> knockdown<00:02:07.409> situation

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the advantage on the knockdown situation

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.459 
the advantage on the knockdown situation
I<00:02:08.340> mean<00:02:08.519> it<00:02:09.029> is<00:02:09.269> could<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.719> could<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.139> you

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:10.469 
I mean it is could this could be you

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.019 
I mean it is could this could be you
know<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> situation<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.430> who<00:02:11.609> strikes<00:02:11.909> first

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:12.029 
know a situation of who strikes first

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.260 
know a situation of who strikes first
who<00:02:12.359> makes<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.659> mistake<00:02:12.749> for

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
who makes a mistake for

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.480 
who makes a mistake for
I mean<00:02:13.480> there's<00:02:13.630> history<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:15.280> could

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
I mean there's history so this could

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.040 
I mean there's history so this could
come<00:02:15.700> down<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.910> heart<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.510> could<00:02:16.690> come<00:02:16.840> down<00:02:16.900> a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
come down to heart it could come down a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.380 
come down to heart it could come down a
condition<00:02:17.620> digital<00:02:18.250> just<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.000> intense

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
condition digital just this is intense

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.960 
condition digital just this is intense
but<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.080> bottom<00:02:20.410> line<00:02:20.440> for<00:02:20.560> me<00:02:20.770> is<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.190> think<00:02:21.460> if

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
but the bottom line for me is I think if

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.500 
but the bottom line for me is I think if
my<00:02:22.180> postal<00:02:22.570> painting<00:02:22.840> yes<00:02:23.490> Marquez<00:02:24.490> now<00:02:24.880> has

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
my postal painting yes Marquez now has

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.110 
my postal painting yes Marquez now has
the<00:02:25.780> power<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.470> knock<00:02:27.040> down<00:02:27.070> or<00:02:27.640> knock<00:02:27.880> out

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the power to knock down or knock out

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.860 
the power to knock down or knock out
Manny<00:02:28.720> pack<00:02:28.990> out<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.740> fight<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.870> think

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
Manny pack out in this fight and I think

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.150 
Manny pack out in this fight and I think
it's<00:02:31.960> going<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.200> be<00:02:32.290> very<00:02:32.500> interesting<00:02:33.010> so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
it's going to be very interesting so

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.650 
it's going to be very interesting so
whereas<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.610> last<00:02:33.790> fight<00:02:34.090> we<00:02:34.300> didn't<00:02:34.540> see<00:02:34.630> any

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
whereas the last fight we didn't see any

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.900 
whereas the last fight we didn't see any
knockdowns<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.130> fight<00:02:36.430> we

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
knockdowns I think in this fight we

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.820 
knockdowns I think in this fight we
might<00:02:37.150> what<00:02:37.810> do<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.930> think<00:02:38.020> about<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.590> you

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830
