00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.000
 relatively yesterday would have come to mine 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.680
 first episode of titan vol live live is yes 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.630
 my very first round part as i have 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.980
 already played a bit in the beta 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.090
 but now this is my very first 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.410
 round of the full version of titan full 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.640
 So you already see level 1 was there too 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.430
 yet I have to get used to that 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.900
 You can not do that by yourself, yes 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.550
 I have not played it yet 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.500
 now since the beta has and this game 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.030
 has not yet and yes I have me 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.250
 my parties decided against videos too 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.839
 do 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.700
 this will hopefully work out as an activity 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.719
 I have a little euro in front of me 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.710
 decided at a few times before 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.270
 to make videos 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.940
 although some people are against you 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.840
 So you have to be the one 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.309
 Of course, do not look 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.800
 who does not want to look and it does me 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.129
 really sorry if you play ps3 and yours 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.390
 pc is not good enough and so on 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.100
 it's just that it's me 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.129
 play at least in the beta pretty much 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.710
 cool and that's why I'm so cancer 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.699
 That's why I'm so easy 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.800
 would like to bring a bit and 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.350
 some people of you thought so too 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.660
 really drive the videos so synonymous good 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.039
 So as I said please hold me now 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.920
 not because I hold now 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:19.849
 do okay you have to me yes me 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.259
 I just have to understand that I'm there 

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:22.970
 just want to make some videos 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.099
 and then I do not want to because some 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.869
 people just do not stop that yet 

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.190
 can play so full 2 will be yes 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.580
 also most likely for ps3 and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.610
 So what ps4 and what come out 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.289
 therefore please do not get me 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.720
 that and somehow sensibility is mine 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.119
 way too high, I have to say it does not matter 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 just talk so times I feel well 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.770
 not really the sco in that only 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.179
 just like somehow lately 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.039
 I have my first rounds too 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.020
 made big and my first would come 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.800
 even recorded live with me 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.759
 By any chance, I like to do it now 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.780
 repeat that for teenagers 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.580
 that's why i just take it somehow 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.110
 the first round on the big caal 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.970
 although I'm really in the beta 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.410
 pretty good in there so i know 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.209
 not if it was because of the people 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.280
 were just so bad but I had 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.349
 so marx and his kd are not right 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.319
 but I just had a look 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.750
 just ten rounds out of interest 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.450
 a range they pilot enemy 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.770
 pilots I played 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.220
 I have no Emming usually so 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.660
 I've just counted shit and 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.879
 my death I have somehow on one 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.410
 Five chain came so it plays 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.640
 actually quite easy but I know 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.300
 maybe it was only in the beta 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.410
 So at the beta and the map I have 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.349
 honestly, no idea 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.489
 how to play this where I wanted 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.890
 actually dropshot again somehow 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:49.170
 I forget that it is not possible 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:55.209
 there came 2 what do I have 4 to 3 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:59.829
 yes is still halfway where I do not 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.299
 times already call themselves that way 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.530
 I them so incidentally, I must 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.519
 was also definitely say 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.980
 How did I do it? 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.590
 that I can play it today 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.940
 because it is yes if you know it 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.380
 probably it's only really 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.329
 from tomorrow ops ff okay that was now but 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.360
 otherwise always on the text 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.739
 I often dropped off it is yes 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.290
 actually until tomorrow so now is 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.329
 only the usa full pages at all 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.709
 published yes I have so 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.959
 I made it over one 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:38.049
 American server then did 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.670
 Can I play this is always one 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.250
 a bit risky and does not always work 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.569
 but I just tried it 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.519
 because I just feel more like it today 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:50.950
 has to wait for taxi now 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:53.350
 That's why I just quoted God 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.700
 damn many 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.680
 That's why I just have time today 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.110
 played and it is also of the type of 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.480
 So that of a programmer 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.090
 Chief even announced 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.350
 that one is not banished for that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.510
 That's why I thought so then do it 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.220
 Just now was not easy 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.260
 but has worked well anyway 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.700
 I hope so far so has not 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.250
 have now laid a 67 epping so the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.300
 American server that's where I come from 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.870
 okay too is already through that 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.100
 age is he i hope that now everything 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.690
 the recording works that will me 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.280
 now very noticeable here there is belief 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.450
 I do not do private maps at least that 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.610
 not found so I could not 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.260
 test that's all with sound and stuff 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.310
 works all these bots I had 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.110
 Really , I do not like that 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.570
 I know that you recognize those things 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:50.280
 yes still here but that too is zuspieler 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.330
 what was that besides bacon more urgent 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.160
 In spite of that they would have my opinion 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.440
 after rauslassen but no idea 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.220
 maybe they are used to it someday 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.510
 you look at it 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.580
 no idea so I go in again 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:10.199
 my time with eleven I have to me 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:13.030
 remember so well 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.110
 or no aiming so it lies 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.800
 just remember that the sensitivity 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.189
 you'll have to do it yourself 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.550
 then no sense always has if 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:26.529
 you can counter it if you could 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.699
 as again countered then brought the 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.400
 bullet about the damage to you now 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:35.529
 I'll pack it here again if so 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:39.310
 now even level 2 lost what 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.749
 I do not have any over in 63 now 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.590
 gate 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:43.180
 I do not know maybe I will 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.169
 again as good as in the beta maybe 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.479
 are now just the opponents 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.650
 better but look for the first 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.300
 Round the others are already 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.930
 all played here it is actually 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.479
 very well and would have the matter 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.979
 Now do not count the cell anymore 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.279
 neither cold nor death what I am now 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:05.949
 make that is now a pilot so 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:07.120
 this is just another feature you like 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.819
 you have to go there or there 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.839
 This should now be completely distributed 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.400
 actually try with my 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:14.699
 flee spaceships but somehow 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.659
 I overslept this now 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.180
 I will not be able to do that anymore 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.500
 okay i was right far has long 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.819
 No more times has been playing since 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.639
 the beta and that's why I have it now 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.259
 somehow forget it is a dead one 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.009
 spectrum wörthersee team a spaceship 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.659
 fly away 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.009
 I lived alone and yet I die like 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:30.370
 said that is no longer one of the 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.259
 kill 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.180
 yes that's the first round 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.229
 second leading past as I said 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.399
 maybe bring a few more 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.990
 videos if I feel like and if 

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:39.159
 some people please look at them 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.300
 would not have that if you did not have one 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:45.009
 want to play case or so and yes 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.199
 please write me what you did 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.370
 so keep it full when you play 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.199
 if it can not play up 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.219
 Do not like it just bad 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.830
 because it can not play you can 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:54.939
 you anyway do not form opinion and 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.330
 so that 's the first round goes like 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.889
 said i would drive by 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.580
 very happy with revenue and above 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:02.580
 yes that was what you wanted
