argue about

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.119 
argue about
you<00:01:02.790> what's<00:01:03.090> causing<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:03.900> they<00:01:04.440> can't<00:01:04.739> say

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
you what's causing it but they can't say

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.290 
you what's causing it but they can't say
I<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.930> fact<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.220> people<00:01:08.460> that

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
I think the fact that the people that

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.880 
I think the fact that the people that
were<00:01:09.450> directly<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.710> we're

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
were directly and that we're

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
were directly and that we're
contributing<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.880> most<00:01:12.120> tune<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.750> too

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
contributing the most tune to it too

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.510 
contributing the most tune to it too
it's<00:01:13.770> happening<00:01:14.130> people<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.460> were

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it's happening people that were

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
it's happening people that were
encouraging<00:01:14.940> people<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> stake<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
encouraging people to have a stake and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
encouraging people to have a stake and
that's<00:01:16.410> continuing<00:01:17.010> to<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.280> things

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that's continuing to do the things

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.430 
that's continuing to do the things
exactly<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> same<00:01:18.540> way<00:01:18.690> we<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.110> I

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
exactly the same way we can do it I

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.710 
exactly the same way we can do it I
think<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.220> interesting<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:21.479> for

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
think it's really interesting that for

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.650 
think it's really interesting that for
years<00:01:22.050> they<00:01:22.979> denied<00:01:23.340> did<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> even<00:01:23.820> happen<00:01:24.150> now

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
years they denied did it even happen now

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.030 
years they denied did it even happen now
they've<00:01:24.840> brought<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> position<00:01:25.950> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
they've brought back to a position of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.440 
they've brought back to a position of
yeah<00:01:26.190> it's<00:01:26.550> happening<00:01:26.910> but<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.240> our

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
yeah it's happening but it's not our

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.480 
yeah it's happening but it's not our
fault<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.050> so<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.860> makes<00:01:29.040> me<00:01:29.160> suspicious

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
fault and so that makes me suspicious

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.609 
fault and so that makes me suspicious
when<00:01:29.910> they<00:01:30.030> say<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.570> our<00:01:30.990> fault<00:01:31.020> because

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
when they say it's not our fault because

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.480 
when they say it's not our fault because
they<00:01:31.890> they<00:01:32.190> they<00:01:32.750> protest<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.990> too<00:01:34.350> much<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
they they they protest it too much and I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.609 
they they they protest it too much and I
were<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.790> make<00:01:35.940> history<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:37.410> this<00:01:37.560> time

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
were to make history I think this time

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.460 
were to make history I think this time
out<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.580> think<00:01:38.910> that<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.360> been<00:01:39.570> sick

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.870 

keep<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.590> mind<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.040> live<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.430> pic<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.759> a
