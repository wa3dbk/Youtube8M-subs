00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:08.310
 this is the new garmin for gunner 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.410
 15 just got in and of course I want 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.910
 want to show him to you to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.160
 see what's in the box 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.610
 how good it is how beautiful it is how it is 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.220
 trick on your wrist 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.770
 and of course what he can do because 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.289
 this for one there 15 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.900
 You can do a lot more than the team and 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760
 also has the active that draw 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.830
 functions 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.920
 well the box culture can do well 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.920
 see 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.050
 connect is the app from garmin all these 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.060
 is therefore properly allocated 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.350
 tim those tractors 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.149
 at least use their future 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 users and the piss 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.750
 yes what they say themselves a bit one 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 all in one 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.040
 so on the one hand rash meter on the other 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.320
 an activity tracker 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.640
 such as the pololu and then 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.710
 you have it all in one device 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.499
 The disadvantage of this is that tutu is somewhat more expensive 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.409
 150 euros each time 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:09.840
 but you have everything in may 1 must 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.920
 just place lay watch but that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 they come up that you can save from you 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.990
 share data on a community 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.459
 a free community to the rear 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.700
 a GPS is in boxes 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:30.170
 so you measure distance speed average 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.849
 speed and heart rate and says here too 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.849
 separate purchase is required 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.259
 I dump operation so that reminds you 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.429
 when it's time to go 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.590
 to move 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.749
 counting steps and measuring calories 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.599
 so that he knows 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:49.969
 I measure all weather that you also see on this 

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:54.149
 page this side of the box 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.520
 so these are the screens this is just 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.130
 Walk for 28 minutes and 36 seconds 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.249
 for example 4.9 km 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.509
 well you have 9000 their measurement steps and 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:07.690
 you want to walk a total of 10,000 steps 7.2 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.390
 km 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.520
 have you already walked and that is something 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.830
 more than 2,000 calories 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.870
 and here you just go the instructions 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.090
 activity tracker 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.400
 function of which to spur to more 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.140
 to move and question if that goes 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.190
 help but it is a good one in itself 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.610
 try but that the me once 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.610
 unpack 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.080
 see what's in the box 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.110
 the box, of course, many books 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.930
 real experience and a finger thick booklets 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.640
 nice on the side because we have that 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.510
 I don't think it's necessary to miss it 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.510
 that's how it should be 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.310
 Well you immediately see that you are now one 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.330
 Have a heart rate monitor without a heart rate monitor 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.920
 band and that is always a bit of a shame 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.640
 yes through more on the self chosen piece 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.670
 and so in this case if you are there 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.840
 want to buy too loose 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.180
 yes it costs more money and maybe 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.730
 do you have a hand had meter 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.370
 and he , for example, we also met 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.130
 you still have this video link from 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.690
 activity tracker on your wrist 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.280
 so a loose heart rate monitor strap if you 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.410
 want to measure your heart rate can be adjusted 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.220
 to guess 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.220
 the charger 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.280
 because you have to charge over top okay 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.080
 you must also connect it to the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.040
 computer below indicates upload has no 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.620
 and wifi 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.620
 for example but he works with four 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.750
 pins and click on the watch 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:53.330
 first let's just get rid of it 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.330
 we look at how that looks 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.079
 well this is between 15 and i have to 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.860
 say the are two different ones 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.900
 models 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.030
 you have a number of colors anyway 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.079
 this is the great model of the fore and 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.670
 15 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.890
 and the other one is a small one said 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.930
 I more and 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.890
 watch for narrow polish silver front 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.260
 Women 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.000
 and I also in beautiful and it in beautiful 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.130
 friendly color and the circle 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.880
 a little men color name i have this one 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.880
 chosen 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.840
 well what about your wrist 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.840
 very nice smooth mitten 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.590
 just the rest we just normal how one 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.750
 watch should be 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.160
 we can pretty pretty he is not whole 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.760
 thick on your wrist but not whole 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.610
 he says thin and yes a little less than 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.849
 a finger thick and like this drove off 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.400
 get it 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.400
 and see how it works 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.680
 and you know what i do i just make 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.680
 just an extensive video of all 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.659
 functions of this order 15 and the link 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.659
 that would also put under the video
