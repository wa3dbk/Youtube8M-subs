so starting with the basic drawing

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.200

front somewhere so if you draw the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.620 
front somewhere so if you draw the
muzzle<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.830> your<00:01:23.009> gun<00:01:23.220> will<00:01:23.610> cross<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.299> hand

moving the slide away from your body now
at<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.110> point<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:41.070> shoot

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
at this point you could actually shoot

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.819 
at this point you could actually shoot
the<00:01:41.820> gun<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.270> needed<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.380> defensive

safely draw a gun but what I wanted to
do<00:03:47.130> here<00:03:47.400> was<00:03:47.430> at<00:03:47.730> least<00:03:47.910> give<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.299> an<00:03:48.450> idea

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
do here was at least give you an idea

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.710 
do here was at least give you an idea

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
that it does take practice it does take

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.780 
that it does take practice it does take
training<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.349> you<00:03:52.709> have<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.160> be<00:03:53.280> safe<00:03:53.519> while

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
training and you have to be safe while

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.090 
training and you have to be safe while
you<00:03:53.910> do<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.090> before<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.200> actually<00:03:55.410> do<00:03:55.859> this

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
you do it before you actually do this

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.640 
you do it before you actually do this
especially<00:03:56.549> with<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> loaded<00:03:57.389> gun<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.989> heartily

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
especially with a loaded gun I heartily

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.379 
especially with a loaded gun I heartily
recommend<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:59.340> get<00:03:59.549> training<00:03:59.819> from<00:03:59.940> someone

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
recommend you get training from someone

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.020 
recommend you get training from someone
who<00:04:00.510> knows<00:04:00.540> what<00:04:00.780> they're<00:04:01.079> doing<00:04:01.790> I'm<00:04:02.790> Roy

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
who knows what they're doing I'm Roy
