00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:18.840
 the aia was beauties and click ok was from 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.150
 back to the ocs series the builder 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400
 and today I came here to show you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.800
 this condition that I did here was this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.080
 many of them should already be 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 knowing that he is not only looking 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.949
 this is not the white house of the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.730
 united states that white house where 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.610
 live the barack obama is boring are not they 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.190
 connected and this house here is a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.110
 big but did not get too fat 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.129
 Minecraft Galera I'll explain why 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.120
 of this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.480
 How's the house is? It's how the house is. It's a 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.870
 little big but not so big like that 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.969
 she has many details but here in the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.680
 mini crash does not convince the details 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.469
 they have there y'know 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.500
 So it did not stay that way then equal 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.900
 but it was the same then kind has some 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.290
 details you really could not do 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.210
 It is some what god was these places here 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.520
 on top of the windows, which was the only 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.119
 thing that I can do in the whole house 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.979
 practically because the rest is everything 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.100
 Straight as you can see here has 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.979
 problems like the stairs upside down 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.540
 here it is not to be very correct here 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.030
 in the very kind episode 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.759
 so it got strange so I decided 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.610
 Put it right here to stay different. 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.159
 here is a base that has behind it the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.869
 blame for this strange line that is a people 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.890
 Roman, I do not know how that is. 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.810
 but it's a Roman engineer who uses 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.310
 those in those places that have them 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.960
 several giant ports but now 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.060
 by the house for you to see 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.759
 it has not had as how to type 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.860
 many details but some details of 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.950
 oprah noted that he had how to do 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.680
 so there is the entrance has the four 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.320
 nice pillars here ok you enter the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.069
 house and that's all there is nothing at all 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.349
 not the biella because this type to own 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.800
 internet does not provide you with both the images 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.860
 gives 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.500
 of the white house type you can look for 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.070
 clear enough that you will not have 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.320
 type photo on the side of the house is not going to have 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.290
 photo of the house or the ceiling of the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.480
 house will have photos of the front facade 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.040
 and the back facade 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.330
 so it was more or less left by 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.670
 do because the staff asked enough 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.430
 to make the house white so I did 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.740
 but here that they said they have no way 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.310
 to do the same kind of right the house 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.500
 white 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.650
 because of these facts right there is in the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.380
 maine craft that I tried to do in 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.980
 right ratio of minecraft to version 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.930
 of the world is right, and also because of 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.080
 There are not many photos here for you. 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.270
 I'll try to have a look at the house. 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.280
 as it is more or less but in force it was 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.300
 Okay, the first floor does not have much 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.490
 because on the second floor 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.910
 this time that floor does not have a thing 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.010
 It's nothing, but finally I have this 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.830
 part that is a bit different right? 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.840
 It's a team that has this track this other 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.820
 facade that is the second strip of the house 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.760
 which is the back and has a lot of 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.330
 gardens back here and you have to judge 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:35.370
 my round 'from here like this but now it's 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.980
 so there's not much to do 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.410
 in the house because it already says why 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.350
 because it was not minecraft to resort to 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.350
 details and also he suffered this thing 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.630
 not have many photos of the house but 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.550
 Anyway, I need to like execution, I'll go. 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.500
 leave your favorite cell phone to help 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.989
 in video resolution it proves its 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.620
 I will taste more cultural wants more 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.480
 Brazil 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.030
 so we 'll come up with a suggestion 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.739
 construction is done by leaving the 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.630
 comments that is making beauty 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.760
 so this was not a strong hug 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.760
 Everyone bye and bye
