00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 but before the start of this video clip 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.140
 I want to soar on but there is a channel Mike so 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.429
 how can she find his channel 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.889
 mechanism for minecraft poket edishn but 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.620
 also you can see hungry here 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.839
 games gryffer show explay a lot of different 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.699
 also he has you go in server 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.699
 subscribe link will be in description 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.200
 hello friends with you simple and 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.230
 today show a new messenger creams craft 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.180
 edishn works on version 0 to 40 10 5 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.400
 latest versions of ours in minecraft and and 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.580
 past versions will not add yet 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.650
 Redstone our game this mechanism 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.960
 I was already on the channel he was called 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.239
 the mechanical dining room was not like this 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.059
 mechanism but this time I have it a little 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.750
 simplified and want to show it to you 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.400
 look 2 we go inside so we go and I 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.629
 also reinstalled mechanisms forgot 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.440
 add here a sign okay 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.880
 if we see the elephant that's what this block 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.160
 the sand will go and we will need a little bit 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.440
 wait and from here on this old man to us 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.440
 throw away our meat we can come 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.180
 pick it up also with cows look 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.380
 we break the block we wait a little and here here 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.270
 this table she'll fall out skin and our meat 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.170
 Now this mechanism who liked 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.390
 put likes 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.149
 by the way here here i have a piggy 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.360
 let's try it too as we see 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.160
 taken away one by one happy from them and us 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.099
 will need to wait a lot longer then as 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.819
 any mob hostile has more life 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:47.720
 than good mom aki approach we take 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:50.630
 rotten flesh and gold is such a mechanism 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.050
 I also give chickens even try 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.610
 wait a little and we will be given feathers and 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.470
 the hens themselves here is such a mechanism I 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.520
 slightly simplified as you can see past 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.330
 series not series but in the past mechanism 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.599
 I have the oldest thing up to the hem top and 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.300
 it was necessary to put 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.920
 the glass inserts a little more 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.110
 Odessans made it a little easier let's 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 I will show you how to build this mechanism 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.040
 it is built in a very simple way 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.310
 look let's it now I'm all here 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.569
 disassemble and show an example e.g. 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.020
 pigs here here is where we will be 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.209
 break the block just we put it and lead 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.610
 the signal from the plates is raised by two 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.260
 up inside here even with me now 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.950
 but personally I have 3 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.989
 then we divert the signal to two plates in 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.930
 side so that our sand could kill ours 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.439
 animals so here here we are spawn 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.569
 our pigs with swimming is not very much 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.670
 because by and if very much 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.340
 spawning animals will be enough 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.620
 strongly lag and here it is to me not very 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.030
 like it but if you have a powerful tablet 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.709
 or phone it does not threaten you 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.940
 those. look we break the form there it falls 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.359
 our sand breaks and kills ours 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.519
 pigs 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.920
 here is such a mechanism to become it so much 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.540
 flew to someone like the mechanism 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.579
 put likes write comments 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.049
 and with you it was just signed by everyone 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.109
 thanks for watching subscribe to 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.639
 channel put likes write comments 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.359
 subscribe to the channel Mike all good luck and 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.359
