00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
back I've got it spawned right there I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.920 
back I've got it spawned right there I
was<00:02:46.680> trying<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:46.889> smash<00:02:47.219> the<00:02:47.459> tack<00:02:47.669> plus<00:02:48.659> one

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.490 
was trying to smash the tack plus one
for<00:02:49.139> me<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> guess<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:51.049> think<00:02:52.049> I'm<00:02:52.139> just<00:02:52.169> burst

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.289 
for me I guess I think I'm just burst
like<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.859> full<00:02:53.189> sniper<00:02:53.519> team<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:53.969> don't<00:02:54.150> think

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
like a full sniper team I don't think

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.539
