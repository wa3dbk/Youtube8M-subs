00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.010
 on the new call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.849

 me the thing here you have to have 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.529
 It's really cool but alone 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.099
 I really like the design 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.989
 cool 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.390
 I just want that today 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.190

 the skills i will be in the next 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050
 video what I intend to do 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.250
 is a third video to speak 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 There I will in this video then 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.710
 test how the part works exactly 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 if we have it in action speaks that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.090
 it really is that crucial 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.000
 How to play with the things you can 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 the opponents can be well located 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.350
 Assessment of the coming is one 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 real bass boost while you can me 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.880
 In the chat I can understand the people well 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.689
 Regulating chat I can vote 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.090
 regulate 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.830
 These are all things we test 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.189
 of course, if it canned 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.640
 Today is only the age of 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.799
 this device 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.939
 The set comes in packaging you can 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.520
 do not say it now 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.320
 the packaging I myself 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 I know a lot of packaging from 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 any things this 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.579
 These films are extremely shrink-wrapped 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.780
 hard to make out 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.549
 luckily I have little here now 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.720
 problems what me right now here 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.479
 I notice, for example, one 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.640
 separate thing for cable 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.369
 So that always means also on here 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.000
 We look at cables and accessories 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.860
 also on 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.950
 everywhere we have the call of duty black 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.320
 ops two euros on it makes a right 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.399
 cool design I like the black 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.450
 I marco reus are mine 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.079
 favorite colors from which he so correctly 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.430
 cool 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.920
 turtle beach her forest tango on the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.760
 page 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.690
 Now let's look at just once the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 Scenario drive it so that you are so 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.950
 a little something you can see here 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 for example there is still a stickers 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.760
 by turtle beach a guarantee is yes 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.200
 clear 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.380
 Of course, this should always be included 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.550
 his and then called quick start 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.220
 guide me a bit in the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.240
 camera 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.470
 I think you should not do much 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.000
 so if you do not do it wrong 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.940
 I know all the stuff 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.350
 just scroll through here you have 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.400
 for example, these presets so 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.360
 I 'll do it a bit on that 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.860
 headset 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.180
 the features of the headset 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.440
 sing very clearly that call of duty black 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.080
 ops 2 design 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.990
 There you have a call of duty imprint 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.900
 I 'll show you the headset bar then 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.000
 also the same is just as horny 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.030
 the black ops 2 audio preset and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.200
 the prompts in the specially 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.980
 These sentences developed by Treyarch 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.170
 were 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.590
 Here you see, for example, you have one 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.720
 so-called sharp goes exactly play 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.120
 Preferences and chat 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.620
 presets can all here 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.570
 make a program 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.489
 that is all possible that is you 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.850
 you can choose different presets, so to speak 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:27.300
 create the perfect for your hearing then 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.590
 I think it's cool because it's quite cool 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.540
 Honestly it's a bit complicated 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.400
 if you do not mess with these 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.239
 deals and you want by the best 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.980
 rausholen 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.630
 that's really personal too 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.560
 very good if you have a headset 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.680
 you have many options 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.360
 Of course, that's what testifies 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.950
 Professionalism and me it is 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.350
 gaming is especially important when I am 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.330
 I should buy my headset now 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.790
 already a few years and should keep 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.540
 also me and play a helper 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.340
 his 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.530
 that's what i keep coming in too 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.790
 videos of me preach headset is 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.709
 important, well then we'll continue 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.400
 Here you can see a nice CD again 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.890
 cover on everything in black ops 2 design 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.390
 there were just 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.130
 These things you just showed 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:16.150
 have it in the pac man again nice 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:19.430
 to the packaging 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.170
 here again the packaging now that 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:28.280
 Of course, that's what interested dollars 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:29.990
 tell fix on the side that is 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.460
 Of course wirelessly that's natural 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.770
 something very convenient for us 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.520
 here comes one sees again the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.460
 station 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.550
 if that also the headset comes 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.640
 now just show everything fix 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.640
 can 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.410
 the whole looks like this than now 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.290
 once the camera made cool 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.980
 impression with the so-called 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.750
 cities like it 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.770
 no here I would have to repeat 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.150
 comments write the stands said 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.070
 what I find very cool is to 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.350
 example this occurs up here and 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.139
 can see it very well , I think 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.240
 above are call of duty this is 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.150
 leather feels so much 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.430
 gallantly the pad with here 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.800
 There are also leather upholstery inside 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.690
 they are very very stable 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.630
 Here you can see the turtle beach logo 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.100
 imprinted the headset itself 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.500
 a stable impression there on the 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.650
 first look at the headset itself 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.260
 So the microphone is so pivotal 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.479
 completely swinging back and forth 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.520
 headset as I said very much 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.680
 I think it's stable 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.860
 meaning cheap impression is also if you 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.870
 It works so well here 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.700
 not somehow cheap somehow 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.680
 zombie shooter but that makes you 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.280
 Real cool impression we had over 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.169
 all the black ops 2 logo on it and here 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.440
 for example, on the side of the turtle 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.810
 beach logo you have different ones 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.260
 possibilities to turn on bluetooth eg 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.280
 here you can adjust the want so 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.550
 with the buttons 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.570
 I hope you can see it well 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.470
 otherwise you have different game 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:30.320
 presets on the microphone is on it 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:34.250
 of course, this socialist radio that 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.660
 means you have no cable of course 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.820
 it was very horny 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.190
 can walk around in the room and that 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.470
 is of course very cool too 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.150
 radio receiver with it is then 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.130
 shows now also has time, of course 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.490
 the classic black ops 2 logo on it 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.370
 and here is sometimes another 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.880
 light effect turtle beach something for me 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.090
 very very crucial are the 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.680
 connection options 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.770
 Here we have the optical up here 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.360
 Connection and boys the normal 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.860
 Everyone knows that red-white author knows 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.650
 we have that 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:11.479
 the volume display is so line in volume and 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:13.219
 otherwise have the power plug here 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.289
 we visually in optically out so that 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:17.120
 means you really can with yours 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:20.289
 system theoretically also go in and 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.289
 go out with the system also 

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:24.949
 that's what the whole thing always looks like 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.270
 ever looks very cool to me 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:28.849
 get offered here so 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.650
 I must honestly say that we have 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.379
 In any case, I was very good 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:36.650
 like this one must ever quite 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:38.870
 honestly say yes now feel 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.460
 just a little bit around it 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:44.860
 device and then we'll take a look 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.860
 later in detail the rest to bite
