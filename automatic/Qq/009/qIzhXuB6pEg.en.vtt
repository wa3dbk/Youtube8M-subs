newspaper will actually work

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.430 
newspaper will actually work
some<00:00:32.669> people<00:00:32.969> use<00:00:33.180> sand<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:35.390> sandy<00:00:36.390> soil<00:00:36.690> for

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
some people use sand or sandy soil for

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.740 
some people use sand or sandy soil for
their<00:00:37.649> substrate<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.850> works<00:00:39.149> fine<00:00:39.450> too

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
their substrate and that works fine too

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.100 
their substrate and that works fine too
but<00:00:40.379> if<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> just<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:40.920> sand<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:42.300> should<00:00:42.660> feed

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
but if you just use sand you should feed

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.860 
but if you just use sand you should feed
your<00:00:43.140> animal<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.670> different<00:00:45.030> enclosure<00:00:45.420> so

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
your animal in a different enclosure so

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.650 
your animal in a different enclosure so
that<00:00:46.079> they<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:46.950> swallow<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.640> lot<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.910> things

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.990 

and<00:00:54.660> after<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.280> substrate<00:00:56.670> down

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and after you have the substrate down

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
and after you have the substrate down
you<00:00:57.449> want<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:58.079> cage<00:00:58.440> furniture<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

heating<00:01:03.989> pad<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:05.220> goes<00:01:05.580> underneath<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
heating pad and that goes underneath the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.420 
heating pad and that goes underneath the
tank<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> animal<00:01:09.450> stays<00:01:09.720> warm<00:01:10.430> also

we're going to have a heat lamp and the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.300 
we're going to have a heat lamp and the
lamp<00:01:17.009> will<00:01:17.970> give<00:01:18.470> UV<00:01:19.470> light<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.159> either

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
lamp will give UV light you can either

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.190 
lamp will give UV light you can either
use<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.850> fluorescent<00:01:21.840> UV<00:01:22.770> light<00:01:22.979> or<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
use a fluorescent UV light or this is a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.310 
use a fluorescent UV light or this is a
an<00:01:25.710> incandescent<00:01:26.520> UV<00:01:27.509> light<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:28.049> also

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.479 
actually like to sit almost 90 degrees
from<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.659> ground<00:02:28.019> so<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> try<00:02:29.430> to

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
from the ground so you want to try to

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.930 
from the ground so you want to try to
get<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.940> branch<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.980> more<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.489> angle

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
get a branch that is more at this angle

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.339 
get a branch that is more at this angle
than<00:02:34.040> flat<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.879> they<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:36.629> bask<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.140> that

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
than flat and they like to bask on that

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.880 
than flat and they like to bask on that
you'll<00:02:37.980> also<00:02:38.190> need<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:39.230> thermometer<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.860> you

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
you'll also need a thermometer so you

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.670 
you'll also need a thermometer so you
can<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.700> basking<00:02:42.150> area<00:02:42.680> the

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
can see what the basking area the

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160 
can see what the basking area the
temperature<00:02:44.129> is<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:45.420> want<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.750> temperature

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
temperature is you want the temperature

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.400 
temperature is you want the temperature
to<00:02:46.379> be<00:02:46.530> about<00:02:46.950> 100<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.849> 105<00:02:48.450> degrees

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.960 

you'll<00:02:52.410> also<00:02:52.650> need<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.950> water<00:02:53.190> bowl<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.760> this

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
you'll also need a water bowl and this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.630 
you'll also need a water bowl and this
cage<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.660> little<00:02:55.019> bit<00:02:55.140> small<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:56.220> it's<00:02:56.400> for

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
cage is a little bit small but it's for

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.240 
cage is a little bit small but it's for
demonstration<00:02:57.390> purposes<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.799> can<00:02:59.069> see

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
demonstration purposes so you can see

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.949 
demonstration purposes so you can see
everything<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.730> need<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.510> water<00:03:00.720> bowl

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
everything you need and the water bowl

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.110 
everything you need and the water bowl
should<00:03:01.200> be<00:03:01.290> big<00:03:01.500> enough<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.640> bearded

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
should be big enough that the bearded

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.720 
should be big enough that the bearded
dragon<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.660> actually<00:03:04.109> get<00:03:04.349> in<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.950> lay<00:03:05.670> in

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
dragon can actually get in it and lay in

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.270 
dragon can actually get in it and lay in
it<00:03:07.760> then<00:03:08.760> you'll<00:03:08.940> also<00:03:09.120> want<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.510> food<00:03:09.750> dish<00:03:10.280> now

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
it then you'll also want a food dish now

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.479 
it then you'll also want a food dish now
they<00:03:11.489> eat<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.940> variety<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.599> foods<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.489> you'll

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
they eat a variety of foods so you'll

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.670 
they eat a variety of foods so you'll
have<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.390> food<00:03:15.599> dish<00:03:15.810> for<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.170> vegetables

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
have the food dish for the vegetables

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.699 
have the food dish for the vegetables
and<00:03:16.950> then<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.269> insects<00:03:19.169> will<00:03:19.349> just<00:03:19.560> run

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
and then the insects will just run

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.500 
and then the insects will just run
around<00:03:19.859> in<00:03:20.160> there<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.819> that's<00:03:21.060> how<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.239> set

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
around in there and that's how you set

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.240 
around in there and that's how you set
up<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> enclosure<00:03:22.200> next<00:03:22.859> we'll<00:03:23.010> talk<00:03:23.190> about

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
up the enclosure next we'll talk about

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.430 
up the enclosure next we'll talk about
how<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.030> choose<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.599> bearded<00:03:24.900> dragon<00:03:24.959> that's

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
how to choose the bearded dragon that's

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.199
