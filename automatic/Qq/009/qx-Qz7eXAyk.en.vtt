00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
we're using on a lego frame and well we

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.870 
we're using on a lego frame and well we
use<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.389> we<00:00:13.349> flip<00:00:14.309> into<00:00:14.460> robotic<00:00:15.030> mode

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
use it is we flip into robotic mode

use it is we flip into robotic mode
throttle<00:00:17.880> up<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.449> bit<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.710> up

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
throttle up just a little bit you see up

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.779 
throttle up just a little bit you see up
take<00:00:20.520> off<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.820> by<00:00:20.970> itself<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.350> goes

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
take off all by itself and there it goes

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.040 
take off all by itself and there it goes
if<00:00:23.789> Toronto<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.240> still<00:00:24.449> not<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:24.779> all<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
if Toronto is still not really all the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.000 
if Toronto is still not really all the
way<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.550> put<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.029> over<00:00:28.010> half

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
way up but I'm going to put it over half

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.850 
way up but I'm going to put it over half
way<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> they<00:00:32.430> don't<00:00:32.460> know<00:00:33.559> ok<00:00:34.559> something

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
way up so they don't know ok something

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.580 
way up so they don't know ok something
goes<00:00:35.010> wrong<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.930> should<00:00:37.200> fly<00:00:37.350> yourself

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
goes wrong and you should fly yourself

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.240 
goes wrong and you should fly yourself
back<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.340> mean<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.360> shouldn't<00:00:39.920> go<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
back I mean it shouldn't go right to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
back I mean it shouldn't go right to
Europe<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.850> met<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> there's<00:00:43.260> all

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
on his own I'm not controlling it at all

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.340 
on his own I'm not controlling it at all
actually<00:00:47.309> want<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> put<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.789> down<00:00:48.289> but<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
actually want to put this down but I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.299 
actually want to put this down but I
want<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> keep<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> near<00:00:49.950> me<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.160> case

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so far if you can see it but it's taken

so far if you can see it but it's taken
off<00:00:58.160> it's<00:00:59.160> moving<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:04.040> this<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
off it's moving and this is the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.649 
off it's moving and this is the
controller's<00:01:06.000> down<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.950> goes<00:01:08.659> tongue

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
controller's down there that goes tongue

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.440 
controller's down there that goes tongue
by<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> Sun<00:01:13.700> if<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
can't see it at all soon its first

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.649 
can't see it at all soon its first
Waypoint<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:22.140> turning<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:22.979> turn

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
Waypoint it's turning I can see the turn

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.940 
Waypoint it's turning I can see the turn
it's<00:01:24.659> doing<00:01:24.900> its<00:01:25.080> next<00:01:25.320> Waypoint<00:01:27.799> seem<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.860> be

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
it's doing its next Waypoint seem to be

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.170 
it's doing its next Waypoint seem to be
doing<00:01:29.040> pretty<00:01:29.189> well<00:01:29.369> its<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> GoPro<00:01:30.119> on

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

it<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.420> time<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> GoPro<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.340> kind

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
it this time so with the GoPro is kind

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.670 
it this time so with the GoPro is kind
of<00:01:32.549> worried<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.290> wouldn't<00:01:34.290> fly<00:01:34.439> that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of worried that it wouldn't fly that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
of worried that it wouldn't fly that
well<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.159> gets<00:01:35.220> near<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.610> end<00:01:35.790> I'm

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
well but when it gets near the end I'm

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
well but when it gets near the end I'm
going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> take<00:01:36.299> put<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.350> take

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
going to take put this down and take

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.370 
going to take put this down and take
back<00:01:38.040> over<00:01:38.509> because<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.600> does<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.780> land<00:01:40.140> well

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
back over because it does not land well

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.990 
back over because it does not land well
by<00:01:40.530> itself<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:41.009> now<00:01:41.180> I'm<00:01:42.180> working<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.540> that

by itself right now I'm working on that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
by itself right now I'm working on that
controllers<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.649> it's<00:01:46.649> kind<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
controllers down there it's kind of

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.230 
controllers down there it's kind of
second<00:01:47.250> waypoints<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> be<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
second waypoints going to be do a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.520 
second waypoints going to be do a
complete<00:01:48.590> basically<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.710> 180<00:01:51.079> then<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> in

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
complete basically at 180 then get it in

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.910 
complete basically at 180 then get it in
a<00:01:52.619> little<00:01:52.860> bit<00:01:52.979> oh<00:01:53.329> yeah<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.390> can

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
flying it controllers on the ground is

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.819 
flying it controllers on the ground is
actually<00:02:03.679> starting<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.490> head<00:02:04.610> back<00:02:05.649> back<00:02:06.649> to

the lego drone as we like to call it it

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.110 
the lego drone as we like to call it it
is<00:02:50.390> fully<00:02:51.280> Waypoint<00:02:52.280> it's<00:02:52.549> completely

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
is fully Waypoint it's completely

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.660 
is fully Waypoint it's completely
robotic<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.140> can<00:02:54.379> take<00:02:54.650> off<00:02:54.860> by<00:02:55.040> itself<00:02:55.190> as<00:02:55.519> it

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
robotic it can take off by itself as it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.210 
robotic it can take off by itself as it
did<00:02:55.849> it<00:02:56.720> can<00:02:56.930> fly<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.319> all<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.560> way<00:02:57.739> points<00:02:58.099> by

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
did it can fly to all the way points by

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.650 
did it can fly to all the way points by
itself<00:02:58.489> as<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.879> did<00:02:59.049> it<00:03:00.049> can<00:03:00.350> land<00:03:00.650> itself<00:03:01.069> but

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
itself as it did it can land itself but

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.150 
itself as it did it can land itself but
when<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:02.780> lands<00:03:03.019> right<00:03:03.290> now<00:03:03.440> doesn't<00:03:03.739> shut<00:03:04.040> off

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
when it lands right now doesn't shut off

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.729 
when it lands right now doesn't shut off
the<00:03:04.280> props<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.450> bounces<00:03:06.200> around<00:03:06.350> so<00:03:06.709> I

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
the props and it bounces around so I

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.129 
the props and it bounces around so I
really<00:03:07.010> don't<00:03:07.190> want<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.400> break<00:03:07.549> it<00:03:08.139> but

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
really don't want to break it but

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.750 
really don't want to break it but
hopefully<00:03:09.380> we'll<00:03:09.680> get<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:09.920> worked<00:03:10.639> out

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
hopefully we'll get that worked out

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.739 
hopefully we'll get that worked out
later<00:03:11.200> thanks<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.470> good<00:03:12.590> day
