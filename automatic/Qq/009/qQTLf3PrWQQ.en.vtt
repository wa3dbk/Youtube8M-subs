00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello I'm this from books to read and today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.759
 I bring you in this new scenario with 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.200
 this new bookshelf a book tac that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.760
 is the book is of guthrie that is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.380
 pretty entertaining is pretty 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.380
 interesting and I wanted to do it 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.180
 in case you do not know cutris is a network 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.500
 social made for readers where you can 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.820
 share the novels you are reading 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.070
 that you have come across to novels 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.600
 note them participate in open groups 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.310
 debates and finally endless 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.690
 possibilities of the world of books and 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.360
 you're asking where he has 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.800
 come out this shelf so big it's worth 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.420
 I leave you the there is the video where he taught the 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.130
 process of putting them and all that the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.420
 first question what is the last book 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.640
 that you have marked as a read the last 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.650
 book that I have read has been the blue world 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.660
 love your chaos of albert espinosa is one of 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.130
 my favorite Spanish authors and so 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.020
 I was so eager to read this 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.250
 novel law of nothing and that was the last 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.780
 novel that I read that you are reading 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.339
 I am currently reading 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.809
 will grace will grace on the last 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.280
 novel published in Spanish by john 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.900
 green and one of the few that have 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.850
 daring publishers through the 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.250
 Visa bill has a style quite 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.080
 Rare because the parts that written 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.270
 By weak they avoid not having a 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.830
 capitalized which was the last book that 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.180
 you marked on your to-do list for 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.190
 read the last book that marquez was 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.170
 steel see the first book of dreams 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.150
 that they gave it to us in the state 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.220
 green origins see and which then not 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.900
 I had on my list of upcoming readings 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.490
 I added it because I saw it in my fit 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.500
 cutris and I said well then I will not add 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.480
 so I remember that I have to 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.860
 what will be the next book you read 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.450
 without a doubt it is one of the most 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.790
 difficult things you can do to a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.320
 reader I honestly do not know what will be 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.270
 next I will read but I have several 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.250
 options among them figure in two candles 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.070
 for the devil of laura gallego fanger 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.140
 of rimbaud raÃºl may already finish with the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.180
 trilogy the selection and maybe read the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.610
 one of caracas not the ones of vale I am in 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.229
 an incredible mess here using the system 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.520
 cutris stars obviously there's no 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.869
 another way to point several books in 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.700
 cutris is so if you used it without 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.560
 However, one thing that everyone asks 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.630
 among them I'm worth because I'm very given 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.860
 to put half the stars is that I put 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.540
 in half stars you can put it 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.100
 whole notes and there are many times a 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.750
 Novel is not a 3 but neither does a 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.399
 4 and litis that put a 3 and a half 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.560
 so good you have signed up the challenge 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.970
 of reading 2015 this time I have been a 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.880
 little more realistic and has pointed me to 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.790
 this challenge with a total of 75 books of 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.650
 moment you have read 21 of those 75 and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.870
 butrich warns me that I have been four 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.300
 more books than you should read 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.800
 according to the natural rhythm that would mark but 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.570
 it so now I'm very 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.220
 satisfied with my challenge you have a list 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.290
 of wishes the truth is that in what it's 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.120
 almost all the novels that I put of ugt 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.220
 in plan to read are novels that do not 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.050
 I have therefore that is a list 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.060
 wishes but wish list as such 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.740
 as a bookshelf I also have a 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.750
 shelf that is called time for they are 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.580
 like 30 novels or so are the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.560
 novels that I need to read already in plan 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.390
 that I need you can read this novel or 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.830
 this saga start the are like my 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.390
 preference and it's like a list of 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.470
 wishes I really do not know but let's go 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.030
 for wish list the amazon 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.290
 contradicted the description that the book or 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.360
 books you have thought of buying 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.040
 soon sincerely my list of 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.570
 desires of amazon of which I have just 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.580
 talking to me helps me know what he bought 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.840
 before or that I buy after and not only 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.520
 for the preference that I'm going to 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.350
 awarding depending on the reviews that 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.630
 go see or the desire you have or 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.220
 not for a book especially so I 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.570
 more I buy in amazon is because 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.370
 novels that are on my list then 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.860
 they are an offer because I buy them 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.810
 ok then there is an option that you give 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.250
 and they put you products with discount you 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.900
 you give that option and you get the novels 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.760
 that are blank with doors in the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.320
 less for four euros less then I 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.970
 I see the offers and I say it's worth it 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.459
 purchases even if you do not have high priority 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.140
 but I say pussy you know it's an opportunity 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.120
 not spend so much money so then 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.400
 that you have a favorite quote which is 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.410
 Well sad enemy seen a date 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.150
 pretty pretty that is one of those that 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.769
 I liked the most about a book 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.780
 jordi serra i fabra of the novel maybe 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.420
 tomorrow the word 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.160
 the appointment is my doctor said that all 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.110
 we have weights in the soul and that those 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.819
 weights are difficult to remove so what 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.250
 that touches us is to make the soul stronger 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.080
 I do not know I like who your people are 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.580
 favorite authors I honestly do not 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.110
 I understand q3 and it puts me as authors 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.640
 favorites some authors that I take without 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.989
 books including three years , but good 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.060
 I tell you those who tell me butrich yes 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.770
 that is lie will be of stein what good 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.989
 if I could say good then I like it 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.610
 full showalter ok let's say that 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.550
 she has only read two books of her that she does not 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.480
 I know why you are no julie kagawa 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.010
 understands why he's there because he has not 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.480
 I read nothing of this woman but good to read 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.810
 to valente and from which you have read a 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.269
 book 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.530
 allison not the good of this law or four 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.239
 or five books from the extra saga of the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.919
 immortal and I really did not put notes 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.570
 super high then I do not know why it is 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.190
 in the favorites list and finally 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.540
 Rachel Vincent, how good is the truth? 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.130
 that I have read two of his books and they have 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.480
 I liked it a lot but it's not like 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.190
 so it's on this list but let's go 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.810
 I'm already saying that this list is missing 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.820
 cassandra clare and jk rowling i will 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.110
 I say is part of a group if it forms 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.820
 part of some group but honestly 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.290
 I do not pay much attention to them the only one 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.240
 I remember now it's yard radio that is a 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.010
 group of Spanish-speaking readers or 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.750
 something like that in which there are many themes 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.550
 but I do not really get into them very much 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.200
 because if I get in a group in a forum 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.700
 in the end it ends up abandoning and we see 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.320
 what ends up abandoning it but that 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.260
 I want a lot of time then it 's like 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.880
 get into something else even more to lose 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.140
 more time and that's it has been all 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.190
 I hope you liked this costume 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.900
 cutris is also true that he has 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.880
 seemed interesting because it 's sad is 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.100
 wonderful then then and nothing we 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.750
 we see in upcoming videos and these little things 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.010
 that I am going to bring you a lot of chalets 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.900
 the ones that I'm preparing with my boyfriend and 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.490
 that in the law is secular subscribe if 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.110
 that and that we see in future videos 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.100
 can you add me in cutris 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.100
 obviously they are worth
