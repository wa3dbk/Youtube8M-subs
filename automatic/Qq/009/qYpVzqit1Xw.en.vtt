00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
so um well we have here is the Rube

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.540 
so um well we have here is the Rube
Goldberg<00:00:05.549> cracking<00:00:06.299> egg<00:00:06.540> machine<00:00:07.080> thing<00:00:07.680> so

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
Goldberg cracking egg machine thing so

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.419 
Goldberg cracking egg machine thing so
right<00:00:09.269> here<00:00:09.450> we've<00:00:09.570> got<00:00:09.599> screw<00:00:10.130> got<00:00:11.130> screws

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
right here we've got screw got screws

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.810 
right here we've got screw got screws
everywhere<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.840> hold<00:00:13.139> up<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.380> machine<00:00:13.820> cuz

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
everywhere to hold up the machine cuz

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.430 
everywhere to hold up the machine cuz
they<00:00:14.969> are<00:00:15.000> really<00:00:15.360> useful<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:16.020> holding<00:00:16.350> up

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
they are really useful in holding up

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.710 
they are really useful in holding up
machines<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.100> machine<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.270> holding<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.630> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
machines a machine for holding up a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.500 
machines a machine for holding up a
machine<00:00:19.100> and<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.640> right<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.359> got<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
machine and then right here we got a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.259 
machine and then right here we got a
wheel<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.869> axle<00:00:21.990> car<00:00:22.529> thing<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.760> will<00:00:23.939> then

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
wheel and axle car thing that will then

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.900 
wheel and axle car thing that will then
roll<00:00:24.660> down<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.960> inclined<00:00:25.350> plane<00:00:25.730> hit<00:00:26.730> that

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
roll down this inclined plane hit that

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.359 
roll down this inclined plane hit that
lever<00:00:27.410> on<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.560> lever<00:00:28.800> boobs

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
lever on this lever boobs

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.089 
lever on this lever boobs
it<00:00:29.460> will<00:00:29.820> pull<00:00:30.240> back<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.570> wedge<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:31.769> up

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
it will pull back this wedge and then up

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.490 
it will pull back this wedge and then up
here<00:00:32.520> there's<00:00:32.700> marbles<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.780> marbles<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.290> go

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
here there's marbles the marbles will go

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.580 
here there's marbles the marbles will go
down<00:00:34.770> after<00:00:35.760> being<00:00:35.969> released<00:00:36.230> do<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.380> were

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
down after being released do this were

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.959 
down after being released do this were
amazed<00:00:37.920> more<00:00:38.399> inclined<00:00:38.700> planes<00:00:40.160> then<00:00:41.160> when<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
amazed more inclined planes then when it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
amazed more inclined planes then when it
comes<00:00:42.120> down<00:00:42.329> it'll<00:00:42.989> land<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.500> pulley

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
comes down it'll land in this pulley

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.330 
comes down it'll land in this pulley
system<00:00:44.219> which<00:00:44.700> oh<00:00:45.020> there's<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.250> there's<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
system which oh there's a there's a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.459 
system which oh there's a there's a
little<00:00:47.550> barrier<00:00:48.149> thing<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.690> holding

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
little barrier thing right here holding

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.290 
little barrier thing right here holding
marble<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.129> going<00:00:50.430> down<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.149> when

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
marble from going down and so then when

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.380 
marble from going down and so then when
that<00:00:54.449> barriers<00:00:55.079> pulled<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.039> will<00:00:56.370> let<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
that barriers pulled up it will let the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.049 
that barriers pulled up it will let the
marble<00:00:57.809> continue<00:00:58.289> rolling<00:00:58.949> down<00:00:59.129> they'll<00:00:59.910> go

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
marble continue rolling down they'll go

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.439 
marble continue rolling down they'll go
into<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> PVC<00:01:00.710> inclined<00:01:01.710> plane<00:01:01.920> also<00:01:02.449> then

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
into the PVC inclined plane also then

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.469 
into the PVC inclined plane also then
once<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.719> comes<00:01:03.870> down<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.379> there's<00:01:04.860> Dowell

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
once it comes down here there's Dowell

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.090 
once it comes down here there's Dowell
let's<00:01:06.479> tie<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.840> off<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> temperature

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
let's tie it off and all the temperature

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.500 
let's tie it off and all the temperature
or<00:01:08.189> spring<00:01:08.549> makes<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:08.970> easy<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
or spring makes it really easy for the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.810 
or spring makes it really easy for the
marble<00:01:09.750> knock<00:01:10.020> off<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:11.610> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
marble knock off the down so then that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.750 
marble knock off the down so then that
happens<00:01:12.560> not<00:01:13.560> me<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.830> set<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.130> off<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
happens not me to set that off it's a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
happens not me to set that off it's a
very<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> hair-trigger<00:01:16.170> kind<00:01:16.650> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
very it's like a hair-trigger kind of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.380 
very it's like a hair-trigger kind of
thing<00:01:21.020> this<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.560> our<00:01:23.549> test<00:01:23.729> subject<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.299> will

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
thing this is our test subject that will

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.900 
thing this is our test subject that will
probably<00:01:24.720> die

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.690 

sit<00:01:27.910> there<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.860> all<00:01:30.040> I<00:01:30.190> have<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.340> do<00:01:30.550> is

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
sit there and all I have to do is

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:45.480 
sit there and all I have to do is
release<00:01:30.940> this<00:01:31.150> car<00:01:39.690> ha<00:01:40.690> ha<00:01:41.940> we<00:01:42.940> got<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:45.310> our

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
release this car ha ha we got got our

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
release this car ha ha we got got our
egg<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.470> yeah<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.650> do<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:48.460> got<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.700> show<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:52.450> a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
egg so yeah I do you got the show get a

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:04.840 
egg so yeah I do you got the show get a
pan

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.909
