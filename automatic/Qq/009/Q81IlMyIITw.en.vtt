legato techniques were popularized in
the<00:00:13.980> 1980s<00:00:14.549> by<00:00:14.670> Eddie<00:00:15.120> Van<00:00:15.360> Halen<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.080> basic

the 1980s by Eddie Van Halen the basic

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.060 
the 1980s by Eddie Van Halen the basic
idea<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.730> you're<00:00:18.630> taking<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.109> note<00:00:19.320> off<00:00:19.650> of

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
idea is that you're taking a note off of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.179 
idea is that you're taking a note off of
the<00:00:20.189> first<00:00:20.550> note<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.000> play<00:00:21.710> your<00:00:22.710> pig<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.010> can

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the first note you play your pig you can

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.980 
the first note you play your pig you can
pick<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> note<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.420> hammer-on<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
pick a note and then hammer-on and

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.290 
pick a note and then hammer-on and
pull-off<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> whole<00:00:26.279> flurry<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.880> other

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
pull-off and get a whole flurry of other

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.250 
pull-off and get a whole flurry of other
notes<00:00:27.599> say<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> fifth<00:00:29.130> fret<00:00:29.990> my<00:00:30.990> a

notes say I'm at the fifth fret my a

notes say I'm at the fifth fret my a
natural<00:00:32.219> minor<00:00:32.460> scale<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:37.520> if<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.670> ascend

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
natural minor scale is this if I ascend

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.799 
natural minor scale is this if I ascend
I<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:43.879> alright<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.390> understand<00:00:45.719> I'm

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I get this alright to understand I'm

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.160 
I get this alright to understand I'm
just<00:00:45.989> ascending<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.829> descending<00:00:50.989> now<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.079> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
just ascending and descending now if I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.500 
just ascending and descending now if I
take<00:00:52.379> those<00:00:52.559> first<00:00:52.920> three<00:00:53.460> notes<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.030> instead

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
take those first three notes and instead

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.349 
take those first three notes and instead
of<00:00:54.570> picking<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.140> hammer-on<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.739> pull-off

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.180 

right<00:01:00.359> that's<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.079> beginning<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.829> legato

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
right that's the beginning of a legato

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:11.100 
right that's the beginning of a legato
pattern<00:01:05.600> now<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.810> continue<00:01:07.380> down<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> scale

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.340 

I<00:01:12.550> don't<00:01:13.550> need<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.820> pick<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.420> next<00:01:14.840> string

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
I don't need to pick the next string

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.730 
I don't need to pick the next string
because<00:01:15.920> my<00:01:16.880> hand<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.690> coming<00:01:17.870> and<00:01:18.110> hammering

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
because my hand is coming and hammering

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.920 
because my hand is coming and hammering
on<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.760> hammer<00:01:19.970> on<00:01:20.120> is<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.500> source<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.160> the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
on the hammer on is the source of the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.090 
on the hammer on is the source of the
sound<00:01:25.240> I<00:01:26.320> can<00:01:27.320> do<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.530> same<00:01:27.680> thing<00:01:27.890> on<00:01:28.010> the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
sound I can do the same thing on the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.950 
sound I can do the same thing on the
next<00:01:28.130> string

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.810 

all<00:01:33.560> right<00:01:35.740> so<00:01:36.740> when<00:01:36.860> it's<00:01:36.980> quick<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.550> sounds

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
all right so when it's quick it sounds

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.300 
all right so when it's quick it sounds
like

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.910 

any<00:01:43.310> note<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.700> land<00:01:44.149> on<00:01:44.360> I<00:01:44.719> can<00:01:45.170> take<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.590> note

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
any note I land on I can take that note

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.100 
any note I land on I can take that note
and<00:01:46.670> do<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.939> same<00:01:47.149> pattern<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.810> here<00:01:48.020> I'm

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
and do the same pattern so here I'm

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.050 
and do the same pattern so here I'm
going<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.259> do<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.500> same<00:01:48.710> pattern<00:01:48.950> with<00:01:49.880> this

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
going to do the same pattern with this

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:00.270 
going to do the same pattern with this
beat

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.260 

a<00:02:00.750> good<00:02:01.750> way<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.930> practice<00:02:02.200> these<00:02:02.650> is<00:02:03.270> not

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
a good way to practice these is not

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.880 
a good way to practice these is not
necessarily<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.869> start<00:02:05.140> out<00:02:05.350> going<00:02:05.680> across

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
necessarily to start out going across

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.100 
necessarily to start out going across
the<00:02:06.220> net<00:02:06.430> just<00:02:07.090> like<00:02:07.210> we<00:02:07.390> started<00:02:07.450> that<00:02:07.869> lick

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
the net just like we started that lick

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.820 
the net just like we started that lick
on<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:09.369> string<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:09.940> then<00:02:10.060> two<00:02:10.240> strings<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.830> try

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
on one string and then two strings I try

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:24.850 
on one string and then two strings I try
practicing<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.520> one<00:02:12.760> string

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:38.540 

if<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.790> do<00:02:25.850> two<00:02:26.180> strings

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.119 

ah<00:02:38.580> what<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.540> want<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.810> ascend<00:02:40.290> through<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
ah what if I want to ascend through the

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.940 
ah what if I want to ascend through the
scale<00:02:41.400> ascending<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> little<00:02:42.840> trickier<00:02:43.349> but

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
scale ascending is a little trickier but

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.979 
scale ascending is a little trickier but
I<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.250> do<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.550> by<00:02:44.760> sliding<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.910> picking<00:02:48.480> all

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
I can do it by sliding and picking all

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.570 
I can do it by sliding and picking all
right<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.290> when<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.530> ascend<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
right so when you ascend you have to

00:02:50.580 --> 00:03:11.630 
right so when you ascend you have to
pick<00:02:50.879> each<00:02:51.480> new<00:02:51.780> string

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.709 

all<00:03:12.640> right<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:12.909> this<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.060> pretty<00:03:13.359> advanced

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
all right so this is pretty advanced

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.990 
all right so this is pretty advanced
stuff<00:03:13.900> ah<00:03:14.409> you<00:03:14.829> might<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.189> want<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.459> start<00:03:15.790> out

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
stuff ah you might not want to start out

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.490 
stuff ah you might not want to start out
with<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:16.299> if<00:03:16.569> you're<00:03:16.810> new<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.200> guitar

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
with this if you're new to the guitar

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.580 
with this if you're new to the guitar
make<00:03:18.069> sure<00:03:18.219> you<00:03:18.400> go<00:03:18.579> slow<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.269> try<00:03:20.200> not<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:20.469> do

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
make sure you go slow and try not to do

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.140 
make sure you go slow and try not to do
everything<00:03:20.950> at<00:03:21.040> once<00:03:21.189> try<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.489> do<00:03:21.670> one<00:03:21.969> or<00:03:22.120> two

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
everything at once try to do one or two

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.039 
everything at once try to do one or two
strings<00:03:22.540> at<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.840> time<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.349> pace<00:03:24.219> yourself<00:03:24.250> and

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
strings at a time and pace yourself and

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.209 
strings at a time and pace yourself and
thank<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.139> for<00:03:26.230> checking<00:03:26.379> out<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:26.829> lesson
