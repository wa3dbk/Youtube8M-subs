00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 make a video by make up it became 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:10.679
 tradition in my opinion is already all krone hi 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.969
 guys and today I want to make a video about 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.610
 my drawings and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.250
 I drew these drawings in faraway childhood 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.539
 now i rarely draw on yet 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.550
 draw you ask 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.640
 what the fuck are you wearing 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 I will say that there will be such drawings very 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.920
 weird if you remember from the video about 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.000
 My personal diary 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.910
 I was sick of emo bots and I have many 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
 drawings so they have to with something 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 harmonize so I decided they would 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.969
 blend in with me because if 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.660
 they will not harmonize with 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:50.160
 something i don't know you just call 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.050
 madhouse and me there for brutal me earlier 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.739
 Loved the pictures of victoria 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.649
 frances 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.710
 and I'm with them some of my drawings 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.129
 drew and for example one of them 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.120
 know where we are there without being given everything 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.119
 except her boobs 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.820
 she somewhere in my fly at all 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.130
 separate body don't know why so 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.560
 Well, yes, the rest is basically 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.890
 I really like this bear 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.210
 the next picture I really like it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.140
 also victoria frances 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.439
 he has such gothic pictures so 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.070
 if you like this google victoria 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.680
 frances 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:34.570
 the next one just mimic the next one 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.690
 I donâ€™t even know how to describe it 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.320
 through the wind probably through tears 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.110
 lenovo 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.020
 Here such here I inscription written 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.810
 nobody dies in vain is very strange 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.900
 I also have a picture 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.910
 there was a cat I don't know but he has some eyes 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.790
 human reminds me more 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.790
 man overgrown with hair 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.090
 then you think it is from the category 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.649
 mv 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.569
 the next picture is very, very me 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.450
 I liked it so I decided to draw but 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.120
 I always had a problem with faces 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.810
 that is, I donâ€™t draw you equally 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.269
 eyes mouth nose is something strange but in 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.790
 Basically, I'm happy with this picture. 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.870
 except from that person u so here and pick up 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.730
 of you i like this dude too 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.340
 I like it and now I will show you 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.079
 second album and how i said mine 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.860
 drawings must be in harmony with something 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.140
 you mean with me poets such Sedna 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.239
 gothic 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.099
 one album is worth but you understand yes I am 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.530
 I'll show you one shameful drawing 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.099
 as I tell people not very 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.690
 It turns out and I remember that we are in school 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.340
 sketched from life it was my village 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.269
 classmate on the table I tried everything 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.000
 draw and that's what came out of it 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.920
 it's just the bottom if you take this 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.019
 cartoon he is well done not all is lost 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.750
 I like very much I painted like a soul 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.760
 then both things will enrich with colored pens 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.470
 drawing here is some more disulfide 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.519
 schools that will not show you which 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.040
 some dumb 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.829
 because i can't draw when i 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.959
 something indicates valid if they don't 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.299
 like that i never draw life 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.180
 simple and clean up the picture like that 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.400
 mom likes dude here soars type 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.980
 or don't know the beans, but I like the way 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.299
 I drew his legs such they 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.210
 develop in parts 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.570
 going to mr year section 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.490
 further chick vampire well 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.550
 merge between me problems but all 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.460
 the rest seems to be nothing so psyche is not 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.800
 contradicts the following again theka lumber 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.870
 in this drawing I really like how 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.100
 her usual face was like I was painting 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:01.350
 just art but a dress and i drew 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.660
 Awesome straight dress like that 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.860
 the demons are such a dude 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.710
 Here is such a Babins I like you understand 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.710
 it's all gothic but if 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.340
 consider it because many did not live in that 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.640
 an era 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.960
 even smaller and all the guys on it if 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.240
