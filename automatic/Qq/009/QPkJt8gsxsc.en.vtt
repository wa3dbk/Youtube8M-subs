Oh<00:01:04.949> Walt<00:01:05.640> bond<00:01:05.970> does<00:01:06.299> dry<00:01:06.689> crystal<00:01:07.320> clear<00:01:08.689> so

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.060 

you<00:01:14.659> have<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.869> kind<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.140> build<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.560> up<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:15.890> you

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
you have to kind of build it up and you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.609 
you have to kind of build it up and you
know<00:01:16.189> how<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.399> get<00:01:16.640> like<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.450> soap<00:01:17.750> bubble<00:01:18.079> film

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
know how you get like a soap bubble film

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.179 
know how you get like a soap bubble film
on<00:01:18.859> you<00:01:19.579> know<00:01:19.700> where<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.509> goes<00:01:20.780> right<00:01:20.990> across

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
on you know where it goes right across

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.649 
on you know where it goes right across
that's<00:01:22.189> why<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:22.429> have<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.759> try<00:01:22.969> achieving

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
that's why you have to try achieving

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.639 
that's why you have to try achieving
with<00:01:24.229> this<00:01:24.469> kind<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.859> stuff<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:25.479> a<00:01:26.479> paint<00:01:27.469> brush

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
with this kind of stuff so a paint brush

with this kind of stuff so a paint brush
works<00:01:27.979> really<00:01:28.250> good<00:01:28.460> or<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:29.299> know<00:01:29.390> some<00:01:29.719> sort

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
works really good or you know some sort

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.999 
works really good or you know some sort
of<00:01:30.020> flat<00:01:30.469> flat<00:01:30.860> out<00:01:31.069> tool<00:01:31.840> get<00:01:32.840> as<00:01:32.959> much<00:01:33.350> around

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
of flat flat out tool get as much around

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.209 
of flat flat out tool get as much around
the<00:01:34.250> edge<00:01:34.490> as<00:01:34.880> possible<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:36.619> can<00:01:36.770> see<00:01:36.950> there

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
the edge as possible you can see there

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.969 
the edge as possible you can see there
in<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.520> middle<00:01:37.700> okay<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.679> then<00:01:39.679> basically

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
in the middle okay and then basically

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.249 
in the middle okay and then basically
wanted<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.789> sort<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.090> wipe<00:01:41.299> it<00:01:41.479> over<00:01:41.780> top<00:01:42.020> at

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
wanted to sort of wipe it over top at

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.089 
wanted to sort of wipe it over top at
the<00:01:42.289> whole<00:01:42.560> thing<00:01:42.799> to<00:01:42.950> get<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.130> bubble<00:01:43.369> over<00:01:43.640> top

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
the whole thing to get a bubble over top

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:49.240 
the whole thing to get a bubble over top
okay<00:01:47.020> now<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.079> can<00:01:48.289> see<00:01:48.439> it's<00:01:48.590> right<00:01:48.770> over<00:01:48.829> top
