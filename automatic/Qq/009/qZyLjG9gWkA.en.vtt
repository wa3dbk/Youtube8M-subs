00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello everyone because 1054 for a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.150
 new video news video games for 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.740
 this Saturday April 4, 2015 resulting in a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.349
 little bit on the internet I came across 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.480
 a pretty original article about a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.670
 new accessory or rather gadget 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.170
 offered by hi park inn 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.210
 you know this company that has 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 marketed not long since the art 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 and the fifth version of which I 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.029
 had made a presentation there is no 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.359
 so long as this is a very good boat 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.939
 anyway 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 well they finally decided they have 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.750
 proposed their projects in their 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.660
 social networks which is called the smart 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.300
 boy who is actually actually 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.879
 turn your iphone into a gameboy where 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.469
 we would spend it will be a mix of a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.610
 good big game boy 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.739
 well plump with one last 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.170
 generation generation mobile phone 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.030
 and you have the mix of both actually 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.730
 as you can see in the picture 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.879
 it would actually be the basis of the game boy 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.340
 and you insert your your phone 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.680
 just in with plus you have a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.890
 a cartridge port for gameboy games 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.320
 it's a pretty original idea 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.330
 you had to think about it because 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.130
 these you can play at any 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 what gameboy game feels the need 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.479
 to have the big bawdy that takes 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.259
 plenty of room in your bag or 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.909
 in your pocket 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.700
 we can also observe that this gadget 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.979
 has a good point this is the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.560
 video quality since the problem 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.590
 with an old game boy and well at 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.420
 screen level it's it's small and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.729
 it stings a little to the eyes have been the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.220
 color palette is really tiny 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.530
 good even if the game boy color offers 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.020
 offers a wider range of 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.880
 colors at least with a screen of 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.350
 allah generation phone level 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 of the screen it may not sting 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.720
 eyes and it can be top to play at 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.399
 game boy 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.020
 nothing is known about the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.549
 marketing price we even know 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.439
 not if it's going to be really marketed 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.600
 since it's really at the project stage 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.670
 for now personally I 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.079
 think well we'll see if I have if I 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.750
 reason if I was not nice 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.700
 bet I do not care I think it will be sold 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.020
 around 50 euros that fart goes 30 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.819
 euros it can be the hundred of one 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.940
 does not know anything about it though the hundred 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.430
 of euros 117 has not seen so especially that 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.180
 stop 35 is proposed around 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.940
 150 euros 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.430
 finally after that it's really a small 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.130
 detail but when we when we look 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.860
 more precisely this project the smart boys 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.190
 and well there are a lot of faults that 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.260
 risk being a bit boring for 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.500
 start the smart boy will only be 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.560
 compatible with the iphone 6 in terms of 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.450
 cell phones good father who did 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.070
 have not we said we were talking about 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.710
 like what they're trying to find 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.410
 solutions to make sure that this 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.360
 smart boy be compatible with others 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.340
 cell phones then the second 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.870
 problem regarding the management of the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.580
 drums 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.650
 from what I read the smart buzz is going 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.150
 directly pop and the battery of your 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.070
 phone to play games 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.220
 game boy it's not great because already 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.530
 that iphone are quite lacking in 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.420
 battery management with the smart boys and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.370
 down it will not be joy it punishes 10 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.470
 according to the websites at 5 o'clock 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.150
 game it's not much unlike is 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.220
 a good old game boy see game boy 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.870
 color where we can do I think 8.9 to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.670
 rick two batteries if and when even top mea 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.020
 culpa if I was wrong on the duration 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.610
 of batteries life if we when using 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.830
 a gameboy color the third problem 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.660
 it concerns the compatibility of the games 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.550
 on the smart bailly hall he will join 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.310
 only gameboy and gameboy games 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.250
 color for an iphone and might have 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.410
 have proposed a Game Boy Advance games 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.970
 to start and see ds games like 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.820
 for example his features 35 years they have 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.950
 proposed downright megadrive nintendo 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.050
 super nintendo gameboy advance game boy 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.330
 color game simple boy I think it 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.500
 does a little skinny for for a 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.130
 smartphone only gameboy games 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.200
 gameboy color 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.540
 there is another concern also it is that 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.040
 would look like nintendo regarding this little 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.890
 gadget that looks strongly 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.989
 so gameboy 11.7 nintendo remake are 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.700
 pretty boring at the level of rights 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.040
 of authorship when they go to see the project 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.959
 marketed it may be enough 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.910
 virulent towards the hyper society that did 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.200
 between very recently the first level 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.700
 mario 64 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.890
 hadji that was quickly removed by nintendo 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.620
 while it was volunteered by 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.400
 the student on purpose to draw the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.580
 less profit 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.470
 we must also look at the fact that 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.590
 Nintendo does not stop hunting 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.859
 to youtuber using videos 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.169
 two 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.090
 their own game in canteen gameplay 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.319
 when there is history of cash by 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.900
 relation to copyright nintendo 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.479
 they are pretty stingy and vultures of this 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.159
 side there so I think they will not 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.080
 let it go if this project is 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.000
 commercialized it flies I think they 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.430
 will want to touch their slice of the cake 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.770
 and finally we finish this video with the 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.110
 last problem you do not find yourself 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.849
 that this smart boys might be a 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.169
 cheap and it is so to play 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.139
 to old games gameboy gameboy color 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.379
 the price of an iphone if you add it 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.419
 the price of the smart boy with the cartridges 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.159
 of game boy game boy color meaning without 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.430
 really passed by emulation 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.900
 sauce there is not the purpose of the video and 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.819
 what I mean is that at this 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.490
 there up to invest this bad food 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.800
 other iphone and take a place 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.370
 monster in your bag so much to 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.409
 invest in these a little game 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.789
 boy advance sp with his little loader 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.159
 you have good for 8 9 hours 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.479
 of autonomy and you add that you 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.250
 can find it for pretty much a 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.599
 thirty euros loose on the internet 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.460
 or less if you're lucky 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.110
 in the attic empties and you can 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.789
 play games gameboy color gameboy 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.849
 as well as game boy advance 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.610
 so in the end this smart boys 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.979
 for now the project the project 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.169
 announced by bass hyperkin and a leash 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.349
 and I know I think it's really 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.349
 can
