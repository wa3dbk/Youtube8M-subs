00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we made okay right here see if we'll

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.740 
we made okay right here see if we'll
actually<00:01:40.740> focus<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:44.119> three<00:01:45.119> dollars<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
actually focus on that three dollars and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.139 
actually focus on that three dollars and
twenty-eight<00:01:46.109> cents<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> huge

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
twenty-eight cents so that is a huge

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.469 
twenty-eight cents so that is a huge
difference<00:01:48.689> from<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> 93<00:01:50.430> sense<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
difference from the 93 sense and so I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.230 
difference from the 93 sense and so I
was<00:01:51.719> at<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.899> register<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.310> hey
