00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.179
 hi everyone i'm over 6 vÃ¡squez 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.179
 let us begin 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.240
 and there has always been a tendency to 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.860
 assess players in relation to 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.290
 number of rings that have managed to 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.779
 throughout his career but this we are going to 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.029
 To be honest is very wrong and I'm going to put 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.070
 an example christina driver kings that 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.050
 has a ring the nba is better than 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.050
 allen iverson since it sounds more than this 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.599
 phrase smells to hear it why the number 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.399
 of rings have nothing to do with what 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.930
 well that is a player we have to 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.450
 remember that rings is a prize 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.910
 collective an award from the whole team a 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.400
 player alone if he is alone he will never be able 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.260
 win a ring in today's video we're going 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.970
 to talk about players who have had a 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.530
 very good career in the nba 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.960
 but in the end they could not win the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.300
 championship and that does not mean they are 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.740
 bad if for example joel anthony won 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.270
 a ring with Miami 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.270
 tracy mcgrady has none 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.940
 well done joel anthony has two 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.770
 rings and for some maybe bronze 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.770
 and joel anthony are at the same level 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.880
 Boston is the highest assistant of the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.130
 history of the nba and carvalho the second 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.530
 top scorer there had to go out 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.450
 something good if or if it is a pity 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.640
 they did not win the ring of the nba but 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.290
 they gave us great moments 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.690
 they understood very well and on the track what 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.240
 they reflected pick and roll was simply 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.690
 spectacular 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.690
 poetry in movement 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.100
 patrick ewing a player that full of 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.680
 hopes to the whole city again 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.660
 york and wing was a very strong center very 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.700
 dominant but in the end luck does not 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.399
 accompanied and retired without any ring 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.990
 of the nba can at least say that he formed 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.619
 part of the best team in history 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.880
 of the 1992 team dream the team that 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.880
 reason the olympics of barcelona 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.459
 cardelli tracy mcgrady the two share 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.570
 quite a few things in common and ccoo are 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.909
 distant cousins 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.890
 are two moles are two clear but 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.670
 unfortunately they have not won any 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.710
 ring 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.780
 mcgrady is already retired but vince 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.920
 Carter continued to wage war in the best 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.540
 league of the world 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.610
 to see if he is lucky and can finish 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.060
 his career at the top with a ring 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.060
 from the nba 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.130
 a king of assists occupies the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.760
 third place of the maximum assistants 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.410
 of the whole story with more than ten thousand 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.570
 was a single player had a vision of 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.890
 games and rarely has seen what 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.440
 good thing about this player is he did 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.330
 better your companions more there will be 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.130
 won the ring of the nba but at least 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.380
 It has very important recognitions 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:51.230
 as for example the two that won in 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.550
 jean veil or eleven times all-star one of 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.800
 the best players of all the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.870
 history of the angels lakers disputed 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.950
 several endings but in the end his record 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.950
 was 0 8 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.599
 allen iverson a single player did not have 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.969
 a great physicist barely half a meter 80 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.599
 but the NBA dominated a league of 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.810
 students 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.430
 iverson was in living to be the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.530
 teams until the finals but could not 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.629
 win if you have rings but not 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.379
 nothing happens will equally be remembered as 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.379
 one of the great 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.090
 we also have to include pete maravich 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.430
 a mythical player his passes were 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.590
 spectacular was pure magic and its game 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.870
 is hypnotized it was really nice to see 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.620
 play this wonder crack is also 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.620
 one of the great 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.050
 the frame is one of the best 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.110
 wing-pivots of all history and that 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.370
 me diameter 95 the height was not a 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.349
 problem for him 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.629
 barkley was very powerful he had a physical 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.890
 spectacular had a lot of energy and in 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.890
 each match left the skin 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.690
 reid and miller a whole killer from the 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.730
 triple line is the second maximum 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.739
 triplist of the whole story is only 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.000
 exceeded by scratching in the countries 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.000
 they enjoyed a player 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.200
 dominique wilkins nine times all-star 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.169
 twice champion of the mattes contest 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.790
 top scorer of the nba in 1986 and 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.320
 top scorer of the entire history of 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.780
 the atlanta hawks 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.390
 so there are missing players but those and 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.730
 we will see them in a second part this has 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.800
 been everything I hope you liked us 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.950
 we see very soon and that everything goes very 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.950
 all right
