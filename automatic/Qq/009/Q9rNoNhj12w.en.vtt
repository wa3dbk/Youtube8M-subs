00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
bit piece of kit and so far all of the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.649 
bit piece of kit and so far all of the
stuff<00:03:40.639> that<00:03:40.669> I've<00:03:41.319> used<00:03:42.319> on<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:43.120> it's<00:03:44.120> as<00:03:44.359> good

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
stuff that I've used on it it's as good

as the beauty if not better now

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.860 
as the beauty if not better now
obviously<00:03:48.169> what<00:03:48.650> I'll<00:03:48.769> do<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.430> later<00:03:49.849> on<00:03:50.150> when

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
obviously what I'll do is later on when

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.569 
obviously what I'll do is later on when
I've<00:03:51.019> used<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.560> bit<00:03:51.709> more<00:03:51.919> and<00:03:52.190> I've<00:03:52.370> got<00:03:52.549> a

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
I've used it a bit more and I've got a

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.789 
I've used it a bit more and I've got a
bit<00:03:52.760> more<00:03:52.909> video<00:03:53.209> footage<00:03:53.510> then<00:03:53.930> I'll<00:03:54.079> do<00:03:54.769> a

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
bit more video footage then I'll do a

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.089 
bit more video footage then I'll do a
proper<00:03:55.099> review<00:03:55.940> on<00:03:56.269> it<00:03:56.299> but<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:57.470> far<00:03:57.739> I'm

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
proper review on it but so far I'm

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.089 
proper review on it but so far I'm
really<00:03:58.400> chuffed<00:03:58.699> with<00:03:58.879> it<00:03:59.030> I<00:03:59.209> think<00:04:00.099> another

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
really chuffed with it I think another

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.369 
really chuffed with it I think another
thing<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.459> wanted<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.790> do<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.269> a<00:04:02.329> comparison<00:04:03.139> in

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
thing I wanted to do is a comparison in

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.729 
thing I wanted to do is a comparison in
size<00:04:03.879> there's<00:04:04.879> of<00:04:05.120> UT<00:04:05.510> there's<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.229> secret

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
size there's of UT there's the secret

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.229 
size there's of UT there's the secret
they<00:04:07.609> are<00:04:07.849> quite<00:04:08.150> similar<00:04:08.449> but<00:04:10.030> obviously<00:04:11.030> the

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
they are quite similar but obviously the

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.380 
they are quite similar but obviously the
secret<00:04:11.750> is<00:04:12.169> a<00:04:12.769> lot<00:04:13.069> thinner

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.190 

and<00:04:17.390> basically<00:04:17.660> that's<00:04:18.080> a<00:04:18.230> size<00:04:18.470> comparison

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
and basically that's a size comparison

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.990 
and basically that's a size comparison
but<00:04:21.200> I<00:04:21.290> really<00:04:21.560> think<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.920> secret<00:04:22.160> is<00:04:22.490> just<00:04:22.730> I

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
but I really think the secret is just I

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.600 
but I really think the secret is just I
think<00:04:23.390> that's<00:04:23.510> going<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.720> be<00:04:23.870> an<00:04:24.020> outstanding

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
think that's going to be an outstanding

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.160 
think that's going to be an outstanding
piece<00:04:25.610> of<00:04:25.790> kit<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.300> I'm<00:04:26.420> really<00:04:26.660> chuffed<00:04:26.930> that

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
piece of kit and I'm really chuffed that

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.110 
piece of kit and I'm really chuffed that
I've<00:04:27.260> got<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.400> stay<00:04:29.390> tuned<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.790> I<00:04:31.790> shall

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
I've got it so stay tuned and I shall

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.050 
I've got it so stay tuned and I shall
update<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.660> more<00:04:32.900> on<00:04:33.430> what<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.460> think<00:04:34.790> of<00:04:34.940> it

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
update you more on what I think of it

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.540 
update you more on what I think of it
and<00:04:35.240> how<00:04:35.450> it<00:04:35.600> goes<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:36.200> mean<00:04:37.010> it's<00:04:37.160> early<00:04:37.400> days

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
and how it goes I mean it's early days

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.690 
and how it goes I mean it's early days
yet<00:04:37.790> you<00:04:38.480> know<00:04:38.660> I've<00:04:38.870> only<00:04:38.960> just<00:04:39.140> got<00:04:39.410> it<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:39.890> it

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
yet you know I've only just got it so it

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.160 
yet you know I've only just got it so it
could<00:04:40.940> turn<00:04:41.150> out<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.390> be<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.600> right<00:04:41.780> old<00:04:41.900> piece

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
could turn out to be a right old piece

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.680 
could turn out to be a right old piece
