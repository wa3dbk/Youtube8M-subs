level<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.289> stepped<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.740> up<00:02:10.800> lately<00:02:11.070> but

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
level you have stepped it up lately but

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.940 
level you have stepped it up lately but
coach<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.990> one<00:02:13.110> who<00:02:13.170> ultimately<00:02:13.290> decides

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
coach is the one who ultimately decides

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.980

on<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.220> rotation<00:02:14.490> look<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.390> feel<00:02:15.570> like<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.870> have

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
on the rotation look I feel like I have

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.470 
on the rotation look I feel like I have
a<00:02:16.050> good<00:02:16.230> handle<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> offense<00:02:17.400> now<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
a good handle of the offense now and the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.900 
a good handle of the offense now and the
overall<00:02:18.810> system<00:02:19.020> coach<00:02:19.350> has<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.680> place<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.790> at
