00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 welcome to the school operators of 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.359
 heavy equipment in the district of mala la 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.130
 school was created with the intention of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.099
 professionalize team career 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.809
 heavy and be able to provide a school for 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.910
 train the new generation of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.810
 operators of Peru to date we have 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.400
 come forming more than 900 operators in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.710
 him but there is a deficit of 4 thousand 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.920
 operators today 4,000 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.170
 trained professional operators what 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.759
 exist in Peru are operators but 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.469
 who have learned not in a way 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.200
 professional but he taught me 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.460
 really for a family member for a friend or 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.930
 by someone inside the operation but 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.219
 where the form has not been taught 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.219
 professional way to do it 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.070
 We practically focus on 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.230
 school in three aspects the training in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.320
 the security issue during the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.149
 operation we focus on the issues of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 basic maintenance and the role of 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.890
 operator in maintenance and care 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.650
 of the team and finally and mainly 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.309
 in the operation of the heavy equipment of 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.309
 productive way 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.770
 the family of hydraulic excavator and 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 front wheel loader caterpillars and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.470
 soybean bulldozer caterpillar tractor 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.649
 Later we include the machine that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.360
 is the leveling motorcycle and lately 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.620
 we just added to the portfolio of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.810
 courses the truck operation course 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:38.850
 off road money the first 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.010
 stage is an instruction in classroom or 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.979
 theoretical instruction where the students 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.660
 they do not know anything about heavy equipment they 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.090
 familiarizes them with the aspects 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.729
 team technicians with the controls 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.640
 with the theory of how to operate because 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.830
 operate that is important should also be 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.710
 the safety issues in the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.490
 second stage is the recognition of the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.220
 machine in a simulator where it happens to 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.470
 a virtual operation the operation will 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.810
 allows in the simo does not allow the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.270
 operator become familiar with the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.130
 controls have control mastery 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.140
 and practice different techniques of 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.209
 operation and also allows you to practice 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.410
 all aspects of security which 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.480
 are the security aspects during the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.340
 start and during shutdown the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 simulator has the feature that 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.810
 can measure the skills and the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.570
 development the operator measures the errors 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.569
 measures the correct answers and allows 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.480
 corrections finally once he 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.540
 has gone through the simulator happens to the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.239
 teams that have them behind my back and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.090
 Can the operator practice exactly 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.340
 what he saw in the simulator the transition 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.530
 from the simulator to the machine is much more 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.329
 easy when it comes to forming a 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.379
 new operator that has never had 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.379
 heavy machinery experience
