the<00:03:13.410> curls<00:03:13.920> actually<00:03:14.610> coil<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.150> all<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.480> that

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the curls actually coil in all of that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.450 
the curls actually coil in all of that
that's<00:03:15.840> definitely<00:03:16.290> on<00:03:16.470> point<00:03:16.770> with

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
that's definitely on point with

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.360 
that's definitely on point with
mimicking<00:03:18.090> human<00:03:18.720> hair<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.710> to<00:03:19.770> get<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.340> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
mimicking human hair so to get on to the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.220 
mimicking human hair so to get on to the
hair<00:03:20.610> itself<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.270> said<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.810> doesn't<00:03:21.840> come

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
hair itself like I said it doesn't come

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.050 
hair itself like I said it doesn't come
out<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.530> package<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.520> this<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.880> had

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
out the package and just like this I had

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.450 
out the package and just like this I had
to<00:03:24.300> actually<00:03:24.840> cut<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.530> was<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:25.980> density<00:03:26.430> of

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
to actually cut it it was the density of

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.660 
to actually cut it it was the density of
this<00:03:26.670> hair<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.150> very<00:03:27.380> very<00:03:28.380> thick<00:03:28.830> like<00:03:29.100> i<00:03:29.310> did

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
this hair is very very thick like i did

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.430 
this hair is very very thick like i did
a<00:03:29.700> video<00:03:29.880> on<00:03:30.060> how<00:03:30.210> i<00:03:30.330> had<00:03:30.540> cut<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:30.930> hair<00:03:31.170> and

will have that video sometime up soon if

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.750 
will have that video sometime up soon if
it's<00:03:36.990> not<00:03:37.140> down<00:03:37.380> below<00:03:37.650> already<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.310> show<00:03:38.700> you

it's not down below already and show you
guys<00:03:38.850> exactly<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.510> process<00:03:39.960> but<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.620> density

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
guys exactly a process but the density

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.490 
guys exactly a process but the density
of<00:03:41.100> this<00:03:41.250> hair<00:03:41.520> is<00:03:41.550> very<00:03:42.000> very<00:03:42.450> thick<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.080> was

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
of this hair is very very thick and was

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.470 
of this hair is very very thick and was
you've<00:03:44.280> been<00:03:44.430> thicker<00:03:44.640> than<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.240> it<00:03:45.360> was

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
you've been thicker than this and it was

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.750 
you've been thicker than this and it was
a<00:03:45.510> lot<00:03:45.690> more<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.500> i'll<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.010> show<00:03:47.460> you<00:03:47.490> guys

a lot more to so i'll just show you guys

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
a lot more to so i'll just show you guys
exactly<00:03:48.090> how<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.690> looks<00:03:48.870> as<00:03:49.080> far<00:03:49.380> as<00:03:49.410> shaking

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
exactly how it looks as far as shaking

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.910 
exactly how it looks as far as shaking
goes<00:03:50.190> it's<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.450> know<00:03:51.570> it's<00:03:51.600> very<00:03:52.020> very<00:03:52.440> nice

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
goes it's you know it's very very nice

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.310 
goes it's you know it's very very nice
and<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.550> just<00:03:53.790> really<00:03:53.850> luscious<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:54.840> it

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
and it's just really luscious and it

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.350 
and it's just really luscious and it
flows<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.890> it's<00:03:56.040> lightning<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:56.580> fluffy<00:03:57.090> so

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
flows and it's lightning is fluffy so

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.960 
flows and it's lightning is fluffy so
it's<00:03:57.960> definitely<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.500> nice<00:03:58.650> unit<00:03:59.310> but<00:03:59.520> like<00:03:59.850> i

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
it's definitely a nice unit but like i

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.460 
it's definitely a nice unit but like i
said<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.180> density<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.750> pretty<00:04:01.020> high<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.230> it

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
said a density is pretty high in it

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.410 
said a density is pretty high in it
which<00:04:01.620> isn't<00:04:01.800> a<00:04:02.220> problem<00:04:02.460> with<00:04:02.910> me<00:04:03.090> because<00:04:03.390> i

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
which isn't a problem with me because i

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.540 
which isn't a problem with me because i
like<00:04:03.750> big<00:04:03.990> hair<00:04:04.260> but<00:04:04.530> I'm<00:04:04.680> another<00:04:04.980> thing<00:04:05.280> that

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
like big hair but I'm another thing that

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.190 
like big hair but I'm another thing that
really<00:04:05.820> does<00:04:06.120> mimic<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.570> way<00:04:06.690> human<00:04:07.020> hair<00:04:07.170> is

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
really does mimic the way human hair is

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.949 
really does mimic the way human hair is
is<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.580> more<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.060> actually<00:04:09.420> wear

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
is that the more that you actually wear

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.740 
is that the more that you actually wear
this<00:04:10.170> hair<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:11.130> curls<00:04:11.430> do<00:04:11.730> drop<00:04:12.060> because<00:04:12.330> I

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
this hair the curls do drop because I

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.170 
this hair the curls do drop because I
have<00:04:13.080> cut<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.709> many<00:04:13.890> times<00:04:14.010> like<00:04:14.459> mainly

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
have cut it so many times like mainly

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.060 
have cut it so many times like mainly
the<00:04:15.810> front<00:04:16.080> portion<00:04:16.320> right<00:04:16.590> here<00:04:16.650> with<00:04:16.950> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
the front portion right here with the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.070 
the front portion right here with the
curls<00:04:17.400> for<00:04:17.670> the<00:04:17.790> bangs<00:04:18.030> I've<00:04:18.270> cut<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.630> like<00:04:18.780> I

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
curls for the bangs I've cut it like I

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.479 
curls for the bangs I've cut it like I
think<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:19.709> probably<00:04:19.890> gonna<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.160> like<00:04:20.250> my

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
think it's probably gonna be like my

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.520 
think it's probably gonna be like my
second<00:04:20.880> time<00:04:20.970> cut

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
second time cut

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.930 
second time cut
things<00:04:21.680> because<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.190> know<00:04:22.310> they<00:04:22.520> fall<00:04:22.910> a

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
things because you know they fall a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.030 
things because you know they fall a
little<00:04:23.180> bit<00:04:23.420> lighter<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.440> was<00:04:24.590> always<00:04:24.920> in

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
little bit lighter and it was always in

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.980 
little bit lighter and it was always in
my<00:04:25.070> face<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:26.030> know<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.180> just<00:04:26.270> cut<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.720> again

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
my face but you know I just cut it again

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.680 
my face but you know I just cut it again
and<00:04:27.290> if<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.650> curls<00:04:28.310> dropped<00:04:28.550> even<00:04:28.670> more<00:04:29.000> so<00:04:29.270> so

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
and if the curls dropped even more so so

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.330 
and if the curls dropped even more so so
this<00:04:29.930> is<00:04:29.960> one<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.440> those<00:04:30.620> units<00:04:31.040> where<00:04:31.220> the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
this is one of those units where the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.830 
this is one of those units where the
first<00:04:31.550> time<00:04:31.790> when<00:04:31.970> you<00:04:32.090> wear<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.480> don't<00:04:32.600> just

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
first time when you wear you don't just

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.240 
first time when you wear you don't just
want<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.080> jump<00:04:33.260> in<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.740> get<00:04:33.860> all<00:04:33.980> scissor

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
want to jump in and get all scissor

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.970 
want to jump in and get all scissor
happy<00:04:34.490> because<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.840> curls<00:04:36.139> do<00:04:36.350> drop<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:36.860> if

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
happy because the curls do drop so if

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.590 
happy because the curls do drop so if
you<00:04:37.070> cut<00:04:37.280> too<00:04:37.460> much<00:04:37.490> off<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:38.210> might<00:04:38.389> realize

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
you cut too much off you might realize

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.390 
you cut too much off you might realize
that<00:04:38.930> later<00:04:39.110> on<00:04:39.320> it's<00:04:39.889> going<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.160> stay<00:04:40.370> that

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
that later on it's going to stay that

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.100 
that later on it's going to stay that
way<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:40.940> doesn't<00:04:41.300> drop<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:41.720> definitely

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
way and it doesn't drop so definitely

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.020 
way and it doesn't drop so definitely
you<00:04:42.410> know<00:04:42.680> throw<00:04:42.889> it<00:04:42.950> on<00:04:43.040> your<00:04:43.190> head<00:04:43.340> playing

I said it's one of those units that gets

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.890 
I said it's one of those units that gets
better<00:06:19.580> or<00:06:19.760> it<00:06:19.880> looks<00:06:20.090> really<00:06:20.270> good<00:06:20.510> coming

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
better or it looks really good coming

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.529 
better or it looks really good coming
out<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.770> first<00:06:22.010> time<00:06:22.310> and<00:06:22.640> then<00:06:22.910> once<00:06:23.150> you<00:06:23.300> cut

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
out the first time and then once you cut

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.870 
out the first time and then once you cut
it<00:06:23.690> it<00:06:23.870> gets<00:06:23.990> better<00:06:24.320> over<00:06:24.680> time<00:06:24.710> so<00:06:25.310> yeah<00:06:25.729> it's

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
it it gets better over time so yeah it's

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.370 
it it gets better over time so yeah it's
pretty<00:06:26.060> much<00:06:26.300> what<00:06:26.600> I<00:06:26.630> think<00:06:26.900> about<00:06:26.960> it<00:06:27.229> as<00:06:27.350> far

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
pretty much what I think about it as far

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.950 
pretty much what I think about it as far
as<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:27.860> combs<00:06:28.130> go<00:06:28.490> I<00:06:28.729> believe<00:06:29.419> it<00:06:29.539> has<00:06:29.570> two

as the combs go I believe it has two
combs<00:06:30.260> on<00:06:30.710> this<00:06:31.370> side<00:06:31.640> see<00:06:32.030> if<00:06:32.150> I<00:06:32.210> can<00:06:32.360> feel<00:06:32.510> for
