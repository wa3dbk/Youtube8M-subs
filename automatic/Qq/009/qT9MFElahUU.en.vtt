Woods<00:04:04.180> i<00:04:04.600> think<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.990> team<00:04:05.200> that<00:04:05.230> comes<00:04:05.530> out

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
Woods i think is the team that comes out

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.710 
Woods i think is the team that comes out
of<00:04:05.770> this<00:04:05.950> region<00:04:06.190> you<00:04:06.760> saw<00:04:06.970> Domonic<00:04:07.480> Brown<00:04:07.510> a

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
of this region you saw Domonic Brown a

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.780 
of this region you saw Domonic Brown a
quarterback<00:04:08.350> he's<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> difference<00:04:09.010> maker<00:04:09.100> they

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
quarterback he's a difference maker they

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.309 
quarterback he's a difference maker they
can<00:04:10.000> get<00:04:10.120> points<00:04:10.510> on<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.720> board<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.050> I<00:04:11.110> think

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319
