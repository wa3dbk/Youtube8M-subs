00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.950
 hello hello tell 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:27.830
 about my device so to speak 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:30.040
 project schwarz blitz electro trike mean 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.250
 frame 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:37.780
 I digested myself 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.489
 work to be comfortable for the knees 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.360
 sits on a trike 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:47.600
 comfortable fit no further 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.199
 36 volt lithium battery but it's true 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.760
 15 m 5 hours here lithium polymer but she 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.910
 four and a half movie thunderstorm you 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.460
 remade the baturina no it's ready 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.929
 option but there are also folk cutlets up 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.420
 20 ampere hours of polymer clay here 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:09.140
 respectively 500 watt motor 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.270
 36 volts in this case programmable 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.270
 controller top yes yes 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.340
 and to more interesting things still 3 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:25.119
 so to say, respectively, reverse 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.119
 here are the rear turn signals here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.260
 one about another 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.780
 and so to say homemade 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:48.219
 headlight converter on lm317 here it is 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.649
 actually itself lm317 quality 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:55.240
 cooling is used here is this iron 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.479
 design for three important led 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.210
 lights past what's this here with us 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.750
 there is no anti-theft alarm 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.920
 and here is the bridge 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.149
 I mean ate masters will 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.870
 all-wheel drive of the two-wheel drive 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.620
 with disc brakes on two wheels dad 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.380
 stuntman 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:24.630
 does avid bb7 on one wheel mean 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.570
 disco true ours men 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.640
 ashinsky drive he gives better grip 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:37.180
 avid bb7 on another wheel 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.610
 it was made by me such a device 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.830
 and also 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.830
 experience with one pen worked 20 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.170
 it works like this 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.380
 cable and respectively 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.660
 were cut off just without any 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.860
 so to speak heads just bare cables 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 and brought to this device and not one 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.660
 handle up one handle 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.850
 here is all the food of the country 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.850
 to shoot 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.249
 developing 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.060
 It turned out that we have a box 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:39.090
 This backup battery is still so 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.690
 say roll i roll the peas 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.690
 enable rise 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.480
 and what you have in the trunk responsibly toggle 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.970
 backup mainly and 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.120
 not on a very large current since I and not 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.870
 I plan especially large trunk 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.870
 personal items 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.530
 her moment is that pretty water is not 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.280
 accepted and yes yes yes water is not in it 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.280
 gets into 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.460
 a run at it with a velocity v 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:19.609
 speed limit 40 kilometers per hour 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:23.449
 here is the run which means 65 kilometers to 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:29.620
 15 ampere hours and 80 kilometers on 20 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.620
 ampere hours 36 to
