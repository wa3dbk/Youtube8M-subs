00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
but going through the weaknesses that I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.849 
but going through the weaknesses that I
did<00:00:57.539> find<00:00:57.840> there<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.289> something<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
did find there just something that I

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.369 
did find there just something that I
happen<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.640> find<00:01:00.090> while<00:01:00.449> using<00:01:00.840> em<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.260> know

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.830 
happen to find while using em you know
they're<00:01:01.559> not<00:01:01.590> exactly<00:01:02.280> very<00:01:02.940> important<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
they're not exactly very important for a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.350 
they're not exactly very important for a
centre-back<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.369> are<00:01:05.580> weaknesses<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.330> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
centre-back but they are weaknesses so I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.910
