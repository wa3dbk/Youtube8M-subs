include the tanks it will it will it

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:27.969 
include the tanks it will it will it
includes<00:03:23.479> a<00:03:23.750> pcs<00:03:24.229> and<00:03:25.359> la<00:03:26.359> veas<00:03:26.629> and<00:03:26.979> it's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
going to be a fight through the dust and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.219 
going to be a fight through the dust and
rubble<00:03:30.199> and<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.849> earthquake<00:03:32.449> the<00:03:32.690> damages

the<00:03:33.470> earthquake<00:03:33.889> did<00:03:34.159> will<00:03:34.579> be<00:03:35.000> used<00:03:35.299> for

the earthquake did will be used for

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.020 
the earthquake did will be used for
total<00:03:36.470> advantage<00:03:36.650> maybe<00:03:37.250> crack<00:03:37.699> in<00:03:37.909> a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
total advantage maybe crack in a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.509 
total advantage maybe crack in a
building<00:03:38.449> baby<00:03:39.229> crack<00:03:39.680> on<00:03:39.859> their<00:03:40.040> own<00:03:40.190> if<00:03:40.400> you

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
building baby crack on their own if you

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.229 
building baby crack on their own if you
can<00:03:41.409> slide<00:03:42.409> through<00:03:42.799> it<00:03:42.979> and<00:03:43.250> go<00:03:43.819> near<00:03:44.090> the

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
can slide through it and go near the

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.479 
can slide through it and go near the
objective<00:03:44.780> something<00:03:45.199> like<00:03:45.379> that<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:45.859> think

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
objective something like that I I think

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.819 
objective something like that I I think
it<00:03:46.639> will<00:03:46.879> be<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.799> destruction<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
it will be the destruction the

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.839 
it will be the destruction the
earthquake<00:03:49.400> did<00:03:49.669> it<00:03:50.269> will<00:03:50.569> be<00:03:50.780> more<00:03:51.139> of<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.859> fly

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
earthquake did it will be more of a fly

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.229 
earthquake did it will be more of a fly
will<00:03:53.359> be<00:03:53.510> more<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:54.709> will<00:03:54.949> create<00:03:55.310> more<00:03:55.819> flank

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
will be more it will create more flank
