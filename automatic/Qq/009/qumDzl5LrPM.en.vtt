00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
okay I've dabbed on some it's kind of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.910 
okay I've dabbed on some it's kind of
thick<00:01:44.850> because<00:01:45.090> when<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> VOCs<00:01:46.439> dry<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.890> I

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
thick because when the VOCs dry out I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.569 
thick because when the VOCs dry out I
think<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> shrink<00:01:48.719> down<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.549> use<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
think it's going to shrink down I use a

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550 
think it's going to shrink down I use a
little<00:01:50.880> paint<00:01:51.149> diver<00:01:51.359> that<00:01:51.479> came<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
container so we'll see how that goes and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.499 
container so we'll see how that goes and
we'll<00:01:56.460> check<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.789> here<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.090> minute<00:01:57.359> when

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
we'll check it here in a minute when

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.359 
we'll check it here in a minute when
it's<00:01:57.659> drying<00:01:57.930> okay<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.950> point<00:01:59.189> I've

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
it's drying okay at this point I've

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.349 
it's drying okay at this point I've
dabbed<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.789> product<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.719> here<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.500> definitely

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
dabbed the product on here it definitely

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.749 
dabbed the product on here it definitely
looks<00:02:03.359> less<00:02:03.659> glossy<00:02:04.460> looks<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> little

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
looks less glossy looks a little

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.249 
looks less glossy looks a little
different<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.719> color<00:02:06.990> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
different but I think the color is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.830 
different but I think the color is
correct<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.360> let<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.509> dry<00:02:09.780> for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
correct so I have to let it dry for

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.480 
correct so I have to let it dry for
about<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> week<00:02:10.380> or<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:10.950> then<00:02:11.070> I'll<00:02:11.160> come<00:02:11.340> in

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
about a week or so and then I'll come in

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.750 
about a week or so and then I'll come in
here<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.730> I'll<00:02:11.790> lightly<00:02:12.090> wet<00:02:12.930> sand<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.440> and

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
here and I'll lightly wet sand it and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.780 
here and I'll lightly wet sand it and
then<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.120> will<00:02:15.540> polish<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:17.070> I'll<00:02:17.220> wax

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
then I will polish it and then I'll wax

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.640 
then I will polish it and then I'll wax
then<00:02:18.000> we'll<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.569> if<00:02:18.659> it<00:02:18.780> doesn't<00:02:19.170> blend<00:02:19.409> in

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
then we'll see if it doesn't blend in
