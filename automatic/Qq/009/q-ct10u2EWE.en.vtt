wondering<00:00:24.570> night<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> second<00:00:26.070> hardest

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
wondering night is the second hardest

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.460 
wondering night is the second hardest
difficulty<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.119> game<00:00:27.330> there<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> one

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
difficulty on this game there the one

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.859 
difficulty on this game there the one
above<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.890> called<00:00:29.099> paladin<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.510> reason

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
above it is called paladin the reason

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.240 
above it is called paladin the reason
why<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> didn't<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.650> guide<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
why I didn't do this guide on that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.889 
why I didn't do this guide on that
difficulty<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.239> can't<00:00:33.480> start

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
difficulty is because you can't start

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.959 
difficulty is because you can't start
from<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.230> fresh<00:00:34.380> save<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.250> means<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
from a fresh save on it which means you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.510 
from a fresh save on it which means you
carry<00:00:36.210> over<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.540> powerup<00:00:36.899> character<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.770> I

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
carry over a powerup character and I

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.280 
carry over a powerup character and I
personally<00:00:39.239> don't<00:00:39.450> think<00:00:39.510> those<00:00:39.750> guides<00:00:39.989> help

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
personally don't think those guides help

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.440 
personally don't think those guides help
if<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.620> completely<00:00:41.129> badass<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.090> do

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
if you are completely badass and you do

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
if you are completely badass and you do
it<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.920> it<00:00:43.920> doesn't<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.460> doesn't<00:00:44.640> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
it because it doesn't it doesn't you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.130 
it because it doesn't it doesn't you
know<00:00:44.940> sure<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> struggle<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> doesn't<00:00:46.020> show

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
know sure the struggle it doesn't show

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.299 
know sure the struggle it doesn't show
you<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> should<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> doing<00:00:46.800> how<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you what you should be doing how you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.619 
you what you should be doing how you
should<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.579> approaching<00:00:47.789> fights<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.420> you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
should be approaching fights because you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
should be approaching fights because you
have<00:00:48.780> every<00:00:49.020> move<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.410> locked<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
have every move on locked and you just a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
have every move on locked and you just a
tank<00:00:50.789> basically<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.140> made<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.379> mistake

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
tank basically and I made that mistake

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.080 
tank basically and I made that mistake
on<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:52.949> first<00:00:53.250> Unleashed<00:00:53.550> 2<00:00:53.699> video<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
on my first Unleashed 2 video and I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.910 
on my first Unleashed 2 video and I
regretted<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.620> will<00:00:55.800> be

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
regretted it so this one will be

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.520 
regretted it so this one will be
different<00:00:56.960> there's<00:00:57.960> two<00:00:58.050> things<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.350> will<00:00:58.410> say

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
different there's two things I will say

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.310 
different there's two things I will say
is<00:00:59.149> the<00:01:00.149> difference<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> difficulty

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
is the difference is in the difficulty

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650 
is the difference is in the difficulty
on<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.559> game<00:01:01.800> are<00:01:02.039> an<00:01:02.370> interesting<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
on this game are an interesting one the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
on this game are an interesting one the
two<00:01:04.170> major<00:01:04.379> factors<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> damage<00:01:05.549> that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
two major factors are the damage that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
two major factors are the damage that
you<00:01:05.880> deal<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> enemies<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.560> damage

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
you deal to the enemies and the damage

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.679 
you deal to the enemies and the damage
you<00:01:07.950> receive<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.850> enemy<00:01:09.150> from<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
you receive from the enemy from the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.710 
you receive from the enemy from the
enemies<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.520> paladin<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.420> enemies

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
enemies and on on paladin the enemies

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.330 
enemies and on on paladin the enemies
will<00:01:12.900> take<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> little<00:01:13.500> bit<00:01:13.680> more<00:01:13.830> damage<00:01:14.010> they

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
will take a little bit more damage they

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920 
will take a little bit more damage they
will<00:01:14.460> also<00:01:14.610> deal<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:15.330> bit<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.720> damage

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
will also deal a little bit more damage

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.620 
will also deal a little bit more damage
but<00:01:16.650> aside<00:01:16.920> from<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.270> much<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
but aside from that it's pretty much the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.109 
but aside from that it's pretty much the
same<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.560> aggressiveness<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.850> ferocity

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
same the aggressiveness and the ferocity

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.539 
same the aggressiveness and the ferocity
of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.600> enemies<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.320> same<00:01:22.710> uneasy<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.369> it

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
of the enemies is the same uneasy as it

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.120 
of the enemies is the same uneasy as it
is<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> hardest<00:01:24.540> difficulty<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
is on on the hardest difficulty and I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
is on on the hardest difficulty and I
think<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.640> down<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> AI<00:01:27.210> being

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
think that's just down to the AI being

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.850 
think that's just down to the AI being
programmed<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.200> way<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> yeah<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.710> one

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
programmed that way and so yeah it's one

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.230 
programmed that way and so yeah it's one
of<00:01:31.890> those<00:01:32.070> games<00:01:32.369> where<00:01:32.640> regardless<00:01:32.820> of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
of those games where regardless of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.460 
of those games where regardless of
difficulty<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.720> enemies<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.140> still<00:01:34.200> going

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
difficulty the enemies are still going

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.749 
difficulty the enemies are still going
to<00:01:34.530> give<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.799> challenge<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> damage

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to give you a challenge but the damage

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.060 
to give you a challenge but the damage
that<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.119> do<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.930> obviously<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.950> know

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that they do will obviously you know

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
that they do will obviously you know
dictate<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> real<00:01:38.759> difficulty<00:01:39.439> but<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
dictate the real difficulty but the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.830 
dictate the real difficulty but the
start<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.880> being<00:01:42.090> introduced<00:01:42.540> moves

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
start of this you being introduced moves

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.170 
start of this you being introduced moves
and<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:44.159> don't<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.880> part

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and I really don't like this part

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.940 
and I really don't like this part
because<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.899> can't<00:01:46.140> actually<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.770> moves

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
because you can't actually do the moves

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.530 
because you can't actually do the moves
until<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.340> game<00:01:47.520> tells<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> how<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.329> them

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
until the game tells you how to do them
