00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello how about friends of all and wallace already 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.180
 I'm going to show you how to feed 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.210
 our iguanas can see it here 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.040
 is my iguana geron I'm going to show you 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.440
 the hormone that is fed and what kind of 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.890
 animals we can occupy good to day of 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.190
 today I am going to occupy pumpkin 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.720
 squash 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.250
 and carrot 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.170
 good and we'll start with the pumpkin 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.500
 remember that the latter can not 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.110
 eat things too big and neither 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.020
 so so small so we're going to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.590
 cut the pumpkin into squares 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.250
 we started cutting in half and in parts 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250
 proportional 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.489
 it was cut 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.059
 to utter tics the size of the eye of 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.290
 our equal the pieces of food 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.290
 that we are going to give in this case 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.250
 we cut it into lines, you can not see 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.270
 then proceed to cut in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270
 dimensions 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.549
 or what 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.840
 well we cut the other vegetables 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.700
 we cut the remaining pumpkin block 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.590
 we continue cutting the pieces of pumpkin 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.460
 in the same way 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.689
 we cut it divided into two since 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.180
 is very large 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.860
 this work cut it 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.700
 we cut 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.700
 all together 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 cut 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.210
 ah 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.240
 ah 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.299
 ah 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.860
 well the good chayote now we proceed 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.890
 with the chayote 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.560
 we removed the tail and cut a piece 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.220
 not so big or small because it's going to be 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.220
 a lot of food 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.410
 a short century we do not let the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.890
 pumpkin 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.890
 ah 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.980
 then cut while forming streaks 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.980
 of the little solitates 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.430
 so 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.400
 we already have our coverage finely 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.600
 chopped into small pieces can see more 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.620
 big that his eye 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.760
 as they are 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.980
 because they can not eat more things 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.950
 big 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.659
 then we are going to cut a carrot the 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.720
 rings of the radio preferably 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.080
 because sometimes it's very hard on its own 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.640
 then the root in a peculiar way 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.640
 go occupied this grater 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.140
 with all 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.140
 and like us 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.769
 here 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.549
 it is easier 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.350
 that we have this 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.370
 with that is enough 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.940
 we already have chopped food prepared 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.050
 we have pumpkin that the iron helps them 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.050
 to the bones of our equal 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.360
 this now let's put in your 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.520
 container a container similar to this one 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.970
 and now we stir everything perfectly 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.970
 all right 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.740
 a little better and we warn you about 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.740
 the recipient 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.280
 this is impatient 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.420
 we put all this there 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.320
 very well 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.320
 that's good 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.300
 or what 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.330
 I occupy a charge supplement a 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.950
 Calcium council called cal cyclope 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.340
 Yes Yes 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.000
 this is not a formula for is a 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.350
 calcium-based formula for reptiles 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.350
 it's a little bit white 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.090
 this does not get much I cooper the 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.050
 knife in this case with a small 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.969
 pressure and warn you in this way 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.499
 in all the food 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:30.830
 We waited about 5 minutes is recommended 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:34.300
 the recipient 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.300
 so that calcium is absorbed 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.180
 the focus allows 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.139
 here it is 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.139
 to eat 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.930
 well this has been all for today I hope 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.750
