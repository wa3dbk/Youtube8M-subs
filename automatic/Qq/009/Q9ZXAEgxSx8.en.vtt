00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
shadows that's pretty much where I stay

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.140 
shadows that's pretty much where I stay
for<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.350> covergirl<00:00:16.770> line<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.520> really<00:00:17.850> do

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
for the covergirl line and really do

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.240 
for the covergirl line and really do
like<00:00:18.600> their<00:00:18.869> covergirl<00:00:19.350> eyeshadow<00:00:19.500> they<00:00:20.100> get

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
like their covergirl eyeshadow they get

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.710 
like their covergirl eyeshadow they get
really<00:00:20.580> bad<00:00:21.050> rep<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.680> being<00:00:23.100> poor<00:00:24.090> quality

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
really bad rep for being poor quality

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.640 
really bad rep for being poor quality
but<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:26.720> they've<00:00:27.720> steps<00:00:28.380> are

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
but I really think they've steps are

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.479 
but I really think they've steps are
quality<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> years<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.830> few

show<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.360> great<00:00:51.629> because<00:00:52.230> i<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.890> very

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
show up that great because i have very

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.810 
show up that great because i have very
light<00:00:53.789> skin<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.390> start<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
light skin to start with so that is the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
light skin to start with so that is the
third<00:00:57.000> shade<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> middle<00:00:58.410> shade<00:00:58.620> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that's the the lightest shade so this is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.990 
that's the the lightest shade so this is
great<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:08.880> everyday<00:01:09.780> wear<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:11.580> mean

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
great as you can see I mean it's not

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.479

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
really light pretty pink and then kind

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.670 
really light pretty pink and then kind
of<00:03:28.549> like<00:03:28.870> more<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.260> pearl<00:03:31.099> ayush<00:03:32.410> magenta<00:03:33.410> I

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
of like more of a pearl ayush magenta I

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.430 
of like more of a pearl ayush magenta I
guess<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.160> would<00:03:34.280> say<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.930> those<00:03:36.139> are<00:03:36.319> really

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
guess you would say but those are really

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.809 
guess you would say but those are really
pretty<00:03:36.560> too<00:03:37.099> but<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.639> don't<00:03:38.150> wear<00:03:38.930> them<00:03:39.819> very

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
pretty too but I don't wear them very

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.059 
pretty too but I don't wear them very
much<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.389> think<00:03:41.690> I've<00:03:41.810> worn<00:03:42.049> them<00:03:42.169> maybe<00:03:42.769> once

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
much I think I've worn them maybe once

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.940 
much I think I've worn them maybe once
but<00:03:43.489> there's<00:03:43.790> probably<00:03:44.120> some<00:03:44.810> way<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.620> you

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
but there's probably some way that you

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.430 
but there's probably some way that you
can<00:03:46.160> make<00:03:46.730> them<00:03:46.970> work<00:03:47.239> for<00:03:47.569> everyday<00:03:48.290> wear

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
can make them work for everyday wear

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.509 
can make them work for everyday wear
