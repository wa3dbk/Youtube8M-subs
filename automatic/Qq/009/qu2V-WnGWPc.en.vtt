00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
plane and then it's gonna be hard like

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.570 
plane and then it's gonna be hard like
well<00:02:13.260> if<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.770> guy<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.160> something<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.520> that

in-game leader tells me to do yeah
that's<00:02:44.370> fair<00:02:44.700> enough<00:02:44.760> am<00:02:45.060> because<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:45.780> would

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that's fair enough am because I would

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.690 
that's fair enough am because I would
come<00:02:46.530> sit<00:02:46.709> with<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.980> book<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.280> he<00:02:47.400> said<00:02:47.580> is

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
come sit with that book and he said is

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.740 
come sit with that book and he said is
that<00:02:47.730> because<00:02:48.150> you've<00:02:48.360> got<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> last

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
that because you've got the last

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.330 
that because you've got the last
position<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.709> seems<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:50.040> it's<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.280> of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
position so it seems like it's one of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.610 
position so it seems like it's one of
those<00:02:50.400> ones<00:02:50.610> where<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> necessary<00:02:52.140> role

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
those ones where it is a necessary role

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.830 
those ones where it is a necessary role
but<00:02:52.830> not<00:02:52.950> happen<00:02:53.220> likes<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.000> do<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.390> at

know<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.419> style<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:45.810> how<00:04:46.139> they<00:04:46.350> think<00:04:46.410> and

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
know the style and how they think and

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.040 
know the style and how they think and
you<00:04:46.889> seem<00:04:47.220> very<00:04:47.250> well<00:04:47.580> oh<00:04:47.880> good<00:04:48.389> and<00:04:48.540> abused<00:04:48.960> in

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
you seem very well oh good and abused in

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.260 
you seem very well oh good and abused in
that<00:04:49.230> you<00:04:50.160> explain<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.760> hell<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:51.000> them<00:04:51.150> all

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
that you explain the hell of them all

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.480 
that you explain the hell of them all
yeah<00:04:51.570> actually<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:51.990> think<00:04:52.020> our<00:04:52.889> style<00:04:53.310> is

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
yeah actually I think our style is

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.250 
yeah actually I think our style is
actually<00:04:53.880> very<00:04:53.910> similar<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.600> then<00:04:55.110> I

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
actually very similar to then I

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.620 
actually very similar to then I
peacetime<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.949> think<00:04:56.460> they<00:04:56.699> pay<00:04:56.910> very<00:04:57.180> simple

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
peacetime I think they pay very simple

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.350 
peacetime I think they pay very simple
and<00:04:57.840> let<00:04:58.320> like<00:04:58.740> they<00:04:59.040> good<00:04:59.940> really<00:05:00.330> good

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
and let like they good really good

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.570 
and let like they good really good
players<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:01.110> go<00:05:01.290> forward<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:01.889> take<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.370> shops

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
players to go forward and take the shops

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.250 
players to go forward and take the shops
and<00:05:02.760> we're<00:05:02.940> doing<00:05:03.419> basically<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.050> same<00:05:04.199> thing

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
and we're doing basically the same thing

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.010 
and we're doing basically the same thing
that<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:05.070> think<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.400> comes<00:05:05.669> down<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:06.270> like<00:05:06.510> who

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
that I think it comes down to like who

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.170 
that I think it comes down to like who
got<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.290> better<00:05:07.440> day<00:05:07.710> yeah<00:05:08.280> things<00:05:08.820> like<00:05:08.910> that

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
got the better day yeah things like that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.780 
got the better day yeah things like that
I<00:05:09.360> was<00:05:09.660> going<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.870> say<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.169> then<00:05:10.350> Chris<00:05:10.790> like

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
I was going to say that then Chris like

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.830 
I was going to say that then Chris like
it's<00:05:12.120> kind<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.330> one<00:05:12.449> of<00:05:12.479> those<00:05:12.540> things<00:05:12.720> where

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
it's kind of one of those things where

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.390 
it's kind of one of those things where
the<00:05:13.380> games<00:05:13.590> are<00:05:13.680> never<00:05:13.830> really<00:05:14.100> that<00:05:14.370> close

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
the games are never really that close

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.939 
the games are never really that close
already<00:05:15.180> or<00:05:15.690> sometimes<00:05:16.080> sometimes<00:05:16.740> they<00:05:16.830> are

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
already or sometimes sometimes they are

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.770 
already or sometimes sometimes they are
but<00:05:17.100> I<00:05:17.220> could<00:05:17.370> see<00:05:17.460> like<00:05:18.120> if<00:05:18.150> you<00:05:18.570> were<00:05:18.660> to

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
but I could see like if you were to

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.939 
but I could see like if you were to
Dreamhack<00:05:19.020> winter<00:05:19.080> for<00:05:19.410> example<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.770> first

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
Dreamhack winter for example the first

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.439 
Dreamhack winter for example the first
map<00:05:20.130> is<00:05:20.280> kind<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.490> closed<00:05:20.669> sack<00:05:20.940> one<00:05:21.120> wasn't

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
map is kind of closed sack one wasn't

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.760 
map is kind of closed sack one wasn't
that<00:05:21.540> goes<00:05:21.690> from<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.870> third<00:05:22.110> while<00:05:22.290> I'm<00:05:22.410> train

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
that goes from the third while I'm train

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.710 
that goes from the third while I'm train
you<00:05:23.070> can't<00:05:23.250> stop<00:05:23.430> them<00:05:23.699> and<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.330> was<00:05:24.449> the<00:05:24.510> man

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
you can't stop them and that was the man

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.020 
you can't stop them and that was the man
that<00:05:24.750> they're<00:05:25.110> notorious<00:05:25.740> for<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:26.250> fantastic

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
that they're notorious for you fantastic

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.629 
that they're notorious for you fantastic
on<00:05:27.120> immigrants<00:05:28.020> that<00:05:28.110> was<00:05:28.410> that<00:05:28.590> like<00:05:29.100> did<00:05:29.550> you

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
on immigrants that was that like did you

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.800 
on immigrants that was that like did you
just<00:05:29.729> play<00:05:30.000> them<00:05:30.180> really<00:05:30.210> well<00:05:30.540> know<00:05:30.690> when

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
just play them really well know when

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.150 
just play them really well know when
their<00:05:30.960> mindset<00:05:31.290> like<00:05:31.410> I<00:05:31.650> know<00:05:31.800> for<00:05:32.070> example

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
their mindset like I know for example

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.620 
their mindset like I know for example
get<00:05:32.610> white<00:05:32.850> this<00:05:33.030> one<00:05:33.150> of<00:05:33.210> those<00:05:33.300> plays<00:05:33.449> where

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
get white this one of those plays where

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.120 
get white this one of those plays where
everyone<00:05:34.050> knows<00:05:34.169> he<00:05:34.320> just<00:05:34.350> runs<00:05:34.800> around<00:05:34.919> in

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
everyone knows he just runs around in

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.129 
everyone knows he just runs around in
this<00:05:35.250> is<00:05:35.400> something<00:05:35.699> and<00:05:36.150> you<00:05:36.210> kind<00:05:36.419> of<00:05:36.449> can't

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
this is something and you kind of can't

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.080 
this is something and you kind of can't
come<00:05:37.290> to<00:05:37.410> that<00:05:37.530> pretty<00:05:37.710> well<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:38.130> think<00:05:38.639> like

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
come to that pretty well I think like

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.060 
come to that pretty well I think like
before<00:05:39.570> DREAM<00:05:39.780> Act<00:05:39.930> we<00:05:40.110> actually<00:05:40.410> practiced<00:05:40.919> a

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
before DREAM Act we actually practiced a

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.070 
before DREAM Act we actually practiced a
lot<00:05:41.190> against<00:05:41.520> me<00:05:41.699> we<00:05:42.270> didn't<00:05:42.540> actually<00:05:42.720> watch

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
lot against me we didn't actually watch

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.409 
lot against me we didn't actually watch
the<00:05:43.320> most<00:05:43.560> of<00:05:43.800> them<00:05:44.250> but<00:05:44.280> we<00:05:44.639> practice<00:05:45.090> so<00:05:45.240> much

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
the most of them but we practice so much

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.780 
the most of them but we practice so much
against<00:05:45.780> them<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:45.930> we<00:05:46.199> we<00:05:46.680> knew<00:05:47.490> what<00:05:47.669> they

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
against them so we we knew what they

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.460 
against them so we we knew what they
were

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
were

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.620 
were
I<00:05:48.500> think<00:05:48.890> they<00:05:49.130> knew<00:05:49.820> what<00:05:50.030> we<00:05:50.180> were<00:05:50.330> going<00:05:50.510> to

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
I think they knew what we were going to

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.450 
I think they knew what we were going to
do<00:05:50.780> as<00:05:50.900> well<00:05:51.110> but<00:05:51.140> we<00:05:51.410> just<00:05:51.470> made<00:05:51.920> like<00:05:52.130> small

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
do as well but we just made like small

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.940 
do as well but we just made like small
changes<00:05:52.970> and<00:05:53.260> everything<00:05:54.260> just<00:05:54.290> worked<00:05:54.740> up

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
changes and everything just worked up

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.120 
changes and everything just worked up
worked<00:05:55.490> out<00:05:55.670> good<00:05:56.000> like<00:05:56.390> I<00:05:56.570> think<00:05:56.780> it<00:05:57.110> JW<00:05:57.980> had

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
worked out good like I think it JW had

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.630 
worked out good like I think it JW had
some<00:05:58.370> really<00:05:58.790> be<00:05:59.000> around<00:05:59.270> with<00:05:59.480> the<00:05:59.630> off<00:05:59.990> and

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
some really be around with the off and

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.220 
some really be around with the off and
everyone<00:06:01.640> just<00:06:01.790> had<00:06:02.180> big<00:06:02.360> runs<00:06:02.600> and<00:06:02.870> that's

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
everyone just had big runs and that's

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.140 
everyone just had big runs and that's
the<00:06:03.950> funnest<00:06:04.250> night<00:06:04.700> with<00:06:04.850> the<00:06:05.000> match

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150
