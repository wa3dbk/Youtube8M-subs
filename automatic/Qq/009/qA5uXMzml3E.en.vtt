00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.570
 of the little ones that last Sunday 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.580
 in the voice kids advanced to the next 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.860
 stage of competition as part of the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.660
 prince royce team I visited his 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.230
 family who reside in ontario 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.970
 california let's meet them 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.109
 oliÃº who is an only child lives with his 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.390
 parents in the city of ontario 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.640
 california and now it is part of the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.039
 children in the prince royce team from 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.129
 very small he loves music something that 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.739
 his parents tried but before this 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.300
 We put each type of instrument 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:46.560
 music in front of him to see if he liked 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.630
 one or the other and he started to play a little and 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.890
 then in a 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:57.340
 a group of mariachis came to his 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:01:00.490
 school and we think why not 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.710
 we put the action in this group an idea 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.059
 that fascinated him but more to his 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.100
 own parents when they heard it 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.970
 sing for the first time with the mariachi and 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.350
 the first time the singing was a 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.270
 surprise to us 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.270
 the present day 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.260
 the powerful voice that left them 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.260
 open-mouthed 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.740
 definitely a very talented child 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 who despite being already part of a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.120
 Mariachi be in front of the coaches and the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.670
 large audience of the voice kids represents 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.820
 quite a challenge but it is the first time 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:46.080
 face him because he is usually 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.110
 a school and not the parents or family and 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.660
 that's all it does not have 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.460
 is the verbena before v every time in 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.690
 television something they told us 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.690
 make the most of 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.650
 I remind you not to miss the voice kits 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.360

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.360
