00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.840
 my game sold that's where he calls us both to know before the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.199
 season 8 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.159
 and it's not over 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:20.949
 it's not scary 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:21.920
 I'm disappointed 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.720
 we want to bring a little more 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.239
 misadventure overflowing on 25 meanwhile 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.449
 a first novel I wanted to talk to you a little bit of protection because at 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:35.760
 texas this case 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.950
 now I had it must be appropriate montreal 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.770
 all the links between the news of weird things 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.289
 like seeing them for example 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.289
 yes people his poor knowing that what happened 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.430
 for now I am here to make a shift in demand 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.030
 pc left the room this is part of china repeats his race 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.950
 at their request for example protection 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.110
 the numberer launcher so earlier 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.680
 what word sequences 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.620
 here with us 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.640
 especially in full storm in savoie Friday the court for the fire two 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.140
 extraordinary judgments 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 for example political rallies 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.740
 84 ' 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.229
 this lack of more with the palette it could be the girl who did not 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.970
 well 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.760
 forest left the room 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.190
 the stability of the charges are not 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.020
 and so I thought to myself that if the European charter for the combination 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.380
 complete 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.480
 by this call catalog of the redoubt 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.070
 apparently if you see 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.460
 he's talking because I'm totally reading my diary 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.190
 and all of a sudden I always ask myself so far from nothing and I say to myself 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.300
 like 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.540
 what could it be 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.540
 and here I tell myself that the text that it's a role 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.579
 maybe it's a black strikes what is the state a man - 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:07.650
 this Friday 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.650
 it means plant in a window 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:12.549
 what is the point 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.430
 it is to believe that it is very dangerous also in this case 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.430
 you must immediately react 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.679
 then we have directly and indirectly ready 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.679
 of which 40 years w 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.269
 no no no 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.079
 well maybe
