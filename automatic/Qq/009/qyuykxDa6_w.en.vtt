brutal easy so I'll just remove the
clips<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.939> funny<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.390> I've<00:01:42.570> put<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.869> out

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
clips and it's funny as I've put it out

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.639 
clips and it's funny as I've put it out
it's<00:01:44.310> our<00:01:44.729> system<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.259> see<00:01:46.500> it's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it's our system now you can see it's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.340 
it's our system now you can see it's
exactly<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.220> same<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
exactly the same and because it's the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.760 
exactly the same and because it's the
same<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.280> does<00:01:50.490> mean<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.170> fit

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
same it does mean that we can just fit

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.069 
same it does mean that we can just fit
the<00:01:52.979> center<00:01:53.670> pieces<00:01:53.909> straight<00:01:54.329> over<00:01:54.689> which<00:01:54.930> is

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the center pieces straight over which is

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.139 
the center pieces straight over which is
really<00:01:55.890> extraordinarily<00:01:56.340> handy<00:01:57.000> don't

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
really extraordinarily handy don't

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.359 
really extraordinarily handy don't
bother<00:01:57.390> try<00:01:57.659> repair<00:01:58.079> these<00:01:58.200> old<00:01:58.409> ones<00:01:58.560> it's

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
bother try repair these old ones it's

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.340 
bother try repair these old ones it's
virtually<00:01:59.790> impossible<00:02:00.020> okay<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
virtually impossible okay just get a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.060 
virtually impossible okay just get a
brand<00:02:01.619> new<00:02:01.680> one

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
brand new one

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.200 
brand new one
and<00:02:02.340> I'm<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.820> click<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and I'm going to do is click that

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.910 
and I'm going to do is click that
straight<00:02:03.509> back<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.899> place<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.560> other<00:02:04.590> one

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
straight back in place of the other one

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520 
straight back in place of the other one
so<00:02:05.189> we'll<00:02:05.399> do<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.640> now<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.079> goes<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.380> new

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so we'll do that now so it goes a new

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
so we'll do that now so it goes a new
one<00:02:07.710> okay<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.879> down<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> hole

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
one okay and up and down on the hole

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.270 
one okay and up and down on the hole
there<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.410> goes<00:02:10.590> over<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.950> hole<00:02:11.129> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
there it just goes over the hole and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.020 
there it just goes over the hole and
it's<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.459> couple<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.790> side<00:02:12.000> bits<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.510> click

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
it's a couple of side bits on the click

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's a couple of side bits on the click
should<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.450> cut<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.840> there<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.530> go<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.220> you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
should just cut in there you go so you

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.559 
should just cut in there you go so you
clicked<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.850> can<00:02:16.000> turn<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.510> position

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
clicked in you can turn it to a position

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.340 
clicked in you can turn it to a position
you<00:02:16.990> want

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
you want
