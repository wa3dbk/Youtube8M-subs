00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.679
 the psp 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.129
 it is a whole day and bigger top to think of 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.520
 Ajax Feyenoord Feyenoord Ajax that is the classic 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.370
 ajax psv 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.500
 it is about places 1 and 2 in general 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.400
 for championships 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.840
 similarly in 2004 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.220
 when ajax played in the very crucial game in February of that year 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 against PSV in the Amsterdam arena 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.180
 do you remember a fiery consultation psv 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.570
 both fulfill 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.160
 working hours 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.060
 pianist who naturally munsterman the cart pulled is the biggest 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 these matches will start this morning 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.670
 beh 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.100
 in addition to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.970
 so stay the marriage 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.960
 if this road 8 is thus the most expensive, then a bridge will be built between the set positions 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.980
 was the fastest meantime 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.980
 what the 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.280
 so 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.430
 yes there are many 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.840
 the difficult matches that this too as always 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.760
 the competition years 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 always that goes 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.690
 in the first half 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.140
 the devil was caught in the tail as he walked along 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 and it was PSV that scored 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.960
 Jan Vennegoor or Hesselink was played 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 He left our keeper Stekelenburg without a chance 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.959
 have far-reaching consequences 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.709
 just ridiculous 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.709
 t 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.369
 the formation 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.059
 after the break 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.669
 only then ice-cold moment in that competition 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.739
 lucius plays the ball 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.679
 at sea for the goal mouth but Jan Vennegoor or Hesselink 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.919
 actually that is the guarantee for a goal 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.919
 the stadium was not intentional to megrahi for seconds 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.899
 9 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.029
 then you can make it right 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.449
 can be in between 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.409
 ajax was saved at that time a 2 0 deficit 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.409
 that would actually be irreconcilable and not long afterwards 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.319
 it was suddenly one 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.009
 and that was a great promotion 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:34.899
 Wesley Sneijder, who is actually a bit more horizontal from midfield 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.919
 walked at the height of the sixteen meter and that ball with some 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.619
 great kick inside foot but it's no heart at the back 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.609
 incredible that remains 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.679
 complaints have been everyone 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:12.139
 went up and did not know what to do with those with those flights for the 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.139
 equalizer 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.559
 thereafter 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.909
 ajax set the tone 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.559
 he came into the field with a substitute 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:34.499
 nicola imitate the small 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.419
 a rough diamond you 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.060
 unfortunately never completely honed but he did have talent and he showed that 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.840
 that competition starts with a fantastic 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.290
 with a nice place a nice place i think that is a fitting word to the giro 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.599
 to drive 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.990
 I thought the breasts to the running quarter through the entire morning 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.789
 the space 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.229
 he gets the ball and it seems that it has just been for him and the ball is not like that 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.949
 known that 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.949
 for traffic 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.059
 the arena exploded on a mitt 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:25.169
 everyone is at a profit, we are not yet extra at a distance from psv 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.789
 competition in hand to make that distance even bigger from the league after six 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.789
 points 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.029
 it became difficult because psv switched on to march and had to go to Stekelenburg 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.029
 fantastic club a few times 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.160
 the population 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.970
 substitute 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.410
 Rafael van dervaart is slightly injured 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.389
 before the match 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.710
 he now also put the couch on the couch 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.600
 but with Rafael van dervaart in midfield, we stopped against PSVs 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.999
 be in the arena 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.999
 there came 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.680
 the 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.889
 that's a nice feeling 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.830
 the bulk win caused by this is the was also happy that meant yes I am 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.960
 drivers really 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.960
 shoot 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.279
 he received was 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.239
 those two a victory was indeed the first step on the road to one 

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:42.430
 league title anp ajax so season 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.430
 become champion of the Netherlands 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.089
 No
