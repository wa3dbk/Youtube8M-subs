00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.260
 the youtube galera good the phone 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 android 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.990
 in the beginning it is very good very fast 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.870
 very efficient but in passing the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.849
 time it will start to lock it will stay 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.430
 a bit slow 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.980
 So how do we solve this problem well? 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.020
 I'll leave the application link in the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.880
 description of the video you open the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.190
 description of the video as well and download 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.810
 app there by good prehistory 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:37.239
 download and install the application clicks 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.100
 in it to open it comes down here 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.140
 bottom of the screen 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.569
 click on these traces which are the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.960
 application settings here 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:50.999
 Notifications 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.079
 I have verify notifications 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:54.640
 automatically memory automatically 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.499
 leave daily 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.089
 I suggest idle applications for 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:04.570
 Uninstall I leave here weekly 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.820
 remove ads and get all themes 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.079
 this version is paid you will have to buy 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.869
 there by prehistory and here is the theme 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.840
 also the only theme that is free of this 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.500
 theme winter the other themes are paid 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.509
 also help yes for you to use 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.200
 quietly the free version 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.109
 the application will work to let the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.450
 same way to certain 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:34.090
 good if your phone talent work 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.810
 too much trouble to resort to this 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.060
 here in this memory menu let's 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.399
 click review 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.219
 he will analyze here everything that is 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.100
 making memory applications that are 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.679
 running in the background so that you 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.799
 can kill those tasks and get there with 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.539
 a little extra memory it will change 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.270
 here how much memory do I 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.210
 I have been singing while using 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.299
 has been released from extra memory is my 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.770
 smartphone 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.250
 of course there are several others 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.569
 applications scattered throughout history 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.930
 the internet, but the decline is 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.090
 being very efficient at least with me 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.819
 so I recommend it to anyone up to whom 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.860
 has a slightly weaker phone than 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.370
 installed clean you will notice 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.500
 a significant improvement over the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.810
 good phone performance that already 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.640
 show here he will give me the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.959
 applications that are running in second 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.300
 plan 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.120
 if I stay here in that red box 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.989
 with the clean name he will do this 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.760
 cleaning will kill these tasks and 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.250
 will let the phone performance a 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.519
 you will realize that the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.940
 phone will stay a little faster 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.670
 and also good glp which is memory I come 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.970
 here and storage but if second 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.790
 menu 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.610
 if I click review 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.829
 it will analyze all that is rubbish that 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.709
 have inside my device are also 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:19.090
 historical caches so that I can 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.430
 gain some extra space in my 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.769
 also if I saw this 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.840
 trash click analyze 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.390
 it will review my apps 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.000
 also if I want to install the 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.579
 application it will change here the list of 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.769
 applications that I have I want 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.310
 install can select just click 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:42.540
 here it still exists it's there also here 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.070
 this icon here in this last water 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:51.459
 are my phone records 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:54.730
 records of conversations records of 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.989
 calls and sms short everything that was 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.510
 register here he will call here for 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.430
 that I can clean if I want too 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.350
 so this is it folks galley 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.860
 the application is very simple to use 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.770
 also if you have problems with many 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.560
 treatments on your phone then 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.959
 I recommend that you download install the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.550
 the clean you will notice a 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.800

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.290
 the decline also counts on the object 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.460
 is it from him then if you suddenly 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:38.100

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:45.150
