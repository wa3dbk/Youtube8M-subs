defending that title making a ton of

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.550 
defending that title making a ton of
money<00:02:21.340> ultimately<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.600> control<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:23.380> his

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560

destiny his own destiny as the champion

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.110 
destiny his own destiny as the champion
so<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:29.110> don't<00:02:29.320> think<00:02:29.610> WWE<00:02:30.610> sending<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
so I just don't think WWE sending the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.480 
so I just don't think WWE sending the
feelers<00:02:31.450> out<00:02:31.600> at<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.900> time<00:02:31.960> is<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:33.220> right

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
feelers out at this time is the right

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.550 
feelers out at this time is the right
time<00:02:33.550> at<00:02:34.150> all<00:02:34.330> because<00:02:34.750> they<00:02:35.080> dropped<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
time at all because they dropped the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.440 
time at all because they dropped the
ball<00:02:35.710> when<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.070> indeed<00:02:36.400> had<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.790> opportunity

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
ball when the indeed had the opportunity

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.450 
ball when the indeed had the opportunity
when<00:02:37.900> AJ<00:02:38.260> Styles<00:02:38.680> was<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.950> hottest<00:02:39.130> free

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
when AJ Styles was the hottest free

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.750 
when AJ Styles was the hottest free
agent<00:02:39.820> in<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.840> wrestling<00:02:41.290> world<00:02:41.320> so<00:02:42.040> maybe

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
agent in in the wrestling world so maybe

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.640 
agent in in the wrestling world so maybe
sometime<00:02:43.300> down<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.570> line<00:02:43.870> Never<00:02:44.350> Say<00:02:44.620> Never

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
sometime down the line Never Say Never

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.450 
sometime down the line Never Say Never
but<00:02:45.250> definitely<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.420> positively<00:02:47.080> I'll<00:02:47.590> say

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
but definitely and positively I'll say

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.760 
but definitely and positively I'll say
not<00:02:48.730> now<00:02:49.030> I'm<00:02:49.870> gonna<00:02:49.990> cool<00:02:50.230> I'm<00:02:50.440> gonna<00:02:50.530> close

with<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.190> again<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.880> being<00:02:52.120> our<00:02:52.270> last

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
with this and again this being our last

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.320 
with this and again this being our last
segment<00:02:52.950> using<00:02:53.950> Samoa<00:02:54.430> Joe<00:02:54.670> as<00:02:54.820> an<00:02:54.940> example

segment using Samoa Joe as an example

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.590 
segment using Samoa Joe as an example
and<00:02:55.720> NXT<00:02:56.620> um<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:56.920> think<00:02:57.130> WWE<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:57.970> looking<00:02:58.360> for

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
and NXT um I think WWE is looking for

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.470 
and NXT um I think WWE is looking for
four<00:02:58.960> veteran<00:02:59.440> talent<00:02:59.950> with<00:03:00.850> MIT<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.240> with

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
four veteran talent with MIT with with

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.140
