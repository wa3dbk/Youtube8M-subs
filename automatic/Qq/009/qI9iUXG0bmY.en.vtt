00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.920 
call it there's something like this it's
an<00:01:19.740> example<00:01:20.070> since<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.000> rename<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.630> your

weapons your nades and everything all
the<00:01:24.390> way<00:01:24.479> down<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:27.360> second<00:01:27.750> thing

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the way down there now the second thing

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.050 
the way down there now the second thing
which<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> scroll<00:01:30.000> down

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
which you can do is if you scroll down

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:42.080 
which you can do is if you scroll down
to<00:01:30.540> row<00:01:31.790> 5890<00:01:32.790> 3<00:01:33.619> go<00:01:34.619> down<00:01:38.840> 5890<00:01:39.869> 3<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.939> you'll

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to row 5890 3 go down 5890 3 so you'll

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
to row 5890 3 go down 5890 3 so you'll
be<00:01:42.210> over<00:01:42.540> here<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:43.680> you've<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:43.920> all<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
be over here then you've got all the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
be over here then you've got all the
rank<00:01:44.430> names<00:01:44.670> example<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.750> currently

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
rank names example I'm currently

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:57.310

masticating<00:01:46.860> elite<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.610> change<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.260 

so<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:59.039> could<00:01:59.490> also<00:01:59.700> rename<00:02:00.060> it
