00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
hi in this short video we're going to

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.230 
hi in this short video we're going to
take<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> look<00:00:08.250> at<00:00:08.400> how<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.610> can<00:00:08.880> use<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> free

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
take a look at how we can use a free

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.070 
take a look at how we can use a free
online<00:00:09.889> photo<00:00:10.889> editing<00:00:11.429> tool<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.599> do<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> number

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
online photo editing tool to do a number

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.169 
online photo editing tool to do a number
of<00:00:13.110> things<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.710> an<00:00:14.009> image<00:00:14.429> particularly

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
of things with an image particularly

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.710 
of things with an image particularly
change<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.080> pixel<00:00:16.740> size<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> let's<00:00:18.510> take<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
change the pixel size so let's take a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.700 
change the pixel size so let's take a
look<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:19.020> how<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.289> works

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
look at how this works

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.910 
look at how this works
it's<00:00:19.920> pixlr.com<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.500> we're<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> go<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it's pixlr.com and we're going to go to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.609 
it's pixlr.com and we're going to go to
open<00:00:23.100> Pixlr<00:00:24.090> editor<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.990> advanced<00:00:25.320> version

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
open Pixlr editor the advanced version

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.150 
open Pixlr editor the advanced version
and<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.869> thing<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.199> needed<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.980> is

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and the first thing we needed to do is

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
and the first thing we needed to do is
go<00:00:29.310> find<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.820> image<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.570> would<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> work

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
go find the image we would like to work

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
go find the image we would like to work
with<00:00:31.289> off<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.890> our<00:00:32.070> computer<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.969> we're<00:00:33.360> going

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
with off of our computer so we're going

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.260 
with off of our computer so we're going
to<00:00:33.540> open<00:00:33.690> an<00:00:33.899> image<00:00:34.020> from<00:00:34.469> our<00:00:34.590> computer<00:00:35.010> I

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
to open an image from our computer I

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.729 
to open an image from our computer I
happen<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.630> Mac<00:00:36.899> here<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:37.680> why

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
your computer for the image that you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
your computer for the image that you
want<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> use<00:00:42.989> here's<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
pull up and so I'm bringing a picture

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760 
pull up and so I'm bringing a picture
from<00:00:47.550> my<00:00:47.700> computer<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.750> cloud<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.440> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
from my computer up to the cloud I have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
from my computer up to the cloud I have
a<00:00:49.829> lot<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> tools<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.899> thing

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
a lot of tools here but the first thing

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.810 
a lot of tools here but the first thing
that<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> take<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> look<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> how<00:00:53.610> to

that we want to take a look at is how to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
that we want to take a look at is how to
change<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.539> pixel<00:00:54.989> size<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:56.070> if

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
change the pixel size of this if

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.970 
change the pixel size of this if
required<00:00:56.760> -<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.280> 273<00:00:59.280> by

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
required - you can see it's a 273 by

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.799 
required - you can see it's a 273 by
2:18<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> first<00:01:03.090> thing<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.660> do

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
2:18 so the first thing we want to do

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.420 
2:18 so the first thing we want to do
when<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> picture<00:01:04.320> comes<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.369> to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
when the picture comes up is to go to

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.500 
when the picture comes up is to go to
the<00:01:05.610> edit<00:01:05.939> menu<00:01:05.970> select<00:01:07.100> Emmett<00:01:08.100> image<00:01:09.060> size

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the edit menu select Emmett image size

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.410 
the edit menu select Emmett image size
sorry<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.880> working<00:01:12.180> box

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
sorry and we have a little working box

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
sorry and we have a little working box
right<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.799> our<00:01:14.040> work<00:01:14.310> we're<00:01:14.580> going

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
right here and for our work we're going

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.200 
right here and for our work we're going
to<00:01:14.760> make<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.060> image<00:01:15.860> 150<00:01:16.860> pixels<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.850> width

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to make this image 150 pixels in width

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120 
to make this image 150 pixels in width
and<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.509> automatically<00:01:19.200> changes<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.830> height

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and it automatically changes the height

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.740 
and it automatically changes the height
to<00:01:20.430> keep<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.880> proportion<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:22.409> click<00:01:22.650> ok

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
to keep it in proportion and we click ok

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.770 
to keep it in proportion and we click ok
now<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> image<00:01:25.200> pixel<00:01:25.979> size<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:27.060> required

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
now the image pixel size is as required

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
now the image pixel size is as required
now<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.770> things<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.159> this

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
now we can do more things with this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.950 
now we can do more things with this
picture<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.939> wanted<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.810> could

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
picture if we wanted to we could

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
picture if we wanted to we could
actually<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.560> some<00:01:31.770> cropping<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:32.670> we

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
actually do some cropping with it or we

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.210 
actually do some cropping with it or we
can<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.060> some<00:01:33.270> filtering<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:33.990> that's<00:01:34.890> all<00:01:35.100> we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
can do some filtering but that's all we

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.370 
can do some filtering but that's all we
want<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.790> right<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.170> it's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
want to do with it right now so now it's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.410 
want to do with it right now so now it's
up<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> cloud<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.310> need<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> save<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> back

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
up in the cloud we need to save it back

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
up in the cloud we need to save it back
to<00:01:39.689> our<00:01:39.840> hard<00:01:40.079> drive<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> go

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to our hard drive so we're going to go

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.690 
to our hard drive so we're going to go
to<00:01:41.340> file<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.750> save<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.710> we're<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.460> give

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to file and save and we're going to give

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.240 
to file and save and we're going to give
it<00:01:44.820> an<00:01:44.939> image<00:01:45.360> name<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.860> I'm<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it an image name so I'm just going to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.490 
it an image name so I'm just going to
call<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.729> Toni<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.259> have

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
call this Toni and because I have

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.980
