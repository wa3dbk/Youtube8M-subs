the advent of a 500 series they were

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.669 
the advent of a 500 series they were
saying<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.420> build<00:01:44.659> something<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.320> we'd

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
saying we you build something and we'd

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.859 
saying we you build something and we'd
resist<00:01:46.039> it<00:01:46.189> we<00:01:46.310> resisted<00:01:46.909> in<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.600> end<00:01:47.719> we

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
resist it we resisted in the end we

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.270 
resist it we resisted in the end we
could<00:01:48.020> resist<00:01:48.200> no<00:01:48.499> longer<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:51.229> is<00:01:51.289> wider<00:01:52.070> than

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
could resist no longer it is wider than

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.999 
could resist no longer it is wider than

than your average 500 suit as you can
see<00:01:55.280> but<00:01:55.549> that's<00:01:55.700> because<00:01:56.229> everything<00:01:57.229> that's

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
see but that's because everything that's

in here is in here so you know you

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.149 
in here is in here so you know you
