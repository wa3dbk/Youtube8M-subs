00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 Nicaragua as everyone knows the asteroid 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.330
 rc 2014 of approximately 20 meters 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.620
 it happened near the earth yesterday 7 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.620
 September 2014 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.699
 according to experts the asteroid 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.430
 It did not represent any danger to the 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.430
 there was no possibility of impact 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.870
 on Saturday, September 6, 2014 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.640
 approximately eleven five 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.610
 night local time 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.230
 the people of managua nicaragua 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.870
 they heard a loud roar that was 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.870
 caused by a meteorite that fell in 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.200
 an isolated area of ​​the northern highway 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.050
 [Music] 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.110
 the meteorite caused a crater of 12 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.170
 meters in diameter x 1.50 meters 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.250
 depth and it is believed that the rock 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 traveled at about 300 meters per second 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.900
 fortunately for people the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.900
 meteorite only affected trees and weeds 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.650
 but that's not all in Spain on the day of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.070
 yesterday at 6 55 local time several 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.450
 people managed to see like a meteor 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.450
 lit the skies of various places 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.060
 due to the proximity of both events 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.040
 with space the asteroid rs 2014 what 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.500
 most likely they are 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 related and this be a small 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.050
 fragment that have been detached from 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.050
 asteroid 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.510
 as I have always told you between all 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.540
 the tastings that may occur in the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.030
 earth the impact of a meteorite is the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.280
 what else should we worry about since 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.860
 as humans we are not yet ready 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.290
 in the face of these types of threats 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.110
 thanks to our friend Jorge for 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
