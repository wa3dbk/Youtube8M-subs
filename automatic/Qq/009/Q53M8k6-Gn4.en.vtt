said in the beginning we really want to
see<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> variety<00:00:32.880> that'll<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.500> win<00:00:34.710> in

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
see a variety that'll get you the win in

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.060 
see a variety that'll get you the win in
most<00:00:35.100> cases<00:00:35.340> having<00:00:35.850> harder<00:00:36.329> games<00:00:37.070> more

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
most cases having harder games more

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.959 
most cases having harder games more
clips<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.489> them<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.879> things<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.930> so

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
clips on them and things like that so

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.420 
clips on them and things like that so
next<00:00:41.969> round<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.600> CD<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.260> hex<00:00:43.469> cd1<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
next round we have CD and hex cd1 this

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.080 
next round we have CD and hex cd1 this
one<00:00:44.610> mainly<00:00:45.030> because<00:00:45.680> hex<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:47.010> had<00:00:47.219> way<00:00:48.030> too

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
one mainly because hex just had way too

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
one mainly because hex just had way too
many<00:00:48.390> demolition<00:00:49.230> clips<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.890> feel<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
many demolition clips we feel that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.500 
many demolition clips we feel that
demolition<00:00:50.550> there's<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.449> easier

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
demolition there's just a lot easier

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.750 
demolition there's just a lot easier
than<00:00:51.960> any<00:00:52.230> other<00:00:52.350> game<00:00:52.590> type<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
than any other game type and I know a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
than any other game type and I know a
lot<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.000> people<00:00:54.530> disagree<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.860> that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
lot of people disagree with this that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
lot of people disagree with this that
it's<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> same<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.390> domination

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
it's kind of the same as domination

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.160 
it's kind of the same as domination
spawn<00:00:58.500> trapping<00:00:58.829> etc<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.870> people

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
spawn trapping etc but the people

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.630 
spawn trapping etc but the people
literally<00:01:01.500> spawn<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.280> front<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.520> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
literally spawn right in front of you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880 
literally spawn right in front of you
you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.000> walk<00:01:03.239> almost<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.960> their<00:01:04.320> spawn<00:01:04.589> point

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you can walk almost in their spawn point

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.060 
you can walk almost in their spawn point
and<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.280> won't<00:01:05.519> even<00:01:06.049> shift<00:01:07.049> spawns<00:01:07.320> with

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and they won't even shift spawns with

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.890 
and they won't even shift spawns with
domination<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.970> very<00:01:09.180> easy<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> flip<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
domination it's very easy to flip the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.170 
domination it's very easy to flip the
spawns<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:11.280> actually<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> strategy

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
spawns and there's actually a strategy

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.670 
spawns and there's actually a strategy
to<00:01:12.210> getting<00:01:12.540> clips<00:01:12.780> rather<00:01:13.170> than<00:01:13.380> just

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
to getting clips rather than just

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
to getting clips rather than just
blindly<00:01:14.250> running<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.670> their<00:01:14.790> spawn<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
blindly running in their spawn and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.560 
blindly running in their spawn and
having<00:01:16.409> them<00:01:16.530> still<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.700> no

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
having them still be there and no

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.810 
having them still be there and no
competition<00:01:19.259> whatsoever<00:01:19.490> alright<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.700> now

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
are five now this was probably one of

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.560 
are five now this was probably one of
the<00:01:59.770> toughest<00:02:00.280> decisions<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.270> we've<00:02:01.450> ever

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
the toughest decisions that we've ever

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.340 
the toughest decisions that we've ever
had<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.990> make<00:02:03.360> both<00:02:04.360> teams<00:02:04.660> just<00:02:05.020> for

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
had to make both teams just for

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.609 
had to make both teams just for
ridiculous<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.550> clips<00:02:06.760> they<00:02:06.910> had<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
ridiculous and the clips they had the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.499 
ridiculous and the clips they had the
variety<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.649> everything<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.509> mass

variety and everything like that mass

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.110 
variety and everything like that mass
had<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> lot<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.170> black<00:02:11.620> ops<00:02:11.830> 1<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.340> we<00:02:12.850> really

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
had a lot of black ops 1 and we really

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.510 
had a lot of black ops 1 and we really
enjoyed<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.870> r5<00:02:14.560> had<00:02:14.830> some<00:02:15.040> variety<00:02:15.430> and

world at war and other games and it

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.620 
world at war and other games and it
honestly<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:18.190> came<00:02:18.520> down<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.300> simple

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
honestly just came down to the simple

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.920 
honestly just came down to the simple
fact<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.050> most<00:02:20.680> people<00:02:21.390> voted<00:02:22.390> for<00:02:22.420> our<00:02:22.630> five

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
fact that most people voted for our five

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.330 
fact that most people voted for our five
I<00:02:23.470> know<00:02:24.400> voting<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.180> comments<00:02:25.660> isn't<00:02:25.990> very

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
I know voting and comments isn't very

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.010 
I know voting and comments isn't very
consistent<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.430> isn't<00:02:27.730> very<00:02:27.940> reliable<00:02:28.360> but

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
consistent it isn't very reliable but

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.170 
consistent it isn't very reliable but
when<00:02:29.740> we<00:02:29.830> go<00:02:29.950> through<00:02:29.980> comments<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.760> see<00:02:30.940> that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
when we go through comments and see that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.760 
when we go through comments and see that
everyone<00:02:31.750> wants<00:02:32.020> his<00:02:32.140> team<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.380> when<00:02:32.620> they

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
everyone wants his team to when they

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.590 
everyone wants his team to when they
have<00:02:32.950> their<00:02:33.100> reasons<00:02:33.340> they<00:02:33.730> have<00:02:33.910> everything

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
have their reasons they have everything

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.130 
have their reasons they have everything
they<00:02:34.870> need<00:02:35.190> they<00:02:36.190> do<00:02:36.250> influence<00:02:36.850> our<00:02:37.570> decision

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
they need they do influence our decision

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.800 
they need they do influence our decision
in<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.680> form<00:02:39.070> we<00:02:39.490> felt<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.820> these<00:02:40.060> these<00:02:40.570> two

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
in a form we felt that these these two

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.990 
in a form we felt that these these two
matchups<00:02:41.200> were<00:02:41.350> really<00:02:42.010> close<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.880> all

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
matchups were really close and it all

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.030 
matchups were really close and it all
came<00:02:43.209> down<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.480> like<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.990> said<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.470> simple<00:02:44.800> fact

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
came down to like I said the simple fact

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.090 
came down to like I said the simple fact
that<00:02:45.160> everyone<00:02:45.910> voted<00:02:46.209> for<00:02:46.390> our<00:02:46.480> five<00:02:47.100> there

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
that everyone voted for our five there

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.699 
that everyone voted for our five there
was<00:02:48.220> an<00:02:48.310> overwhelming<00:02:48.580> majority<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.570> we<00:02:50.470> feel

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
was an overwhelming majority and we feel

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.759 
was an overwhelming majority and we feel
like<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:51.340> guys<00:02:51.490> should<00:02:51.940> have<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.780> say<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.440> what

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
like you guys should have a say and what

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.220

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
involved as much as possible obviously

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.259 
involved as much as possible obviously
we're<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.570> going<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:59.280> judge<00:03:00.280> completely

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
we're not going to judge completely

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.580 
we're not going to judge completely
based<00:03:01.450> off<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.750> comments<00:03:02.170> like<00:03:02.230> I've<00:03:02.410> said

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
based off the comments like I've said

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.320 
based off the comments like I've said
before<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:03.130> doesn't<00:03:03.459> have<00:03:03.640> very<00:03:04.090> much

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
before that doesn't have very much

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.640 
before that doesn't have very much
better<00:03:04.600> influence<00:03:04.840> but<00:03:05.170> when<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.500> get<00:03:05.620> a

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
better influence but when you get a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.920 
better influence but when you get a
match<00:03:05.860> that's<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.459> close<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.120> this

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
match that's this close and this

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.120 
match that's this close and this
ridiculous<00:03:09.090> we<00:03:10.090> go<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.420> comments<00:03:10.840> we<00:03:10.959> see
