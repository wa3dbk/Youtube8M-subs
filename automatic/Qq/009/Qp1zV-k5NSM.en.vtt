he had to go to an outside agency which
was<00:01:04.799> staple<00:01:05.610> design<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.180> had<00:01:06.270> been

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
was staple design because we had been

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.859 
was staple design because we had been
doing<00:01:06.570> work<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:06.960> him<00:01:07.080> before<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:09.450> again<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
doing work with him before so again to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.240 
doing work with him before so again to
your<00:01:09.990> point<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.619> difference<00:01:10.770> between<00:01:11.070> a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
your point the difference between a

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.840 
your point the difference between a
company<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.939> born<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.260> DNA<00:01:13.850> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
company that is born out of that DNA of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.880 
company that is born out of that DNA of
sustainability<00:01:15.600> versus<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> company<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> has

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
sustainability versus a company that has

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.280 
sustainability versus a company that has
made<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:18.060> their<00:01:18.210> fruits<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
made all of their fruits on that on the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.469 
made all of their fruits on that on the
opposite<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.520> having<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> change<00:01:21.119> gears

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
opposite and then having to change gears

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
opposite and then having to change gears
is<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.900> very<00:01:22.170> different<00:01:22.619> paradigm<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.220> work

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
is a very different paradigm to work

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
is a very different paradigm to work
with<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.630> were

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
with we really were

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.350 
with we really were
renegades<00:01:26.220> within<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> company<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.210> had

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
renegades within that company and we had

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.050 
renegades within that company and we had
to<00:01:27.479> slowly<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.740> person<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.280> time<00:01:29.310> change

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to slowly one person at a time change

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.740 
to slowly one person at a time change
people's<00:01:30.450> opinions<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.600> we

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
people's opinions on what it was so we

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.490 
people's opinions on what it was so we
developed<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> shoe<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:36.140> these<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.259> sort<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
developed the shoe and these are sort of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.929 
developed the shoe and these are sort of
some<00:01:37.680> early<00:01:37.950> renderings<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.549> sketches<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
some early renderings and sketches that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
some early renderings and sketches that
we<00:01:39.210> were<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.509> kind<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.900> playing<00:01:39.960> around<00:01:40.290> with

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
we were just kind of playing around with

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.090 
we were just kind of playing around with
the<00:01:40.560> idea<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:42.140> what<00:01:43.140> does<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.409> shoe<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the idea of what does this shoe have to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.490 
the idea of what does this shoe have to
do<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> checkpoints<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:46.020> will

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
do what are the checkpoints that will

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.760 
do what are the checkpoints that will
allow<00:01:47.399> us<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.670> call<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> shoe<00:01:48.770> environmentally

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
allow us to call a shoe environmentally

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.280 
allow us to call a shoe environmentally
sustainable<00:01:50.600> what<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> rules<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.259> are

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
sustainable what are the rules what are

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
sustainable what are the rules what are
the<00:01:52.380> guidelines<00:01:52.649> what<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> packaging

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the guidelines what is the packaging
