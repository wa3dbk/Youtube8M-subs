00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
one of my Lego Research Institute models

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.270 
one of my Lego Research Institute models
you<00:00:12.900> might<00:00:13.049> know<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> last<00:00:13.440> time<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.980> made<00:00:14.130> the

you might know the last time we made the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.730 
you might know the last time we made the
paleontologists<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.509> her<00:00:15.660> t-rex<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.560> she

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
paleontologists with her t-rex and she

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.980 
paleontologists with her t-rex and she
is<00:00:16.980> super<00:00:17.640> awesome<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.390> says<00:00:18.570> I've<00:00:18.690> lost<00:00:18.810> her

bone<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.670> today<00:00:20.970> we're<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.810> make<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
bone so today we're going to make the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.019 
bone so today we're going to make the
Austral<00:00:22.830> number<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.519> because<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
Austral number and because it's got the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.550 
Austral number and because it's got the
star<00:00:24.240> chart<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.660> seemed<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.350> good

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
star chart it seemed like a really good

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.950 
star chart it seemed like a really good
opportunity<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.340> talk<00:00:26.519> about<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.000> lady<00:00:27.480> called

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.130 
interest in astronomy and her mother
suggested<00:01:29.340> she<00:01:30.000> went<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> place<00:01:30.900> at

Wellesley College in Massachusetts which
was<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> top<00:01:34.439> academic<00:01:34.740> schools<00:01:35.400> for

was one of the top academic schools for
women<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> u.s.<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.079> time<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.710> now

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
women in the u.s. at the time we now

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.719 
women in the u.s. at the time we now
need<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.400> make<00:01:38.939> our<00:01:39.810> patchwork<00:01:40.380> floor<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.219 
need to make our patchwork floor and I
guess<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.299> should<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.600> quite<00:01:43.049> easy

southern hemisphere stars and she did

southern hemisphere stars and she did
this<00:05:29.729> by<00:05:29.940> dividing<00:05:30.240> them<00:05:30.509> into<00:05:30.840> their

you've got OB AFGE KN and she remembered
these<00:05:41.729> by<00:05:42.089> the<00:05:42.150> words<00:05:42.389> o<00:05:42.569> be<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.080> fine<00:05:43.379> girl<00:05:43.740> kiss

these by the words o be a fine girl kiss
me<00:05:44.699> right<00:05:45.419> so<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:45.719> don't<00:05:46.020> think<00:05:46.349> we<00:05:46.500> want<00:05:46.770> a

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
me right so I don't think we want a

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.649 
me right so I don't think we want a
little<00:05:47.129> plunger<00:05:47.759> I<00:05:47.909> don't<00:05:48.240> think<00:05:48.479> that's

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
little plunger I don't think that's

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:49.879 
little plunger I don't think that's
quite<00:05:48.839> right<00:05:48.960> so<00:05:49.379> we<00:05:49.440> need<00:05:49.560> to<00:05:49.650> create

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
quite right so we need to create

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:50.869 
quite right so we need to create
something<00:05:50.069> to<00:05:50.279> go<00:05:50.400> on<00:05:50.520> top

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
something to go on top
