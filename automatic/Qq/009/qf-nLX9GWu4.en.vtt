00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello well is not how do I do 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.309
 am happy to meet you for a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.780
 new recipe 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.940
 today we are going to realize 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 together a cake that everyone 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.430
 know I want to talk about the biscuit of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.020
 savoy 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.330
 you'll see it's very simple to 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.269
 realize and his superb accompanied 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.920
 a small cream or jam and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.330
 it's really like I say it very 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.009
 simple go I explain all that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.219
 now 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.050
 the first step is to separate the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.270
 yellow whites 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.160
 it's not complicated for everyone 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.450
 the world knows how to do that in case I have 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 a video that explains how 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.600
 do we go add in the whites of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.670
 a little bit of salt is really 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.770
 very little a tiny handle just 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.940
 to be a little bit firmer 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.609
 here and go for the editing is 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.609
 dead we want very firm 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.390
 the whites are well mounted we will 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 put a little bit aside then 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.280
 normally the time that the whites 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 goes up you prepare the sugar yolks and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.490
 flour 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.740
 I had the idea to do for 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.830
 not that we hear the sound of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.070
 drummer so we just take the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.910
 egg yolks we take the sugar and we 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 going to come 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.740
 whip the whole I know that 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 this bleach then you go 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.030
 see at the beginning it's a little bit 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.830
 complicated I mean like we do not want 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.470
 immediately mix perfectly 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.479
 it's a little bit compact and you see 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.290
 once sugar is integrated into 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.550
 eggs then rub her with the ehome 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.869
 money for a minute or two 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.750
 sailboats it's already starting to wind scheer 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.729
 you really have to be well laundered 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.380
 you see that completely changed from 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.890
 color it took barely two minutes 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.850
 stirring properly we will take 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.479
 Now the flour and the will 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:15.980
 mix in two times then the same one there 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:23.190
 go smoothly so 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.530
 incorporate it together the biscuit of 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.299
 Savoy it's really a cake is very 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.220
 simple to do 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.930
 when we had invited at the last minute 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.360
 we do not know what to do 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.000
 you make a little guy to know everything 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.989
 the world values atg it's me the cetc 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.459
 sweet with valves 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.709
 it's really a bass network all 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.130
 model accompanied by a small 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:49.799
 small cream jams 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:52.070
 So here is the woman of flour and 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.989
 mixtures as I just did 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.850
 last step is just before doing 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.880
 this step you preheat your oven 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.900
 at 180 Â° to take the blanks that 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.060
 went up and we'll go slowly to at 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.330
 honey in several times and we will become 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.910
 integrate them quietly with a 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.130
 a maryse a wooden spoon 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:21.360
 fatally if the kanari's and you 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:24.250
 see we just integrate the dough to white 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.300
 we go down we make sure not to 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.250
 too much to make them fall back into taxes 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.440
 report quietly and in fact this 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.720
 operation decline more in your dish on 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.870
 resume it again and thus killed 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.940
 until it's empty 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.970
 you will see at the beginning when we put 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.530
 the first the first spoon of 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.410
 white it's a little bit complicated to 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.020
 mix and there will be more white 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.820
 integrated and the more you see there it becomes 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.070
 more and more easy to integrate into 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.580
 anyway I'm tired of going to the 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.560
 to integrate 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:03.670
 see it takes a little while 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:07.270
 but frankly we do not tire so 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.950
 there I come to my last step in 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.739
 is almost there and that's it 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.359
 left for a ride 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:23.380
 personally I chose a mold 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:25.060
 will have to sponge or turn you have a but 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.700
 obviously you can very well put 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.130
 your knowledge in a hamlet the color 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.470
 for example to give it a shape or 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.040
 any other mold that will come to you 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.930
 the idea and whenever you want 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.610
 nothing if you put them in small 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.030
 mussels is buying to flee to a little bit 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.970
 faster 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.060
 beware of cooking so obviously 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.440
 we butter perfectly the mold which 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.440
 they are and simply 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.680
 we just put our preparation to 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.860
 inside it may inflate a 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.790
 a bit 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.419
 so even if it's not totally 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.140
 filled it does not matter 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.140
 see he's half 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:17.680
 it's a cake for about 8 people 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.810
 this is the oven must be hot to 180 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.380
 degrees it's gone for about 30 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.880
 minutes of cooking 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.919
 if to find out if these wells like 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.380
 usually one rather soaks in so 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.880
 the sooner spring sex effect this one 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.440
 still spring with dough 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.990
 it was not since then cooking is 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.789
 completed you see well it's 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.650
 still a little hot I cut 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:46.169
 in small pieces to show you to 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:48.180
 how soft and above all 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.570
 well good tender finally short it's 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.490
 really a really a super cake 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.870
 for the decor because it's true that 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.940
 it's a little dull on the ass 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.289
 so you can very well put a 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.120
 little chocolate mousse seems so 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.560
 hard funds it would work very well or 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.289
 then a little icing sugar 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.479
 I'm going to do it then I show you 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.130
 just a little bit i cut i'm going 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.150
 do the whole thing and I put you back into play 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.759
 the hangman moss thirty minutes ago 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.590
 after I took out my oven cake game 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.150
 let cool a little bit I 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.009
 advise you to have it cool on 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.870
 a grid leaving a little bit 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.080
 of air pass below so that 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.630
 that the cake's moisture is not going 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.210
 come back in the cake you see from 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.590
 so that they are very fluffy 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.560
 but who is still a small side 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.180
 crispy on the short cake I is 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.280
 cut into small pieces story of 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.169
 to show you how much the interior and 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.740
 soft and we only have one desire 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:45.270
 it's rubbing in so well 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.940
 obviously maugis me icing sugar 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.580
 top for to decorate but 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:54.030
 you can very well put a little 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.520
 chocolate layer or anything else 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.759
 that goes through your head is the same 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.830
 for indoors or for creams 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.080
 all kinds of jams that you 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.800
 can put with it's really a 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.349
 simple cake within reach of all and there 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.789
 will be loved by any filmed so do not hesitate 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:15.349
 do not run 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.349
 see you soon on how do we do
