00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.090 
hair our next step in recreating the
look<00:01:56.509> would<00:01:56.750> be<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:56.990> do<00:01:57.080> a<00:01:57.110> French<00:01:57.560> braid<00:01:57.830> if

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
look would be to do a French braid if

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.889 
look would be to do a French braid if
you've<00:01:58.610> never<00:01:58.759> done<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.060> French<00:01:59.360> braid<00:01:59.539> before

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
you've never done a French braid before

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.300 
you've never done a French braid before
just<00:02:00.140> watch<00:02:00.380> closely<00:02:00.709> and<00:02:01.039> I'll<00:02:01.100> try<00:02:01.250> to

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
just watch closely and I'll try to

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.499 
just watch closely and I'll try to
explain<00:02:01.459> as<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:02.000> go<00:02:02.030> along

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
explain as I go along

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.260 
explain as I go along
but<00:02:03.319> basically<00:02:03.530> what<00:02:03.979> you're<00:02:04.130> going<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.369> do<00:02:04.610> is

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
but basically what you're going to do is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.510 
but basically what you're going to do is
start<00:02:05.600> right<00:02:05.840> here<00:02:06.380> where<00:02:06.800> your<00:02:06.920> bangs<00:02:07.160> part

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
start right here where your bangs part

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.440 
start right here where your bangs part
and<00:02:08.110> you're<00:02:09.110> going<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.289> break<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.679> up<00:02:09.830> into

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
and you're going to break it up into

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.570 
and you're going to break it up into
three<00:02:11.450> pieces<00:02:11.630> just<00:02:12.050> like<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.290> normal<00:02:12.860> braid

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.520 

alright<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.880> have<00:02:17.000> three<00:02:17.209> pieces<00:02:17.420> one<00:02:18.020> two

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
alright so you have three pieces one two

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.890 
alright so you have three pieces one two
three<00:02:19.099> you're<00:02:19.910> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.120> cross<00:02:20.360> over<00:02:20.599> like

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
three you're going to cross over like

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.510 
three you're going to cross over like
you<00:02:21.020> would<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> normal<00:02:21.260> braid<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.160> take<00:02:22.370> this

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
you would a normal braid so take this

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.910 
you would a normal braid so take this
outer<00:02:22.790> piece<00:02:23.090> right<00:02:23.270> here<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.750> go<00:02:24.500> over<00:02:24.800> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
outer piece right here and go over the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.699 
outer piece right here and go over the
center<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.510> now<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.690> right<00:02:26.990> piece<00:02:27.230> has<00:02:27.410> become

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
center so now the right piece has become

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.980 
center so now the right piece has become
the<00:02:27.830> new<00:02:27.950> middle<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.510> you're<00:02:29.510> going<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.780> do

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the new middle and you're going to do

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.270 
the new middle and you're going to do
the<00:02:30.110> same<00:02:30.260> with<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> left<00:02:30.709> piece<00:02:31.010> it's<00:02:31.220> going

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
the same with the left piece it's going

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.850 
the same with the left piece it's going
to<00:02:31.400> cross<00:02:31.640> over<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.060> middle<00:02:32.410> always<00:02:33.410> do<00:02:33.590> one

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
to cross over the middle always do one

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.680 
to cross over the middle always do one
normal<00:02:34.310> braid<00:02:34.520> before<00:02:34.849> I<00:02:34.880> go<00:02:35.120> into<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.480> French

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
normal braid before I go into the French

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.569 
normal braid before I go into the French
braid<00:02:35.930> alright<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.010> now<00:02:37.129> that<00:02:37.159> you<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.489> your

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
braid alright so now that you have your

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.699 
braid alright so now that you have your
normal<00:02:37.909> braid<00:02:38.090> done<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.110> where<00:02:39.319> you<00:02:39.590> can

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
normal braid done this is where you can

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.530 
normal braid done this is where you can
start<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.159> French<00:02:40.370> braid<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.849> when<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.390> do<00:02:41.510> a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
start the French braid and when you do a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.430 
start the French braid and when you do a
French<00:02:41.840> braid<00:02:42.049> it's

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
French braid it's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.770 
French braid it's
basically<00:02:42.800> just<00:02:43.220> taking<00:02:43.760> pieces<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.450> adding

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
basically just taking pieces and adding

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.050 
basically just taking pieces and adding
them<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.140> outside<00:02:45.560> piece<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.700> part

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
them to the outside piece so this part

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.270 
them to the outside piece so this part
right<00:02:47.240> here<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:48.110> outside<00:02:48.470> piece<00:02:48.710> you're

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
right here the outside piece you're

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.770 
right here the outside piece you're
going<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.460> pick<00:02:49.610> up<00:02:49.760> hair<00:02:49.940> that's<00:02:50.270> not<00:02:50.570> in<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
going to pick up hair that's not in the

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.400 
going to pick up hair that's not in the
braid<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.520> add<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> outside<00:02:53.030> piece<00:02:53.420> so

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
braid and add it to the outside piece so

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.530 
braid and add it to the outside piece so
you<00:02:54.710> can<00:02:55.010> see<00:02:55.160> where<00:02:55.310> my<00:02:55.490> piece<00:02:55.880> was<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
you can see where my piece was in the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.600 
you can see where my piece was in the
braid<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.080> I've<00:02:57.500> picked<00:02:57.710> up<00:02:57.860> from<00:02:57.920> my<00:02:58.340> scalp

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
braid and I've picked up from my scalp

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.730 
braid and I've picked up from my scalp
right<00:02:58.820> here<00:02:59.090> then<00:02:59.990> you're<00:03:00.110> going<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.290> cross<00:03:00.530> it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
right here then you're going to cross it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.050 
right here then you're going to cross it
over<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.220> center<00:03:01.490> like<00:03:01.670> when<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:01.880> did<00:03:02.030> a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
over to the center like when you did a

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.890 
over to the center like when you did a
normal<00:03:02.450> braid<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:05.300> outside<00:03:05.510> piece

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
normal braid and on this outside piece

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.720 
normal braid and on this outside piece
on<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.170> left<00:03:06.410> you're<00:03:07.010> going<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.220> pick<00:03:07.400> up<00:03:07.430> hair

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
on the left you're going to pick up hair

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.960 
on the left you're going to pick up hair
from<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.120> scalp<00:03:08.240> as<00:03:08.540> well<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:09.790> then<00:03:10.790> you're

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
from the scalp as well and then you're

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.510 
from the scalp as well and then you're
going<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.150> cross<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.630> over<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.900> middle<00:03:12.520> so

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
going to cross it over the middle so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.130 
going to cross it over the middle so
it's<00:03:13.700> essentially<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.480> regular<00:03:14.870> braid

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
it's essentially just a regular braid

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.380 
it's essentially just a regular braid
you're<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.530> adding<00:03:15.770> in<00:03:16.010> pieces<00:03:16.490> I<00:03:16.700> know<00:03:17.090> when

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
you're just adding in pieces I know when

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.820 
you're just adding in pieces I know when
I<00:03:17.420> was<00:03:17.720> trying<00:03:17.990> to<00:03:18.200> learn<00:03:18.290> how<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.500> French

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
I was trying to learn how to French

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.530 
I was trying to learn how to French
braid<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.340> had<00:03:19.640> always<00:03:19.760> heard<00:03:20.000> it's<00:03:20.210> braiding

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
braid I had always heard it's braiding

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.510 
braid I had always heard it's braiding
with<00:03:20.600> four<00:03:20.840> pieces<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.440> honestly<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.100> would

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
with four pieces and honestly I would

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.980 
with four pieces and honestly I would
not<00:03:22.700> ever<00:03:22.910> describe<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.690> way<00:03:23.810> it's

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
not ever describe it that way it's

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.390 
not ever describe it that way it's
braiding<00:03:24.350> with<00:03:24.440> three<00:03:24.770> you're<00:03:25.010> just<00:03:25.160> adding

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
braiding with three you're just adding

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.620 
braiding with three you're just adding
in<00:03:25.700> more<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:27.080> the<00:03:27.290> three<00:03:28.000> all<00:03:29.000> right<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.420> again

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
in more to the three all right so again

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.480 
in more to the three all right so again
you're<00:03:30.110> back<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.500> where<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.770> were<00:03:30.920> you're

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
you're back to where you were you're

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.650 
you're back to where you were you're
going<00:03:31.520> to<00:03:31.670> pick<00:03:31.820> up<00:03:31.910> more<00:03:32.090> hair<00:03:32.360> from<00:03:32.390> the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
going to pick up more hair from the
