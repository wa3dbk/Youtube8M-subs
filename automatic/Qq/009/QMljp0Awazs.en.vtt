00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.160
 Simple for you to see that we can not 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.199
 You can make a good makeup cool 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.439
 per day in the summer season that white 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.510
 It is well remembering the reveillon Brazil 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.969

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.000
 It's very very simple, I hope you 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.000
 like and have the tutorial 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.620
 so let's start applying good 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.289
 Concealer on eyelid is cool to take 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.379
 a collective because it equals the gift of 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:06.900
 palm tree and helps a lot to fix the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:10.830
 shadows then give the potatoes with the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.350
 and now I'm going to pass as I 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.320
 I do not have the game so I'll spend the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.320
 beige pencil contains tape to help 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 to potentiate the white you know it is 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.650
 It's very difficult to have a white person remembering 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 the same then use a pencil so help 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.560
 to enhance the white color 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.260
 now I'm going to apply a white shadow that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.880
 I have a little bit of cookie and a 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.040
 overalls with the field with a shadow 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.119

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.210

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.869
 More black color is brown or even there 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.330
 you see how it looks 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.000
 I'm going to blow a lot of shade 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.640
 led through the inner corner of the eye 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.190
 eyelid and I was smoking a lot and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.350

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.970
 color from below 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.910
 now I'm just a white pigment to give 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.100
 a nice shine here in the camera 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:28.750
 You can not see any more, you want an understanding. 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:31.130
 It shines very well, it's very cool, it's fine. 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.459
 very sparkling 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.580
 now I'll go over to remove the pigment 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.250

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.410

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.890
 Why do you support in the eye and with 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.019

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.840

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.729
 that collective in v 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.270
 It's good to clear enough to look at 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:54.900
 take any shade you left behind 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.289
 there in the right part of the goalkeepers 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.229

 A little surprised the punishment is over. 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.100

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.740
 brightness to the passage of the american way 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.199

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.490
 corrective to take this pink 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.550
 my mouth because I have a good car 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.620
 pink and I'll spend that bright time it 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.810
 gets super cool with makeup and combines 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.180
 it's discreet but for those girls 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.340
 who want to highlight a little more 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.830
 It would look cool with one more color 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.460
 orange out of the video comes out red but 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.010
