using<00:00:13.769> gun<00:00:14.040> two<00:00:14.160> markers<00:00:15.139> so<00:00:16.139> let's<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
using gun two markers so let's have a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.269 
using gun two markers so let's have a
look<00:00:17.070> at<00:00:17.279> these<00:00:17.430> parts<00:00:20.600> so<00:00:21.600> first<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
look at these parts so first we have the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.759 
look at these parts so first we have the
chest<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> G<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.109> drive<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.410> gonna<00:00:28.560> go

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
chest so the G and drive is gonna go

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.150 
chest so the G and drive is gonna go
inside<00:00:29.130> here<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.840> really<00:00:31.380> good<00:00:31.529> movements<00:00:32.040> on

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
inside here and really good movements on

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.540 
inside here and really good movements on
this<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:33.210> move<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> side<00:00:35.130> like

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
this so you can move it to the side like

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.600 
this so you can move it to the side like
that<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:38.690> also<00:00:39.860> when<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.950> move<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> arms

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that and also when you move the arms

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.139 
that and also when you move the arms
part<00:00:42.000> around<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.719> chest<00:00:43.530> part<00:00:43.739> moves<00:00:44.149> out

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
part around the chest part moves out

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.590 
part around the chest part moves out
with<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.520> fixed<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
with it so it's not just fixed as it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
with it so it's not just fixed as it
usually<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.860> other<00:00:50.039> models<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
usually is with other models so as you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.049 
usually is with other models so as you
can<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.270> kind<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.480> opens<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:53.059> if

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can see it kind of opens up and if

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.729 
can see it kind of opens up and if
you're<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> be<00:00:54.809> using<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.579> LED<00:00:56.600> unit

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
you're going to be using the LED unit

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.069 
you're going to be using the LED unit
for<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> GN<00:00:59.129> drives<00:00:59.489> don't<00:01:00.449> put<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.870> sticker

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
for the GN drives don't put the sticker

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.570 
for the GN drives don't put the sticker
on<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> inside<00:01:02.460> over<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.580> probably

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
on in the inside over here so I probably

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.210 
on in the inside over here so I probably
will<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> didn't<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> stick<00:01:06.960> her<00:01:07.080> in

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
will so I didn't have to stick her in

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.710 
will so I didn't have to stick her in

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.980 

and<00:01:48.280> at<00:01:48.549> first<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.180> just<00:01:51.270> painted<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.390> eyes<00:01:52.540> in

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
and at first I just painted the eyes in

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.830 
and at first I just painted the eyes in
black<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.850> background<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.450> then<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:55.630> used

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
black for the background and then I used

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.490 
black for the background and then I used
the<00:01:55.990> metallic<00:01:56.920> green<00:01:57.840> marker<00:01:58.840> for<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> eyes

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
the metallic green marker for the eyes

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.219 
the metallic green marker for the eyes
but<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.490> comes<00:02:00.640> out<00:02:00.790> really<00:02:01.030> dark<00:02:01.270> so<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:01.810> ended

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
but it comes out really dark so I ended

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.930 
but it comes out really dark so I ended
up<00:02:02.380> using<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.680> stickers<00:02:03.159> for<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.369> eyes<00:02:03.580> and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
up using the stickers for the eyes and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.300 
up using the stickers for the eyes and
what's<00:02:04.750> nice<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.470> this<00:02:05.950> time<00:02:06.190> they<00:02:06.880> have<00:02:07.060> both

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
what's nice is this time they have both

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.630 
what's nice is this time they have both
let's<00:02:09.310> see<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:11.319> sticker<00:02:11.590> right<00:02:11.830> here<00:02:12.190> which

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
let's see this sticker right here which

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.430 
let's see this sticker right here which
includes<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.239> black<00:02:13.569> background<00:02:13.870> they<00:02:14.319> also

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
have horns over here for just the eyes

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.600 
have horns over here for just the eyes
so<00:02:17.380> before<00:02:17.680> if<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:17.830> wanted<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.190> eyes<00:02:18.340> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
so before if you wanted the eyes you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.370 
so before if you wanted the eyes you
would<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.000> cut<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.239> out<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.690> one<00:02:19.989> so

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
would have to cut it out of this one so

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.500 
would have to cut it out of this one so
that<00:02:20.709> was<00:02:20.830> kind<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.100> nicely<00:02:21.390> put<00:02:22.390> them

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.440 
here's the left arm so as usual you have
two<00:02:37.360> three<00:02:38.160> fingers<00:02:39.160> together<00:02:39.450> trigger

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
two three fingers together trigger

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:49.949 
two three fingers together trigger
finger<00:02:40.959> by<00:02:41.860> itself<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.640> thumb

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.890 

and<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.159> is<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:52.200> GN<00:02:53.200> Drive<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.780> has

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
and then this is the GN Drive so it has

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.929 
and then this is the GN Drive so it has
room<00:02:56.200> for<00:02:56.230> two<00:02:57.750> LED<00:02:58.750> units<00:02:59.109> inside<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.340> then

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
room for two LED units inside and then

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.720 
room for two LED units inside and then
if<00:03:01.329> you<00:03:01.480> have<00:03:01.599> them<00:03:01.719> inside<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:02.730> do

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
if you have them inside and you just do

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.330 
if you have them inside and you just do
like<00:03:03.879> that<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.329> turn<00:03:04.510> them<00:03:04.689> on<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.870> guess<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.280> I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
like that to turn them on I guess so I

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.160 
like that to turn them on I guess so I
don't<00:03:06.549> have<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.909> LEDs<00:03:07.359> yet<00:03:07.689> so<00:03:08.109> not<00:03:08.560> using<00:03:10.170> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
don't have the LEDs yet so not using and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.009 
don't have the LEDs yet so not using and
also<00:03:11.769> for<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.969> one<00:03:13.030> there's<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.659> sticker<00:03:13.900> on

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
also for this one there's a sticker on

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.080 
also for this one there's a sticker on
the<00:03:14.109> inside<00:03:14.590> but<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.609> uses<00:03:15.849> different

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
the inside but it uses different

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.259 
the inside but it uses different
stickers<00:03:16.659> if<00:03:16.959> you're<00:03:17.489> using<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.700> LED<00:03:18.909> and<00:03:19.209> if

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
stickers if you're using the LED and if

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.879 
stickers if you're using the LED and if
you're<00:03:19.420> not<00:03:19.569> using<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.989> LED<00:03:20.109> if<00:03:20.439> you're<00:03:20.620> not

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
you're not using the LED if you're not

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.710 
you're not using the LED if you're not
using<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.280> LED<00:03:21.400> then<00:03:21.819> it's<00:03:21.939> a<00:03:22.090> solid<00:03:22.450> sticker

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
using the LED then it's a solid sticker

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.289 
using the LED then it's a solid sticker
and<00:03:23.019> if<00:03:23.859> you're<00:03:24.099> are<00:03:24.340> gonna<00:03:24.609> use<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.939> LED<00:03:25.180> that

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
and if you're are gonna use the LED that

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.429 
and if you're are gonna use the LED that
it's<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:26.079> more<00:03:26.530> transparent<00:03:27.159> one<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:29.290> is

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439 
it's a more transparent one so this is

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.670 
it's a more transparent one so this is
