well<00:00:14.770> we're<00:00:14.890> at<00:00:14.980> the<00:00:15.040> end<00:00:15.340> of<00:00:15.490> March<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:16.000> I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
well we're at the end of March and I

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.890 
well we're at the end of March and I
brought<00:00:16.960> these<00:00:17.380> fish<00:00:18.369> out<00:00:18.520> my<00:00:18.880> tilapia<00:00:19.360> with

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
brought these fish out my tilapia with

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.609 
brought these fish out my tilapia with
this<00:00:20.110> aquarium<00:00:21.900> cleaned<00:00:22.900> it<00:00:23.020> up<00:00:23.110> a<00:00:23.200> little<00:00:23.410> bit

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
this aquarium cleaned it up a little bit

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.900 
this aquarium cleaned it up a little bit
and<00:00:26.040> brought<00:00:27.040> it<00:00:27.130> outside<00:00:27.279> and<00:00:27.580> found<00:00:27.640> out<00:00:27.820> the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
and brought it outside and found out the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.940 
and brought it outside and found out the
temperature<00:00:28.270> was<00:00:28.390> way<00:00:29.080> too<00:00:29.290> cold<00:00:29.590> so

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
temperature was way too cold so

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.710 
temperature was way too cold so
everybody<00:00:30.670> he<00:00:30.820> put<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.060> heater<00:00:31.240> in<00:00:31.449> and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
everybody he put the heater in and

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.170 
everybody he put the heater in and
wrapped<00:00:32.320> it<00:00:32.500> up<00:00:32.710> and<00:00:32.980> now<00:00:33.489> things<00:00:33.790> seem<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.059> be

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
wrapped it up and now things seem to be

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.869 
wrapped it up and now things seem to be
warming<00:00:34.570> up<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.710> added<00:00:36.550> a<00:00:36.750> funnel<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
warming up but I added a funnel and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.490 
warming up but I added a funnel and
waters<00:00:42.879> been<00:00:43.059> spinning<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:46.960> tank

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500

waters been spinning into the tank
ever<00:00:48.430> since<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.790> added<00:00:49.470> some<00:00:50.470> nutrients<00:00:51.070> some

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
ever since I added some nutrients some

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.399 
ever since I added some nutrients some
liquid<00:00:51.760> nutrients<00:00:52.180> from<00:00:52.360> this<00:00:52.799> setup<00:00:58.409> which

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
liquid nutrients from this setup which

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.189 
liquid nutrients from this setup which
AGC<00:00:59.949> also<00:01:00.280> has<00:01:00.430> a<00:01:00.460> funnel<00:01:00.820> but<00:01:01.659> that's<00:01:01.839> really

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
AGC also has a funnel but that's really

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.609 
AGC also has a funnel but that's really

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
is the end of it so we're going to be

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
this dramatic maybe it's the sign maybe

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.680 
this dramatic maybe it's the sign maybe
it's<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.800> outdoors<00:03:15.720> who<00:03:16.720> knows<00:03:16.930> but<00:03:17.350> it's

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
are spending a lot of time playing in

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.229 
are spending a lot of time playing in
those<00:03:22.750> levels<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:26.400> they<00:03:27.400> know<00:03:27.580> best<00:03:27.820> this<00:03:28.060> is

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
those levels so they know best this is

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.259 
those levels so they know best this is
River<00:03:28.450> like<00:03:28.690> water<00:03:28.959> we're<00:03:29.230> creating<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:30.540> and

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
River like water we're creating and and

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.840 
River like water we're creating and and
it<00:03:34.440> must<00:03:35.440> feel<00:03:35.590> good<00:03:35.890> it's<00:03:36.280> feel<00:03:36.459> good<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.730> be<00:03:36.760> a
