thing<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> always<00:01:07.229> recommend<00:01:07.590> doing

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
thing that I always recommend doing

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.160 
thing that I always recommend doing
because<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:08.970> easy<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> come<00:01:09.659> by<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
because it's really easy to come by and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.760 
because it's really easy to come by and
I<00:01:10.680> find<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.700> definitely<00:01:12.180> helps<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.770> washing

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I find it definitely helps is washing

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.910 
I find it definitely helps is washing
your<00:01:13.920> hair<00:01:14.220> once<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.299> twice<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.570> week<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.650> dish

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
your hair once or twice a week with dish

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.580 
your hair once or twice a week with dish
soap<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.820> brand<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> stick<00:01:19.409> with

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
soap so brand that I like to stick with

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.640 
soap so brand that I like to stick with
is<00:01:19.740> dawn<00:01:20.150> simply<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> cuts

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
is dawn simply because like it cuts

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.560 
is dawn simply because like it cuts
grease<00:01:23.040> really<00:01:23.400> well<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.939> has<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.299> power

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
grease really well and it has like power

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.179 
grease really well and it has like power
scrubbers<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.080> stuff<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> feel<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:25.950> it's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
scrubbers and stuff so I feel like it's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.390 
scrubbers and stuff so I feel like it's
a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.430> bit<00:01:26.640> stronger<00:01:27.030> than<00:01:27.450> like

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
a little bit stronger than like

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.429 
a little bit stronger than like
something<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.520> Palmolive<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.420> something<00:01:30.810> if

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
something like Palmolive or something if

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.350 
something like Palmolive or something if
like<00:01:31.619> moisturizing<00:01:32.280> tough<00:01:32.610> because<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.119> want

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
like moisturizing tough because we want

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.840 
like moisturizing tough because we want
it<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.689> really<00:01:34.290> scrub<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.130> stain<00:01:35.549> off

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it to just really scrub that stain off

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.280 
it to just really scrub that stain off
your<00:01:36.360> hair<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.729> won't<00:01:38.909> necessarily

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
your hair now this won't necessarily

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.420

remove all the hair color but it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.149 
remove all the hair color but it
definitely<00:01:41.610> helps<00:01:42.150> feed<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> lot<00:01:42.930> faster

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159
