00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.190
 Oliver Bierhoff, the team manager of the German team, would like to welcome you 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.080
 first time 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.050
 What does that mean in concrete terms these venues for the German team? 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.240
 It is hard to travel on one side twice, two cities are in the city 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.889
 south 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.279
 but the empty stadiums are all written relatively large 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.460
 we all are a little bit of everyone Â»said Kim is coming here are glad that before 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.109
 All in all a Boc spear was very near Pretoria and therefore in 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.060
 staying at our hotel can have a short journey 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.199
 A little third game that will also be crucial 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.440
 to believe in the other but it is also good if you are in South Africa for so long 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.280
 That was always a good deal for the players 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.690
 To have a change of knowing now it starts it can be a change 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 out of necessity and that's why I'm at Inter 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.090
 satisfied with the group draw now you always have to take it as it comes 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.820
 he told him that, of course, it is also for the teams to play against them 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.229
 become 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.329
 Joachim LÃ¶w had called the group just interesting and me 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.819
 Try to read the text of the text a bit 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:57.120
 enthusiasm 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.320
 satisfied or do you want a schnapps 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.780
 Mohamad already baptized, of course, percent as opposed to his opponents No not 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.800
 got as she found kingdom or even Ivory Coast 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.570
 that could have killed but openly Serbs with Australians 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.080
 around and Dale and Inga's name really also strong-fighting teams there if you can 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.110
 physically challenged they all know teams in their teams 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.130
 So groups have become most popular so have played there very confidently 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.490
 Underwear demanded everything from us if there were already groups 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.940
 at World Championships "We may only look at these opponents for a short time 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.320
 Maybe with the beginning of Serbia 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.920
 heaviest opponent of the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.240
 a group 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.820
 with percent former and still active Bundesliga players do not let 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.520
 for the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.320
 Pictures now here the live play a flank of Feltscher increased 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.760
 hertha players or current data is fed 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.920
 Everyone loves each other as the animals found two students and beginners 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.430
 fishing 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.800
 I'm really technically very strong very good football 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510
 all participants were left 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.360
 15 50h 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.960
 for the five percent to come that the previous version they know many of 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.719
 but they also know the players 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:09.820
 yes it is always 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.970
 hurry for me are not so good because of course, with fasting 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.710
 Double motivation still play just the players in Germany 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.069
 Play duration 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.090
 but that is normal of course want to show the German audience and 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.250
 then the national pride still comes to m the rather lousy team 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.290
 much easier 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.589
 yes, if that is not only by difficulty and maybe Kerner 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:30.900
 who from Africa and the close season 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.129
 this team just a little bit closer to Herrmann found this Sharks 1 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.029
 4 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.269
 In the spring, Daimler wants to explain itself fully 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.090
 if they are against the wm qualifiers and once again the Black Stars 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.719
 the jump to South Africa only by the better goal difference over the 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.059
 Vogue 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:50.019
 from Volkmar 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.319
 at all for the second time after 2006 as they wins against Czech Republic USA until 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.819
 moved into the second round 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.329
 Michaela Kessler 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.099
 Ballack's teammate at Chelsea 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.309
 and Stephen Appiah of Doha 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.589
 it is still their support 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.719
 and guarantors for soccer-aesthetes of a special kind 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.099
 on that place 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.099
 and the contract, for example 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.379
 The knockout stages against Brazil three years ago, thrilling and far 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.049
 Closer than it only expresses in numbers by ze Roberto in numbers 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.310
 arrived there in the workforce of world football 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.239
 maybe the future belongs to the West Africans 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.439
 The wm-gold 2009 with the u 20 on penalties in the final against 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.909
 Brazil 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.909
 as an indication of that 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.779
 The times have long since passed as the black stars around the then FDA 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:00.719
 have the PEH life single game against Germany it was the first goal 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.539
 shot 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:04.099
 but also 6 cashed 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.889
 no idea if they are at the core of today's national holiday 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.699
 Bauerntag this the murder charge 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.699
 or something like fire department as well as the return to the wm premiere 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.799
 not excluded though 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.769
 in a few months 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.319
 on a soccer field 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.240
 for cheers 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.960
 That's why in the past time, too, in South Africa you play her 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.020
 because as an African representative also in the home advantage in Unna 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.830
 yes definitely that you only proud and southern Africa the World Cup takes place and 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.430
 uncertain home advantage 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.180
 we all know continent percent is very fierce with us at the beginning 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.490
 Foot breaks player 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.330
 We played with Stephen Appiah ourselves in July but wanted to be 17 years old 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.789
 if I am happy to meet again in their ranks 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.699
 Shire is the coach of Ghana and now it's on the microphone of Dieter Gruschwitz 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:55.690
 meanwhile I know 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.930
 the oil spill I mean in a group with Germany the worry of what 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.749
 go through their heads 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:03.689
 like a rocket 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:08.020
 I did not think about any money for everyone today as the competitor 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.150
 Percent the group overall will not be that easy yet 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.000
 Australia, we play for every guy and what does that mean for them? 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.289
 to be at this World Cup next year 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:19.300
 Rehn 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.120
 at the AStA 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.819
 which are caused by ticks 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.129
 So we have to aim at time periods 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.189
 and spoken very well everywhere 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.459
 but it can never neglect that will be the first 

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.889
 To be an opponent in the preliminary round for the German team 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.889
 the weighty one is now properly come to the tournament 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.180
 Read and Nombre de you can choose that even at the 2006 World Cup 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.490
 unhappy in Italy and through her feet 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.229
 who was not entitled to them have certainly fueled self-confidence and 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.449
 is around him who feel strong too there is in all other players 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.509
 in Germany but plays
