00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.320
 hello, I'm yo 'friend, double z4, impute to 1 4g 0 sorry for not putting the third 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.379
 part of the stories more plextor and curiosities is that things happened to me very 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.049
 rare 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.129
 because I got lazy then I got depression because my videos do not pass 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.439
 the 50 visits but I know that the more videos they put, the more people will be 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.019
 see them xdxd good to the topic for today I had the theme of society more than 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.480
 you only progress to two questions from vic 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.710
 0 231 cimaco de 133 I put two themes more than served to choose how to upload from 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.829
 fast level let's start with how to level up fast 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.020
 according to the forums that he read in most of the users more than the best 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.710
 form is with the pq but they will ask z4 wt 14 g zero which is pq as they are 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.710
 missions in the group of which they put you to kill monsters or make tests 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.770
 of intelligence but the exciting thing is that in the end with the group all together 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.470
 once in a boss but good that you will believe 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.800
 that's the wonder but also the pp 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.900
 it's not perfect look if you're in matheu what the issue is you have that 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.820
 server very few channels and the question is that not so few channels is 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.230
 almost impossible to enter but that has a solution 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.240
 if you know what the name of the kobe leader is, some of the people who entered 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.590
 in the pqd that channel write search for a bar and the name will then come out 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.070
 induction of where they are at what stage and all sun 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.970
 wait for a moment and when they tell you that the rescuer is the most 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.110
 you can and to follow inside only mandata to cullen that is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.240
 there they let you know if you can leave all that you hear simple but now the problem 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.590
 is the northern boy is testing his first pq of his life with your group and not 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.490
 he knows how to square I know nothing or how to kill and it's always typical that they kill 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.740
 the monsters with more than fifteen attacks and t 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.790
 fears like 30 minutes helping him good but to see that I'm not 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.310
 so bad i will tell you all the pqs that i haiti all your information first pq 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.510
 of enersis from level 10 to 200 pq d from 21 to 30 after qb kernel 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.210
 level 21 to 30 after carnival monster from 30 to 50 orbis from 50 to 70 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.229
 then harmony but that has the problem that only 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.489
 you can play if you're married so very few people play it and I also think 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.680
 that this agreement and should be two pairs and this level 70 to 110 and others of which 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.280
 I do not remember the name but this level 110 the 130 of rest you will have to 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.290
 kill on your own or in a group but in the group you will kill monstrous bosses of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.670
 which I will talk about in my next good video I will explain briefly the 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:34.329
 pq is not choosing seeds and putting them in their respective place and if they do not know how 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.990
 I have nothing else to make them explain the scope down to the left the 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.659
 yellow center-left 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.339
 the blue top left 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:45.779
 the green top right the purple center right the pink one down and then 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.329
 you'll have to kill monsters and not let them kill the rabbit 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.049
 in the kern and talk to a woman at the bottom of the pope 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.220
 and she will give you a question of coupon numbers you only carry the 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.709
 answer no more or less than what she says later in the second phase 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.150
 discover the code as in 3 and a-4 in 5 will kill we go out king passes 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.290
 slate cup and in the dran you have to compete against another character by killing 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.619
 mou 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:12.409
 strobos but these are left with the life low and then they trap them with a stone 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.309
 the one that is the most behind monsters, but make sure that there is little 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.919
 life because if you do not try to catch it and pay you that takes away rocks 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.919
 the most entertaining of this fish toys that you can put bombs which you 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.819
 they take points from others and leave them quiet in the carnival you make a group 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.189
 with people and fights against other people killing monsters the bad of this is 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.199
 that you will not have good pq after level 40 of rest you will have from level 30 to 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:43.069
 40 July 5 to 10 good people in the ludin the first one kills monsters and 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.189
 then take the step that botanic asylum to the leader of the rest I do not remember anymore 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.909
 but the last thing you'll do with the alisal and it's very difficult in the orbis 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.569
 I do not remember but delays like 45 minutes to spend it and rest no more 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.059
 but well let's go to the other topic the server you can choose the server 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:04.639
 you want if you understand English well I recommend Maple Estoril drowned 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.519
 he inaugurated that he was in episode 2 the global already have more 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.470
 works of works also 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.530
 the next video in European penalties usi heron pirates but there are many people who 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.360
 speak spanish de resto look at your language in the maple community sincerely the 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.230
 Community of Madrid is very ugly so much so that more than a game is considered 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.499
 selfish 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:27.129
 because instead of the fruits that help with kisses coconut experience you 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.870
 they say north and they laugh at you in your face that they have done that to them not 

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:35.150
 it means that they do that to others for that reason many have told me that 

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:39.169
 they almost went away from makled for that, so those fucking selfish people are going to these 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:39.999
 dogs 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.429
 but it is always the best as we say in 

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:45.929
 the country the bacán that helps one like in mac leod europe a friend already 

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:49.769

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.499
