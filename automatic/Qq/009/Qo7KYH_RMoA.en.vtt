00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
to get it started the car seems to crank

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.159 
to get it started the car seems to crank
okay<00:00:24.080> but<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:24.350> not<00:00:24.790> it's<00:00:25.790> not<00:00:26.509> catching<00:00:26.840> not

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
okay but it's not it's not catching not

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.650 
okay but it's not it's not catching not
firing<00:00:28.240> there's<00:00:29.240> a<00:00:29.300> couple<00:00:29.480> more

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
firing there's a couple more

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.960 
firing there's a couple more
possibilities<00:00:30.320> here<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.800> diesel<00:00:31.700> in<00:00:31.849> the

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
possibilities here the diesel in the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.499 
possibilities here the diesel in the
tank

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
tank

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.620 
tank
I'm<00:00:32.599> gonna<00:00:33.050> guess<00:00:33.350> is<00:00:33.710> probably<00:00:33.950> around<00:00:34.640> 10

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'm gonna guess is probably around 10

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.080 
I'm gonna guess is probably around 10
years<00:00:35.840> old<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:36.440> did<00:00:36.950> have<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.250> car<00:00:37.460> running<00:00:37.880> on

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
years old I did have the car running on

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.380 
years old I did have the car running on
whatever<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.840> in<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.320> tank<00:00:39.700> last<00:00:40.700> year<00:00:42.130> and

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
whatever is in the tank last year and

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.560 
whatever is in the tank last year and
the<00:00:44.390> car<00:00:44.570> would<00:00:44.810> start<00:00:45.370> poorly<00:00:46.370> but<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:46.610> did<00:00:46.820> so

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
the car would start poorly but it did so

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
the car would start poorly but it did so
I<00:00:48.430> was<00:00:49.450> leaning<00:00:50.450> towards<00:00:50.840> discounting<00:00:51.470> that

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
I was leaning towards discounting that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.260 
I was leaning towards discounting that
as<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:51.740> possibility<00:00:52.370> but<00:00:52.490> made<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.850> maybe<00:00:53.060> now

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
as a possibility but made it maybe now

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.330 
as a possibility but made it maybe now
the<00:00:53.330> fuel<00:00:53.660> is<00:00:53.810> just<00:00:53.990> so<00:00:54.170> bad<00:00:54.470> that<00:00:54.740> the<00:00:55.160> car

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
the fuel is just so bad that the car

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.650 
the fuel is just so bad that the car
won't<00:00:55.520> fire<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:56.120> other<00:00:56.210> thing<00:00:56.420> I'm<00:00:56.510> going<00:00:56.600> to

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
won't fire the other thing I'm going to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.930 
won't fire the other thing I'm going to
do<00:00:56.780> right<00:00:56.930> now<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.680> well<00:00:58.340> two<00:00:58.520> more<00:00:58.730> things<00:01:00.940> I'm

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
do right now is well two more things I'm

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.830 
do right now is well two more things I'm
going<00:01:02.330> to<00:01:02.450> first<00:01:02.960> check<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.830> air<00:01:04.009> filter<00:01:04.840> if

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
going to first check the air filter if

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.300 
going to first check the air filter if
the<00:01:06.020> car<00:01:06.200> won't<00:01:06.320> start<00:01:06.560> with<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.009> what<00:01:07.220> I'll

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
the car won't start with that what I'll

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.730 
the car won't start with that what I'll
do<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.820> I<00:01:08.240> will<00:01:08.270> pull<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.049> fuel<00:01:09.290> lines<00:01:09.530> and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
do is I will pull the fuel lines and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.539 
do is I will pull the fuel lines and
hook<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:11.509> car<00:01:11.750> up<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.140> can<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.159> straight

diesel purge now this stuff here you can

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.840 
diesel purge now this stuff here you can
run<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.740> engine<00:01:19.039> directly<00:01:19.460> on<00:01:19.579> it<00:01:19.729> without

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
run the engine directly on it without

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.120 
run the engine directly on it without
any<00:01:20.179> additional<00:01:20.659> diesel<00:01:21.109> and<00:01:21.409> it'll<00:01:21.950> clean

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
any additional diesel and it'll clean

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.499 
any additional diesel and it'll clean
out<00:01:22.249> the<00:01:22.369> injectors<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:22.850> everything<00:01:23.270> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
out the injectors and everything and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.429 
out the injectors and everything and
since<00:01:24.079> this<00:01:24.229> is<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.409> good<00:01:25.240> no<00:01:26.240> clean<00:01:26.600> source<00:01:27.049> of

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
since this is a good no clean source of

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.969 
since this is a good no clean source of
new<00:01:28.249> fuel<00:01:28.810> I'm<00:01:29.810> hoping<00:01:30.289> that<00:01:30.469> it<00:01:30.679> would<00:01:30.829> get

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
new fuel I'm hoping that it would get

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.190 
new fuel I'm hoping that it would get
the<00:01:31.130> car<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.399> start<00:01:31.749> pulled<00:01:32.749> out<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.049> air

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
the car to start pulled out the air

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.989 
the car to start pulled out the air
filter<00:01:33.619> which<00:01:34.009> is<00:01:34.039> a<00:01:34.189> little<00:01:34.429> more<00:01:34.609> difficult

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
filter which is a little more difficult

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.080 
filter which is a little more difficult
to<00:01:35.030> get<00:01:35.179> to<00:01:35.240> than<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.539> thought<00:01:35.749> and<00:01:36.909> this<00:01:37.909> is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
to get to than I thought and this is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.690 
to get to than I thought and this is
what<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.270> found<00:01:38.539> right<00:01:38.840> here<00:01:39.460> never<00:01:40.460> seen

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
what I found right here never seen

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.120 
what I found right here never seen
anything<00:01:40.909> like<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.359> is<00:01:41.869> certainly<00:01:42.139> way

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
anything like this is certainly way

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.219 
anything like this is certainly way
different<00:01:43.579> than<00:01:43.639> on<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.909> later<00:01:44.090> 123<00:01:44.899> series

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
different than on the later 123 series

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.580 
different than on the later 123 series
Diesel's<00:01:45.649> this<00:01:45.829> is<00:01:45.979> some<00:01:46.159> sort<00:01:46.399> of<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:47.590> metal

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
Diesel's this is some sort of a metal

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.910 
Diesel's this is some sort of a metal
cam<00:01:50.499> hey<00:01:51.499> there

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
cam hey there

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.300 
cam hey there
okay<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:53.139> as<00:01:54.139> I<00:01:54.200> said<00:01:54.499> I<00:01:54.530> inspected<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.159> air

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
okay I as I said I inspected the air

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.370 
okay I as I said I inspected the air
filter<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.319> I<00:01:57.319> found<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:59.259> underneath<00:02:00.259> the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
filter and I found the underneath the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.069 
filter and I found the underneath the
air<00:02:00.530> filter<00:02:01.179> elements<00:02:02.179> that<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.479> canister

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
air filter elements that the canister

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.069 
air filter elements that the canister
has<00:02:03.170> showed<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:03.590> there<00:02:04.399> was<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:05.240> puddle<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:05.719> oil

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
has showed you there was a puddle of oil

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.980 
has showed you there was a puddle of oil
I<00:02:06.490> checked<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.670> owners<00:02:08.149> manual<00:02:08.569> which<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.810> have

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
I checked the owners manual which I have

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.870 
I checked the owners manual which I have
and<00:02:09.289> what<00:02:09.890> do<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.039> know<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.250> car<00:02:10.429> has<00:02:10.610> an<00:02:10.700> oil

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
and what do you know this car has an oil

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.160 
and what do you know this car has an oil
bath<00:02:11.030> air<00:02:11.060> filter<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.720> they're<00:02:11.810> supposed<00:02:12.080> to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
bath air filter and they're supposed to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.620 
bath air filter and they're supposed to
be<00:02:12.290> oil<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.620> there<00:02:12.970> but<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.000> doubted<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.540> was

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
be oil in there but I doubted it was

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.559 
be oil in there but I doubted it was
supposed<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.990> have<00:02:15.200> all<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:16.240> all<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.420> leaves

through I'm not really seeing much of an

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.089 
through I'm not really seeing much of an
issue<00:04:48.629> of<00:04:48.839> the<00:04:48.959> air<00:04:49.050> bubbles<00:04:49.379> there<00:04:49.559> I<00:04:49.800> know

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
issue of the air bubbles there I know

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.769 
issue of the air bubbles there I know
it's<00:04:50.339> got<00:04:50.459> a<00:04:50.489> clean<00:04:50.759> supply<00:04:51.179> of<00:04:51.360> fuel<00:04:51.599> right

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:53.209 
it's got a clean supply of fuel right
now<00:04:51.959> because<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.379> the<00:04:52.439> diesel<00:04:52.769> purge<00:04:52.949> and<00:04:53.129> that

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
now because of the diesel purge and that

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.109 
now because of the diesel purge and that
didn't<00:04:53.459> make<00:04:53.489> a<00:04:53.610> difference

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:54.119 
didn't make a difference

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:55.729 
didn't make a difference
took<00:04:54.659> a<00:04:54.689> look<00:04:54.809> at<00:04:54.929> the<00:04:55.019> air<00:04:55.139> filter<00:04:55.499> I<00:04:55.559> don't

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:55.739 
took a look at the air filter I don't

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:57.379 
took a look at the air filter I don't
think<00:04:55.889> there's<00:04:56.009> a<00:04:56.069> restriction<00:04:56.580> there<00:04:56.759> I'm

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
think there's a restriction there I'm

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.659 
think there's a restriction there I'm
actually<00:04:57.769> believe<00:04:58.769> it<00:04:58.919> or<00:04:58.979> not<00:04:59.099> as<00:04:59.339> long<00:04:59.399> as

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
actually believe it or not as long as

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.579 
actually believe it or not as long as
this<00:04:59.969> is<00:05:00.179> taking<00:05:00.629> I'm<00:05:00.809> getting<00:05:01.139> more<00:05:01.319> and<00:05:01.499> more

this is taking I'm getting more and more

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:03.529 
this is taking I'm getting more and more
confident<00:05:02.219> that<00:05:02.429> the<00:05:02.580> car<00:05:02.789> will<00:05:03.029> start<00:05:03.360> and

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
confident that the car will start and

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.799 
confident that the car will start and
run<00:05:04.489> mostly<00:05:05.489> because<00:05:05.639> as<00:05:06.269> I'm<00:05:06.449> going<00:05:06.629> along

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:06.809

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
fixing little things that might be

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.489 
fixing little things that might be
getting<00:05:10.740> in<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.860> way<00:05:11.009> of<00:05:11.039> starting<00:05:11.550> and

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:12.499 
getting in the way of starting and

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.139 
getting in the way of starting and
things<00:05:13.499> that<00:05:13.740> are<00:05:13.860> as<00:05:14.129> such<00:05:14.550> just<00:05:14.909> getting

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:15.149 
things that are as such just getting

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:17.269 
things that are as such just getting
better<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.539> better<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:16.139> well<00:05:16.889> I<00:05:16.919> actually

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:17.279 
better and better so well I actually

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.790 
better and better so well I actually
decided<00:05:18.029> to<00:05:18.149> try<00:05:18.449> one<00:05:18.689> more<00:05:18.719> thing<00:05:18.929> today<00:05:19.319> I

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
decided to try one more thing today I

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.699 
decided to try one more thing today I
looked<00:05:20.490> at<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.669> book<00:05:20.929> and<00:05:21.929> it's<00:05:22.080> on<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.229> diagram

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:22.709 
looked at the book and it's on a diagram

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:24.949 
looked at the book and it's on a diagram
and<00:05:23.009> it<00:05:23.459> occurred<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:23.879> me<00:05:23.999> that<00:05:24.029> quite

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:24.959 
and it occurred to me that quite

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:27.169 
and it occurred to me that quite
possibly<00:05:25.499> when<00:05:25.769> I<00:05:25.800> cleaned<00:05:26.639> the<00:05:26.789> carbon<00:05:27.119> out

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:27.179 
possibly when I cleaned the carbon out

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:28.850 
possibly when I cleaned the carbon out
of<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.360> global<00:05:27.479> club<00:05:27.719> chambers<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.529> may<00:05:28.800> have

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
of the global club chambers I may have

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.059 
of the global club chambers I may have
hooked<00:05:29.189> everything<00:05:29.550> back<00:05:29.819> up<00:05:29.999> falling<00:05:30.389> so

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
hooked everything back up falling so

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.639 
hooked everything back up falling so
actually<00:05:32.069> going<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:33.139> give<00:05:34.139> the<00:05:34.259> car<00:05:34.469> at<00:05:34.589> least

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:34.649 
actually going to give the car at least

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:38.600 
actually going to give the car at least
one<00:05:35.009> more<00:05:35.159> start<00:05:35.489> as<00:05:35.579> hemp<00:05:35.819> right<00:05:36.029> now<00:05:37.610> listen

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
one more start as hemp right now listen

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.159 
one more start as hemp right now listen
to<00:05:38.669> that<00:05:38.759> the<00:05:38.879> glow<00:05:39.029> plugs<00:05:39.329> are<00:05:39.509> now<00:05:39.659> hooked<00:05:39.959> up

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
to that the glow plugs are now hooked up

00:05:40.169 --> 00:06:10.430 
to that the glow plugs are now hooked up
