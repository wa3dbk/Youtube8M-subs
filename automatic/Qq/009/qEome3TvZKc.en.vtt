 he's going to do it because he thought it was 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.179
 easy but I've seen forums and seen that the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.849
 people have problems with the 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:24.619
 chapters do not seem chapters 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:27.060

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.009

 I will put your song at the end of 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.810

 your confidence in your like and we will grow 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.540
 together so let's go to the mess we have to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.220
 go to game page for a 2 point 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.060
 com that's where I develop look 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.130
 receive the return in two and look for the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.720
 the mega download 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.640
 important and careful eye worth here you 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.890
 it shows that three vital points appear 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.900
 then by equipping energy che the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.750
 already patched chapters be 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.180
 unlocked and so on if everything goes 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.520
 you work from another page, maybe not 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.710
 are unlocked then no 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.229
 only maybe you do not go what you're going to 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.990
 do now why I always recommend 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.729
 this is worth in mega to download 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.759
 these links you have to have the jacks 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.000
 fold of the 2 installed and you have to 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.860
 search by google and select 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.340
 all the links you give to copy and 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.489
 it will automatically come out here worth these 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.489
 are 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.930
 what we have to do is give 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:23.989
 start and even as I already have it here 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.459
 all done and this step we discard 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.920
 well first of all we have to go 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.579
 as always to the root of xbox 360 a 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.829
 use system configuration 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:37.190
 storage we have look for the usb 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.459
 so it will come out to the usb will come out unit but 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.230
 we will get the gigas you have to give 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.019
 it will be configured to customize them to 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.000
 customize and while the redwoods are 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.519
 will configure once decompressed 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.099
 let's look at what folders are there for 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.180
 inform you these are the parts already 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.670
 they have compressed but it be 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.940
 unzip it is winrar and extract here 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.670
 of this folder with information and such 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.650
 content and here it is very important because 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.000
 here I failed it's just that a lot 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.230
 people will fail 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.810
 0 to 0 0 only two are the chapters 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.570
 two three four suits and so on and 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.760
 this is chapter one what 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.670
 we have to do first before 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.790
 nothing is to go to xbox unity and look for the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.670
 update without update is not going 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.530
 to be able to play we give a take 4 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.650
 nation 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.020
 and we download the most current in this case is 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.390
 the 3 if you within a month see this 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.920
 video maybe there are 4 porsche downloads 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.950
 that you give here here is worth it and you download 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.910
 will come out 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.980
 this file the tube and so on 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.690
 what we have to do is a very important step 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.490
 simple but attentive we have to do 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.830
 it is this 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.830
 here chapter 1 we drag it 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.580
 for the other folder outside 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.500
 in this case it's going to be here I follow my 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.700
 steps I do it well for that the best 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.190
 I put chapter 1 first 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.750
 and then I put the rest 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.010
 As you can see the post all 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:28.600
 chapters in 0 002 we return at 00 of 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:30.790
 January and we put the update worth 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.680
 Once done already open horizon 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.810
 I have opened with the pen already configured 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.270
 already recognizes it and we have to do it 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.270
 estonia new folk is to look for the 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.520
 update we give you here and we give to 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.450
 open automatically I do not give because 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.400
 I already have it installed on the pen or tv 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.919
 automatically 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.479
 it will turn green after five seconds 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.610
 what we do is go out in 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.960
 systems we have to cover with the pen 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.410
 we give system 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.180
 storage we look for this one and 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.100
 you see that this is update what 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.759
 we have to do is select what 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.050
 connector hoist and move once moved already 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.440
 everything is done what we have to do is 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.479
 take as you see in this case the title 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.270
 that is already put I have already put the 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.690
 console update we have to go back 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.540
 to do with the usb and go to the other 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.970
 folder 0 0 0 2 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.450
 once and to give you we have to give 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.450
 all 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.250
 but I will emphasize that the first 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.669
 chapter that is 8 f 6 you have to 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.830
 first and then the others have to 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.750
 be all the same as you will see 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.380
 you are fine you do not have to be all the same 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.840
 we select everything 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.340
 and it will take about 20 minutes one as 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.820
 once you have passed all the files by 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.010
 horizon 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.000
 we have to look again to do what 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:02.730
 but it will go file manager go 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.490
 now where is this album you see that this is 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.370
 contain the zeros and here is the thing very 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.980
 important, that's enough 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.110
 important 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.110
 you see that I have told you what there is 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.050
 pass all the files at 00 02 and 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.790
 at 00 of 0 00 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.500
 we have gone before the update but 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.360
 I as we have previously passed and 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.310
 the hard drive should not have anything 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.020
 ok but we see that here is this 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.250
 Chapter 1 file not quiet 0 0 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.710
 we give this this must be the 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.530
 chapter 23 I do not know what we give in 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.360
 jump to that you have to update in a 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.230
 failure will not happen anything not calm 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:45.080
 we must accept and send us to the side 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.600
 which is at the root of the xbox where 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.100
 we have the update put in this 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.310
 case will put revelations 6 we accept 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.990
 now 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:59.750
 and now it will automatically come out what is 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.610
 capcom and everything that has been the 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.610
 root you see that is loading 

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.000
 we see that the jump mode is already 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.090
 available on the other we are interested in 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.140
 chapters you see the fight in the little woman 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.140
 its extra chapters 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.620
 you know they were more and better from your 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:32.640
 trust to life and that we have together 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.640
 to tolo 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.970
 I do not know what to tell you so we go to the day
