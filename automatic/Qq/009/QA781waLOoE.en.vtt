00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.740
 hello broadcast bread on 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.140
 everyday 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.439
 thank god for the new day and the new 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.939
 opportunity to reflect on his word 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.820
 we will spend the next few minutes 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.110
 talk about how to draw the line 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.630
 between soulful and spiritual in each 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 generation is both divine and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.680
 human 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.050
 if we seek God we will 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.750
 meet in peace and harmony 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.560
 and if everyone will look for their own there and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.570
 disagree let's divide the situation is similar to 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.510
 the one that Maximilian Voloshin described 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.200
 remember your famous poem 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 here and there between the rows 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.360
 the same eye sounds who is not for us 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.770
 he is not indifferent against us the truth with 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.640
 us and I stand alone down in roaring 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:19.200
 flames and smoke and with all their might 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.740
 I pray for those and for others in fact 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.969
 all creativity is divided into spiritual and 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.840
 soulful and time is nothing to do with 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:33.960
 every generation there were and there will be songs 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.859
 spiritual and there were and there will be songs 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.579
 spiritual moreover sometimes between the spirit and 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.280
 soul 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.280
 don't draw boundaries because man is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.369
 the process of its way goes back excellent 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.130
 that is, spiritual to God, that is 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.249
 spiritual so we are transformed from 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.279
 spiritual in spiritual therefore not time 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:02:00.630
 has the right to be the criterion of truth 

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:03.539
 but truth is the judge of time and his 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.350
 heritage why so yes because 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.619
 true spiritual creativity will live 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.069
 out of time or more precisely to say at all 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.970
 time 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.450
 whereas the spiritual ones are fed only from 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.090
 of the spirit 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.880
 of this century only the age of the century lives 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.400
 scares the other when the church without 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.010
 a twinge of conscience 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.500
 creates its masterpieces so let's say from 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.540
 fornication with the world I take on 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.659
 the courage to say that many 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.900
 music hits in the christian market 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.480
 popular that is to say they have many millions 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.780
 views on youtube or other channels 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.170
 just because they are not inferior to the level 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.900
 worldly performers they are because they 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.750
 born of the holy spirit and therefore upon them 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.840
 such a big demand in society by 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.389
 talk about these truths yourself 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.819
 During the day it was kept to the Lord 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:05.950
 dating thoughts from the book 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.950
 attempted supreme sovereignty
