00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 in open battle t-90 and leopard 26 never 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.069
 did not encounter experts 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.210
 modeled a similar situation 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.190
 read the results mathematically 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.380
 possible collision, provided that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.400
 against ten German tanks on 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.949
 open country 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
 10 Russian cars will perform according to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.000
 the leopard does not even have time 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.539
 get close to t 90 at a distance 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.519
 shot 1,500 kilometers across the desert and over 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.719
 difficult terrain and abrams was and mean 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.660
 the leopard was and t-90 so here is the victory 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.410
 scored on these races 190 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.239
 Well, as he won opera on patency 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.780
 in the strongest dust conditions 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.710
 terrain yes that was able to withstand these runs 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.579
 high temperatures here and after that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.579
 on shooting 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.500
 encounter fight equal conditions we on 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 surfaces worth not buried not on 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.900
 surface at each other go step 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.759
 so for this period of time while they 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.540
 come out on the far really intelligible 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:11.000
 yes we knock out 60 percent of the technique is not 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.000
 hitting the t-90 my paradise
