00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.420

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.040

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.400
 you as parents you responsible for 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.400
 their children 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.660
 With a lot of respect 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.270
 for the house that we are seeing for 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.880
 José had actually made himself a candle 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.300
 A little while ago in Barranquilla 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.010
 of my trust and others 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.420
 well as you can see here is the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.210
 shirt that was used for the evening 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.280
 on that evening we put a 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.100
 box office very accessible to people who 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.090
 It was 5 thousand pesos and we were able to collect 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.880
 5 million pesos which with this 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.940
 contribution that makes several processes and those 5 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.380
 millions since we already have more than half 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:50.920
 from the road that house can 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.920
 my goal is to achieve this challenge 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 look 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.500
 so we can know your house 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.760
 and good many thanks to a pleasure of 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.920
 be with you and good avoiding 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.580
 carmona know how it continues today we are going to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.930
 start from when they believe that everything happened 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.480
 you found out at the same time 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.580
 when jose was wrong you found out 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.870
 later as I take you a news not 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.630
 obviously the same night of the fight 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.280
 when when he fell knocked out he no longer 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.620
 never recovered then already they are in 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.970
 stretcher and well I was already celebrating 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.530
 for the victory because he was very 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.510
 happy because I had received many 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.300
 criticism of the fight they are going to strike 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.010
 that I know he was coming back and when I what 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.740
 I was very celebrating when I arrived 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.440
 to miami is jorge josé is not right 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.700
 wrong and I do and I see it and seeing his face and 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.230
 I saw that it was wrong I started asking 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.870
 doctors the vertigo is over for me 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.030
 started a storm of torture I started to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.860
 worry about him they took him to 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.480
 hospital on a stretcher and I knew I was 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.130
 in an induced coma state that have it 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.780
 that operated the emergency then they were 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.650
 very difficult hours for me I did not sleep 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.360
 all night worried were days 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.120
 difficult for me until until 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.400
 I knew that the danger comes out by forming a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.200
 little bit me calme gave a pretty impact 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.520
 great in fact we had had 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.070
 the opportunity to talk to you before 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.170
 boxing from colombia you said that people 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.580
 by twitter that yesterday said that fate of 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.830
 done on the street they also told you how 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.180
 was that psychological impact because it has been 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.680
 very hard but he has also understood that 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.540
 people always talk and criticize and it is 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.730
 very easy to write silly in behind 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.470
 of a computer but here I am 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.880
 showed that they are was a human being I come 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.460
 to visit him and he does not come with his hands 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.200
 empty of the native tissue and if I have not 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.030
 come before it was not because I did not want 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.800
 come was because he does not want to see it in the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.290
 state of nerja in a dessert a stretcher 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.150
 today I see it more recovered already laughs already 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.850
 raise your hand is with your recovery 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.440
 and I have come to motivate him then I 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.030
 I decided to come from apart from not coming with 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.920
 empty hands did not want to come with a 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.970
 donation of 10 thousand dollars is ten thousand 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.800
 dollars for him to finish his house 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.240
 they are calmly advising me that 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.570
 with that you can calmly finish your 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.570
 home 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.100
 so 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.940
 so I'm very happy and I think 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.100
 with that 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.750
 10,000 poets for now we are going to 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.980
 say we can do it with more what was 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.190
 the first impression when seeing joseph 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.780
 carmona then in bed now no longer well 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.580
 seen very percent with you in fact 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.930
 talking about the contest in the is the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.440
 until the fraud in which you do not what 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.000
 does he was going up and then you had 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.950
 blow hit sends it to the canvas 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.330
 you saw that moving very active now that 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.310
 you see here what was the first impression 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.470
 because feelings are not 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.379
 always from what I saw above the good is a 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.590
 warrior in a fight and is winning me 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.479
 the fight and this and today is to see it here 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.979
 it gives me as feelings but I hope 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.539
 in God I trust in God who is going to 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.939
 recover and will get ahead the is a 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.860
 great champion is a warrior who 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:04.039
 We hope to find here in Cartagena 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.590

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.050
