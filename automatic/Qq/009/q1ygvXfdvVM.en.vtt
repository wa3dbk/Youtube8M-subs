00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.410 

roll<00:01:05.510> cage<00:01:05.830> was<00:01:06.830> obviously<00:01:07.190> a<00:01:07.280> hindsight<00:01:07.909> but

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
roll cage was obviously a hindsight but

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.450 
roll cage was obviously a hindsight but
I<00:01:08.479> wanted<00:01:08.869> it<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.170> but<00:01:10.159> now<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.340> biggest

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
I wanted it in but now the biggest

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.160 
I wanted it in but now the biggest
problem<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:10.880> had<00:01:11.000> his<00:01:11.119> gas<00:01:11.420> tanks<00:01:11.780> took<00:01:11.930> up<00:01:12.049> all

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
problem I had his gas tanks took up all

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.510 
problem I had his gas tanks took up all
that<00:01:12.290> space<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.800> there<00:01:12.920> so<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.100> had<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.280> make<00:01:13.490> a

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
that space in there so I had to make a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.130 
that space in there so I had to make a
bracket<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.030> sort<00:01:14.330> of<00:01:14.390> cantilever<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.050> off

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
bracket that sort of cantilever it off

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.530 
bracket that sort of cantilever it off
the<00:01:15.320> frame<00:01:15.590> support<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> roll<00:01:16.760> bar<00:01:16.790> as<00:01:17.300> the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
the frame support the roll bar as the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.570 
the frame support the roll bar as the
roll<00:01:17.690> bar<00:01:17.720> went<00:01:18.110> up<00:01:18.200> basically<00:01:18.950> it's<00:01:19.250> tucked

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
roll bar went up basically it's tucked

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.180 
roll bar went up basically it's tucked
as<00:01:19.759> tight<00:01:20.000> as<00:01:20.180> possible<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.350> b-pillar<00:01:21.920> so

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
as tight as possible to the b-pillar so

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.620 
as tight as possible to the b-pillar so
I<00:01:22.250> could<00:01:22.400> bolt<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.700> B<00:01:22.850> color<00:01:23.030> into<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.450> roll

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
I could bolt the B color into the roll

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.810 
I could bolt the B color into the roll
cage<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.080> add<00:01:24.170> some<00:01:24.470> strengths<00:01:24.860> when<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:25.399> needed

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
the the jig so if it wasn't enough that

I<00:02:14.959> heated<00:02:15.260> up<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.440> tube<00:02:15.739> first<00:02:16.220> i<00:02:16.340> think<00:02:16.400> was

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
I heated up the tube first i think was

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.560 
I heated up the tube first i think was
270<00:02:17.299> than<00:02:17.480> 28<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.200> 29<00:02:18.380> then<00:02:19.250> 300<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.060> i<00:02:20.420> just

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
270 than 28 and 29 then 300 and i just

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.090 
270 than 28 and 29 then 300 and i just
waited<00:02:20.750> for<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.049> to<00:02:21.110> cool<00:02:21.320> back<00:02:21.590> down<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.980> look

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
waited for it to cool back down to look

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.800 
waited for it to cool back down to look
at<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> crown<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.900> was<00:02:24.019> in<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.230> roof<00:02:24.440> and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
at the crown that was in the roof and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.420 
at the crown that was in the roof and
that<00:02:26.810> was<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.170> i<00:02:27.200> think<00:02:27.530> at<00:02:27.650> 300<00:02:28.130> i<00:02:28.190> may<00:02:28.370> have

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
that was it i think at 300 i may have

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.800 
that was it i think at 300 i may have
made<00:02:28.730> one<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.030> was<00:02:29.090> too<00:02:29.360> big<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.780> doesn't

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
made one that was too big it doesn't

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.380 
made one that was too big it doesn't
quite<00:02:30.110> look<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.500> popemobile<00:02:31.269> but<00:02:32.269> it's

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
quite look like a popemobile but it's

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.690 
quite look like a popemobile but it's
pretty<00:02:32.510> good
