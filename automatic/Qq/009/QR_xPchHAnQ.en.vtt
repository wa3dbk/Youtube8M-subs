00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
but I wasn't really sure like maybe I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
but I wasn't really sure like maybe I
had<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.619> dive<00:01:58.829> by<00:01:59.100> an<00:01:59.219> honest<00:01:59.610> honestly<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
had to dive by an honest honestly I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
had to dive by an honest honestly I
really<00:02:00.659> had<00:02:00.899> no<00:02:01.049> idea<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:02.040> he<00:02:02.159> had<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
really had no idea that he had a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.530 
really had no idea that he had a
cosplayer<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.149> wasn't<00:02:03.299> paying

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
attention right there I really thought

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.639 
attention right there I really thought
maybe<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:06.290> trapping<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.409> don't<00:02:07.530> want

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
maybe I just don't trapping I don't want

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.080
