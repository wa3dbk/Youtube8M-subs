you<00:02:15.330> know<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.510> pretty<00:02:15.780> much<00:02:15.900> bored<00:02:16.260> with

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
you know I was pretty much bored with

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.059 
you know I was pretty much bored with
the<00:02:16.500> DSR<00:02:17.040> or<00:02:17.520> whatever<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.959> DSR<00:02:19.380> sniper<00:02:19.739> rifle

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
the DSR or whatever the DSR sniper rifle

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.130 
the DSR or whatever the DSR sniper rifle
is<00:02:20.130> easy<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.120> assault<00:02:21.510> rifle<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.989> easy

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
is easy the assault rifle is easy

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.280 
is easy the assault rifle is easy
attrition<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.220> easy<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.970> me<00:02:24.120> because<00:02:24.330> it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
attrition is easy to me because it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.190 
attrition is easy to me because it
reminds<00:02:25.770> me<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.010> call<00:02:26.610> duty<00:02:26.880> but<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.720> title<00:02:28.110> of

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
reminds me of call duty but the title of

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.830 
reminds me of call duty but the title of
the<00:02:28.349> game<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.980> called<00:02:29.250> titanfall<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.660> if

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the game is called titanfall so if

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.260 
the game is called titanfall so if

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
so from this point forward I'm just

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.479 
so from this point forward I'm just
going<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.440> do<00:02:52.530> regular<00:02:52.830> commentary<00:02:53.370> is

so forth but I deeply understand the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.550 
so forth but I deeply understand the
difference<00:02:59.970> between<00:03:00.030> call<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.690> duty<00:03:00.959> ghosts

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
difference between call of duty ghosts

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.780 
difference between call of duty ghosts
or<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.280> call<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.610> duty<00:03:02.760> period<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.690> titanfall

or in call of duty period and titanfall

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.960 
or in call of duty period and titanfall
the<00:03:05.790> freedom<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.410> have<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.310> titanfall

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the freedom that you have in titanfall

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.809 
the freedom that you have in titanfall
versus<00:03:09.630> call<00:03:09.840> duty<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.489> night

don't like it anymore and that's their

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.140 
don't like it anymore and that's their
game<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.650> don't<00:04:08.160> like<00:04:08.220> playing<00:04:08.609> it<00:04:08.790> anymore

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
game I don't like playing it anymore

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.379 
game I don't like playing it anymore
that's<00:04:09.540> period<00:04:09.930> titanfall<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:11.250> better<00:04:12.000> than

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
that's period titanfall is better than

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.990 
that's period titanfall is better than
every<00:04:13.290> call<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.650> duty<00:04:13.889> except<00:04:14.430> modern<00:04:14.819> warfare

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
every call of duty except modern warfare

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.449 
every call of duty except modern warfare
2<00:04:15.359> and<00:04:15.690> call<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.019> duty<00:04:16.200> 4<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.650> think<00:04:17.310> there's

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
2 and call of duty 4 I think there's

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.220 
2 and call of duty 4 I think there's
about<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.820> same<00:04:18.090> level<00:04:18.539> of

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
about the same level of

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.000 
about the same level of
of<00:04:20.320> freedom<00:04:21.070> with<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.730> joystick<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:23.010> moving

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
of freedom with a joystick and moving

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.460 
of freedom with a joystick and moving
forward<00:04:24.460> with<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.790> game<00:04:24.970> that's<00:04:25.750> that's<00:04:26.260> my

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
forward with the game that's that's my

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.650 
forward with the game that's that's my
opinion<00:04:26.770> now<00:04:29.670> game<00:04:30.670> of<00:04:30.820> attrition<00:04:30.940> is<00:04:31.450> not<00:04:31.630> a

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
opinion now game of attrition is not a

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.870 
opinion now game of attrition is not a
bad<00:04:31.900> game<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.350> like<00:04:32.650> attrition<00:04:33.190> but<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.520> think

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
bad game I like attrition but I think

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.010 
bad game I like attrition but I think
the<00:04:34.620> titanfall<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:36.460> game<00:04:36.730> is<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.090> mech<00:04:37.750> game

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
the titanfall the game is a mech game

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.810 
the titanfall the game is a mech game
and<00:04:38.470> that's<00:04:38.620> what<00:04:38.770> they<00:04:38.920> built<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.340> around<00:04:39.400> and

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
and that's what they built it around and

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.600 
and that's what they built it around and
if<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.030> listen<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.920> the<00:04:41.920> live<00:04:42.130> stream<00:04:42.490> that

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
during that you know they said this game

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.530 
during that you know they said this game
is<00:04:53.950> they<00:04:54.280> literally<00:04:54.670> said<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.210> game<00:04:55.390> is

is they literally said this game is
titanfall<00:04:55.870> which<00:04:56.230> we<00:04:56.440> which<00:04:56.800> is<00:04:56.830> reiterating

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
titanfall which we which is reiterating

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.310 
titanfall which we which is reiterating
the<00:04:57.670> fact<00:04:57.700> that<00:04:58.060> they<00:04:58.510> made<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:58.870> game<00:04:59.080> with

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
the fact that they made this game with

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.400 
the fact that they made this game with
mex<00:04:59.710> in<00:04:59.980> mind<00:05:00.430> in<00:05:00.640> the<00:05:00.700> first<00:05:01.000> place<00:05:01.210> and<00:05:01.570> the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
mex in mind in the first place and the

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.130 
mex in mind in the first place and the
fact<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:04.000> other<00:05:04.150> stuff<00:05:04.450> is<00:05:04.570> in<00:05:04.750> there<00:05:04.930> I

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
fact that the other stuff is in there I

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.320 
fact that the other stuff is in there I
think<00:05:06.100> it's<00:05:06.250> just<00:05:06.310> there<00:05:06.670> to<00:05:06.700> draw<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.060> call

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
think it's just there to draw the call

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.170 
think it's just there to draw the call
duty<00:05:07.570> fans<00:05:07.900> now<00:05:08.350> is<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:09.700> better<00:05:09.850> than<00:05:10.000> the

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
duty fans now is it better than the

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.740 
duty fans now is it better than the
other<00:05:10.570> call<00:05:10.870> duty<00:05:11.080> now<00:05:11.770> with<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.700> weapons<00:05:13.540> and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
other call duty now with the weapons and

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.110 
other call duty now with the weapons and
whatnot<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.230> don't<00:05:14.440> really<00:05:14.560> think<00:05:14.680> so<00:05:15.100> you<00:05:16.030> know

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
whatnot I don't really think so you know

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.610 
whatnot I don't really think so you know
I<00:05:16.180> think<00:05:16.300> the<00:05:16.570> weapons<00:05:16.990> are<00:05:17.110> really<00:05:17.350> dummy

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
I think the weapons are really dummy

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.860 
I think the weapons are really dummy
down<00:05:17.890> but<00:05:18.550> with<00:05:18.730> the<00:05:18.850> movement<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.450> freedom

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
down but with the movement and freedom

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.960 
down but with the movement and freedom
it's<00:05:20.140> light<00:05:20.980> years<00:05:21.220> ahead<00:05:21.400> of<00:05:21.790> what<00:05:23.970> Treyarch

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
it's light years ahead of what Treyarch
