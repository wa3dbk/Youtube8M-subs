notebook computer up off the desk giving
me<00:00:37.980> more<00:00:38.280> space<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.510> doing<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.290> has

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
me more space here but in doing so has

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.650 
me more space here but in doing so has
increased<00:00:41.940> airflow<00:00:42.829> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.399> underside<00:00:45.329> of

increased airflow on the underside of

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.250 
increased airflow on the underside of
the<00:00:46.289> hardware<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.739> yes<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.640> cooled<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.809> by

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the hardware and yes that cooled it by

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
the hardware and yes that cooled it by
at<00:00:49.379> least<00:00:49.590> 10<00:00:50.100> degrees<00:00:50.430> according<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.910> my

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
at least 10 degrees according to my

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.490 
at least 10 degrees according to my
measurements<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.870> completely<00:00:52.320> scientific

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
measurements not completely scientific

but i can tell you even by touch when i

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.520 
but i can tell you even by touch when i
lifted<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.309> notebook<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.969> put<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.530> the

it<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> elevator<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:02.370> done<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it on the elevator and be done with it

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
it on the elevator and be done with it
not<00:01:03.480> realizing<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> would<00:01:04.320> actually

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
not realizing that it would actually

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.310 
not realizing that it would actually
cool<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> down<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:06.090> even<00:01:06.540> though<00:01:06.659> i<00:01:06.869> have

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
cool it down because even though i have

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.030 
cool it down because even though i have
a<00:01:07.740> small<00:01:08.430> rubber<00:01:09.060> feet<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:10.350> i<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.680> attached

to the bottom of this notebook computer

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
to the bottom of this notebook computer
i<00:01:13.799> remember<00:01:14.760> doing<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.270> review<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.570> those<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
i remember doing a review on those the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.149 
i remember doing a review on those the
laptop<00:01:16.710> lips<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:19.020> does<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> fair<00:01:19.799> job<00:01:19.830> at

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
laptop lips it does a fair job at

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
laptop lips it does a fair job at
bringing<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.900> computer<00:01:22.290> off<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
bringing the the computer off the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
bringing the the computer off the
surface<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.060> keep<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.299> from<00:01:24.420> sliding<00:01:24.600> around

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
surface and keep it from sliding around

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.760 
surface and keep it from sliding around
but<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.750> effective<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.020> cooling<00:01:28.590> or

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
but not really effective it cooling or

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
but not really effective it cooling or
keeping<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.970> notebook<00:01:30.299> running<00:01:30.540> cool

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
keeping the notebook running cool

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.690 
keeping the notebook running cool
especially<00:01:30.979> when<00:01:31.979> i'm<00:01:32.070> running<00:01:32.189> CPU

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
especially when i'm running CPU

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
especially when i'm running CPU
intensive<00:01:32.880> apps<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.530> computer<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
intensive apps on the computer and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.289 
intensive apps on the computer and
griffins<00:01:35.880> elevator<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:37.200> only<00:01:37.500> looks<00:01:38.280> nice<00:01:38.549> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
griffins elevator not only looks nice it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
griffins elevator not only looks nice it
works<00:01:39.540> well<00:01:39.799> bringing<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.070> off<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> ground

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
works well bringing it up off the ground

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 
works well bringing it up off the ground
so<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:42.060> could<00:01:42.210> set<00:01:42.390> things<00:01:42.570> underneath<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> or

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so i could set things underneath it or

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.950 
so i could set things underneath it or
around<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.100> also<00:01:44.630> increasing<00:01:45.630> airflow

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
around it but also increasing airflow

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.069 
around it but also increasing airflow
underneath<00:01:46.939> the<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.420> computer<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> could

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
underneath the the computer and I could

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
underneath the the computer and I could
feel<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.380> specifically<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.090> front<00:01:51.390> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
feel it specifically on the front it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.389 
feel it specifically on the front it
would<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.409> gets<00:01:52.619> hot<00:01:52.890> where<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.280> would

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
would get it gets hot where I would

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.330 
would get it gets hot where I would
normally<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:54.630> rest<00:01:54.869> my<00:01:55.049> palms<00:01:55.470> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
normally you know rest my palms on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.039 
normally you know rest my palms on
either<00:01:56.520> side<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.240> mouse<00:01:57.390> pad<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.899> this

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
either side of the mouse pad on this
