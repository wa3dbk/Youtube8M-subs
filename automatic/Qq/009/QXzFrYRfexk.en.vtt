00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
you'll be able to hear where the parts

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580 
you'll be able to hear where the parts
change<00:00:09.150> so<00:00:09.599> I'll<00:00:09.960> just<00:00:10.170> kind<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.440> go<00:00:10.559> through

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.129 
change so I'll just kind of go through
what<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.099> playing<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.179> decide<00:00:12.960> what

what I'm playing and you can decide what

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.070 
what I'm playing and you can decide what
you<00:00:13.290> like<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.089> don't<00:00:15.089> play<00:00:15.330> everything<00:00:15.750> you

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
you like and don't play everything you

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.230 
you like and don't play everything you
don't<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.880> okay<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.470> the<00:00:19.760> basically<00:00:20.760> intro

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
don't like okay so the basically intro

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.950 
don't like okay so the basically intro
through<00:00:21.689> -<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> think<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:23.390> chorus<00:00:24.390> -<00:00:24.750> or

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
through - I think it's chorus - or

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.179 
through - I think it's chorus - or
something<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.529> remember<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.900> up<00:00:28.189> 1

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
something like I remember I do like up 1

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.799 
something like I remember I do like up 1
3<00:00:35.630> okay

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
3 okay

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.979 
3 okay
so<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.559> basically<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.790> good<00:00:39.120> between<00:00:39.660> these

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so I basically just good between these

00:00:39.989 --> 00:01:05.000 
so I basically just good between these
two<00:00:40.170> notes<00:00:40.440> go<00:01:03.049> up<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> high<00:01:04.530> G<00:01:04.769> right

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
two notes go up to that high G right

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.420 
two notes go up to that high G right
there

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
there

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.830 
there
grant<00:01:06.330> doesn't<00:01:06.689> mind<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.320> okay<00:01:11.600> okay<00:01:12.600> so

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
grant doesn't mind it's okay okay so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.219 
grant doesn't mind it's okay okay so
that's<00:01:13.619> because<00:01:14.040> Brandon<00:01:14.850> cancels<00:01:18.530> okay<00:01:19.530> so

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
that's because Brandon cancels okay so

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.870 
that's because Brandon cancels okay so
so<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> progression<00:01:23.460> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
so you can that's the progression a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.480 
so you can that's the progression a
minor<00:01:24.409> C<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> want<00:01:27.680> parts<00:01:28.680> maybe

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
minor C and then if you want parts maybe

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.760 
minor C and then if you want parts maybe
on<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> second<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> builds<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.650> bit

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
on the second as it builds a little bit

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.640 
on the second as it builds a little bit
you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.040> maybe<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.210> higher<00:01:33.450> G<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you can maybe go to the higher G for the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.310 
you can maybe go to the higher G for the
last<00:01:34.829> one<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.189> dead<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
last one is dead so there's that and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.770 
last one is dead so there's that and
then<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.860> switch<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.460> part<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:41.630> think<00:01:42.630> it's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
then I switch to this part I think it's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.270 
then I switch to this part I think it's
on<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> my<00:01:43.409> life<00:01:43.590> I've<00:01:43.829> been<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.070> Heidi

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
on the all of my life I've been in Heidi

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.740 
on the all of my life I've been in Heidi
in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> second<00:01:44.850> time<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.180> through<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
in the second time we go through that I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.580 
in the second time we go through that I
go<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.149> forget<00:01:48.149> exactly<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.990> rhythm<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
go I forget exactly the the rhythm of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
go I forget exactly the the rhythm of
the<00:01:49.770> picking<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.189> knew<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.490> someone

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.760 

so<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.660> forget<00:02:05.020> what<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:06.040> think<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.490> might<00:02:06.670> do

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
so I forget what I think I might do

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:18.000 
so I forget what I think I might do
that's<00:02:08.770> what<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.130> is

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.770 

so<00:02:19.010> that's<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.310> inversions<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
so that's just inversions on the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:36.820 
so that's just inversions on the
progression<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:34.690> okay<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.870> then<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.590> go<00:02:36.800> a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
progression so okay and then I go a

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.610 
progression so okay and then I go a
little<00:02:37.220> like<00:02:37.489> lead<00:02:38.360> line<00:02:38.780> while<00:02:39.140> he's<00:02:39.440> doing

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
little like lead line while he's doing

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.190 
little like lead line while he's doing
the<00:02:39.830> spoken-word<00:02:40.250> thing<00:02:40.840> there's<00:02:41.840> something

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
the spoken-word thing there's something

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.449 
the spoken-word thing there's something
like<00:02:42.349> this<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.920> kind<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.190> moved<00:02:43.370> around

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
like this I kind of moved around

00:02:43.459 --> 00:03:02.710 
like this I kind of moved around
different<00:02:43.730> parts<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.959> just<00:02:45.140> did<00:03:01.720> something

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
different parts so I just did something

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.350 
different parts so I just did something
like<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:03.110> little<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:04.250> then<00:03:04.850> on<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.120> part

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
like that a little and then on the part

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.140 
like that a little and then on the part
where<00:03:05.510> bills<00:03:05.720> did<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.140> Jesus<00:03:06.500> Jesus<00:03:07.120> how<00:03:08.120> I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
where bills did the Jesus Jesus how I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.740 
where bills did the Jesus Jesus how I
trust<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.489> basically<00:03:10.489> just<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:11.269> haven't

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
trust you I basically just I haven't

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.479 
trust you I basically just I haven't
really<00:03:12.019> settled<00:03:12.230> into<00:03:12.470> exactly<00:03:12.980> what<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.160> want

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
really settled into exactly what I want

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.940 
really settled into exactly what I want
but<00:03:13.819> I<00:03:13.880> wanted<00:03:14.180> something<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.600> was<00:03:15.350> melodic

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
but I wanted something that was melodic

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.930 
but I wanted something that was melodic
but<00:03:16.220> carried<00:03:16.910> some<00:03:17.299> sense<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.750> tension<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:19.910> I

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
but carried some sense of tension so I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.530 
but carried some sense of tension so I
was

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.340 

stuff<00:03:27.540> like<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.880> don't<00:03:30.240> know<00:03:30.420> just<00:03:31.140> chose

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.770 
through I try to keep things kind of
lower<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.860> then<00:03:44.250> when<00:03:44.520> it<00:03:44.640> really<00:03:45.090> builds<00:03:45.570> I

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
lower and then when it really builds I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.930 
lower and then when it really builds I
tried<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:46.860> give<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> little<00:03:47.280> intensity<00:03:47.670> by

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
tried to give it a little intensity by

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.260 
tried to give it a little intensity by
maybe<00:03:48.270> thrown<00:03:48.720> in<00:03:48.840> some<00:03:48.990> more<00:03:49.910> stuff<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.060> there

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
maybe thrown in some more stuff in there

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.090 
maybe thrown in some more stuff in there
so<00:03:51.780> that's<00:03:51.990> pretty<00:03:52.230> much<00:03:52.290> all<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.890> was

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
so that's pretty much all that I was

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.830 
so that's pretty much all that I was
doing<00:03:53.430> blah<00:03:54.150> blah<00:03:54.330> blah

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
doing blah blah blah

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.880 
doing blah blah blah
that<00:03:55.440> helps<00:03:55.950> what<00:03:56.280> delay<00:03:56.750> are<00:03:57.750> using<00:03:58.140> I<00:04:00.890> think

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
that helps what delay are using I think

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.930 
that helps what delay are using I think
I<00:04:02.010> was<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:02.250> using<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.670> dotted<00:04:03.090> quarter<00:04:04.940> I'm

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
I was just using a dotted quarter I'm

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.430 
I was just using a dotted quarter I'm
pretty<00:04:06.210> sure<00:04:06.330> that's<00:04:06.480> what's<00:04:06.690> doing<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.410> a

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
pretty sure that's what's doing like a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.320 
pretty sure that's what's doing like a
longer<00:04:07.770> dotted<00:04:08.220> quarter<00:04:08.550> with<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.000> good<00:04:09.240> number

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
longer dotted quarter with a good number

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.960 
longer dotted quarter with a good number
of<00:04:09.510> repeats<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.080> then<00:04:10.500> when<00:04:11.070> things<00:04:11.520> built<00:04:11.820> a

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
of repeats and then when things built a

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.200 
of repeats and then when things built a
little<00:04:12.120> bit<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.540> rolled<00:04:13.470> back<00:04:13.740> that<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.580> mix

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
little bit I rolled back that the mix

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.060 
little bit I rolled back that the mix
and<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.960> repeats<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.470> little<00:04:16.709> bit<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:17.010> it

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
and the repeats a little bit so it

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.110 
and the repeats a little bit so it
didn't<00:04:17.280> get<00:04:17.340> too<00:04:17.520> cloudy<00:04:19.970> stayed<00:04:20.970> pretty

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
didn't get too cloudy stayed pretty

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.240 
didn't get too cloudy stayed pretty
clean<00:04:21.510> throughout<00:04:21.900> most<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:23.070> only

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
clean throughout most of it the only

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.450 
clean throughout most of it the only
time<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.460> really<00:04:24.740> overdrive<00:04:25.740> on<00:04:25.920> was<00:04:26.130> on<00:04:26.280> that

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
time I really overdrive on was on that

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.090 
time I really overdrive on was on that
lead<00:04:26.790> just<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.240> give<00:04:27.390> it<00:04:27.420> a<00:04:27.630> kind<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.800> dirty

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
lead just to give it a kind of a dirty

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.060 
lead just to give it a kind of a dirty
sound<00:04:29.930> like<00:04:30.930> kind<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:33.680> kind<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.800> dirtier

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
sound like kind of kind of a dirtier

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.460 
sound like kind of kind of a dirtier
sound<00:04:35.340> then<00:04:35.640> on<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.880> octave<00:04:36.240> run<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.720> had<00:04:37.290> some

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
sound then on the octave run I had some

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.870 
sound then on the octave run I had some
overdrive<00:04:37.860> but<00:04:38.040> everything<00:04:38.370> else<00:04:38.520> did<00:04:38.700> pretty

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
overdrive but everything else did pretty

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.120 
overdrive but everything else did pretty
clean
