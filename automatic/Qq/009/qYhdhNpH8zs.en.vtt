guess someone could lend me one for the
video<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:04.019> I've<00:01:04.110> chosen<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
video but I've chosen not to do that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.179 
video but I've chosen not to do that
because<00:01:05.700> obviously<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.439> want<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> keep<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189

nice and fair and the best way to keep
track<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> being<00:01:10.830> fair<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
track of it being fair is to use the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
track of it being fair is to use the
same<00:01:12.390> setup<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.170> change<00:01:13.439> anything<00:01:13.680> just

the calculations of how much Shh p we've
lost<00:01:26.460> rather<00:01:27.150> than<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.659> food<00:01:28.400> because

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400

obviously<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.850> bit<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:42.329> click<00:01:42.600> intensive<00:01:43.170> or

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
obviously a bit more click intensive or

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.770 
obviously a bit more click intensive or
i<00:01:43.439> should<00:01:43.649> say<00:01:43.829> press<00:01:44.759> intensive<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.600> i

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
i should say press intensive because i

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.719 
i should say press intensive because i
do<00:01:45.840> use<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.799> keys<00:01:47.570> 120<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.960> then<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.380> dots<00:01:49.729> at

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
do use the keys 120 and then the dots at

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.609 
do use the keys 120 and then the dots at
the<00:01:50.759> bottom<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> screen<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.409> don't

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
the bottom of the screen which I don't

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.050 
the bottom of the screen which I don't
tend<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> use<00:01:53.070> much<00:01:53.310> because<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.610> usually<00:01:54.030> just

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
tend to use much because I usually just

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.420 
tend to use much because I usually just
click<00:01:54.450> kick<00:01:54.840> or<00:01:55.140> anticipation<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.189> something

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
click kick or anticipation or something

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.789 
click kick or anticipation or something
like<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.420> yeah<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.049> we're<00:01:58.259> killing<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
like that but yeah so we're killing it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.289 
like that but yeah so we're killing it
as<00:01:58.920> quickly<00:01:59.159> as<00:01:59.399> possible<00:01:59.430> using<00:02:00.000> all

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
as quickly as possible using all

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:00.820 
as quickly as possible using all
different

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
different

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.640 
different
Bertie's<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:01.840> just<00:02:02.840> trying<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.290> get<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.620> down

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
Bertie's and just trying to get it down

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.610 
Bertie's and just trying to get it down
as<00:02:03.950> faster<00:02:04.520> because<00:02:05.030> i<00:02:05.180> do<00:02:05.240> want<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.840> i<00:02:06.230> mean<00:02:06.410> i

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
as faster because i do want to i mean i

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.830 
as faster because i do want to i mean i
know<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.100> being<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.580> bit<00:02:07.790> biased<00:02:08.210> but<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.750> do

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
know this is being a bit biased but I do

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.870 
know this is being a bit biased but I do
want<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.500> prove<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.920> EEOC<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.430> better<00:02:10.729> than

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
want to prove the EEOC is better than

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.840 
want to prove the EEOC is better than
the<00:02:10.970> legacy<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.470> could<00:02:13.250> say<00:02:13.460> I'm<00:02:13.580> trying

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the legacy so I could say I'm trying

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.820 
the legacy so I could say I'm trying
harder<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.360> EEOC<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.380> be<00:02:15.410> fair<00:02:15.530> you

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
harder on the EEOC but to be fair you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.610 
harder on the EEOC but to be fair you
have<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.160> try<00:02:16.340> harder<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.940> see<00:02:17.380> because<00:02:18.380> it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
have to try harder on you see because it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.500 
have to try harder on you see because it
obviously<00:02:18.740> does<00:02:19.280> require<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.670> lot<00:02:20.000> more<00:02:20.030> button

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
obviously does require a lot more button

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.780 
obviously does require a lot more button
pressing<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.650> could<00:02:21.860> say<00:02:22.070> legacy<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.760> a

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
pressing and you could say legacy is a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.030 
pressing and you could say legacy is a
bit<00:02:23.120> simpler<00:02:24.050> when<00:02:24.470> you're<00:02:24.530> wearing<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.860> kilt

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
bit simpler when you're wearing the kilt

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.550 
bit simpler when you're wearing the kilt
I'm<00:02:25.250> one<00:02:25.430> legacy<00:02:25.730> was<00:02:26.000> one<00:02:26.240> minute<00:02:26.540> 11<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.140> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
I'm one legacy was one minute 11 and the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.350 
I'm one legacy was one minute 11 and the
HP<00:02:27.770> loss<00:02:28.160> was<00:02:28.420> 929<00:02:29.420> at<00:02:30.010> 921<00:02:31.010> sorry<00:02:31.520> because<00:02:32.180> if

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
HP loss was 929 at 921 sorry because if

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.840 
HP loss was 929 at 921 sorry because if
you<00:02:32.480> did<00:02:32.690> remember<00:02:32.870> we<00:02:33.290> were<00:02:33.470> down<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:34.010> 69<00:02:34.460> Life

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
you did remember we were down to 69 Life

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.280 
you did remember we were down to 69 Life
Points<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:36.100> obviously<00:02:37.480> 990<00:02:38.480> minus<00:02:38.930> sixty

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
Points and obviously 990 minus sixty

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.330 
Points and obviously 990 minus sixty
nine<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.640> 921<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:42.050> quite<00:02:42.350> often<00:02:42.620> hip<00:02:42.950> points

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
nine is 921 so quite often hip points

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.020 
nine is 921 so quite often hip points
lost<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:44.150> did<00:02:44.720> decide<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.140> not<00:02:45.560> eat<00:02:45.740> obviously

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
lost I did decide to not eat obviously

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.360 
lost I did decide to not eat obviously
just<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.240> see<00:02:48.110> if<00:02:48.260> we<00:02:48.380> could<00:02:48.410> not<00:02:48.800> eat<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.190> just

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
just to see if we could not eat and just

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.660 
just to see if we could not eat and just
do<00:02:49.520> HP<00:02:49.970> loss<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.650> yeah<00:02:51.650> that's<00:02:51.800> why<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.070> did<00:02:52.370> so

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
do HP loss and yeah that's why I did so

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.860 
do HP loss and yeah that's why I did so
921<00:02:53.570> now<00:02:53.959> let's<00:02:54.110> go<00:02:54.290> over<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.620> EOC<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:56.420> as<00:02:56.600> we

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
921 now let's go over to EOC so as we

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.680 
921 now let's go over to EOC so as we
roll<00:02:57.230> over<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.709> EOC<00:02:58.280> we<00:02:58.550> see<00:02:58.760> there<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.300> big

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
roll over to EOC we see there is a big

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.800 
roll over to EOC we see there is a big
difference<00:02:59.870> in<00:03:00.350> kill<00:03:00.920> time<00:03:01.160> an<00:03:01.400> HP<00:03:01.880> lost<00:03:02.090> so

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
difference in kill time an HP lost so

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.680 
difference in kill time an HP lost so
we'll<00:03:02.990> go<00:03:03.140> over<00:03:03.170> kill<00:03:03.680> time<00:03:03.890> first<00:03:04.220> 52<00:03:05.060> seconds

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
we'll go over kill time first 52 seconds

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.310 
we'll go over kill time first 52 seconds
that's<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.650> whopping<00:03:06.980> wait<00:03:07.610> having<00:03:07.910> 19<00:03:08.630> seconds

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
that's a whopping wait having 19 seconds

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.420 
that's a whopping wait having 19 seconds
faster<00:03:09.890> than<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.790> legacy<00:03:11.530> HP<00:03:12.530> loss<00:03:12.830> comes<00:03:13.190> to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
faster than the legacy HP loss comes to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.390 
faster than the legacy HP loss comes to
400<00:03:13.940> 17.5<00:03:14.870> because<00:03:15.230> obviously<00:03:15.440> were<00:03:15.890> we<00:03:16.220> were

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
400 17.5 because obviously were we were

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.520 
400 17.5 because obviously were we were
on<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.820> see<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.360> we<00:03:17.480> had<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.780> divide<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.320> by

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
on you see so we had to divide that by

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.160 
on you see so we had to divide that by
10<00:03:18.800> it<00:03:19.190> was<00:03:19.480> 5.1<00:03:20.480> k<00:03:20.750> HP<00:03:21.620> lost<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.760> yeah<00:03:23.150> 400<00:03:23.900> HP

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
10 it was 5.1 k HP lost so yeah 400 HP

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.449 
10 it was 5.1 k HP lost so yeah 400 HP
on<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:25.100> legacy<00:03:26.290> difference<00:03:27.290> which<00:03:27.560> means<00:03:27.860> EOC

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
on the legacy difference which means EOC

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.979 
on the legacy difference which means EOC
is<00:03:28.580> definitely<00:03:29.030> more<00:03:29.180> efficient<00:03:29.630> for<00:03:29.660> killing

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
is definitely more efficient for killing

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.310 
is definitely more efficient for killing
kbd<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:31.060> yes<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.330> that's<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.780> niall<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.110> EEOC

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
kbd and yes so that's to niall to EEOC

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.220 
kbd and yes so that's to niall to EEOC
so<00:03:33.769> far<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.160> this<00:03:34.250> series<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.840> yeah<00:03:36.019> this

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
so far in this series but yeah this

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.990 
so far in this series but yeah this
episode<00:03:36.709> has<00:03:36.920> been<00:03:36.980> slightly<00:03:37.519> shorter

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
episode has been slightly shorter

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.820 
episode has been slightly shorter
because<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.420> King<00:03:38.780> black<00:03:39.019> dragon<00:03:39.320> kills<00:03:39.530> to

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
because the King black dragon kills to
