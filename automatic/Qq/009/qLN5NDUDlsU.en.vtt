00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.059
 Basque Country Spain 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.470
 not luxury innovation is luxury and 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.880
 the burial in evolution 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.449
 the investigation 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.769
 and the world, however, it is necessary to go forward 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.239
 and the vanguard 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.300
 this is why the Spanish cuisine at this moment are spear point 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.040
 for the vanguard 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.000
 for cutting-edge cuisine in research and return 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.740
 not for the traditional cuisine of before monuments like italy are 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.410
 avant-garde also 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.620
 and in the world spearhead for its modern cuisine 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 good very simple you have on the other side of the author 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.380

 with claw and fishing identities german and genetic experience heirs 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.670
 cultural of a town 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.520
 but with the feet in the world 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.760
 open wing cultural exchange very important 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.570
 and then what we do and go around the world 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.570
 let's see catch look learning 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.720
 we come to change them this land does not 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.660
 and we think in Basque 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.620
 because I'm a bit against globalization 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.850
 I believe that every town must know why you eat where you are 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.850
 that you are in a different place 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.960
 that does not happen like modern music 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.670
 that you and esaú back and that to one or a fixed poum 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340
 hoare or to a rapture 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.300
 idc close your eyes do not know if you are in new york 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.030
 if you are in canada 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 if you are in milano in rome or madrid 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.300
 you for what you are eating you have to know that you are in a place 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.800
 different 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.820
 Freud poor as he eats or eats as he is 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.659
 I am is undoubted as commented a town is one way or another 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.770
 return 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.680
 research 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.030
 yd 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.450
 inspected vanguard and even worse 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.450
 means 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.549
 that all dishes that we make in our kitchen are nowhere else 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.099
 but that was to finish with another important thing what a chef is 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.089
 the pineda cook who see the world with chef's eyes 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.629
 for example a traffic light 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.609
 a chocolate with three buttons with 3d can diego and with chocolate with three 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.569
 colors 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.319
 a can of cola-bent 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.349
 olp a chocolate in which I can do well 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.879
 and then for example 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.249
 you have to 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.379
 capacity for amazement 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.229
 all things have to amaze 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.529
 and is that having the most important humility by anyone teaches you 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:42.459
 Well, to be able to be amazed 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.799
 you have to think like a child 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.009
 yes no these losses of 15 stain 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:49.139
 and is that let it go down
