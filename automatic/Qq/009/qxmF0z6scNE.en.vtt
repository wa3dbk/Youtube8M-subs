00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.110
 less than I expected 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.659
 what can be done 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.279

 incommunicado history has gone for electronic headquarters music the night is 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.069
 how more frivolous it is or not 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.120

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:47.659

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.180
 to the airport 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.810
 mt 6 the test before the modest firmly that it is true that we are 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.500
 proudly dogwood when sectioning me Leonard Cohen is not something you do in the 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.129
 repertoire usually 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.610
 not to the pruning tasks for this occasion yes 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.290
 tibán has been something strange because cancer five posts to be the other three to 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.610
 zero as I have spent a little bit to the rest of the group 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.099
 but oh but we have had a great time and what we are in the same 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.270
 second disc 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.569
 and the truth is that we are already a whistle and have to have it prepared and good 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.729
 we send that we go out with the 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.820

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:31.819
 we will work now 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.889
 I think we all really want to do something but we're also a bit 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.389
 scorched 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:05.389
 and with a feeling like at night 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.099
 the match 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:11.960
 as to the councilors that is amazing 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.879
 than an NGO that says it's your 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.219
 that its purpose is to disappear 

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:21.960
 for the people you want to be dissatisfied with your band 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.740
 the generation of more 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.740
 more hungry more eager to do things and maybe I do not 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.419
 the information or less possibilities of where to start 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.999

 around here and at a very domestic level is very basic but 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:41.990
 no less important than 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.530
 that what the bonus does these people estimated that moves to a much higher level 

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:45.979
 big no
