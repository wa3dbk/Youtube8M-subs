that we've borrowed and spent and we are

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
created an economy a phony economy that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.780 
created an economy a phony economy that
is<00:01:54.570> completely<00:01:55.290> dependent<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.340> ability

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
is completely dependent on the ability

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.370 
is completely dependent on the ability
to<00:01:56.850> keep<00:01:57.060> borrowing<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.810> money<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.170> we

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
to keep borrowing more money that we

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.069 
to keep borrowing more money that we
can't<00:01:58.590> pay<00:01:58.740> back<00:01:58.920> now<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.030> did<00:02:00.270> say<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.719> part

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
can't pay back now you did say that part

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.440 
can't pay back now you did say that part
of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> problem<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.710> our<00:02:02.159> debt<00:02:02.490> isn't<00:02:03.030> really

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
of the problem is our debt isn't really

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.730 
of the problem is our debt isn't really
the<00:02:03.570> debt<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> persistent<00:02:04.619> unemployment

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
the debt or the persistent unemployment

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.889 
the debt or the persistent unemployment
that's<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> root<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.820> our<00:02:05.909> economic<00:02:06.119> woes<00:02:06.600> at

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that's the root of our economic woes at

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.520 
that's the root of our economic woes at
this<00:02:07.049> point<00:02:08.660> well<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:10.200> are<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.379> reasons

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
this point well what are the reasons

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.260 
this point well what are the reasons
that<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.280> much<00:02:11.430> debt<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.849> because<00:02:12.120> we

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that we have so much debt is because we

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.950 
that we have so much debt is because we
have<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> lot<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.720> unemployed<00:02:13.050> people

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
have a lot of unemployed people

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.630 
have a lot of unemployed people
and<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.470> course<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.830> have<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> lot<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.310> people

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
and of course we have a lot of people

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.150 
and of course we have a lot of people
who<00:02:15.730> are<00:02:15.940> employed<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.630> non<00:02:17.290> productive<00:02:17.620> ways

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
who are employed in non productive ways

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.070 
who are employed in non productive ways
that's<00:02:18.970> also<00:02:19.360> part<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.690> problem<00:02:19.930> that's

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
that's also part of the problem that's

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.810 
that's also part of the problem that's
why<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.380> have<00:02:20.470> such<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> large<00:02:20.890> trade<00:02:21.280> deficit

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
why we have such a large trade deficit

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.880 
why we have such a large trade deficit
but<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.240> lot<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.170> fault<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
but a lot of this is the fault of the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
but a lot of this is the fault of the
central<00:02:24.340> government<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.790> federal

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
problem well not yet but it's the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.950 
problem well not yet but it's the
enormity<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.400> problem<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:16.060> starts<00:03:16.510> off<00:03:16.690> as

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
enormity of the problem it starts off as

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.300 
enormity of the problem it starts off as
a<00:03:16.990> small<00:03:17.380> problem<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:17.890> like<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.160> know<00:03:18.250> you

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
a small problem it's like you know you

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.490 
a small problem it's like you know you
can<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:18.970> can<00:03:19.180> get<00:03:19.360> cancer<00:03:19.870> but<00:03:20.020> you<00:03:20.110> don't<00:03:20.260> die

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
can you can get cancer but you don't die

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.490 
can you can get cancer but you don't die
right<00:03:20.920> away<00:03:21.210> you<00:03:22.210> have<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.570> wait<00:03:22.750> until<00:03:22.930> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
right away you have to wait until the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.460 
right away you have to wait until the
disease<00:03:24.220> grows<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.180> point<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:26.020> it

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
kills you and you know our debt was a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.720 
kills you and you know our debt was a
cancer<00:03:28.750> but<00:03:29.290> it's<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.800> taking<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.250> long<00:03:30.430> time

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730

cancer but it's it's taking a long time
for<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.210> disease<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.900> progress<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.710> I<00:03:33.370> guess

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
for the disease to progress and I guess

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.090 
for the disease to progress and I guess
it's<00:03:33.760> not<00:03:33.940> fatal<00:03:34.390> at<00:03:34.660> this<00:03:34.840> very<00:03:35.320> second<00:03:35.890> but

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
it's not fatal at this very second but

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.860 
it's not fatal at this very second but
it<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.430> know<00:03:36.550> we're<00:03:36.700> really<00:03:36.880> close<00:03:37.210> to<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.690> if

it you know we're really close to it if

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.530 
huge potentially global ramifications if
it<00:05:09.229> reverberates<00:05:09.500> throughout<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.160> economy

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
it reverberates throughout the economy

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.659 
it reverberates throughout the economy
so<00:05:11.540> it's<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.780> massive<00:05:12.320> problem<00:05:12.770> in<00:05:12.889> yet<00:05:13.040> no<00:05:13.460> one

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
so it's a massive problem in yet no one

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.610 
so it's a massive problem in yet no one
