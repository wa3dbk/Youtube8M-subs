00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
in the Battle of the labyrinth which is

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:12.969 
in the Battle of the labyrinth which is
the<00:05:11.599> fourth<00:05:11.810> book<00:05:12.020> in<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.259> Percy<00:05:12.560> Jackson

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
the fourth book in the Percy Jackson

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.460 
the fourth book in the Percy Jackson
series<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:13.580> then<00:05:14.180> there<00:05:14.599> is<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.990> assassin's

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
series and then there is the assassin's

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.170 
series and then there is the assassin's
blade<00:05:15.650> which<00:05:16.039> will<00:05:16.250> probably<00:05:16.460> actually<00:05:17.030> take

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
blade which will probably actually take

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.839 
blade which will probably actually take
me<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.510> most<00:05:17.690> out<00:05:18.050> of<00:05:18.530> all<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.889> these<00:05:19.099> books<00:05:19.520> to

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
me the most out of all of these books to

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.000 
me the most out of all of these books to
