00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.070
 this is the material you need a skirt 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.670
 of denim or a denim short 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.750
 you need a piece of cloth pearls 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.180
 lace thread and needle scissors moon and 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.369
 reggae 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.800
 you will also use some application 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.700
 in brillitos that are doing in the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 big haberdashery a league and a 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.860
 container with 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.440
 The first thing we are going to do is with all 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.720
 the hem of your skirt you're going to go 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 the edge cited and you're going to cut the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.220
 Bastilla sell a few listeners 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 special but I do not have then what 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.770
 What I do is put the scissors short and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.170
 I'm pulling and they are discussing a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.390
 little tricks and so I'm going to go 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.540
 all over the shore until there is 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 finished the entire hem once 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.150
 finished pill now what are you going to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.790
 to do is if your bag has forgiveness if your 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.700
 skirt has bags here your brand of a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.810
 figure on the bag that you like 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.579
 I'm going to make this bag has 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.670
 a shape of an irregular polygon 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:31.590
 logical to do is leaving a margin more or 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.640
 less than one centimeter 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.980
 I'm going to mark 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.600
 the figure that it carries is the same 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.110
 the bag well 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.110
 A) Yes 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.320
 and so 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.219
 more or less like that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.369
 and then I will remember all the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.789
 outline of the figure that traces with the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.789
 feather 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.360
 with a piece of cloth you will introduce it 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.500
 through the hole you made 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.350
 thus 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.180
 and you have to accommodate it well and since 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.180
 you're well-off, you're going to meet her 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.990
 That building 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.970
 and good the point is that it must be 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.900
 accommodate and there is the fabric and things for 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.970
 all the edge and you will stay like this now 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.360
 what you are going to do is you are going to take the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.520
 lace and you're going to put it in all the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.620
 little hill and I want to put it in the other 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.100
 little bag but you can put it where 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.370
 you like it more and then give it cut 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.720
 Orillita and you're going to meet him in Pelinka 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.540
 which can be the color that you 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.820
 like you will stay like this now what 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.640
 you're going to do is with a pen or with a 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.600
 down you're going to score points so that 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.520
 go to stick pearls 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.830
 in those different points and of 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.130
 different sizes here you can hit 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.320
 crystals or because it sticks and the way you see 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.840
 I have it in the video of a clutch 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.240

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.150
 these pearls then I will sew them and 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.310
 come back and when he throws them sewn you 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.280
 is going to stay like this now what are you going to do 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.680
 is with these applications that are like 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.730
 for party dresses I'm going to 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.900
 put in this part of the sachet and the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.599
 I'm going to sew 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.290
 and then you stay like this now 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.470
 Last, what you are going to do is take your 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.470
 list 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.540
 and you're going to put them on tightly 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.659
 program that goes in all the parts 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.620
 here you can decide how high 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.060
 you want me to be I almost want it to be 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.060
