00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.660 
in our second lesson on chapter 5
protein<00:00:04.259> function<00:00:04.770> we<00:00:05.250> want<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.549> look

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
protein function we want to look

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.639 
protein function we want to look
specifically<00:00:06.270> at<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.600> binding<00:00:06.870> affinity<00:00:07.170> of

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
specifically at the binding affinity of

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.360 
specifically at the binding affinity of
myoglobin<00:00:09.410> first<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.530> all<00:00:10.650> we<00:00:10.769> want<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> define

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
myoglobin first of all we want to define

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.759 
myoglobin first of all we want to define
a<00:00:11.429> constant<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.300> indicate<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.080> equilibrium

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
a constant to indicate the equilibrium

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.189 
a constant to indicate the equilibrium
binding<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.370> oxygen<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:15.480> let's<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> simple

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
binding of oxygen so let's do a simple

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.250 
binding of oxygen so let's do a simple
case<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:17.190> have<00:00:17.400> unbound<00:00:18.000> myoglobin<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
case we have unbound myoglobin on the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.769 
case we have unbound myoglobin on the
left<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:20.070> got<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.369> bind<00:00:20.580> oxygen<00:00:20.910> here's<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
left it's got to bind oxygen here's the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.750 
left it's got to bind oxygen here's the
bound<00:00:22.020> form<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.580> there's

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
bound form on the right and so there's

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970 
bound form on the right and so there's
an<00:00:23.939> equilibrium<00:00:24.420> between<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.050> unbound<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
an equilibrium between the unbound and

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.029 
an equilibrium between the unbound and
bound<00:00:26.340> forms<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.599> now<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.140> come<00:00:28.859> up<00:00:29.010> with

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
bound forms so now we can come up with

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.349 
bound forms so now we can come up with
an<00:00:29.279> expression<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.000> equilibrium

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
an expression for an equilibrium

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.269 
an expression for an equilibrium
constant<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.289> would<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.619> an<00:00:31.710> association

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
constant this would be an association

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.430 
constant this would be an association
constant<00:00:33.059> remember<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.570> always<00:00:33.750> products

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
constant remember it's always products

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.069 
constant remember it's always products
over<00:00:34.829> reactants<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> ratio<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
over reactants so this is the ratio of

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.369 
over reactants so this is the ratio of
bound<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:38.100> unbound<00:00:39.079> instead<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.230> an

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
bound to unbound instead of an

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.799 
bound to unbound instead of an
association<00:00:40.950> constant<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.059> could<00:00:42.329> express<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
association constant we could express a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
association constant we could express a
dissociation<00:00:43.620> constant<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.090> case

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
dissociation constant in which case

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.940 
dissociation constant in which case
we're<00:00:45.570> looking<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> equilibrium<00:00:46.559> from

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
we're looking at the equilibrium from

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.160 
we're looking at the equilibrium from
the<00:00:47.010> opposite<00:00:47.579> point<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.059> view<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> we're

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the opposite point of view that is we're

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.130 
the opposite point of view that is we're
starting<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.739> myoglobin<00:00:50.160> bound<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.210> moving

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
starting with myoglobin bound and moving

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.130 
starting with myoglobin bound and moving
towards<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> unbound<00:00:53.160> form<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.840> can

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
towards the unbound form so now we can

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.520 
towards the unbound form so now we can
develop<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:56.390> dissociation<00:00:57.390> content<00:00:58.199> another

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
develop a dissociation content another

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.459 
develop a dissociation content another
equilibrium<00:00:59.340> constant<00:00:59.940> again<00:01:00.210> products<00:01:01.050> over

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
equilibrium constant again products over

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.340 
equilibrium constant again products over
reactants<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.910> case<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
reactants in this case it's the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
reactants in this case it's the
relationship<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.519> unbound<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> bound

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
relationship of the unbound to the bound

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.649 
relationship of the unbound to the bound
in<00:01:07.320> either<00:01:08.100> case<00:01:08.460> where<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.030> an<00:01:09.150> association

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
in either case where it's an association

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.350 
in either case where it's an association
constant<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.650> dissociation<00:01:11.490> constant<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
constant or dissociation constant is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
constant or dissociation constant is
still<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> measure<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.799> affinity<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
still a measure of the affinity of

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.550 
still a measure of the affinity of
myoglobin<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:15.299> oxygen<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
myoglobin for oxygen from the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
myoglobin for oxygen from the
association<00:01:17.369> point<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.820> view<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.600> how

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
association point of view it's how

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.560 
association point of view it's how
readily<00:01:19.229> does<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.650> bind<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.880> dissociation

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
readily does it bind in the dissociation

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.740 
readily does it bind in the dissociation
how<00:01:22.049> readily<00:01:22.380> does<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> let<00:01:22.950> go<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.369> oxygen

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
how readily does it let go of oxygen

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.280 
how readily does it let go of oxygen
for<00:01:25.440> most<00:01:26.100> biochemists<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.970> consider<00:01:27.450> binding

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
for most biochemists we consider binding

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.470 
for most biochemists we consider binding
constants<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.070> terms<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.640> dissociation

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
constants in terms of a dissociation

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.600 
constants in terms of a dissociation
constant<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.620> it's<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> latter<00:01:32.280> case

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
constant and so it's the latter case

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.370 
constant and so it's the latter case
we'll<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:33.000> looking<00:01:33.360> at<00:01:33.510> here<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
we'll be looking at here and so the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.950 
we'll be looking at here and so the
question<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:38.040> once<00:01:38.430> myoglobin<00:01:38.970> binds<00:01:39.480> oxygen

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
question is once myoglobin binds oxygen

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.950 
question is once myoglobin binds oxygen
how<00:01:40.680> tightly<00:01:41.190> does<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.790> hold<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.240> how<00:01:42.540> likely

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
how tightly does it hold on how likely

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.020 
how tightly does it hold on how likely
is<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.530> dissociate<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.880> our

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
is it to dissociate that is our

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.570 
is it to dissociate that is our
equilibrium<00:01:45.510> expression<00:01:45.920> on<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> bottom<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
equilibrium expression on the bottom of

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.110 
equilibrium expression on the bottom of
the<00:01:48.210> screen<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.830> you'll<00:01:50.010> notice<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
the screen here now you'll notice as the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.600 
the screen here now you'll notice as the
affinity<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.750> myoglobin<00:01:52.620> for<00:01:53.040> oxygen

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
affinity of myoglobin for oxygen

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.060 
affinity of myoglobin for oxygen
increases<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.780> concentration<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.830> bound

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
increases the concentration of the bound

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
increases the concentration of the bound
form<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.910> increase<00:01:57.720> that's<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.470> our

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
form will increase that's in our

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.500 
form will increase that's in our
denominator<00:01:59.310> which<00:01:59.850> means<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
denominator which means that the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.719 
denominator which means that the
numerical<00:02:01.200> value<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.770> our<00:02:01.920> equilibrium

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
numerical value of our equilibrium

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.840 
numerical value of our equilibrium
constant<00:02:03.479> will<00:02:03.600> decrease<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.160> as<00:02:05.340> binding

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
constant will decrease so as binding

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.999 
constant will decrease so as binding
affinity<00:02:06.360> increases<00:02:07.260> our<00:02:07.650> K<00:02:07.979> value<00:02:08.010> decreases

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
affinity increases our K value decreases

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.199 
affinity increases our K value decreases
now<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.160> we<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.400> an<00:02:11.490> expression<00:02:11.700> for<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
now that we have an expression for that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.630 
now that we have an expression for that
equilibrium<00:02:12.630> constant<00:02:13.100> we<00:02:14.100> want<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> be<00:02:14.520> able

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
equilibrium constant we want to be able

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.880 
equilibrium constant we want to be able
to<00:02:14.790> measure<00:02:15.030> how<00:02:15.330> much<00:02:15.510> oxygen<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.350> actually

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
to measure how much oxygen is actually

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.949 
to measure how much oxygen is actually
bound<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.090> let's<00:02:18.330> come<00:02:18.570> up<00:02:18.720> with<00:02:18.870> an

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
bound and so let's come up with an

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.570 
bound and so let's come up with an
expression<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.740> that'll<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.459> our

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
expression for that that'll be our

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.900 
expression for that that'll be our
fractional<00:02:21.180> saturation<00:02:21.959> or<00:02:22.200> Y<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.520> it's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
fractional saturation or Y so it's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.449 
fractional saturation or Y so it's
simply<00:02:24.390> an<00:02:24.660> expression<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.830> fraction<00:02:26.370> of

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
simply an expression of the fraction of

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.000 
simply an expression of the fraction of
the<00:02:26.760> bound<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> total<00:02:28.590> amount<00:02:28.920> of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the bound to the total amount of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.100 
the bound to the total amount of
myoglobin<00:02:29.280> that's<00:02:29.880> present<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.019> our

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
myoglobin that's present so in our

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.870 
myoglobin that's present so in our
expression<00:02:31.590> here<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:31.980> have<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> total<00:02:32.610> amount

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
expression here we have the total amount

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.150 
expression here we have the total amount
of<00:02:33.000> myoglobin<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:34.200> would<00:02:34.380> either<00:02:34.620> be<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
of myoglobin it would either be in the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.250 
of myoglobin it would either be in the
unbound<00:02:35.700> or<00:02:35.940> bound<00:02:36.150> form<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:36.870> again<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
unbound or bound form so again the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.870 
unbound or bound form so again the
denominator<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.070> total<00:02:38.220> amount<00:02:38.790> of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
denominator is the total amount of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.449 
denominator is the total amount of
myoglobin<00:02:39.180> out<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.440> total<00:02:40.800> myoglobin

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
myoglobin out of the total myoglobin

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.190 
myoglobin out of the total myoglobin
that's<00:02:41.880> present<00:02:42.330> how<00:02:42.660> much<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.019> actually

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that's present how much is actually

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.030 
that's present how much is actually
bound<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:44.160> oxygen

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
bound to oxygen

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.949 
bound to oxygen
now<00:02:46.640> we<00:02:46.700> want<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.090> combine<00:02:47.269> these<00:02:47.689> two

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
now we want to combine these two

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.309 
now we want to combine these two
expressions<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.970> we<00:02:50.120> can<00:02:50.420> see<00:02:51.170> the

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
expressions so that we can see the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.740 
expressions so that we can see the
relationship<00:02:52.129> between<00:02:52.159> the<00:02:52.970> equilibrium

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
relationship between the equilibrium

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.899 
relationship between the equilibrium
constant<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.650> fractional<00:02:55.129> saturation

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
constant and the fractional saturation

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.600 
constant and the fractional saturation
in<00:02:56.060> other<00:02:56.510> words<00:02:56.780> how<00:02:57.530> does<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:58.069> affinity<00:02:58.579> of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
in other words how does the affinity of

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.670 
in other words how does the affinity of
myoglobin<00:02:58.939> for<00:02:59.510> oxygen<00:03:00.110> that's<00:03:00.470> our

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
myoglobin for oxygen that's our

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.890 
myoglobin for oxygen that's our
equilibrium<00:03:01.099> constant<00:03:01.569> relate<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
equilibrium constant relate to the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.899 
equilibrium constant relate to the

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
degree to which it is saturated with

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.510 
degree to which it is saturated with
oxygen<00:03:05.090> our<00:03:05.810> fractional<00:03:06.409> saturation<00:03:07.099> why

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.580 

when<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.180> combine<00:03:11.390> these<00:03:11.750> two<00:03:11.960> expressions

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
when we combine these two expressions

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.560 
when we combine these two expressions
let's<00:03:13.040> first<00:03:13.340> rearrange<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:14.150> expression

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
let's first rearrange that expression

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.320 
let's first rearrange that expression
for<00:03:14.930> K<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.250> now<00:03:16.460> we<00:03:16.520> have<00:03:16.670> an<00:03:16.910> expression

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
for K and so now we have an expression

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.480 
for K and so now we have an expression
for<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.690> concentration<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.680> bound<00:03:18.920> form

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
for the concentration of the bound form

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.340 
for the concentration of the bound form
and<00:03:19.760> we're<00:03:19.880> going<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.030> substitute<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.810> in

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
and we're going to substitute that in

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.520 
and we're going to substitute that in
our<00:03:21.800> expression<00:03:22.370> for<00:03:22.400> why<00:03:22.940> we<00:03:23.900> do<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.320> in<00:03:24.440> the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
our expression for why we do that in the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.650 
our expression for why we do that in the
bottom<00:03:24.830> of<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.070> screen<00:03:25.310> left<00:03:25.790> here<00:03:26.300> we've

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
bottom of the screen left here we've

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.890 
bottom of the screen left here we've
substituted<00:03:27.140> at<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.830> expression<00:03:28.280> in<00:03:28.900> for

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
substituted at that expression in for

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.950 
substituted at that expression in for
our<00:03:30.200> expression<00:03:31.130> for<00:03:31.160> Y<00:03:31.520> we<00:03:32.420> can<00:03:32.570> simplify

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
our expression for Y we can simplify

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.620 
our expression for Y we can simplify
that<00:03:33.380> algebraically<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.610> then<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:35.300> notice

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
that algebraically and then we notice

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.390 
that algebraically and then we notice
secondly<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.350> we<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.710> concentration

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
secondly that we have the concentration

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.520 
secondly that we have the concentration
of<00:03:37.490> myoglobin<00:03:37.850> in<00:03:38.330> all<00:03:38.570> three<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:38.990> our<00:03:39.140> terms

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
of myoglobin in all three of our terms

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.710 
of myoglobin in all three of our terms
and<00:03:39.860> so<00:03:39.950> we<00:03:40.070> can<00:03:40.250> cancel<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.700> out<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.300> now

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
and so we can cancel that out and now

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.410 
and so we can cancel that out and now
we've<00:03:41.930> simplified<00:03:42.440> our<00:03:42.830> expression<00:03:43.460> so<00:03:44.240> the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
we've simplified our expression so the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.630 
we've simplified our expression so the
fractional<00:03:44.960> saturation<00:03:45.770> is<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:45.920> function<00:03:46.520> of

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
fractional saturation is a function of

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.570 
fractional saturation is a function of
oxygen<00:03:47.360> concentration<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.440> that

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
oxygen concentration and that

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.300 
oxygen concentration and that
equilibrium<00:03:49.580> constant<00:03:50.980> well<00:03:51.980> how<00:03:52.130> would<00:03:52.190> we

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
equilibrium constant well how would we

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.450 
equilibrium constant well how would we
measure<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:53.120> concentration<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.230> gas<00:03:54.460> that

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
measure the concentration of a gas that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.520 
measure the concentration of a gas that
would<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.940> partial<00:03:56.360> pressure<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:57.260> in<00:03:57.380> this

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
would be the partial pressure so in this

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.290 
would be the partial pressure so in this
case<00:03:57.800> it's<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.190> partial<00:03:58.610> pressure<00:03:58.880> of<00:03:59.030> oxygen

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
case it's the partial pressure of oxygen

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.410 
case it's the partial pressure of oxygen
the<00:03:59.780> po2<00:04:00.200> so<00:04:01.040> here's<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.430> final<00:04:01.670> form<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.240> our

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
the po2 so here's the final form of our

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.590 
the po2 so here's the final form of our
expression<00:04:02.990> on<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.620> right<00:04:03.830> here<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:05.120> simply

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
expression on the right here so simply

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.990 
expression on the right here so simply
stated<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:06.410> fractional<00:04:06.950> saturation<00:04:07.700> that<00:04:07.730> is

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
stated the fractional saturation that is

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.090 
stated the fractional saturation that is
the<00:04:08.210> degree<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.660> which<00:04:08.840> myoglobin<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.860> bound

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
the degree to which myoglobin is bound

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320

the<00:04:18.410> concentration<00:04:19.160> of<00:04:19.250> oxygen<00:04:19.700> our<00:04:19.970> partial

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
have a very good friend and so a high

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.560 
have a very good friend and so a high
affinity<00:04:26.720> for<00:04:26.960> this<00:04:27.230> person

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
affinity for this person

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.040 
affinity for this person
that's<00:04:29.230> our<00:04:29.410> K<00:04:29.620> value<00:04:30.030> but<00:04:31.030> it's<00:04:31.300> not<00:04:31.510> just<00:04:31.810> a

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
that's our K value but it's not just a

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.900 
that's our K value but it's not just a
matter<00:04:32.170> of<00:04:32.320> how<00:04:32.470> much<00:04:32.650> time<00:04:32.920> I<00:04:32.950> want<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.640> spend

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
matter of how much time I want to spend

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.630 
matter of how much time I want to spend
with<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:34.630> person<00:04:35.170> but<00:04:35.410> also<00:04:35.770> how<00:04:36.190> much<00:04:36.370> time

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
with this person but also how much time

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.890 
with this person but also how much time
do<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:36.850> have<00:04:36.940> available

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
do I have available

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.710 
do I have available
that's<00:04:38.080> our<00:04:38.290> oxygen<00:04:38.860> concentration<00:04:39.700> and<00:04:40.090> so

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
that's our oxygen concentration and so

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.450 
that's our oxygen concentration and so
the<00:04:40.900> degree<00:04:41.230> to<00:04:41.260> which<00:04:41.410> myoglobin<00:04:41.950> binds

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
the degree to which myoglobin binds

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.930 
the degree to which myoglobin binds
oxygen<00:04:42.850> depends<00:04:43.750> on<00:04:43.840> its<00:04:44.020> innate<00:04:44.940> affinity

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
oxygen depends on its innate affinity

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.650 
oxygen depends on its innate affinity
but<00:04:46.450> also<00:04:46.840> at<00:04:47.170> how<00:04:47.350> much<00:04:47.530> oxygen<00:04:47.860> is<00:04:48.370> available

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
but also at how much oxygen is available

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.470 
but also at how much oxygen is available
and<00:04:49.890> so<00:04:50.890> now<00:04:51.070> when<00:04:51.250> we<00:04:51.280> study<00:04:51.700> this<00:04:51.910> fractional

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
and so now when we study this fractional

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.600 
and so now when we study this fractional
saturation<00:04:53.200> that's<00:04:53.380> our<00:04:53.560> value<00:04:53.980> Y<00:04:54.220> and

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
saturation that's our value Y and

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.430 
saturation that's our value Y and
remember<00:04:55.000> that's<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.330> fraction<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:55.990> we<00:04:56.110> go<00:04:56.260> from

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
remember that's a fraction so we go from

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.560 
remember that's a fraction so we go from
zero<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.890> one<00:04:57.310> we're<00:04:57.910> going<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.060> look<00:04:58.240> at<00:04:58.390> that

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
zero to one we're going to look at that

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.840 
zero to one we're going to look at that
as<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.780> function<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.320> oxygen<00:04:59.980> concentration

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
as a function of oxygen concentration

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.750 
as a function of oxygen concentration
our<00:05:01.120> po2<00:05:01.600> value<00:05:02.290> units<00:05:03.040> are<00:05:03.190> Torr<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.490> that

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
our po2 value units are Torr and that

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.420 
our po2 value units are Torr and that

increases from left to right when we

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
study this in the case of myoglobin we

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
that at low oxygen concentration that

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.130 
that at low oxygen concentration that
binding<00:05:17.470> increases<00:05:18.310> rapidly<00:05:18.910> so<00:05:19.480> we<00:05:19.630> have<00:05:19.930> a

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140

value some asymptotes up here that

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.570

myoglobin<00:05:31.150> is<00:05:32.040> mostly<00:05:33.040> saturated<00:05:33.310> so<00:05:33.970> that's

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
myoglobin is mostly saturated so that's

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.280 
myoglobin is mostly saturated so that's

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.440 
point our one-half Y max that's where
it's<00:05:44.080> half<00:05:44.370> saturated<00:05:45.370> so<00:05:46.090> that's<00:05:46.270> our

it's half saturated so that's our

equilibrium constant we call that the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.210 
equilibrium constant we call that the
p50<00:05:49.270> because<00:05:49.960> it's<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.290> partial<00:05:50.560> pressure<00:05:51.070> of

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
p50 because it's the partial pressure of

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.780 
oxygen where maya globe is half or 50%
saturated<00:05:55.260> notice<00:05:56.260> how<00:05:56.470> low<00:05:56.830> that<00:05:56.860> value<00:05:57.580> is

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
saturated notice how low that value is

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.290 
saturated notice how low that value is
it's<00:05:58.330> 2.8<00:05:59.230> Torr<00:05:59.620> so<00:06:00.190> remember<00:06:00.670> the<00:06:00.820> lower<00:06:01.060> the

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
it's 2.8 Torr so remember the lower the

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.750 
it's 2.8 Torr so remember the lower the
value<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.960> higher<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.560> affinity<00:06:02.860> so<00:06:03.550> this

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
value the higher the affinity so this

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.820 
value the higher the affinity so this
means<00:06:04.000> myoglobin<00:06:04.540> has<00:06:04.960> a<00:06:04.990> very<00:06:05.440> high<00:06:05.680> affinity

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
means myoglobin has a very high affinity

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.790 
means myoglobin has a very high affinity
for<00:06:06.220> oxygen<00:06:06.580> even<00:06:07.390> at<00:06:07.510> low<00:06:07.660> concentrations

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
for oxygen even at low concentrations

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.010 
for oxygen even at low concentrations
and<00:06:09.919> so<00:06:10.639> now<00:06:10.789> how<00:06:11.030> does<00:06:11.090> that<00:06:11.210> relate<00:06:11.539> to<00:06:11.720> its

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
and so now how does that relate to its

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.210 
and so now how does that relate to its
role<00:06:12.259> within<00:06:12.440> the<00:06:12.620> cell

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
role within the cell

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.029 
role within the cell
well<00:06:13.759> myoglobin<00:06:14.210> job<00:06:14.810> is<00:06:15.080> to<00:06:15.229> pick<00:06:15.410> up<00:06:15.680> oxygen

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
well myoglobin job is to pick up oxygen

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.430 
well myoglobin job is to pick up oxygen
in<00:06:16.669> the<00:06:16.819> tissues<00:06:17.000> and<00:06:17.630> deliver<00:06:18.169> it<00:06:18.289> to<00:06:18.349> the

specifically<00:06:23.509> aerobic<00:06:24.259> respiration<00:06:24.440> so<00:06:25.280> you

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
specifically aerobic respiration so you

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.400 
specifically aerobic respiration so you
can<00:06:25.580> see<00:06:25.789> it<00:06:26.030> is<00:06:26.150> well<00:06:26.389> suited<00:06:27.050> to<00:06:27.080> its

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
can see it is well suited to its
