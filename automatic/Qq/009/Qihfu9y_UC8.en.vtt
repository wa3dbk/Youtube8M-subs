 It is teak Today I want to do even with color gradation 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 I will make a storehouse from this color this time 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.309
 This is the color of the arm 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:25.140
 The color is also eh 1 step 2 step 3 step 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.700
 I'm going to darken the color First step is 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.700
 It is good to take less 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.110
 Because it is an image that is gradually deepening rather than thinking of reverence at first 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.010
 Continue doing slowly Ma 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.090

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.479
 I will paint 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.080
 Because the effect is about 5 seconds 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 It is okay in 5 seconds 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.170

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.640
 by the way 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.640

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.110
 I will strike gently 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.970
