00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
because then we can find a lot of things

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.020 
because then we can find a lot of things
okay<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.009> think<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.430> them<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:41.909> bit

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
okay so I think about them a little bit

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.260 
okay so I think about them a little bit
then<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:44.280> also<00:01:44.490> want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> make

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
then what we do is we also want to make

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.359 
then what we do is we also want to make
sure<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.930> everything<00:01:46.470> looks<00:01:46.619> good<00:01:46.920> inside

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
sure that everything looks good inside

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.550 
sure that everything looks good inside
so<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:48.180> when<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.540> use<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.930> speculum<00:01:49.409> but

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so that's when we use the speculum but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.469 
so that's when we use the speculum but
this<00:01:49.710> helps<00:01:50.070> us<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.579> inside<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> vagina

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this helps us look inside of the vagina

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.990 
this helps us look inside of the vagina
now<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.380> comes<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.920> lots<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.670> different

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
now this comes in lots of different

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.940 
now this comes in lots of different
shapes<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.390> sizes<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.740> make<00:01:55.920> sure

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
shapes and sizes so you know make sure

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.469 
shapes and sizes so you know make sure
that<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.610> uncomfortable<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.210> tell

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that if it's uncomfortable you tell

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.670 
that if it's uncomfortable you tell
because<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.869> give<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> smaller<00:01:58.500> one

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
because we can give you a smaller one

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.219 
because we can give you a smaller one
and<00:01:58.829> we<00:01:59.340> warm<00:01:59.640> them<00:01:59.850> up<00:02:00.000> okay<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.930> it's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and we warm them up okay so that it's

and we warm them up okay so that it's
nice<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.439> warm<00:02:01.829> or<00:02:02.040> doesn't<00:02:02.310> cause<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> problem

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
nice and warm or doesn't cause a problem

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.819 
vaginally we're going to put those two
fingers<00:03:09.599> in<00:03:09.780> we're<00:03:10.349> going<00:03:10.439> to<00:03:10.500> put<00:03:10.709> them

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
fingers in we're going to put them

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.099 
fingers in we're going to put them
inside<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.639> what<00:03:12.239> we<00:03:12.359> do<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.659> it's<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:13.079> about

feel<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.799> we've<00:03:13.919> been<00:03:14.040> trained<00:03:14.400> for<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.879> in

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
feel and we've been trained for this in

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.990 
feel and we've been trained for this in
residency<00:03:15.689> and<00:03:15.870> basically<00:03:16.650> we<00:03:17.040> feel<00:03:17.370> we<00:03:17.819> put

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
residency and basically we feel we put

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.429 
residency and basically we feel we put
our<00:03:18.120> fingers<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:18.509> we<00:03:18.629> feel<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:18.870> tip<00:03:19.259> of<00:03:19.409> that

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
our fingers and we feel that tip of that

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.899 
our fingers and we feel that tip of that
cervix<00:03:19.949> that<00:03:20.009> we<00:03:20.189> showed<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.790> that

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
cervix that we showed you and that

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.339 
cervix that we showed you and that
actually<00:03:21.329> feels<00:03:21.599> like<00:03:21.689> go<00:03:21.930> ahead<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.199> feel

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
actually feels like go ahead and feel

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:23.990 
actually feels like go ahead and feel
your<00:03:22.500> tip<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.859> your<00:03:22.919> nose<00:03:23.159> that<00:03:23.639> actually

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
your tip of your nose that actually

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.119 
your tip of your nose that actually
feels<00:03:24.239> like<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.509> tip<00:03:24.689> of<00:03:24.840> your<00:03:24.900> nose<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.379> we

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
feels like the tip of your nose and we

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.129 
feels like the tip of your nose and we
feel<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.400> we<00:03:26.669> see<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.299> you're<00:03:27.569> tender<00:03:27.959> with

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
feel that we see if you're tender with

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.990 
feel that we see if you're tender with
that<00:03:28.319> when<00:03:28.500> we<00:03:28.560> move<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.069> we<00:03:29.430> see<00:03:29.669> if<00:03:29.759> it<00:03:29.879> has

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
that when we move it we see if it has

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.759 
that when we move it we see if it has
again<00:03:30.419> if<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.689> has<00:03:30.840> anything<00:03:31.139> on<00:03:31.379> it<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.680> we

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
again if it has anything on it that we

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.920 
again if it has anything on it that we
could<00:03:31.919> feel<00:03:32.189> but<00:03:32.370> we<00:03:32.459> couldn't<00:03:32.729> see<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.449> then

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
could feel but we couldn't see and then

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.569 
could feel but we couldn't see and then
we<00:03:34.019> move<00:03:34.229> it<00:03:34.349> around<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.739> see<00:03:34.859> how<00:03:35.009> mobile<00:03:35.459> is

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
we move it around and see how mobile is

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.699 
we move it around and see how mobile is
and<00:03:35.819> what<00:03:35.909> the<00:03:36.000> position<00:03:36.419> is<00:03:36.509> and<00:03:36.659> then<00:03:37.199> we<00:03:37.560> go

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
and what the position is and then we go

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.379 
and what the position is and then we go
ahead<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:37.979> we<00:03:38.129> sweep<00:03:38.579> our<00:03:38.790> fingers<00:03:39.209> again

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
ahead and we sweep our fingers again

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.360 
ahead and we sweep our fingers again
underneath<00:03:40.379> here<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.919> we're<00:03:41.040> going<00:03:41.129> to<00:03:41.189> go

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
underneath here and we're going to go

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.559 
underneath here and we're going to go
I'm<00:03:41.519> actually<00:03:41.699> going<00:03:41.939> to<00:03:42.060> take<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.389> out

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
I'm actually going to take this out

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.830 
I'm actually going to take this out
because<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.229> like<00:03:43.439> really<00:03:43.889> cool<00:03:44.509> we<00:03:45.509> feel

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
because this is like really cool we feel

because this is like really cool we feel
your<00:03:46.199> ovaries<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.859> your<00:03:47.009> normal<00:03:47.370> ovaries

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
your ovaries and your normal ovaries

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.189 
your ovaries and your normal ovaries

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
should feel like an almond besides an

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.599 
should feel like an almond besides an
almond<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:49.560> we<00:03:49.650> sweep<00:03:49.919> our<00:03:50.099> fingers<00:03:50.459> around

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
almond so we sweep our fingers around

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.999 
almond so we sweep our fingers around
and<00:03:51.030> we<00:03:51.479> feel<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.780> almond<00:03:52.290> just<00:03:52.500> between<00:03:52.739> our

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
and we feel that almond just between our

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.080 
and we feel that almond just between our
fingers<00:03:53.489> like<00:03:53.819> that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
fingers like that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.390 
fingers like that
one<00:03:54.509> is<00:03:54.629> on<00:03:54.750> top<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.590> other<00:03:55.739> ones<00:03:55.919> inside

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
one is on top and the other ones inside

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.979 
one is on top and the other ones inside
and<00:03:56.609> we<00:03:56.699> squish<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.299> between<00:03:57.449> and<00:03:57.810> see<00:03:57.930> if

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
and we squish it in between and see if

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.689 
and we squish it in between and see if
it's<00:03:58.109> tender<00:03:58.469> if<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.650> has<00:03:58.769> mass<00:03:59.069> like<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> cyst

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
it's tender if it has mass like a cyst

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.909 
it's tender if it has mass like a cyst
on<00:03:59.879> it<00:04:00.090> then<00:04:00.479> we<00:04:00.659> sweep<00:04:00.930> closer<00:04:01.229> over<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.769> see

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
on it then we sweep closer over to see

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.069 
on it then we sweep closer over to see
if<00:04:02.040> there's<00:04:02.219> a<00:04:02.280> mess<00:04:02.519> on<00:04:02.729> the<00:04:02.759> tubes<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.449> then

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
if there's a mess on the tubes and then

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.679 
if there's a mess on the tubes and then
we<00:04:04.379> go<00:04:04.560> underneath<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.519> uterus<00:04:05.849> and<00:04:06.030> over<00:04:06.479> the
