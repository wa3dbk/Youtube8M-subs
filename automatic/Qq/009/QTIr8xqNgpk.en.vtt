 reset service is first 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.680
 energize the line let's balance the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.130
 train pressure so we can 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.170
 have movement of the motors we have 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.120
 SPRI two trains voted ie

 the shaft was already moved from the box 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.350
 train we are going to make a disengagement

 and once we achieve that, we separate them 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.569
 let's see if we have conditions and that 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.269
 they generate a short circuit to be able to 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.340
 move to the rosary workshops 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.830
