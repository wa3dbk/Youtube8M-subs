Deb yeah I agree you know I guess I was

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.110 
Deb yeah I agree you know I guess I was
kind<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:15.320> dreading<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.950> answer<00:03:16.370> yeah<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.820> think

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
that I hope w that this is sort of a

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.610 
that I hope w that this is sort of a
third-party<00:03:20.240> observation<00:03:21.200> into<00:03:21.470> your

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
third-party observation into your

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.410 
third-party observation into your
relationship<00:03:21.709> sort<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.459> lets<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.820> see<00:03:23.120> what

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
relationship sort of lets you see what

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.420 
relationship sort of lets you see what
we<00:03:23.750> see<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.410> little<00:03:24.740> bit<00:03:24.830> more<00:03:24.980> clearly<00:03:25.250> because

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
we see a little bit more clearly because

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.830 
we see a little bit more clearly because
sometimes<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.060> be<00:03:26.090> hard<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.360> see<00:03:26.540> from<00:03:26.660> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
sometimes it can be hard to see from the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.290 
sometimes it can be hard to see from the
inside<00:03:27.140> but<00:03:27.740> it<00:03:27.770> really<00:03:28.400> looks<00:03:28.700> like<00:03:28.790> he's<00:03:29.090> not

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
inside but it really looks like he's not

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.600 
inside but it really looks like he's not
nearly<00:03:29.720> as<00:03:29.900> connected<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.770> as<00:03:31.070> maybe<00:03:31.490> you

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
nearly as connected to you as maybe you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.370 
nearly as connected to you as maybe you
would<00:03:31.730> like<00:03:31.880> him<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.240> I<00:03:32.570> got<00:03:33.080> two<00:03:33.230> options

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
would like him to be I got two options

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.350 
would like him to be I got two options
you<00:03:33.680> can<00:03:33.770> either<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:34.190> totally<00:03:34.610> ignore<00:03:35.060> him

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
you can either just totally ignore him

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.240 
you can either just totally ignore him
and<00:03:35.600> he'll<00:03:35.900> probably<00:03:36.140> just<00:03:36.260> go<00:03:36.560> away<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.890> bit

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
and he'll probably just go away a bit

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.380 
and he'll probably just go away a bit
he'll<00:03:37.370> probably<00:03:37.550> call<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:37.880> in<00:03:37.940> two<00:03:38.090> weeks<00:03:38.240> and
