that's<00:02:47.810> what<00:02:48.080> I'm<00:02:48.200> gonna<00:02:48.380> say<00:02:48.680> lava<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.310> storm

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
because I think that's a good

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.270 
because I think that's a good
combination<00:02:52.130> all<00:02:53.090> right<00:02:53.270> so<00:02:54.070> we're<00:02:55.070> going<00:02:55.220> to

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
combination all right so we're going to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.070 
combination all right so we're going to

lava dragon storm dragon that's what I

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.150 
lava dragon storm dragon that's what I
recommend<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:17.330> think<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.810> was<00:03:17.989> 36<00:03:18.650> hours<00:03:19.040> I

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
recommend I think it was 36 hours I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.470 
recommend I think it was 36 hours I
believe<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.959> let's<00:03:20.959> just<00:03:21.170> breathe<00:03:22.450> all<00:03:23.450> right

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
believe and let's just breathe all right

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.660 
believe and let's just breathe all right
we<00:03:23.720> didn't<00:03:23.930> get<00:03:24.019> it<00:03:24.200> we'll<00:03:24.680> be<00:03:24.860> back<00:03:25.220> as<00:03:25.489> we

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
we didn't get it we'll be back as we

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.340 
we didn't get it we'll be back as we
continue<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.239> try<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.540> see<00:03:26.930> if<00:03:27.019> we<00:03:27.080> will<00:03:27.230> get

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
continue to try to see if we will get

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.500 
continue to try to see if we will get
this<00:03:27.590> dragon<00:03:28.070> using<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.700> lava<00:03:28.970> drawing<00:03:29.360> and

this dragon using the lava drawing and

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.840 
this dragon using the lava drawing and

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.820 

all<00:03:38.220> right<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:38.700> we<00:03:38.970> got<00:03:39.180> 36<00:03:39.600> hours<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.500> wasn't

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
all right so we got 36 hours it wasn't

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.199 
all right so we got 36 hours it wasn't
really<00:03:41.069> that<00:03:41.100> long<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.580> think<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.180> our

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
really that long I think it's on our

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.070 
really that long I think it's on our
fifth<00:03:42.690> try<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.770> here<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.390> 36<00:03:45.390> hours<00:03:45.750> zero

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
fifth try so here it is 36 hours zero

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.199 
fifth try so here it is 36 hours zero
111<00:03:46.940> 59<00:03:47.940> 59<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.290> we<00:03:49.470> were<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.950> bit<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.490> second<00:03:50.970> late

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
111 59 59 so we were a bit a second late

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.250 
111 59 59 so we were a bit a second late
so<00:03:52.050> it<00:03:52.350> says<00:03:52.560> 58<00:03:53.010> there<00:03:53.280> usually<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.240> see<00:03:54.420> 57

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
so it says 58 there usually you see 57

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.800 
so it says 58 there usually you see 57
so<00:03:55.740> we're<00:03:56.190> usually<00:03:56.640> we're<00:03:57.000> two<00:03:57.209> seconds<00:03:57.630> late

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
so we're usually we're two seconds late

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.490 
so we're usually we're two seconds late
but<00:03:58.350> there<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:59.570> 36<00:04:00.570> hours<00:04:00.959> we're<00:04:01.230> going<00:04:01.380> to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
but there it is 36 hours we're going to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.830 
but there it is 36 hours we're going to
press<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:03.110> there<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.450> here's<00:04:06.690> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
press it and there it is so here's the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.960 
press it and there it is so here's the
egg<00:04:06.959> again<00:04:07.500> we're<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.830> couple<00:04:08.250> seconds<00:04:08.670> late

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
egg again we're a couple seconds late

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.940 
egg again we're a couple seconds late
but<00:04:09.600> essentially<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.350> is<00:04:10.410> what<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.770> egg

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
but essentially this is what the egg

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.470 
but essentially this is what the egg
looks<00:04:11.250> like<00:04:11.459> if<00:04:11.700> you're<00:04:11.880> wondering<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.360> has<00:04:12.450> a

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
looks like if you're wondering it has a

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.509 
looks like if you're wondering it has a
bunch<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.870> horns<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.500> it's<00:04:13.980> really<00:04:14.340> really

right<00:05:14.189> so<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:14.879> is<00:05:14.909> the<00:05:15.360> first<00:05:15.659> form<00:05:15.960> we're

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
right so that is the first form we're

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.899 
right so that is the first form we're
going<00:05:16.289> to<00:05:16.349> evolve<00:05:16.620> it<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:16.949> second<00:05:17.520> form<00:05:17.759> now

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
going to evolve it to second form now

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.439 
going to evolve it to second form now
there<00:05:18.210> it<00:05:18.300> is<00:05:18.419> you<00:05:18.569> also<00:05:18.750> see<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:20.330> kind<00:05:21.330> of

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
there it is you also see the kind of

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.290 
there it is you also see the kind of
when<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:22.199> evolve<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.889> it<00:05:23.099> has<00:05:23.430> this<00:05:23.610> burst<00:05:24.000> and

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
when you evolve it it has this burst and

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.649 
when you evolve it it has this burst and
the<00:05:24.449> burst<00:05:24.750> is<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:24.990> bunch<00:05:25.319> of<00:05:25.939> thorns<00:05:26.939> or<00:05:27.180> a<00:05:27.210> horn

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
the burst is a bunch of thorns or a horn

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.950 
the burst is a bunch of thorns or a horn
so<00:05:28.849> that's<00:05:29.849> what<00:05:30.120> it's<00:05:30.270> going<00:05:30.419> to<00:05:30.479> do<00:05:30.719> when

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
so that's what it's going to do when

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.809 
so that's what it's going to do when
it's<00:05:31.139> going<00:05:31.409> to<00:05:31.469> breathe<00:05:31.650> its<00:05:31.860> breath<00:05:33.259> come<00:05:34.259> on

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
it's going to breathe its breath come on

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:40.579 
it's going to breathe its breath come on
all<00:05:35.819> right<00:05:35.849> let's<00:05:36.120> move<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.900> poison<00:05:40.440> dragon

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:40.589 
all right let's move the poison dragon

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:42.379 
all right let's move the poison dragon
out<00:05:40.919> of<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.039> way<00:05:41.250> because<00:05:41.490> he's<00:05:41.819> such<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.089> big

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
out of the way because he's such a big

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.399

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:50.609

design and a bunch of horns that kind of

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.149 
design and a bunch of horns that kind of
surround<00:06:23.610> his<00:06:24.119> body<00:06:24.479> I<00:06:24.839> guess<00:06:25.529> they're<00:06:25.860> really

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
surround his body I guess they're really

surround his body I guess they're really
bones<00:06:26.489> that<00:06:27.329> are<00:06:27.449> sticking<00:06:27.779> out<00:06:28.049> of<00:06:28.229> his<00:06:28.409> body
