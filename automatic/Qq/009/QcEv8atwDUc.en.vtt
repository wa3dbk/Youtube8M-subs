00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
and you can fly just by two controls but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.900 
and you can fly just by two controls but
you<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.150> also<00:02:26.330> tilt<00:02:26.750> up<00:02:27.050> or<00:02:27.380> tilt<00:02:27.830> down<00:02:28.069> now

there is a sense it's not always easy to

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.210 
there is a sense it's not always easy to
control<00:02:32.330> mode<00:02:33.320> imagine<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.770> easier<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
control mode imagine be easier with a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.940 
control mode imagine be easier with a
controller<00:02:34.700> then<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.570> touch<00:02:35.810> screen<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.440> you

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
controller then a touch screen and you

you as you fly but you have to tilt down
and<00:03:16.870> fly<00:03:17.870> around<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:19.220> get<00:03:19.400> them<00:03:19.610> right<00:03:20.420> now<00:03:20.600> I'm

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
and fly around to get them right now I'm

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.990 
and fly around to get them right now I'm
not<00:03:21.799> going<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.040> spend<00:03:22.250> too<00:03:22.400> much<00:03:22.519> time<00:03:22.579> on<00:03:22.820> that

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
not going to spend too much time on that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.390 
not going to spend too much time on that
I<00:03:23.209> switch<00:03:23.600> back<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:25.269> Hamilton<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:28.250> can

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
I switch back to Hamilton and you can

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.460 
I switch back to Hamilton and you can
see<00:03:28.579> here<00:03:28.820> these<00:03:29.030> once<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:29.900> go<00:03:30.049> over<00:03:30.110> them

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
see here these once you go over them

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.949 
see here these once you go over them
they<00:03:30.500> disappear<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:31.549> in<00:03:31.760> levels<00:03:32.510> obviously

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
they disappear so in levels obviously

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.569 
they disappear so in levels obviously
that's<00:03:33.110> going<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.350> get<00:03:33.470> more<00:03:33.650> complicated<00:03:34.340> and

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
that's going to get more complicated and

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.810 
that's going to get more complicated and
then<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.540> can<00:03:35.720> use<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.079> key<00:03:36.320> that<00:03:37.310> I<00:03:37.370> picked<00:03:37.640> up

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
then I can use the key that I picked up

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.920 
then I can use the key that I picked up
to<00:03:38.750> go<00:03:38.900> through<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:44.239> course<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.600> gives<00:03:44.690> you

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
to go through and of course it gives you

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.259 
to go through and of course it gives you
the<00:03:45.200> level<00:03:45.410> it's<00:03:45.769> gold<00:03:46.070> bronze<00:03:46.549> or<00:03:46.910> whatever

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
the level it's gold bronze or whatever

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.330 
the level it's gold bronze or whatever
silver<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:49.640> go<00:03:49.790> on<00:03:50.000> um<00:03:51.070> I'm<00:03:52.070> going<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.250> go

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
silver and you go on um I'm going to go

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:10.890 
silver and you go on um I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.880> continue<00:03:53.630> on<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.230> next<00:03:54.440> level

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.730 

so<00:04:13.690> again<00:04:14.690> they're<00:04:14.840> making<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.230> easy<00:04:15.470> with

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
so again they're making it easy with

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.420 
so again they're making it easy with
these<00:04:16.359> tiles<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.600> disappear<00:04:18.230> because<00:04:18.500> and

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
these tiles that disappear because and

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.290 
these tiles that disappear because and
there's<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.970> key<00:04:24.640> here<00:04:25.640> obviously<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:26.150> want

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
there's the key here obviously you want

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.030 
there's the key here obviously you want
to<00:04:26.360> go<00:04:26.510> through<00:04:26.810> this<00:04:26.990> right<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:29.919> as<00:04:30.919> I

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
to go through this right and as I

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.800 
to go through this right and as I
collect<00:04:31.370> these<00:04:31.550> things<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.480> gives<00:04:32.660> me<00:04:32.780> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
collect these things it gives me the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.630 
collect these things it gives me the
levels<00:04:33.260> now<00:04:33.410> there's<00:04:33.950> probably<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.400> piece<00:04:34.610> of

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
levels now there's probably a piece of

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.320 
levels now there's probably a piece of
treasure<00:04:34.970> here<00:04:35.360> somewhere<00:04:36.790> see<00:04:37.790> I'm<00:04:37.910> not<00:04:37.970> sure

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
treasure here somewhere see I'm not sure

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:46.570 
treasure here somewhere see I'm not sure
where<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:41.050> forget<00:04:42.050> now<00:04:42.590> there<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:45.580> if

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
where it is I forget now there it is if

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.530 
where it is I forget now there it is if
I<00:04:46.760> got<00:04:46.940> tilt<00:04:47.210> down<00:04:49.419> where<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.570> is<00:04:52.300> so<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.330> can

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
I got tilt down where it is so I can

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.330 
I got tilt down where it is so I can
quickly<00:04:53.840> sits<00:04:54.230> back<00:04:54.470> I'm<00:04:54.710> not<00:04:54.830> collecting<00:04:55.250> all

quickly sits back I'm not collecting all

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.580 
quickly sits back I'm not collecting all
the<00:04:55.460> particles<00:04:55.730> as<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.210> can<00:04:56.390> see<00:04:56.600> just<00:04:57.260> moving

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
the particles as you can see just moving

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.420 
the particles as you can see just moving
through<00:04:57.740> quickly<00:04:57.950> here<00:05:02.650> now<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.770> third<00:05:04.100> level

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
through quickly here now the third level

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.180 
through quickly here now the third level
presents<00:05:05.090> doors<00:05:05.510> that<00:05:06.380> have<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.650> be<00:05:06.710> kind<00:05:07.010> of

unlock but there are other doors that
you<00:05:11.570> need<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.870> find<00:05:12.169> a<00:05:12.760> mechanism<00:05:13.760> to<00:05:14.180> open<00:05:14.720> it

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
you need to find a mechanism to open it

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:26.310 
you need to find a mechanism to open it
now<00:05:15.110> here's<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.440> story<00:05:15.680> line<00:05:15.950> again

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.800 

just<00:05:27.130> go<00:05:27.310> right<00:05:27.430> into<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.850> so<00:05:29.070> right<00:05:30.070> here<00:05:30.550> I

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
just go right into it so right here I

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.840 
just go right into it so right here I
can't<00:05:31.810> get<00:05:31.960> through<00:05:31.990> here<00:05:32.620> but<00:05:33.550> there's<00:05:33.790> a

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
can't get through here but there's a

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.390 
can't get through here but there's a
heart<00:05:34.840> there<00:05:35.140> so<00:05:35.380> I<00:05:35.410> have<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:35.680> find<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:36.040> hard

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
heart there so I have to find that hard

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:48.090 
heart there so I have to find that hard
and<00:05:45.630> so<00:05:46.630> there's<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.080> heart<00:05:47.290> up<00:05:47.470> there<00:05:47.740> and

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
and so there's the heart up there and

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.920 
and so there's the heart up there and
basically<00:05:48.790> once<00:05:49.270> you<00:05:49.390> get<00:05:49.570> close<00:05:49.750> enough

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
basically once you get close enough

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.040 
basically once you get close enough
there<00:05:50.230> you<00:05:50.350> can<00:05:50.500> see<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:50.740> lights<00:05:50.980> up<00:05:51.220> and<00:05:52.050> I

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
there you can see it lights up and I

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.960 
there you can see it lights up and I
will<00:05:53.550> press<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:55.060> that<00:05:55.740> opens<00:05:56.740> that<00:05:56.920> up

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
will press that and that opens that up

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.650 
will press that and that opens that up
so<00:05:57.970> that<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.180> can<00:05:58.300> go<00:05:58.600> through<00:05:58.930> and<00:06:00.510> there<00:06:01.510> again

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
so that I can go through and there again

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.600 
so that I can go through and there again
they<00:06:02.020> have<00:06:02.170> these<00:06:02.350> tiles<00:06:02.680> here<00:06:03.010> again<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:03.550> it

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
they have these tiles here again and it

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.040 
they have these tiles here again and it
gets<00:06:03.730> more<00:06:03.970> complicated<00:06:04.390> this<00:06:04.780> is<00:06:04.840> only<00:06:04.960> a

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
gets more complicated this is only a

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.740 
gets more complicated this is only a
third<00:06:05.320> level<00:06:05.770> it's<00:06:06.490> pretty<00:06:06.940> breathtaking<00:06:07.210> the

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
third level it's pretty breathtaking the
