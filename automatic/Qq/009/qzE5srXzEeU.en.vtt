00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.230
 live comment here starting the 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.790
 live comment this step locks up how 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.350
 they are and well here starting they take out the 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.269
 live comment I said comment my 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.420
 son like three times but I'll say good 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.660
 again comment 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.699
 are four good I'm going to cover here for 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.430
 see here I bring my shotgun the one that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.430
 assumes the rifles in these 12 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 that was not when it seems to be given to me 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.449
 that little ball that I made 15 or the number that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.699
 say that is like the little ball that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.779
 experience you know that you killed the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.690
 monkeys to talk about here we 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.840
 we found the crazy 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.230
 damn 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.180
 warm to be hidden I would have flipped 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.310
 out there there this 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.280
 Well, that worked out well because I had to 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.020
 see turned well well paranoid when 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.489
 you have to be half paranoid when 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.200
 you're playing here live because of what 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.180
 otherwise grab you from wherever you 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.390
 do diane and good something curious this 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.970
 list of games and call anger that is not 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.460
 I know why because they gave it that name 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.840
 of anger or the first thing that I imagined 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.990
 it was like going backwards 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.060
 to see with the submachine gun that I follow 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.789
 counting because here we have this to 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.490
 through the windows 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.570
 this type is very difficult if in fact not 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:32.610
 because it pointed on the monkey but ah 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:34.900
 because he dies in the truck 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.570
 we adjust the sight we adjust the precision 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.500
 there is not so much game 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.910
 1 - 1 - gentlemen with the sniper whom 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.910
 we wrote to each other over here 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.350
 leave wherever you are leaving 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.930
 of their cursed rat sewers 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.420
 well maybe no rats are players are 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.869
 players like me I have why 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.869
 tell them 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.110
 double streak of casualties and then we're going 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.780
 talking about how good low runs 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:19.140
 he said he is ready if he wins he will go is this way 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:19.140
 how to go there where the meat 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.700
 and there are a lot of red balls but here 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.910
 and I would tend 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.910
 how everything goes with a shotgun 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.240
 more or less but I think the machine gun 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.340
 also it kills you something too Esteli 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.220
 of game for example from that name of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.470
 anger is like anger not anger because 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.750
 maybe you always get in there is no lose 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.890
 if it's a lot of anger in this playlist 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.390
 I is not like seizures do not talk about 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.250
 convulsions is convulsing 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.420
 while you play but obviously I do not 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.420
 is happening that since the artist 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.380
 and not 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.630
 and I was about to lose anybody in 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:13.110
 the comment commenting a lot but not 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.640
 from the side of the 12 what good to see to see 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.440
 coladera what they will now go out 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.800
 what 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.620
 look here there is one that has to be that 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.830
 It is clear to me that it is clear to me that 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.830
 yes 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.350
 if we do not have the third participant to 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.640
 you brought your gun I came up with something 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.340
 like in this hall they're going to be 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.390
 happening so they know what I'm going to do 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.130
 here I will put sticky bombs here or 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.750
 I'm going to put sticky bombs 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.200
 then here hidden when I pass 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.210
 someone walking I'm going to exploit it like that 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.640
 that we just have to just have to 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.850
 wait for an idiot to pass by and 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:07.860
 we will send him straight to hell if he has 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:12.180
 seen I do not see myself as if it's not 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.910
 possible or is it by chance is that I do not know 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.260
 if I was exactly when I 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.400
 was shot they expect to happen to 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.230
 someone who has suddenly someone from 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.750
 ceiling or how do you want you were 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.190
 because it fell from the ceiling or because it fell 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.340
 from the ceiling so the people do not fall 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.340
 the ceiling 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.169
 to that metal and balls 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.169
 that does not explode 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.310
 na 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:42.310
 there comes a medal there 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.250
 if it was like that if the winner and they gave me 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.960
 money if obviously we are all the 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.280
 champions and the winners 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.560
 I thought it had been in first place 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.360
 but not to see where it is left to see that 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.210
 there is that thing in second place if there is 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.950
 74 Well, if I left I would not be good 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.980
