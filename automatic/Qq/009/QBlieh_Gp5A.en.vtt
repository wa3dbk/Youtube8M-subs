00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
too much you can always just pin that

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.090 
too much you can always just pin that
down<00:05:54.020> so<00:05:55.020> that<00:05:55.050> it<00:05:55.380> sticks<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:55.890> back<00:05:56.070> of

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
down so that it sticks to the back of

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.810 
down so that it sticks to the back of
the<00:05:56.220> head<00:05:57.170> this<00:05:58.170> one<00:05:58.350> looks<00:05:58.530> fine<00:05:59.190> so<00:05:59.550> I'm<00:05:59.670> just
