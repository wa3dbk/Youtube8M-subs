cool<00:06:20.869> thing<00:06:20.899> about<00:06:21.080> this<00:06:21.379> base<00:06:21.589> is<00:06:21.800> the<00:06:22.309> fact

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
cool thing about this base is the fact

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.159 
cool thing about this base is the fact
that<00:06:22.669> he<00:06:22.939> cannot<00:06:23.149> use<00:06:23.210> a<00:06:23.389> jump<00:06:23.719> spell<00:06:23.930> if<00:06:24.050> he

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
that he cannot use a jump spell if he

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.839 
that he cannot use a jump spell if he
attacks<00:06:24.409> from<00:06:24.589> the<00:06:24.649> top<00:06:24.919> um<00:06:25.219> the<00:06:25.460> reason<00:06:25.610> he

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
attacks from the top um the reason he

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.100 
attacks from the top um the reason he
can't<00:06:26.089> use<00:06:26.210> this<00:06:26.389> jump<00:06:26.629> spells<00:06:26.839> because

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
can't use this jump spells because

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.659 
can't use this jump spells because
there's<00:06:27.289> no<00:06:27.439> defensive<00:06:27.979> structures<00:06:28.339> or<00:06:28.520> any

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
there's no defensive structures or any

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.010 
there's no defensive structures or any
structures<00:06:29.149> in<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:29.360> middle<00:06:29.389> where<00:06:29.749> the<00:06:29.869> Town

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
structures in the middle where the Town

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.200 
structures in the middle where the Town
Hall<00:06:30.199> is<00:06:30.379> so<00:06:30.889> most<00:06:31.129> of<00:06:31.219> the<00:06:31.309> time<00:06:31.490> the<00:06:31.639> pekka's

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
Hall is so most of the time the pekka's

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.639 
Hall is so most of the time the pekka's
will<00:06:32.360> end<00:06:32.509> up<00:06:32.629> going<00:06:32.869> towards<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.259> sides<00:06:33.439> and

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:33.649 
will end up going towards the sides and

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:36.369 
will end up going towards the sides and
because<00:06:34.339> the<00:06:34.460> jump<00:06:34.669> spell<00:06:34.849> range<00:06:35.149> is<00:06:35.389> so<00:06:35.930> small

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:36.379 
because the jump spell range is so small

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:37.929 
because the jump spell range is so small
it<00:06:36.619> still<00:06:36.860> gets<00:06:37.069> covered<00:06:37.399> to<00:06:37.580> one<00:06:37.729> of<00:06:37.849> the
