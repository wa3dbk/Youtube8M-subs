this you would put back in first and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.460 
this you would put back in first and
then<00:01:48.620> pop<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.730> front<00:01:49.910> into<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.960> front

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
then pop the front into the front

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.980 
then pop the front into the front
channels<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:53.060> that's<00:01:53.300> how<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.510> do<00:01:53.690> it<00:01:53.720> in

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
channels so that's how you do it in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.010 
channels so that's how you do it in
Reverse<00:01:54.320> as<00:01:54.470> well<00:01:54.650> down<00:01:55.100> on<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.550> front<00:01:55.790> up<00:01:56.690> on

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
Reverse as well down on the front up on

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.300 
Reverse as well down on the front up on
the<00:01:57.110> back<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.590> then<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:57.770> thing<00:01:57.950> will<00:01:57.980> pull

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
the back and then this thing will pull

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.700 
the back and then this thing will pull
off<00:01:58.460> make<00:01:58.700> sure<00:01:58.750> everything<00:01:59.750> else<00:01:59.870> is<00:02:00.170> removed

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
off make sure everything else is removed

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.670 
off make sure everything else is removed
already<00:02:00.890> like<00:02:01.280> your<00:02:01.460> clips<00:02:01.730> and<00:02:01.850> all<00:02:02.000> that<00:02:02.180> so

one other piece to the gauge cluster

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.940 
one other piece to the gauge cluster
which<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.750> definitely<00:02:04.990> need<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.380> grab<00:02:05.650> is

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.110 
the middle of the sunglass holder and
just<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.930> know<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.850> discovered<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.000> had

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
just so you know I discovered that I had

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.840 
just so you know I discovered that I had
forgotten<00:02:13.330> that<00:02:13.570> when<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.870> made<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.230> video<00:02:14.850> on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
forgotten that when I made this video on

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.660 
forgotten that when I made this video on
the<00:02:16.000> side<00:02:16.210> here<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:17.110> these<00:02:17.200> are<00:02:17.260> actually

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the side here I think these are actually

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.060 
the side here I think these are actually

plastic hinge on the bottom that can

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.950 
plastic hinge on the bottom that can
break<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.950> did<00:02:27.220> break<00:02:27.430> one<00:02:27.640> off<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.420> be<00:02:28.690> gentle

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
break I did break one off so be gentle

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.930 
break I did break one off so be gentle
when<00:02:29.260> you're<00:02:29.410> exposing<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:30.100> with<00:02:30.610> Phillips

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940

head or 10 millimeter socket remember I
always<00:02:33.520> use<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.850> socket<00:02:34.150> without<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.570> choice<00:02:35.340> for

always use a socket without a choice for
fear<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.730> stripping<00:02:37.060> things<00:02:37.390> from<00:02:37.810> the

fear of stripping things from the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.340 
fear of stripping things from the
factory<00:02:38.560> seal<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.730> there's<00:02:40.630> an<00:02:40.720> implied<00:02:40.990> step

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
factory seal so there's an implied step

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.340 
factory seal so there's an implied step
here<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.870> removing<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.020> headliner

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
here and that is removing the headliner

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.470 
here and that is removing the headliner
from<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.770> weather<00:02:44.950> seal<00:02:45.280> as<00:02:45.490> well<00:02:45.550> as<00:02:46.300> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
from the weather seal as well as the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.120 
from the weather seal as well as the
pillars<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.990> sticks<00:02:47.260> about<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.830> pillar

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
pillars it sticks about in that pillar

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.940 
pillars it sticks about in that pillar
about<00:02:48.490> quarter<00:02:48.820> inch<00:02:49.470> down<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.770> you<00:02:50.860> just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
about quarter inch down and you just

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.710 
about quarter inch down and you just
kind<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.160> wiggle<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.640> shimmy<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.000> out<00:02:52.090> that's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
kind of wiggle and shimmy it out that's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.060 
kind of wiggle and shimmy it out that's
how<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.930> did<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.620> didn't<00:02:53.830> have<00:02:53.920> to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
how I did this so I didn't have to

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.510 
how I did this so I didn't have to
remove<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.670> pillars<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.320> point<00:02:56.620> you're

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
remove the pillars at this point you're

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.800 
remove the pillars at this point you're
starting<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.910> see<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> dome<00:02:58.300> light<00:02:58.330> the

the unit to the frame in the roof and
then<00:03:10.540> it's<00:03:10.959> also<00:03:11.170> held<00:03:11.470> on<00:03:11.650> by<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.860> plastic<00:03:12.400> clip

then it's also held on by a plastic clip

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.060 
then it's also held on by a plastic clip

headliner

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
headliner

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.310 
headliner
I<00:03:18.250> found<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.330> hardest<00:03:19.630> thing<00:03:19.720> about<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:20.140> was

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
I found the hardest thing about this was

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.110 
I found the hardest thing about this was
just<00:03:20.530> getting<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.400> dome<00:03:21.610> light<00:03:21.640> off<00:03:22.060> the

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
just getting the dome light off the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.870 
just getting the dome light off the
headliner<00:03:22.780> but<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.980> will<00:03:24.220> you'll<00:03:24.700> have

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
headliner but you will you'll have

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.590 
headliner but you will you'll have
access<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.750> visibly<00:03:26.320> so<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.610> can<00:03:27.790> figure

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
access to it visibly so you can figure

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.590 
access to it visibly so you can figure
out<00:03:28.750> how<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:28.930> get<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.290> out<00:03:30.000> keep<00:03:31.000> in<00:03:31.120> mind<00:03:31.300> there
