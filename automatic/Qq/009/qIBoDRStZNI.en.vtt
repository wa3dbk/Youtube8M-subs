00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello guys 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 You must have missed this wall. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.049
 that all white is not 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.590
 But I've been talking about making a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.690
 reform of nezinho and does not play for you 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.510
 This is a recipe that really zanatto 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.810
 so then today is teaching to do 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.880
 a delicious steak to the people wait for the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.580
 mouth is super easy to make 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 So, without further ado, let's start 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.230
 get good people so lets start 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.790
 here our turn and had remembered that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.700
 all the ingredients will fall underneath 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.550
 The description of the video is fine, so let's go 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:50.850
 There get my steak here I'll stretch it 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:55.620
 so I'll get a piece of bacon 2 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.010
 pieces of carrot and I'll get the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.399
 Our Calabrian sausage will do so 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.170
 some tinker and will roll well roll 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.060
 Money's good 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.320
 the tightly tightening will tighten well until 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.320
 wrapped tudinho 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.360
 Look at this way, here it has to be okay. 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.440
 Okay, okay, I'll get it later. 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.290
 here's a toothpick and I'll do it 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.060
 so I'll close the chubby ones 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:47.110
 I'll do it like this and I'll stick it here in the fall. 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.940
 with my car and tinho looks and catch 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.730
 here the tip 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:58.930
 I've been here, it was closed, I closed it here. 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.850
 you can put when the sticks 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.650
 you think it's necessary 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.650
 So I'm going to stick another here from the side. 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.200
 Look at this and I'll add one here. 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.880
 For holding on, it is not letting go. 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.030
 When we put it in the pot of 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.030
 pressure 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.920
 Look how it looks here looks good. 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.050
 closed 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.180
 I'll do this with my others. 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.730
 steak and after a while I go back for more 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.770
 So, what's the next step? 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.360
 just 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.940
 Good, I already finished running the whole team b. 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.680
 And remember also what you can give 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.750
 put in the middle we put the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.580
 our lady our language and if that 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.530
 Give our best to you too. 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.650
 add a treat too 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.690
 put olive parsley onion 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.850
 That you want it's okay, so it's 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.980
 wind up together just the way you want 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.020
 and you have no allowance or so now 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.050
 I'll take to cook the pot of 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.150
 So come on, let's go, love. 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.260
 So you're starting to cook here. 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.209
 Our bi-roll 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.670
 I'll start by studying here 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.190
 sufficient amount of oil can not 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.010
 be very and also a little're so 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.220
 more or less but even here there are some 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:20.230
 three four tablespoons of oil, okay? 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.489
 good then add the onion remembering 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.900
 that I will leave the quantities of 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.730
 ingredient in the description of the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.830
 video the parsley 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.640
 I'll also like to put here a cube of 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.640
 broth 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:41.260
 the cut is like that of his own 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.430
 the ol of the salt reminding the staff that the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.430
 salt is delicious 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.170
 so I 'll leave it take a look at the 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.480
 our onion 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.920
 I study well then I'll arrive. 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:11.620
 here on the onion and follow when signing 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:16.900
 here our bi rolê know still low 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:26.060
 so it goes next is starting here 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:30.289
 my tomato paste is cool people are 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.150
 You do not want to be happy that one 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.550
 sauce very reluctant 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.860
 I only know that it wins a little stronger 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.960
 You're not the most ideal. 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:46.660
 now I'm going to cover here and it will cover 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:49.070
 is water is cooking final climb 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.080
 so you put the amount of 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.789
 water that covers our bic rol here 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.550
 then it 's a mere scrambled sit do not go 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.260
 want to move so abruptly because only 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.760
 will undo our biffi 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.250
 So you go like this just to mix 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.250
 right here doing like this 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:17.150
 so now you're the first one to do it 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.159
 so with sauce not tried there to 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.639
 see if I like you 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:25.219
 So I 'll catch you try that my 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.219
 If you are missing only you put in that 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:31.039
 So I'll put it a little bit later. 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:37.370
 more add a little more salt only 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:40.639
 a little bit and I'm going to play it again like this 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.689
 Andrezinho is just watching to move. 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.069
 even here our cause 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:48.680
 so this way I'll put it on fire 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:50.150
 middle is not current and also very 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.069
 down then and middle 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.219
 I'm going to camp here in my 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.219
 pressure 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.680

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.819

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.830
 You will do so when you 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.789
 start hearing the noise that started 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.460
 to take pressure 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.529
 you will count 30 minutinhos okay there 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.590

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.169
