to<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.939> in<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.240> let's<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> look<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:54.990> we

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
to see in here let's have a look what we

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.950 
to see in here let's have a look what we
get<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.399> ways<00:01:56.729> boxing<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.479> no<00:01:57.659> idea

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
get the little ways boxing but no idea

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 
get the little ways boxing but no idea
what's<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:58.500> currently<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> looks

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
what's in here currently so it looks

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.679 
what's in here currently so it looks
like<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.810> adapter<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.689> 30

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
like you get an adapter so you get a 30

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.679 
like you get an adapter so you get a 30
pin<00:02:04.110> Apple<00:02:04.530> connector<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.509> then<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
pin Apple connector here then you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.949 
pin Apple connector here then you
actually<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> USB<00:02:08.270> 232<00:02:09.270> am<00:02:09.450> sorry<00:02:09.899> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
actually get a USB 232 am sorry a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.800 
actually get a USB 232 am sorry a
microUSB<00:02:10.890> potentially<00:02:11.520> yet<00:02:11.760> then<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.660> your

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
microUSB potentially yet then to your

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.630 
microUSB potentially yet then to your
Apple<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.290> that

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
Apple of that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.120 
Apple of that
so<00:02:14.420> let's<00:02:14.569> just<00:02:14.750> put<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:15.080> one<00:02:15.350> side<00:02:15.410> and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
so let's just put that to one side and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.949 
so let's just put that to one side and
then<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.670> also<00:02:16.850> get<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.210> very<00:02:17.450> nice<00:02:17.630> cat

maaco there's the indicator so currently
this<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.799> about<00:03:31.040> four-fifths<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.030> charge

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
this is about four-fifths of a charge

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.050 
this is about four-fifths of a charge
into<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.019> device<00:03:33.290> but<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.190> actual<00:03:34.519> material

into the device but the actual material

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.750 
into the device but the actual material
is<00:03:35.150> very<00:03:35.180> very<00:03:35.510> nice<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:36.190> actually<00:03:37.190> doesn't

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
is very very nice it actually doesn't

glide too much and definitely fills a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.340 
glide too much and definitely fills a
very<00:03:40.430> high<00:03:40.610> quality<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.420> i<00:03:41.660> want<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.170> say<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.320> big

charge I mean I could charge for full
iphones<00:04:18.530> with<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:18.859> so<00:04:19.190> it's<00:04:19.340> a<00:04:19.400> very<00:04:19.430> very

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
iphones with this so it's a very very

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.469 
iphones with this so it's a very very
nice<00:04:20.169> a<00:04:21.169> very<00:04:22.070> very<00:04:22.460> nice<00:04:22.610> size<00:04:23.000> for<00:04:23.030> the

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
nice a very very nice size for the

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.120 
nice a very very nice size for the
amount<00:04:23.720> of<00:04:23.810> capacity<00:04:24.020> battery<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:24.979> has

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
amount of capacity battery that it has

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.740 
amount of capacity battery that it has
on<00:04:25.160> here<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.910> one<00:04:26.060> thing<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.360> would<00:04:26.510> say<00:04:26.539> is

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
on here the one thing I would say is

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.290 
on here the one thing I would say is
obviously

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
obviously

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.510 
obviously
it's<00:04:27.870> not<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.199> capacity<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:28.830> think<00:04:29.190> in<00:04:29.400> these

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
it's not the capacity I think in these

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.520 
it's not the capacity I think in these
things<00:04:29.789> these<00:04:30.060> days<00:04:30.120> it's<00:04:30.629> how<00:04:30.780> charged<00:04:31.199> how

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
things these days it's how charged how

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.770 
things these days it's how charged how
quickly<00:04:31.800> they<00:04:32.069> charge<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.669> device<00:04:32.819> I've<00:04:33.180> come

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
quickly they charge the device I've come

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
own personal external battery that I'm

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.879 
own personal external battery that I'm
going<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.580> use<00:04:47.840> everywhere<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.900> go<00:04:49.020> even<00:04:49.590> taking

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
going to use everywhere I go even taking

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.649 
going to use everywhere I go even taking
it<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.099> work<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.699> the<00:04:50.849> move<00:04:51.000> no<00:04:51.240> matter<00:04:51.330> where<00:04:51.629> I

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 
it to work on the move no matter where I

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.499 
it to work on the move no matter where I
go<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.259> I<00:04:52.740> think<00:04:53.669> to<00:04:53.699> actually<00:04:54.030> charge<00:04:54.270> this

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
go and I think to actually charge this

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.930 
go and I think to actually charge this
device<00:04:54.840> up<00:04:55.139> for<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.830> first<00:04:56.129> time<00:04:56.430> took<00:04:56.729> around

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
device up for the first time took around

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.540 
device up for the first time took around
11<00:04:57.389> hours<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:57.960> yes<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.919> takes<00:04:59.099> a<00:04:59.220> lot<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.400> main

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
11 hours so yes it takes a lot of main
