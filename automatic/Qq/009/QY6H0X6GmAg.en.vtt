00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.150
 In this way , you can enjoy the band that has a handle only on one side of the band 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:13.530
 Of course you can connect even from the whole 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.630
 If you do not have a handle, first 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.039
 First of all , take about 30 centimeters of Saki and fold it in half 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.679
 In the crown of the 30 centimeters of position 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.679
 I will stop the rest at the tip 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.880
 It is wrapped around the body and spread to the width tinged with Kobi 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:57.460
 If the person is facing open the first band with the underline and with the right side the band with the underline 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.460
 Necessarily close down diagonally close tightly 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.070
 We weave from hobio towards the center 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.620
 Transfer 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.240
 Umbrella so that the band that was rolled tomorrow will be on the top 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.240
 I will conclude 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.110
 Carelessly shut 2 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.110
 It becomes difficult to untie by making a shield 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:37.250
 I just weave it ahead towards the left 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.250
 I will tie a wrap around the root of my hand with my daughter earlier 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:57.400
 And cares day to the same about the length and hand in not completely open all at this time 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.730
 The fire of love is broadened 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.730
 Pull the band from behind the knot 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.870
 At this time, if you pull out all the moat day , the knot will be released, so a little play will be left 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.870
 will do so 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.380
 Pull the obi from the same place further 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.850
 d play a little more over here to make a general rule 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.100
 Pull the obi from the same place further 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:52.880
 The tip of the part where they entered last is put on top of the drum 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.630
 The Maki this step, please be adjusted by the length of the band 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.950
 Finally adjust the condition of the two angle top types 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.950
 It is the completion of the obi tie 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.580
 At the end turn the obi back 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:11.710
 Chopsticks holding Hiyama with the right hand and banding with the left 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.710
 Slowly turn from left to right 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.740
