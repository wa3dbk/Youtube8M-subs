00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello hunters welcome to the channel 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.340
 see vi said in our session 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.060
 monster hunter 4 we bring the second 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.189
 event that is now available now for 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.680
 the whole world of universal studies 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.810
 Japan and well this is here in the sand 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 our rivals are a while the celeste 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.210
 there we have the xerez and a radial 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 golden that is just behind and what 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.450
 what are we going to do first is to see if 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.850
 we managed to divide these two 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.440
 monsters because the sand pressing these 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.870
 switches we can make it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.630
 lift a fence and divide them there 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.970
 we have the rat two to one side the line an 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.610
 has come running to here and to 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.640
 press the city switch before the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.410
 button then a grid rises there the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.670
 we have and the time has remained to the other 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.950
 side and the rational and this lasts a while 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.289
 determined and then it gets off 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.149
 and we are tired and we can have 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.149
 access to the entire area of ​​the area 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.690
 good 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.940
 s 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.940
 whether it's been a few days 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.250
 the other universal studies event 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.729
 Japan that the change is giant that we 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.220
 they gave as a reward a set for the 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.340
 autumn and a charlie axel for us 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.810
 well this rat event the celestial and 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:51.360
 the great golden one gives us as a reward the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.360
 armor for our hunter 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.420
 although good time and wasting 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.549
 hitting him 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.159
 meanwhile there we have the mice 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.009
 which is on the other side of the gate 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.009
 ain saying but I want to enter 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.840
 but for the moment there they stay 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.610
 good I add 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.950
 I love the golden coloration of the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.520
 golden ray 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.520
 it's beautiful this monster 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.140
 and there are treated 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.370
 the grating has already been lowered whether it be turns 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.370
 comment here the two 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.840
 on the floor you have to try to take advantage 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.840
 I had the presence of more 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.920
 in the district 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.920
 let's hide a good 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.459
 Y 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:37.070
 and I commented to you I went back to say we have 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.260
 now now if any cut we will have the 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.239
 new air grating 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.349
 this is that they have returned to remove the rat 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.349
 there are the golden ones 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.780
 the cities and those that already know that in 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.500
 these events that we can then get 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.860
 as a reward weapon or armor at the end 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.430
 of the video we have a small addition 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.180
 teaching this reward in this case 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.209
 how is an armor 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.740
 then we will teach the look to outside 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:14.800
 of the armor a back view but 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.959
 but we will not do the analysis because only 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.739
 we will do it in its corresponding 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.739
 pulled apart 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.440
 Well, as the ration has already fallen 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.340
 we are here preparing the supplies 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.220
 for when when the barrier goes down there 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.440
 it is and come rat those that we are 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.750
 looking is having a good time looking more 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.760
 where I was going to go to 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.330
 take a walk and when I had to come 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.919
 I was to distract there is 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.919
 exploiter barrel 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 stellar 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.430
 and good 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.580
 I'm going to do something that I say there's never 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.350
 what to do is to hit a little bit 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.120
 monster while a partner is 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.110
 doing the ride but nothing 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.620
 stuck very little four touches hundreds 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.849
 waste 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.619
 you do not know what 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.619
 which is not an additional part 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.490
 come to the ground again click 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.090
 ay looking for the moment 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:03.170
 and the excellent and good treaty has fallen 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.950
 is that really the color of the treaty 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.009
 Celestial will suit the armor 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.050
 why 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.379

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.379

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.670
 and we will see it obviously I will teach it here 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.910
 at the end we will make this small addition 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:26.630
 when I get it, you know that the 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.950
 we put and we teach it but I do not do 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.570
 the analysis is worth it here I will not do the 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.300
 analysis is playing in its corresponding 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.500
