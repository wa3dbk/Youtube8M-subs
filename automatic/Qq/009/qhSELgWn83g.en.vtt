 U 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.080
 Hello, this is a shrewd portal site early 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.810
 Now there is a good concept of id things . As the temperature rises, 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.310
 It's getting better and the company started. 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.730
 I think you guys are sympathetic to the importance of tires. 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.760
 But when the specific information was 02 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.900
 The government wanted to tell you, from 9 to Mission 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.250
 The kind of botox ipl tie is then according to whether it is noah ' 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.860
 There is 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.510
 It's complicated and difficult, but judging the right tire for you 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.230
 It's not difficult 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.350
 You can judge it as a marker map by appearing next to the tar 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:58.260
 What does it mean to be a timed table 10? 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.260
 First of all, let's see if it's a big place. 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:10.210
 Looking at the side of the tire , 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:15.340
 You can see the number 80 b16 mc 77 h in the slush place 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.060
 First, I will explain this from a large number 150 indicating the width of the tire 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.430
 It is. 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:24.670
 That's a 150ml mark. The higher the number, the thicker the tire. 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.990
 It 's a sign that it's getting thicker . 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:34.060
 80 next'm going to show the thickness of the tire 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:38.109
 You can think of it as 80mm, not 80mm, 150mm. 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:43.570
 80 That procedure is an indication 120ml 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:47.619
 In written that the next thing b'm going to show the meaning of bias tires 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.490
 Bayer Star 2's radial tire is labeled as Al 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.710
 Next time about the radials radial tires and buyer styles a little more 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:01.010
 I will explain in detail. 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.440
 Next to it, 16 indicates the diameter of the fill , 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.690
 It's a tire wheel. 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:13.220
 It is widely used from 10 to 30 inches. 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.580
 The sign "mc" marks the motorcycle resilience. 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:22.160
 77 is the tire load index. 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.240
 77 Sounds Approximately 1 Firefighter that can hold about 390 to 400 kilometers 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.260
 That means. 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:32.180
 Getting down to the weight of Utrecht You will find a little bit more would decrease 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.560
 It's great that you choose the right tire technology 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.590
 It's important. 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.870
 H is displayed next to'm haneungeo speed index 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:46.220
 In the case of Mr. a, about 210 km is the appropriate speed index 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:50.570
 And that the show picked up and re-value al-jet attend attend remind you that the ride 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.420
 These are the ties that can go from 270 to 300 times 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.560
 I guess you can refer to it as 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.480
 Tires, which is the most recent release is the best Lee's Thai 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.250
 But still some American or off-road bikes have tube type 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.470
 I am using 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.650
 If you look closely at small things like 50 psi or 40 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:18.739
 Let's tell the ps and so on 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:23.900
 This psi is released when the maximum load is applied to the tie and you 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:28.760
 That would mean it is to display the maximum permissible inflation pressure of tires dagger 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.579
 But many people, if it says is 55 ps to clothes to matchusin plant 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.630
 You know this is wrong. 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:40.730
 From 70 to up to normal public station 80 Pro i.e. spirit of the tire 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:44.660
 It is a good idea to match a 47-year-old foe between 35 p days . 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:50.060
 Finally, one of the things to watch is the date of manufacture . 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:51.110
 The date of manufacture is usually in the case of boxes, such as boxes, 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.070
 I do. 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.630
 This tire is also listed as the 6th of imaging 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:02.690
 Pay utmost Two kkeokkuro under this vintage-digit display behind a kite 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:08.720
 The first two digits indicate the production line. 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:13.400
 Italy is going to go to the 12th year 2012 06 06th Chuvettel produced 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.230
 If you know the markings of the billions of billions of tires, 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.449
 No goblins. 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:22.520
 Tires are very vulnerable to direct sunlight. Even if you get three , 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:28.070
 Reduced life expectancy 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.130
 The high price of tires is a better sense of trust than a dry place. 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.260
 Note please 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.090
 Antimicrobial Riders Very close to safety No matter how important school politics are 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.780
 Part is 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.280
 Today know this information, the fact that they know little anyone has the interest 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.610
 Things are 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.120
 Check the side of the tire when you show the tire in the future. 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.550
 I do not want to see the right tires for my feet 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.550
 Now Im birth was dismissed from the motor to the site
