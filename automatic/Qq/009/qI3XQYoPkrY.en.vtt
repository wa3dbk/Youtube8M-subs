00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.530
 hello everyone what if I change a little bit 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.330
 mikroft here and so it will look 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.029
 today's mod called but 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.250
 cups then there are no clubs and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 really friends cubes mykrafte 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.050
 almost no that is all that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.550
 see now looks well I would say 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.779
 slightly more realistic 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.640
 although in reality everything is still 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.309
 consists of cubes mykrafte 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 only they are all smoother all the pits 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.570
 cave and other education looks 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.550
 really more realistic because well 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.559
 in real life agree no one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.300
 saw the square stones although it may 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.700
 seen but nevertheless not so 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.800
 huge numbers like my craft then 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.079
 have as you can see really changed 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.140
 all the mountains are more like mountains 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.340
 the snow is more like snow though to the very 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.190
 really strange one 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.079
 but that less really is now Mycroft 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.270
 changed and this mod is very cool 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.649
 suitable for those who are tired of the standard 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.920
 mikroft let's go 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.200
 turn on the creative mode and a little bit about 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.090
 we run jump on the current new world 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.590
 honestly i like best 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.900
 what the new cave looks like 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.760
 if earlier they identified, of course, too 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 like caves but now they are bigger 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.880
 really looks like these same caves 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 and really more realistic 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.900
 let's see what happens if 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.970
 use a little tnt with this mod 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.939
 that is, dynamite take a little 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.369
 dynamite and undermine his friends will see 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 like a dynamite hole does n't look 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.570
 cube as soon as 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.210
 let's get a little bit really 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.100
 let's see we lay in here dynamite and by the way 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.140
 laying dynamite too cool now 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.119
 and undermine it 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.790
 excellent and blew it out of here 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.970
 we leave and let's see what will happen and 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.189
 so there is an explosion and voila here such 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.710
 small moles have turned us that is 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.619
 Blyth help realistically what will happen if 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.390
 lay a lot more dynamite well i think 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.490
 you can check it yourself 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 the reservoir is now way too, but looks 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.570
 more like real pond water 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.530
 now spreads like she should 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.390
 to develop well, that is, how 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.480
 really really all this 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.670
 reached to reach ie appeared 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.200
 Only thanks to the fact that I have something 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.850
 I want to say initially 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.770
 Mycroft remained the same cubic 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.780
 only now thanks to this fashion all 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.640
 become smoother that is see 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.500
 how to show it to you 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.330
 now trying to go to the blog 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.430
 but I can't because respectively 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.390
 there really is a block and to go 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.400
 i need to jump 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.709
 well, or for example in the part about digging two 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.989
 block in depth and let me show you now 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.030
 how it will look like this from 2 then 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.350
 there are friends here are these bugs 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.000
 there is generally 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.620
 but by the way you can look at 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.660
 all these gorgeous caves below 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.430
 but no less bugs 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.920
 friends and it is rather pure 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.140
 Well, such a fun mod problem with shadows 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.519
 Naturally, too, but because 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.010
 Mycroft was originally developed 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.780
 to others it is generally very cool 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.300
 probably for shooting a landscape 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.640
 people like all friends pledge yes 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.980
 just for shooting beautiful landscapes 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.080
 landscapes when you need to show exactly 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.610
 the beauty of minecraft seems to me shaders 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.590
 it will be just great 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.510
 overall okay friends if you need a pit 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.730
 play with this mods link to me like 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.040
 always in the description but with you was bender 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.890
 Thank you all for watching. Put your own 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.890
 thumbs up all good luck and bye
