00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:15.160
 good again in this break or there's 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.890
 today we are going to do what is the sag of the 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.890
 fork that we are going to prepare for 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.849
 for us that is very particular and the 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.649
 bounce of the fork in case of low 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.989
 You see he puts a turtle and a hare 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.960
 it is more or less bouncing in the case of fox 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.820
 comes a more or less the rebound is when 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.470
 we have the hairpin down is with the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.440
 strength that goes up if you 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.149
 we put to stop towards the turtle you go to 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.820
 see that the fork stays almost like 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.030
 dead goes up and now under the left alone and 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.700
 go up in slow motion 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.390
 I do not know if it is appreciated 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 at the speed he wants he returns to 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.440
 its natural position is very slow 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.280
 that 's turtle position 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.840
 now let's put the bounce to butt 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.120
 towards the hare 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.120
 and you are going to see that when the 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.890
 fork will go up 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.180
 much livelier up will have 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.950
 much more strength in returning to your position 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.250
 natural 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.929
 I down 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.790
 he left her alone to the bike and whiskey returns 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.890
 speed I subero 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.530
 okay that's one thing that has the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.010
 hairpin and each one is very particular 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.040
 can play with the bounce put it so much 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.720
 to see in turtle position is too much 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.510
 slow in free position as there are people 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.070
 he likes most suitable for my 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.890
 It's a pleasure to take it in the middle but that's 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.260
 is very particular but that you know that the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.690
 Most front suspensions 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.060
 he has it in the backs too 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.770
 but play you and put it to your 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.270
 taste there are many people who have 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.150
 hairpins and this has never touched us 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.760
 play to put it towards the turtle I 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.470
 now I have it to stop towards him and towards 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.190
 the hare I'm going to put it I'm going to leave 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.480
 to my taste that is a little over half 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.050
 there he stays 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.550
 and you are going to see that it goes up but it does not have 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.250
 excessive force 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.710
 to see we already know what the bounce is and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.390
 Now let's find out what that the 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.390
 pull out is the sinking that the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.980
 fork with our weight on the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.380
 equipment that we are going to do the march or 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.290
 the proof that you want to do you put the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.710
 culotte the helmet the sneakers and you go 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.460
 with much to go to the backpack to have the 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:37.400
 fork to expression I go up to see 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.590
 normally the forks have this 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.780
 orbit the downs down 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.580
 in a fork this is 100 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.250
 wolf hai is down although there is a 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.780
 little bit to see in case the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.760
 fork do not have this rubber band that the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.550
 you have the most you put a bridle 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.280
 finite that the flange is kept 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.580
 I know it does not rise and fall again 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.260
 down by the time I do 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.360
 that stays in the place to where 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.760
 has worked the fork that does not return 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.120
 to fall like that you just put a flange 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.250
 and it looks good down there and I will 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.750
 think that I'm wearing the helmet 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.320
 backpack everything you are going to do 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.430
 test we ride on the bike with the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.430
 unlocked fork 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.790
 there it is unlocked and you see that it has 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.460
 lowered the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.970
 you go down 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.500
 and what has moved is that I as a 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.960
 I like that the fork works a lot 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 I have it almost at 30 so that 's why it 's very 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.480
 particular the normal is a 20 a 25 of 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.340
 15 to 25 normal 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.530
 It is normal most people 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.019
 nobody are going to say we have to work 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.560
 this almost works me, let's say 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.849
 a 30 working then I get the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.489
 fork works all that is the 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.000
 hairpin I like to go with very little 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.980
 pressure on the front fork 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.360
 that 's what they call that as 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.860
 we regulate having as many faces as fos 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.450
 you have a valve like that of the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.450
 wheel than with a special pump 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.070
 we would need this special pump of 

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.260
 hairpins the manufacturer of roxos te 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.900
 by weight puts pressure there 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.000
 that put both positive and negative 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.330
 negative in this fork of 100's 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.840
 travel we look for what we think 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.300
 there comes the table of weights I come 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.180
 both the positive and the negative that 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.870
 you have to put pressure on p 6 a 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.710
 see me for example that weight 60 kilos 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.780
 we look here that is less than 63 that is 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.910
 the first table and I have to put 80 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.260
 to 106 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.730
 both positive and negative 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.890
 understood let's go another case a new 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:05.790
 that weighs 75 kilos artist from 72 to 81 of 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.950
 115 to 136 in the positive that the negative 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.580
 to the same this is the positive one of 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.710
 up and this is the negative 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.220
 to see in most of the hairpins of 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.050
 today there is only positive part this 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.490
 is for a fork already with a few years 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.770
 that has as much negative as 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.680
 positive in case of false you are going to 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.210
 find the positive part you have already 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.770
 seen that I had a blood of 30 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.439
 because I like the hairpin to work 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:36.439
 so much that you do the whole journey 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:40.250
 I have 75 pe 650 100 let's say 75 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:42.800
 and he asks me 80 I have a little less of the 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.720
 minimum he asks me and that's why I have a 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.600
 sack of 30 would get in let's put 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.320
 up to 100 that can you mark me 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.210
 the manufacturer asks me for 80 to 100 looks 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.120
 I already have 100 p 6 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.810
 I had 75 had less than the limit 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.720
 lower 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.210
 now I would ride on the fork and 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.000
 I would drop less or is such that I 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.650
 would come out now it would be more or less than 15 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.840
 at 20 percent we're going to check 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.300
 to the same thing we're going to think that I'm with 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.820
 the kit as I said before the 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.190
 helmet the backpack of the pile with the 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.190
 unlocked fork has to come down 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:27.060
 before it has not fallen almost up to 30% and 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:29.139
 now I calculate that although I made a 20 and 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.659
 has gone down 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.919
 to 20 he was insane before me has 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:34.960
 come down here because I had it with 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.669
 much less expression that's very 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.099
 particular each one that puts it to its 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:42.370
 way more or less the manufacturer gives you 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.719
 an orientation to see how much softer 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.509
 or less push pressures is to the 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:49.300
 fork to work more fork 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:51.969
 is going to get here the rubber when 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.860
 you see a big but clear male is going to 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.360
 work more work better but move 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.819
 more will suffer if you want the 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.009
 hairpin will last for a bit 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:02.169
 more pressure or what it sends you to 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.779
 manufacturer I get married he puts a little 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:07.240
 not least because I like but that's 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.830
 very particular good I hope that you 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.550
 have liked the rich vice of today and 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:15.729
 you know how to adjust the bounce below 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.879
 in turtle position or less or more like 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:20.650
 I called each coffee every manufacturer but 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.500
 I already tell you that it is very particular and then 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:28.330
 Sag what is your weight as you 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:31.479
 you mount and you get more or less 30% is 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:34.499
 the most that is usually put into function 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:34.499
 of the pressure that put that 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.789
 none of this more until the next scream 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:39.789
 light greetings
