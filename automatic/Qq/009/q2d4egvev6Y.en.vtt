00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.770

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:18.830
 I live and brunette 92 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.420
 or small or small vipers to all 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.310
 vaquitas and welcome to a new 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.990
 troll trap for sky piggy and we're going to 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.240
 make a troll bridge that was time 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.770
 that did not bring any to the channel and well 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.230
 realized that there are a couple of 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.120
 Minions are worth all and they are super troll 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.160
 controlling people and good I have 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.590
 followed and well let's try to do 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.199
 today a troll troll a troll bridge with 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.970
 gravel here I have it or if I hope what 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.470
 point is with a little hand up and we're going to 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.360
 try to make this video reach a 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.040
 quite high likes challenge is worth it because 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.530
 today's incident is going to be chubby 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.300
 big bear and let's say it's worth it 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.040
 to try to bite one at least 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.480
 because good for the trap to be 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.309
 overcome as a person has to 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.130
 always chop in any kind of 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.690
 trap that I do and well I'm a pastor 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.399
 It's still good because I'm a cow 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.860
 troll you know everything you know me 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.360
 I'm crazy but let's try to 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.550
 do the storage rooms that need to be done 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.040
 posters okay let's divide this here 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.490
 let's make posters because the trap 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.490
 from today 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.470
 have to hold the gravel in the gravel 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.289
 it is a material that runs off that is to say that 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.700
 do not grab then with posters the 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.750
 we will keep it in the air until 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.810
 someone we 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.850
 and we can throw it into the vacuum then I 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.130
 I think this is so good and to 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.100
 see or yes ok let's see how is the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.200
 panorama the first thing my mother what not 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.820
 I know where I'm going to make the good bridge 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.340
 Now we will think the same way we 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.960
 to go get a special chest worth 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.910
 that will give us some armor 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.729
 fairly normal or in terpel 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.350
 what are you doing no no no no name do not tell me 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.210
 make kill and greet your mom for 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.410
 Please, it's true that until I do not 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.890
 reassure 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.479
 I do not want any mother worth greet 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.780
 be careful, let's say hello or yes 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.630
 or yes we go for there perfect framework worth 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.300
 let's see what's here to see if it's worth 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.880
 with this I believe that I am already an arch worth 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.500
 with this I think that already we are going to 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.479
 start the game much better let's 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.030
 equip we are going to do all the 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.950
 craft diamond eos and we go full 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.150
 diamond or yes yes let's make a 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.689
 Chest a helmet 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.040
 some legs or if it's worth equipping ourselves with this 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.900
 I think that with this we can start 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.329
 the game rather better than the one you 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.730
 pillas is worth seeing look look where are you going 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.590
 small little one who was giving you 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.170
 drains that drains you boy has it 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.819
 warned is warned by a greeting for his 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.829
 mom for her dad and for the cousin 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.239
 jonathan vale let's see we're going to 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.489
 start building the troll bridge the 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.489
 center per la I will have at hand the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.200
 potions and we'll take them later and the 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.430
 case is that I do not know where to start doing 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.790
 the bridge I think we're going to do it 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.139
 up here yes, we're going there 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.030
 see I do not want to hit it please is 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:55.510
 I already have a way you know terpel that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.329
 is that they did not get the taste to fall or 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.269
 is always that the shot I fall is worth 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.370
 see vale vale vale vale let's do it 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.400
 here in the middle so that someone who 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.319
 follow when the last ones remain 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.569
 pique vale I'll explain how is the 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.340
 troll bridge that is pretty simple vale 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.739
 a pretty simple tutorial 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.930
 ok this block is the one that will grab 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.150
 and will activate the whole trap because it's going to 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.830
 grab the first poster is worth starting 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 of this poster are going to grab all 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.910
 the posters so we're going to mark it 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.010
 with stone to know where we have to 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.230
 break when they follow me I think this 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.610
 it feels pretty good if you do like that and 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.030
 you just have to break this 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.160
 block 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.280
 ok then let's make a little road 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.879
 of posters continuing the first one worth 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.160
 so here to see we're going to do it like that 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.410
 high long long we're going to place and 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.579
 dragging more posters is worth the first 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.170
 drag all others 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.180
 then when you remove the first 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.489
 poster all this is going to fall and they 're going to 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.940
 fall they are going to put a milk like that of 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:59.209
 my men is worth then you are going to 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.040
 see that the gravel now does not hold 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.560
 that said it slides because there are the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.209
 posters above and barely looks worth 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.579
 and gravel is gray what happens that I 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.410
 I have a couple of dragonball textures and 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.200
 the yellow visa but the gravel to pieces 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.930
 appears stones to the gravel really is 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.340
 stone material that looks like it is not 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.720
 just like the sand that I had the sand 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.730
 he says his out there I do not step but the gravel 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.950
 look, it's now the villa MarÃ­a but 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.480
 is that it is gray or it looks like stone 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.160
 you if you do not have part of texture 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.009
 you know and it's been a long time since 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.849
 use 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.439
 the predetermined textures so that 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.599
 I like these, it's worth it because I like it 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.339
 use part of textures but what does not 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.770
 like it is that the sand looks like this 

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:42.149
 yellow is worth the grains 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.029
 I'm going to miss posters I think 

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:46.919
 that I'm going to need to get about 6 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:48.629
 more but good will not happen because as 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.610
 I have the hair can go to a tree 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.960
 catch wood and ready to see 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.430
 for there you have to use them to 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.469
 hold berries in after quietly 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.330
 the case that only three remain 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:58.830
 people so I do not think it's the 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.379
 minion there will be safe harbor already 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.360
 because it is very rare that it is in fact in 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.159
 the normal thing that they have died but good 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.110
 ok let's do here we're going to 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.800
 catch a little more of wood 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.930
 to see vale 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.590
 I believe that with this we can already make a 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.729
 couple of sticks and we already do the posters 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.580
 the trap is ready the only thing that 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.750
 it is to finish it I will place the gravel and 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.669
 and go find those who are left 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.310
 outstanding we're going to do here the 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.620
 posters quickly without looking back 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.900
 I hope it will give me time is worth 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.370
 staying in the game is worth I think 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.050
 that with this papaya come let's go 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.729
 they are launching me they are already 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.780

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.879

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.030
 the trolley bridge that I have to climb 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.129
 but either I have to go to finish 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.419

 I hope you do not see the posters uncle is 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.699
 that as you can see the posters are going to 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.819
 chop ok let's go up runs runs 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.590

 I shit on the path of the voucher have not 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.849
 seen I think they have not seen it if it's 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.860
 that the chests are very camouflaged 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.289

 vale vale vale let's put here the 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.750
 Gravel remains pending worth 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:18.710
 to see worth three posters remain passes 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.390
 then we are going to place it here to see 2 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.580
 and three so you do not see the poster 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.140
 from within, it is worth the ones placed and 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.970
 we have the troll bridge now the only thing 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.830
 what we have to do is go for them 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.020
 when they follow us we break the blockade that 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.450
 I told you at the beginning and ready to see 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.890
 this was this also worth we're going to 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.280
 leave the free passage wolf those who carry 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.020
 arcs of attack from this that burns you 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.430
 valuable that you have left live we are going to 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.900
 remove this also because someone has 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.510
 past that has gotten in here and this does not 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.720
 it falls down it stays floating and you can 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:51.380
 save vale we're also going to do here 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:54.230

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:59.210

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.550

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.290

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.770

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:15.560
 trap please is it worth taking me this is 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.900
 which is that they come from the center they will have 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.190
 caught up to legendary chests and me without 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.330

 bridge is that the bridge never fails is 

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.100
 a trap that if you always get 

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.480
