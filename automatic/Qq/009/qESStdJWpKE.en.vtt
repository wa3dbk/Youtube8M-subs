don't know my eyes open but I sleep with
my<00:02:50.400> eye<00:02:50.549> open<00:02:51.269> because<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.109> muscles<00:02:52.290> aren't

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
my eye open because the muscles aren't

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.159 
my eye open because the muscles aren't
strong<00:02:52.889> enough<00:02:53.099> to<00:02:53.519> keep<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.909> closed<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.540> it's

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
strong enough to keep it closed so it's

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.929 
strong enough to keep it closed so it's
kind<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.620> freaky<00:02:56.069> like<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.400> know<00:02:56.519> if<00:02:56.609> I<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.909> a

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
little plane or something somebody would

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.409 
little plane or something somebody would
think<00:02:58.829> I<00:02:58.950> was<00:02:59.069> awake<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.579> I'm<00:02:59.700> my<00:03:00.030> eyes<00:03:00.180> are
