only<00:01:59.729> because<00:01:59.899> they're<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.140> full<00:02:01.560> grown<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
only because they're not full grown and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.950 
only because they're not full grown and
I've<00:02:02.340> got<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> little<00:02:02.729> space<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> creates

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I've got a little space so that creates

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.590 
I've got a little space so that creates
that<00:02:04.170> depth<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:05.670> depth<00:02:06.030> right<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
that depth this depth right here that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.869 
that depth this depth right here that
you<00:02:06.719> want<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:08.310> would<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.670> better

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
you want to see this would look better

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.940 
you want to see this would look better
if<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.270> wasn't<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.720> against<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> glass<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
if this wasn't all against the glass I

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.490 
if this wasn't all against the glass I
would<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.430> trim<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.819> back

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
would really trim that back

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.110 
would really trim that back
and<00:02:12.770> I'd<00:02:12.890> actually<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.400> hack<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.730> back<00:02:13.910> to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
and I'd actually just hack it back to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.420 
and I'd actually just hack it back to
like<00:02:14.300> here<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.890> should<00:02:16.160> just<00:02:16.250> do<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
like here I should just do a

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.520 
like here I should just do a
trimming<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.910> show<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.150> hack<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.230> back<00:02:18.380> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
trimming and show you hack it back to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.500 
trimming and show you hack it back to
hear<00:02:18.830> let<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.220> baby<00:02:19.460> tears<00:02:19.820> kind<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.240> do<00:02:20.360> its

plants go in the front and give yourself
some<00:02:34.370> space<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.020> want<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> create<00:02:36.620> a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
some space to but you want to create a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.100 
some space to but you want to create a
depth<00:02:37.220> if<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.000> will<00:02:38.209> like<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.540> want<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.930> want

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
depth if you will like you want you want

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.530 
depth if you will like you want you want
depth<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.070> like<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.670> blank<00:02:41.000> space<00:02:41.270> over

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
depth so like this this blank space over

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.810 
depth so like this this blank space over
here<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.930> kind<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.440> done<00:02:42.560> intentionally<00:02:42.890> it

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
here is kind of done intentionally it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.300 
here is kind of done intentionally it
gives<00:02:44.060> me<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.240> little<00:02:44.360> room<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.750> like<00:02:45.200> show<00:02:45.920> how

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
gives this the 90th hike that it has and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.180 
gives this the 90th hike that it has and
so<00:03:10.940> that's<00:03:11.330> kind<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:11.930> important<00:03:12.410> i<00:03:12.500> also<00:03:12.680> i

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
so that's kind of important i also i

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
have the Amazon sword intentionally put

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.430 
have the Amazon sword intentionally put
over<00:03:16.670> here<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.390> kind<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.600> like<00:03:17.750> pulls<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.410> I

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
over here so it kind of like pulls the I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.860 
over here so it kind of like pulls the I
in<00:03:18.920> from<00:03:19.580> over<00:03:19.850> here<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.480> they've<00:03:20.570> got<00:03:20.720> like

that<00:03:21.110> that's<00:03:21.709> actually<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.220> little<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.730> don't

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
that that's actually a little I don't

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.289 
that that's actually a little I don't
know<00:03:23.120> what<00:03:23.269> I'm<00:03:23.360> gonna<00:03:23.450> do<00:03:23.660> there<00:03:23.870> with<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.320> AH

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
know what I'm gonna do there with the AH

Cardinal Louis or whatever but that's
just<00:03:28.010> some<00:03:28.250> talk<00:03:28.489> on<00:03:28.700> design<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.090> really<00:03:29.810> think

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
just some talk on design I really think

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.170 
just some talk on design I really think
that<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.470> know<00:03:30.980> with<00:03:31.130> proper<00:03:31.519> design<00:03:31.640> you

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
that you know with proper design you

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.670 
that you know with proper design you
guys<00:03:32.299> can<00:03:32.540> really<00:03:32.780> do<00:03:32.900> well<00:03:33.080> let<00:03:33.560> another

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
guys can really do well let another

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.740 
guys can really do well let another
example<00:03:34.070> creating<00:03:34.519> depth<00:03:34.820> see<00:03:35.480> how<00:03:35.570> there's

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
example creating depth see how there's

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.270 
example creating depth see how there's
like<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:35.959> like<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.290> hole<00:03:36.590> in<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:36.830> that's

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
like a like a hole in that that's

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.770 
like a like a hole in that that's
intentional<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:38.030> makes<00:03:38.239> it<00:03:38.360> look<00:03:38.540> like

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
intentional that makes it look like

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.810
