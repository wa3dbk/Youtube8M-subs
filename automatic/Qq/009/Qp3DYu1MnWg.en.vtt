and<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> bit<00:02:33.300> scary<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.320> it<00:02:34.620> could<00:02:34.950> verge<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and a bit scary so it could verge on the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.150 
and a bit scary so it could verge on the
idea<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.210> halloween<00:02:36.660> dress<00:02:36.960> up<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.980> there<00:02:38.130> are

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
idea of halloween dress up so there are

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.770 
idea of halloween dress up so there are
ways<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.820> can<00:02:39.000> definitely<00:02:39.420> try<00:02:39.600> and
