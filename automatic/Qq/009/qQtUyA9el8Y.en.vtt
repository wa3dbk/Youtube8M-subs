I<00:02:03.329> mean<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.229> obviously<00:02:04.439> got<00:02:04.829> lucky

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
I mean I obviously got lucky

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.510 
I mean I obviously got lucky
times<00:02:06.220> but<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:07.710> pretty<00:02:08.710> much<00:02:08.800> like<00:02:09.130> with<00:02:09.340> the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
times but I pretty much like with the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.100 
times but I pretty much like with the
the<00:02:10.000> knowledge<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.420> had<00:02:10.540> in<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.660> hands<00:02:10.990> I<00:02:11.050> would

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
the knowledge I had in the hands I would

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.560 
the knowledge I had in the hands I would
do<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.040> do<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.280> all<00:02:12.460> over<00:02:12.490> again<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.330> not

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
do it do it all over again and it's not

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.360 
do it do it all over again and it's not
often<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.320> play<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.710> tournament<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:15.310> which

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
often that I play a tournament in which

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.100 
often that I play a tournament in which
I<00:02:15.640> don't<00:02:15.700> make<00:02:16.000> at<00:02:16.180> least<00:02:16.240> one<00:02:16.480> dumb<00:02:16.780> mistake

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
I don't make at least one dumb mistake

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.250 
I don't make at least one dumb mistake
so<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.760> good<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.180> pays<00:02:19.630> off<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.170> know

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
so it's good that it pays off you know

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.560 
so it's good that it pays off you know
so<00:02:20.530> I'm<00:02:21.070> very<00:02:21.130> happy<00:02:21.550> was<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.300> toughest

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
the beginning obviously the simian who

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.840 
the beginning obviously the simian who
got<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.810> third<00:02:28.990> was<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.800> big<00:02:30.010> chip<00:02:30.190> leader<00:02:30.400> but<00:02:30.670> I
