00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
actually for very long time so it might

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.910 
actually for very long time so it might
be<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.770> little<00:00:48.920> rusty<00:00:49.010> outta<00:00:49.460> me<00:00:50.470> and<00:00:51.470> I<00:00:51.680> totally

missed like most of those rings really
set

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.570 

and.and<00:01:00.850> day<00:01:01.260> remember<00:01:02.260> that<00:01:02.440> look

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
and.and day remember that look

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.490 
and.and day remember that look
also<00:01:04.580> if<00:01:04.729> I<00:01:04.879> member<00:01:05.239> right<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:06.110> chaos

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
also if I member right the chaos

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.289 
also if I member right the chaos
emeralds<00:01:06.799> in<00:01:07.189> this<00:01:07.369> one<00:01:07.640> did<00:01:07.970> absolutely

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
emeralds in this one did absolutely

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.649 
emeralds in this one did absolutely
nothing<00:01:08.689> I<00:01:09.820> know<00:01:10.820> that's<00:01:11.000> probably<00:01:11.270> because

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
nothing I know that's probably because

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.320 
nothing I know that's probably because
they<00:01:12.110> were<00:01:12.170> still<00:01:12.580> messing<00:01:13.580> with<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.880> ideas

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
they were still messing with the ideas

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.130 
they were still messing with the ideas
of<00:01:14.360> what<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.320> cast<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.830> well<00:01:16.280> for<00:01:17.140> at

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
of what the cast and well for at

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.020 
of what the cast and well for at
the<00:01:18.320> time<00:01:18.350> but<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:21.250> know<00:01:22.250> what<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.610> go<00:01:22.820> by<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
the time but you know what I go by the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.620 
the time but you know what I go by the
fact<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:23.450> my<00:01:24.229> logic<00:01:25.000> there's<00:01:26.000> only<00:01:26.149> six<00:01:26.479> in

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
fact that my logic there's only six in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.469 
fact that my logic there's only six in
the<00:01:26.720> game<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.170> therefore<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:29.030> reason<00:01:29.299> why<00:01:29.420> you

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
the game so therefore the reason why you

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:30.789 
the game so therefore the reason why you
can't<00:01:29.780> do<00:01:29.899> anything<00:01:30.110> with<00:01:30.320> them<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.649> because

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
can't do anything with them is because

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.580 
can't do anything with them is because
the<00:01:31.100> only<00:01:31.220> have<00:01:31.369> six<00:01:32.200> they<00:01:33.200> just<00:01:33.350> don't<00:01:33.470> know

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
the only have six they just don't know

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.580 
the only have six they just don't know
about<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.920> 720<00:01:37.840> yeah<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:38.869> always<00:01:39.289> go<00:01:39.409> by<00:01:39.560> that

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
about the 720 yeah I always go by that

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.070 
about the 720 yeah I always go by that
logic<00:01:42.850> come<00:01:43.850> on<00:01:43.970> get<00:01:44.420> in<00:01:44.450> there<00:01:44.659> this<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.929> the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
logic come on get in there this is the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:53.700 
logic come on get in there this is the
easiest<00:01:45.380> one

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.690 

I<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:55.659> time<00:01:55.960> fact<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.740> have<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.890> lot<00:01:57.190> of<00:01:57.220> time<00:01:57.520> on

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
I have time fact I have a lot of time on

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.480 
I have time fact I have a lot of time on
my<00:01:57.729> hands<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.420> I'm<00:01:59.380> probably<00:01:59.920> going<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.369> do<00:02:00.460> a

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
my hands so I'm probably going to do a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.430 
my hands so I'm probably going to do a
whole<00:02:00.909> entire<00:02:01.090> game<00:02:01.479> in<00:02:01.630> one<00:02:01.780> run<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.260> just

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
whole entire game in one run and just

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.250 
whole entire game in one run and just
cut<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.010> up<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.729> editing<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.510> I<00:02:04.540> fit<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.080> on<00:02:05.200> the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
cut it up in editing so I fit it on the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:15.720 
cut it up in editing so I fit it on the
family<00:02:11.610> let's<00:02:12.610> see<00:02:12.850> there<00:02:13.239> was<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:14.280> yeah<00:02:15.280> that's
