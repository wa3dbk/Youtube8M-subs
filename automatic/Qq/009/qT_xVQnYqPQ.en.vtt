00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
on Friday but you never know it's for us

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330 
on Friday but you never know it's for us
this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.570> still<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> long-term<00:01:16.590> process<00:01:16.860> there

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
this is still a long-term process there

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249 
this is still a long-term process there
are<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> team<00:01:17.700> they<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:17.990> probably<00:01:18.990> been

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
are a team they are probably been

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.929 
are a team they are probably been
playing<00:01:19.500> together<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.979> couple<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.430> years<00:01:20.580> most

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
playing together a couple of years most

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.130 
playing together a couple of years most
of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> players<00:01:21.420> we've<00:01:21.780> been<00:01:21.930> playing

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
of the players we've been playing

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.070 
of the players we've been playing
together<00:01:22.259> six<00:01:22.740> weeks<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.670> team<00:01:24.080> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
together six weeks with this team so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.600 
together six weeks with this team so
that's<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.439> huge<00:01:25.470> difference<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.490> that's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that's a huge difference and that's

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
that's a huge difference and that's
probably<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.420> difference<00:01:27.810> between<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
probably the difference between the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.670 
probably the difference between the
teams<00:01:28.470> right<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.960> because<00:01:31.350> we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
teams right now I don't know because we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.740 
teams right now I don't know because we
have

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
have

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.460

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
much time here in New York but maybe

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.300 
much time here in New York but maybe
next<00:01:36.710> next<00:01:37.310> year<00:01:37.460> we're<00:01:37.760> gonna<00:01:37.940> be<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.860> big<00:01:39.860> big

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
next next year we're gonna be a big big

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.140 
next next year we're gonna be a big big
team<00:01:40.610> right<00:01:41.479> now<00:01:41.510> maybe<00:01:42.080> he'll<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.979> have<00:01:43.460> more

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150
