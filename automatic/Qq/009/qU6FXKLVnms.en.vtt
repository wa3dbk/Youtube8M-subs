 cook onions for one to 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.450
 two by peaches once the onions 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.140

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.519
 proved with the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.540
 now we can add the broth 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.940
 Poultry 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.010
 I do not want anybody else to put on 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.569
 as and the explosion in the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.950
 pan to add draft 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.890

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.450
 tomato to give a nice color to 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.450
 the preparation 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.770
 will also be able to add Parmesan and 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.050

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.060
 langes and is now is now 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.890
 replaced the bo 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.900
 refrigerator to cool the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.040
 rice be careful though but as it is 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.410
 a little hot must first leave 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.320
 cool to room temperature 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.989
 once we prepared the rice the 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.620
 tomato sauce flour the pure end and there 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.630
 I have eyes what I have 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.890

 orange in the hand with hands 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.860
 wet saint martin good because that 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.000
 avoid that it sticks a little more to make a 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.670
 little more care or to 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.900
 shape into dumplings and then 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.400
 after you're going to push a finger in 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.470
 to do one too much to be able to enter 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.080
 the meat stuffing inside is 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.410
