protection this video is about the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.490 
protection this video is about the
complete<00:00:18.399> assembly<00:00:18.849> of<00:00:19.180> our<00:00:19.360> Jin<00:00:19.599> x-series<00:00:20.140> a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
complete assembly of our Jin x-series a

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.600 
complete assembly of our Jin x-series a
little<00:00:20.770> bit<00:00:20.890> different<00:00:21.250> because<00:00:21.310> the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
little bit different because the

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.159 
little bit different because the
old-school<00:00:21.970> series<00:00:22.419> just<00:00:22.660> happen<00:00:22.930> as<00:00:23.140> a

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
old-school series just happen as a

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.519 
old-school series just happen as a
simple<00:00:23.590> passive<00:00:23.980> lens<00:00:24.419> the<00:00:25.419> aid<00:00:25.750> of<00:00:26.020> the<00:00:26.140> Gen<00:00:26.349> X

simple passive lens the aid of the Gen X

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.290 
simple passive lens the aid of the Gen X
series<00:00:26.739> comes<00:00:27.099> with<00:00:27.189> an<00:00:27.369> ADF<00:00:27.820> so<00:00:28.119> it's<00:00:28.239> a

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
series comes with an ADF so it's a

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.760 
series comes with an ADF so it's a
little<00:00:28.419> bit<00:00:28.599> different<00:00:28.899> for<00:00:29.050> assembly<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:29.619> let

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
little bit different for assembly so let

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.080 
little bit different for assembly so let
me<00:00:29.829> show<00:00:29.980> you<00:00:30.009> all<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.279> different<00:00:30.399> components
