00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 league pro i am piece and today we are here 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.890
 on a new game today's game is not 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.840
 a horror game but it's a rage game thing 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 I intend to play holding the joker and there 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.730
 are those games like in this case not 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.320
 better than a name anyway okay I am 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.010
 of the games we say they will do to you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.810
 let's just drop the balls right 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.000
 in a fairly kind term 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.590
 the games are how they stop or what 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.480
 mara still those games where they 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 just that make you go up on Nazism 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.349
 so let's see this 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.570
 game that is a free game you can 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.430
 find on the web is the name goes well this 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.930
 vivid and it's a game in my opinion it is 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 wonderful then let's try it i am 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.579
 first at least I hope 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 so anyway I don't know how long it lasts 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.879
 because I didn't even try it 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.270
 I try here with you 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.680
 however I know that it is annoying you jump with i 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.350
 basic commands ie we have as commands 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 the darts and the company take a moment 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 headphones because they do a normal 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.590
 absurd yes it is here it is a 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.159
 very simple game I fell already with 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.119
 GDP is in a double jump at no no 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.010
 I had to think about it, I feel careful 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.729
 what does it mean 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:20.790
 not that shit and it's not easy there 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.830
 I say eh no it is not ours at 11 and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 already exceeds the first ok this not me 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.530
 I expected to have so much there are not the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.240
 Scores then I swear it's hard 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:39.000
 especially the jumps up is difficult 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:41.490
 these things then host ostia or eva 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.840
 yepez likely pro own patches 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.939
 passed day my name is burt is not 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.340
 part burt and then look also at the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.390
 graphics va beh is a proper retrogame 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.689
 a very simple thing no way out in 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.689
 the pop 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.780
 move mental problems piece problems 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.700
 mental because you don't know me not 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.599
 I care so much breakthrough 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.930
 day 2 is not a game piece dies two 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.500
 times in two piece episodes is no 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.849
 even with the earthquake we will not 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.189
 I understand nothing guys I swear not 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.780

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.430
 make room 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:34.109
 try it you find it on the internet for free 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.639
 ie for example write the name I the 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.639
 first time liked vivid I do not tell you 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:42.480
 what came out anyway is because I do 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:49.919
 I do this not to be born of how I do it 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:52.010
 then this is difficult calm they use 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:03:00.090
 only two keys but they are those games or 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:02.189
 exceeded that is becomes seems worse 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.209

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.660
