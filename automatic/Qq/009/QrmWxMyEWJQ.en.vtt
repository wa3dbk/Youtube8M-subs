00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi girls so today a 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.180
 little video that I wanted to do because 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.000
 that I thought it could be 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.210
 interesting for moms who like 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.039
 I have children who have eczema or 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.020
 who have very dry skin in the background 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.039
 I searched everywhere to do what 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.060
 to help all that is ultimately 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.240
 I came to the conclusion 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.399
 conclusion I had come to use the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.890
 sybase ice 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.960
 as if I remember more bonuses 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.920
 but it's a really cheap product 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.260
 for quality and then in the background 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.260
 works and for the writing ie 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.989
 that my youngest was examining 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.649
 example in the interiors of the elbows 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.710
 it worked great so for the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.480
 I recommend crises much except 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.710
 that childhood that I found myself for 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.409
 my daughter is that the products that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.720
 I use in life and products for 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.020
 wash then alone it caused a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.000
 drought to his skin so I went 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.890
 see my cosmetologist that I have him 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.400
 talked a little bit about you talking about 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.830
 internal products as an example ago 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.830
 something like this like this 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:39.220
 a little bit when I signed an island 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:41.080
 city ​​engineering the believer like that that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 that's what I use as a shower gel 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.620
 in the background if we want and even saw that 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.480
 shampoos also affects the apple has 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.800
 done well i also use as 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.690
 shampoo this game from this time of 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.840
 childhood could not hair 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.340
 super super party hall do not have 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.400
 need ask special shampoo where 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.479
 everything is done that France is the most 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.560
 young I get up with cleaning oil 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:13.800
 like this then after I cream it with 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.860
 lotion on milk and emollient body 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.290
 like that that if I 'm wrong and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.770
 like 31 dollar so that's a moment 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.020
 quite expensive for this bottle the me 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.830
 I take them to the family tree life 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.980
 that one and 18 and something I like 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.980
 buy back even August and so the bill 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.790
 18 49 makes that I think it's worth 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.860
 really worth it 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.500
 I saw many children the difference 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.730
 as soon as I try to use 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.410
 normal shower gels as soon as the soaps for 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.930
 baby even though I took the soaps 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.030
 johnson johnson 1 extract for babies 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.070
 it had not worked that with this 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.750
 I really saw a big difference 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.050
 then in the background I had it's this 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.400
 been except that I'm still going to 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.019
 champion do you remember I lead 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.110
 it's rough it works for its 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.430
 dishes of what's going on then 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.250
 just put the Greek this down 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.870
 was not enough to calm that would be 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.660
 that is, yes it worked 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.510
 when crises but in terms of 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.030
 really make the skin less dry that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.489
 did not work so when I realized 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.450
 that's the soaps and shampoos 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.400
 since I started using this 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.620
 I also reduced the needs of 1 or 2 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.930
 days to - gueye really an exception 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.930
 what my daughter is really dirty because 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.580
 they play outside or that sami's 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.770
 spaghetti a hair something 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.220
 as alone but otherwise I try to do 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.330
 the baths 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:56.190
 once two more days of wearing himself 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.780
 cleansers and then the emollients 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.870
 then for the crises at that moment the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.450
 free with the glacial makes it 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.780
 a lot helped really happy to have 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.270

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.250
 problems because that in prison they 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.020
 so want to push them that's it 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.090

 special times that counts for this 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.060
 promotion there but still I find 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.340
 that it's worth doing from 7 to 13 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.070
 February 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.950

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.350
 pleasure to hear them read them all 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.390
 this because ben I think it's 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.590
 significant fact is I have 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.770

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.620

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.590
