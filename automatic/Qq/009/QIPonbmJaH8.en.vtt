00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.750 
dance I like the thought of just
creating<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.079> place<00:03:47.260> for<00:03:47.410> people<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.709> escape<00:03:48.430> to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
creating a place for people to escape to

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.240 
creating a place for people to escape to
and<00:03:49.209> it's<00:03:49.690> like<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> this<00:03:50.139> fictional<00:03:50.590> world

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
and it's like a this fictional world

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.589 
and it's like a this fictional world
where<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.549> don't<00:03:51.700> have<00:03:51.819> any<00:03:51.880> cares<00:03:52.329> or<00:03:52.480> any

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
where you don't have any cares or any

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.640 
where you don't have any cares or any
worries<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.139> so<00:03:53.230> it's<00:03:53.380> fun

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
worries and so it's fun

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.410 
worries and so it's fun
be<00:03:53.769> able<00:03:53.890> to<00:03:54.069> create<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.370> place<00:03:54.610> that's<00:03:54.819> that's

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
be able to create a place that's that's

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.000 
be able to create a place that's that's
like<00:03:55.540> stripped<00:03:55.989> away<00:03:56.110> completely<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.829> you

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
like stripped away completely and you

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.470 
like stripped away completely and you
can<00:03:57.159> just<00:03:57.400> dive<00:03:57.730> into<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.299> feel<00:03:58.420> like

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
can just dive into it and feel like

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.080 
can just dive into it and feel like
you're<00:03:58.720> your<00:03:59.409> loss<00:03:59.680> to<00:04:00.069> follow<00:04:00.310> along<00:04:00.610> for<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090

you're your loss to follow along for the
ride
