simple<00:00:35.920> bowl

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.200 

which<00:00:39.810> is<00:00:40.080> easy<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.500> Manila

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.150 

I<00:00:43.300> did<00:00:43.750> share<00:00:43.989> that<00:00:44.140> it's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.979 

curb<00:00:47.699> down<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> bottom<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> water

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
curb down to the bottom to the water

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.029 
curb down to the bottom to the water
can't<00:00:49.320> read

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:04.700 

a<00:00:55.399> little<00:00:56.399> bit<00:00:56.519> out<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> Bears

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740 

so<00:01:05.160> the<00:01:05.250> idea<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.730> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.480> call<00:01:06.720> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so the idea of this is that you call it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.920 
so the idea of this is that you call it
holy<00:01:07.050> hot<00:01:07.890> oil<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.550> then<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.690> put<00:01:09.840> your

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
holy hot oil and then when you put your

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.600 
holy hot oil and then when you put your
wet<00:01:10.110> soap<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.710> water<00:01:10.890> will<00:01:11.070> drain<00:01:11.100> down

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
wet soap on the water will drain down

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.380 
wet soap on the water will drain down
and<00:01:13.280> fall<00:01:14.280> down<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.700> whole<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.940> saltwater

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and fall down the whole you saltwater

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.430 
and fall down the whole you saltwater
wall<00:01:18.690> soggy<00:01:20.960> I'll<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.110> make<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> little

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
wall soggy I'll just make a little

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.840 
wall soggy I'll just make a little
 out<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.729> gonna<00:01:23.910> be<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> little<00:01:24.180> Hollow

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.780 

let's<00:01:29.850> whole<00:01:30.090> thing<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.080> although

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.370 

right<00:01:37.790> through<00:01:38.120> and<00:01:38.270> writing<00:01:38.600> right<00:01:38.990> down<00:01:39.200> to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
right through and writing right down to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:55.080

their Sun so I'll just attach this just
put<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.580> little<00:04:27.700> bit<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:27.940> clay<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.110> edge

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
put a little bit of clay and the edge

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
put a little bit of clay and the edge
just<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.710> keep<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:38.620> turn<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.890> little<00:04:39.070> bit

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
just to keep it just turn a little bit

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
just to keep it just turn a little bit
more<00:04:39.310> on<00:04:40.380> this<00:04:41.380> first<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:43.360> smoother<00:04:43.930> fit<00:04:45.270> what

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
more on this first it smoother fit what

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.720 
more on this first it smoother fit what
I<00:04:46.330> should<00:04:46.540> do

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
I should do

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.670 
I should do
so<00:04:48.730> put<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.000> lot<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.270> slip<00:04:49.510> on<00:04:49.690> here<00:04:49.870> no<00:04:50.350> need<00:04:50.530> to

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
so put a lot of slip on here no need to

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.930 
so put a lot of slip on here no need to
score<00:04:51.010> it<00:04:51.190> or<00:04:51.250> anything<00:04:51.460> because<00:04:51.730> I'm<00:04:51.820> going

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.390 
score it or anything because I'm going
to<00:04:52.030> actually<00:04:52.350> attach<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.830> bit<00:04:53.980> better<00:04:54.160> by

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
to actually attach it a bit better by

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.890 
to actually attach it a bit better by
sort<00:04:54.670> of<00:04:54.730> throwing<00:04:54.970> it<00:04:55.150> all<00:04:55.270> in<00:04:55.390> a<00:04:55.480> minute<00:04:55.720> and

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
sort of throwing it all in a minute and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.400 
sort of throwing it all in a minute and
the<00:04:56.620> quite<00:04:56.830> soft<00:04:57.220> still<00:04:58.020> I'll<00:04:59.020> try<00:04:59.230> and<00:04:59.320> get

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
the quite soft still I'll try and get

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.760 
the quite soft still I'll try and get
that<00:05:01.350> bang<00:05:02.350> on<00:05:02.560> central<00:05:04.440> give<00:05:05.440> it<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.560> quick

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
that bang on central give it a quick

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.869 
that bang on central give it a quick
test

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.349 

there<00:05:14.879> enough<00:05:15.149> anywhere

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:17.359 
there enough anywhere

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:25.339 
there enough anywhere
so<00:05:18.359> we'll<00:05:18.479> just<00:05:18.599> squeeze<00:05:18.929> that<00:05:19.139> on<00:05:24.139> what<00:05:25.139> name

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
so we'll just squeeze that on what name

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:33.589 
so we'll just squeeze that on what name
now<00:05:25.559> is<00:05:25.769> I<00:05:25.979> was<00:05:26.399> trying<00:05:26.699> to<00:05:28.999> throw<00:05:29.999> it<00:05:32.509> give<00:05:33.509> it

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
now is I was trying to throw it give it
