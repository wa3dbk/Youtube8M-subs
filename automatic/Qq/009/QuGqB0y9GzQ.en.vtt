that was made after 2005 I have a game
which<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.400> past<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.799> -<00:01:15.049> but<00:01:16.049> um<00:01:16.820> that<00:01:17.820> game

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
which is a past that - but um that game

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
since I have soft mod it blocks any of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.039 
since I have soft mod it blocks any of
its<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.210> we<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.869> game<00:01:22.170> dashboard<00:01:22.799> updates<00:01:24.049> so
