anyway once you get over here to where

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
anyway once you get over here to where
I'm<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.670> pretty<00:01:17.880> simple<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.299> get<00:01:18.390> all<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
I'm at it's pretty simple to get all the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.600 
I'm at it's pretty simple to get all the
way<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.259> know<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> tree<00:01:20.310> part

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
way you know up here from a tree part

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
way you know up here from a tree part
this<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.330> jump<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.930> tricky<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:22.409> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this little jump can be tricky but I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.649 
this little jump can be tricky but I
think<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> only<00:01:24.210> hard

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
think this is the really the only hard

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
think this is the really the only hard
part<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> find<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.610> really

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
part right here but I find it's really

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.580 
part right here but I find it's really
