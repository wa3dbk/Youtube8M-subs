request to do a tutorial on placement of

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.310 
request to do a tutorial on placement of
pads<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:10.260> where<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.590> place<00:00:11.040> my<00:00:11.340> pads<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.940> why

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
pads so where I place my pads and why

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.620 
pads so where I place my pads and why
it's<00:00:13.320> kind<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.530> like<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> hybrid<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.630> reasoning

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
it's kind of like a hybrid of reasoning

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.380 
it's kind of like a hybrid of reasoning
behind<00:00:16.260> where<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.680> place<00:00:16.980> each<00:00:17.130> pad<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.670> kind<00:00:18.359> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
behind where I place each pad so kind of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.590 
behind where I place each pad so kind of
these<00:00:18.570> bottom<00:00:19.020> eight<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:21.150> bottom<00:00:21.449> eight

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
these bottom eight are the bottom eight

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.259 
these bottom eight are the bottom eight
and<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> top<00:00:22.109> eight<00:00:22.320> are<00:00:22.500> split<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:23.269> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and the top eight are split up the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.140 
and the top eight are split up the
bottom<00:00:24.660> pad<00:00:25.590> number<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
bottom pad number one here on the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.779 
bottom pad number one here on the
machine<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.660> usually<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> kick<00:00:28.500> drum<00:00:28.789> pad

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789

dudes do it mr. invisible he does a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.260 
dudes do it mr. invisible he does a
little<00:00:37.829> bit<00:00:37.950> different<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.640> these<00:00:39.030> two

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
little bit different but just these two

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
little bit different but just these two
it's<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.660> traditionally<00:00:40.170> empty<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.530> how<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it's just traditionally empty see how it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's just traditionally empty see how it
is<00:00:42.170> it's<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.410> closed<00:00:43.710> hi-hat<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
is it's the closed hi-hat this is the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.910 
is it's the closed hi-hat this is the
open<00:00:44.850> hi-hat<00:00:45.030> there<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> choke<00:00:46.559> group

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
open hi-hat there on a choke group

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.819 
open hi-hat there on a choke group
together<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.520> one<00:00:48.110> cancels<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.649> if

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
together so one cancels out the other if

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.479 
together so one cancels out the other if
you<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.039> there

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you get there

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.810 
you get there
cancel<00:00:50.850> cancel<00:00:50.910> cancel<00:00:52.430> these<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.640> kind

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
cancel cancel cancel these are all kind

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.939 
cancel cancel cancel these are all kind
of<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.030> auxilary<00:00:54.510> meaning<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:56.899> secondary

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.740 

secondary<00:01:02.180> instruments<00:01:03.180> or<00:01:03.300> secondary

secondary instruments or secondary

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.899 
secondary instruments or secondary
percussion<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.890> class<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
percussion so this is class so this is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.380 
percussion so this is class so this is
klava<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.100> Belle's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
klava or this is Belle's

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.679 
klava or this is Belle's
epic<00:01:10.049> pal<00:01:10.260> usually<00:01:11.130> over<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.820> kind<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> like

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
epic pal usually over here kind of like

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.570 
epic pal usually over here kind of like
it<00:01:12.840> would<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.200> drum<00:01:13.470> set<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.430> are

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
it would be on a drum set so these are

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.990 
it would be on a drum set so these are
all<00:01:14.640> your<00:01:14.729> drum<00:01:15.000> sounds<00:01:19.850> right

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
all your drum sounds right

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390 
all your drum sounds right
those<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.450> traditional<00:01:21.930> beats<00:01:22.369> hip<00:01:23.369> hop

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
those are like traditional beats hip hop

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.330 
those are like traditional beats hip hop
beats<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.930> across<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.439> top<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.710> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
beats so now going across the top here I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
beats so now going across the top here I
usually<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.090> from<00:01:30.270> left<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> right<00:01:30.840> with

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
usually just go from left to right with

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.370 
usually just go from left to right with
the<00:01:31.229> order<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> samples<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> start<00:01:33.150> with

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
the order of samples so I start with

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
the order of samples so I start with
sample<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:35.880> here

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
sample here and then here and then here

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.990 
sample here and then here and then here
and<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.590> then<00:01:37.799> move<00:01:37.979> over<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and then here and then move over up to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
and then here and then move over up to
the<00:01:39.180> top<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.600> now<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.990> difference<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the top so now the one difference is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
the top so now the one difference is
that<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.650> replace<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.759> two<00:01:42.090> number<00:01:42.360> five<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that I replace these two number five and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.289 
that I replace these two number five and
number<00:01:42.899> 13<00:01:44.090> because<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.960> watch<00:01:46.229> other

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
number 13 because if you watch other

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.319 
number 13 because if you watch other
dudes<00:01:48.680> who<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.070> other<00:01:50.310> other<00:01:50.700> musicians

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
dudes who do this other other musicians

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.530 
dudes who do this other other musicians
who<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.869> MPC<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> machine<00:01:53.280> thing<00:01:53.729> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
who do this MPC or a machine thing this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.139 
who do this MPC or a machine thing this
is<00:01:54.689> usually<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.799> crash<00:01:56.159> cymbal<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.850> don't<00:01:57.090> know

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
is usually the crash cymbal I don't know

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.280 
is usually the crash cymbal I don't know
why<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.719> that's<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.020> kind<00:01:58.259> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
why but that's just kind of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.749 
why but that's just kind of
traditionally<00:01:58.740> trashed<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.670> makes

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
traditionally trashed and what it makes

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.520 
traditionally trashed and what it makes
sense<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> drum<00:02:00.390> set<00:02:00.420> crash<00:02:01.170> double<00:02:01.439> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
sense on the drum set crash double so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.600 
sense on the drum set crash double so
sometimes<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.100> one<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> crash

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
sometimes I have this one as a crash

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.730 
sometimes I have this one as a crash
sometimes<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.840> part<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
sometimes I have this as part of the the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580 
sometimes I have this as part of the the
flow<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.460> eight<00:02:05.640> samples<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:07.320> two

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
flow of the eight samples so these two

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.899 
flow of the eight samples so these two
are<00:02:07.619> switched<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:09.270> if

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
are switched so if

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.390 
are switched so if
if<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.569> were<00:02:11.719> these<00:02:12.439> would<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.739> Ultron's<00:02:13.129> and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
if it were these would be Ultron's and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.250 
if it were these would be Ultron's and
these<00:02:13.489> would<00:02:13.579> be<00:02:13.640> all<00:02:13.760> samples<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:14.450> as<00:02:14.659> it<00:02:15.170> is

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
these would be all samples but as it is

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.929 
these would be all samples but as it is
right<00:02:15.469> now<00:02:16.840> these<00:02:17.840> are<00:02:17.900> all<00:02:18.260> samples<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:19.730> last

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
right now these are all samples the last

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.149 
right now these are all samples the last
sample<00:02:20.209> being<00:02:20.540> here<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.079> then<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.799> crash

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
sample being here and then the crash

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:31.420 
sample being here and then the crash
cymbals<00:02:22.459> up<00:02:22.579> here<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:29.859> so<00:02:30.859> not<00:02:31.010> only<00:02:31.099> do<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.370> have

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
cymbals up here so so not only do I have

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.479 
cymbals up here so so not only do I have
these<00:02:31.700> these<00:02:32.269> two<00:02:32.599> choke<00:02:32.959> groups<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.590> also<00:02:34.219> have

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
these these two choke groups I also have

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.009 
these these two choke groups I also have
each<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:35.030> these<00:02:35.209> chokers

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.659 

these<00:02:39.469> are<00:02:39.680> all<00:02:39.859> choke<00:02:40.189> group<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:40.519> one

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:40.669 
these are all choke group with one

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.929 
these are all choke group with one
another<00:02:41.530> meaning<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.620> they<00:02:42.889> kind<00:02:43.609> of<00:02:43.669> cancel

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
another meaning that they kind of cancel

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.899 
another meaning that they kind of cancel
each<00:02:44.180> other<00:02:44.299> out<00:02:44.419> so<00:02:44.840> when<00:02:45.769> one<00:02:46.010> plays<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
each other out so when one plays and the

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.240 
each other out so when one plays and the
other<00:02:47.030> one<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.329> selected<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.870> means<00:02:48.049> it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
other one is selected it means it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.189 
other one is selected it means it
cancels<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.609> select<00:02:50.060> on<00:02:50.659> the<00:02:50.959> machine

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:51.199 
cancels it if you select on the machine

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.640 
cancels it if you select on the machine
on<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.349> computer<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:53.209> will<00:02:53.389> you<00:02:54.230> select<00:02:54.560> the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
on the computer it will you select the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.020 
on the computer it will you select the
sampling<00:02:55.069> mode<00:02:55.219> it<00:02:55.370> will<00:02:55.459> give<00:02:55.669> you<00:02:55.819> an

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
sampling mode it will give you an

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.420 
sampling mode it will give you an
opportunity<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.739> choke<00:02:57.739> group<00:02:57.980> each<00:02:58.159> one<00:02:58.340> of

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
opportunity to choke group each one of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.890 
opportunity to choke group each one of
these<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:58.969> not<00:02:59.090> only<00:02:59.180> do<00:02:59.329> I<00:02:59.389> choke<00:02:59.599> group<00:02:59.780> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
these so not only do I choke group the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.580 
these so not only do I choke group the
high<00:03:00.019> hats<00:03:00.290> but<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.040> also<00:03:01.219> choke<00:03:01.549> Kirby<00:03:02.590> the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
high hats but I also choke Kirby the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.569 
high hats but I also choke Kirby the
samples<00:03:04.449> in<00:03:05.449> this<00:03:05.629> case<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.049> have<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.650> kind<00:03:07.489> of

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
samples in this case I have this kind of

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.170 
samples in this case I have this kind of
symbol<00:03:07.909> effect<00:03:08.299> as<00:03:08.569> part<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.930> choke<00:03:09.139> group

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
symbol effect as part of the choke group

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.929 
symbol effect as part of the choke group
to<00:03:11.180> use<00:03:11.659> as<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.810> fill<00:03:12.199> a<00:03:12.680> rap<00:03:13.310> music<00:03:13.669> uses<00:03:13.909> a

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
to use as a fill a rap music uses a

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.530 
to use as a fill a rap music uses a
sound<00:03:14.209> that's<00:03:14.299> like<00:03:15.879> as<00:03:16.879> part<00:03:17.030> of<00:03:17.150> his<00:03:17.299> choke

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
sound that's like as part of his choke

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.960 
sound that's like as part of his choke
group<00:03:17.829> something<00:03:18.829> else<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.189> I've<00:03:19.310> only<00:03:19.729> done

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
group something else that I've only done

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.899 
group something else that I've only done
recently<00:03:20.209> is<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.750> have<00:03:21.159> these<00:03:22.159> two<00:03:22.609> on<00:03:22.879> a

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
recently is I have these two on a

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.110 
recently is I have these two on a
master/slave<00:03:24.459> basis<00:03:25.459> meaning<00:03:25.879> that<00:03:25.970> they're

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
master/slave basis meaning that they're

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.789 
master/slave basis meaning that they're
part<00:03:26.359> of<00:03:26.449> the<00:03:26.599> same<00:03:26.870> group<00:03:27.349> that<00:03:27.379> plays

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
part of the same group that plays

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.640 
part of the same group that plays
together<00:03:28.129> so<00:03:28.609> even<00:03:29.090> if<00:03:29.389> so<00:03:30.079> if<00:03:30.139> I<00:03:30.229> hit<00:03:30.349> these<00:03:30.500> at

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
together so even if so if I hit these at

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.499 
together so even if so if I hit these at
the<00:03:30.709> same<00:03:30.919> time<00:03:31.189> that's<00:03:31.879> fine<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:32.239> if<00:03:32.299> I<00:03:32.389> hit

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:32.509 
the same time that's fine but if I hit

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.140 
the same time that's fine but if I hit
this<00:03:32.659> crash<00:03:32.930> cymbal<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.829> bass<00:03:34.069> always<00:03:34.639> goes

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150
