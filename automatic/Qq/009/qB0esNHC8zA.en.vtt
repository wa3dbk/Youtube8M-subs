 type that is located in Mexico and with 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.220
 this becomes the fifth country and 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.780
 world region for its production 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.180
 the new plant will begin production 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.650
 from the first half of 2015 and 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.239
 it is expected that the production capacity 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.949
 maximum is approximately 360 thousand 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.119
 components for vehicles year 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.250
 total investment of the new installation 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:04.400
 is more or less for the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.560
 1400 million yen and the plant will be 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.900
 operated by winston automatic products 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.010
 of Mexico is a business unit of 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.180
 brixton corporation is estimated that mexico 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.850
 present a continuous growth of the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.600
 automobile production due to the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.119
 located your location 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 the increase in domestic demand demands 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.290
 internal we're going to see how it's made up 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.020
 after having seen what this was 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.360
 tax law or the tariff law that is 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.240
 presented a situation last week 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.920
 that maybe he could not meditate or 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.630
 not to be detrimental to the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.930
 growth but maybe it was going to 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.460
 greatly limit the growth of what 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.229
 is the sale of products or the sale of 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.430
 vehicles in our country is a law that 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.840
 somehow already we will talk in 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.330
 another moment I want me to say friends 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.860
 of attraction because this law of some 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.720
 way it is sticking a little to the 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.700
 consumption of the people in this movie that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.259
 is hitting the issue of its liquidity and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.030
 because this somehow will affect 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.890
 also in the possibility of taking of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.409
 new financing for the purchase of 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.759
 vehicles so it's not going to fall but 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.970
 will not grow like us 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.970
 we would like
