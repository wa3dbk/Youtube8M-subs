 from miguel villa with this month we are going to 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.660
 do a different episode we are here 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.639
 in carrying a car we are with the club should 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.889
 w of the equator if it sells month ago it is me 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.410
 that is precisely why we are going to do 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.939
 it's going to give a handling cost and we're going to 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.800
 run certain sleeves then we go to 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.630
 do something half dynamic today 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.710
 then stay with us 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.710
 will happen human 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.750
 Y 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.640
 what we are doing right now is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.649
 putting this reference here as there is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 some who have experience and others 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.600
 that they are not going to put this on so that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.850
 more or less have an idea of how 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.739
 where you cut where you enter and type 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.879
 of things are references so that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.879
 have more ease 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.160
 the quality of cars there 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.300
 wb I'm as a manager in the part of 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.070
 sporting events just as they are 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.680
 rides events track events 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.450
 Finish things with style and let's say 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.260
 I have a bmw of how I find out 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.210
 what do you do 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.680
 the first step would basically be 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:30.660
 go to the facebook page the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:33.520
 official club website www unionradio 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.000
 walks rides on weekends with the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.310
 family short steps porquito and there the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.070
 idea is to foster camaraderie between 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.750
 people who have these cars that is 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.610
