00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone in this video I do 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.020
 see how to prepare the banana brad e 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.929
 we will make it with high chocolate 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.120
 so also very dark beautiful 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.429
 known but also very holy because 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.400
 let's for example use in the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.410
 butter we will put a little oil very little 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.010
 and we never even put it there 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.420
 sugar 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.180
 because this time they chose to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.710
 use the mortar in short it will be a little 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 particular but appointment with him 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.239
 healthy tool and I would also like 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.430
 easy to do first what else 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.630
 break all the bananas 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.770
 use bananas when more 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.040
 we can add the cocoa, ripe and possible 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.860
 so the banal ones can also break 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 better you can also blend it now 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.480
 so let's add the rest 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.489
 of the ingredients the flour the flour of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:01.190
 do this as always in the pro brand 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.190
 middle of Rome soy yogurt 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:16.130
 much remains barley malt are found 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.670
 from the left where yeast name for 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.100
 desserts we also put together 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.780
 we did bits of dark chocolate 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.050
 then the rather large pieces 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.050
 when it is cooked you will feel a little 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.970
 we finish with a pinch of salt 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.270
 now to finish even if already so 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.850
 he would be so very greedy 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.920
 we send to decorate a little with another 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.590
 mana if you have it and we can do it 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.900
 practically interello divided in three the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.850
 let's face this a bit then 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:17.280
 which we can bake at 180 degrees 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.040
 bleak to some in the oven about an hour 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.850
 the last ten minutes or enough 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.920
 oven at 140 degrees and I put the ventilated 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.110
 do this before eating it do it 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.480
 cool in the fridge at least one night 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.430
 you will see that then the next day is 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.170
 really good maybe remove it from the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.480
 paper form because otherwise after when 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.300
 when it cools it could remain a 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.190
 bit stuck and I hope so much that 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.200
 from the 18 visas liked maybe if you go 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.940
 arrived you can also send us the photo 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.310

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.460
 facebook page a kiss to the next
