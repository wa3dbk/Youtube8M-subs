00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.180 
thinner stuff the terpenoid it's very
strong<00:03:41.240> even<00:03:41.990> with<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.260> mask<00:03:42.500> I'm<00:03:42.740> still<00:03:42.980> kind

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
strong even with the mask I'm still kind

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.530 
strong even with the mask I'm still kind
of<00:03:43.250> tasting<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.120> back<00:03:44.270> of<00:03:44.420> my<00:03:44.510> throat

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
of tasting it in the back of my throat

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.750 
of tasting it in the back of my throat
so<00:03:45.020> maybe<00:03:45.320> I'll<00:03:45.470> try<00:03:45.709> this<00:03:45.770> on<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.190> red<00:03:46.340> dragon

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
so maybe I'll try this on the red dragon

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.400 
so maybe I'll try this on the red dragon
and<00:03:46.850> see<00:03:47.030> how<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.270> looks<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:47.959> know<00:03:48.080> some

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
and see how it looks so I know some

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.199 
and see how it looks so I know some
people<00:03:48.530> do<00:03:48.800> crazy<00:03:48.980> things<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.610> wear<00:03:49.880> gloves

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
people do crazy things like wear gloves

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.560 
people do crazy things like wear gloves
or<00:03:50.740> let<00:03:51.740> things<00:03:52.040> dry<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:52.730> between<00:03:53.150> going<00:03:53.420> to

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
or let things dry in between going to

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.690 
or let things dry in between going to
the<00:03:53.750> next<00:03:53.900> steps<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.590> don't<00:03:54.890> really<00:03:55.010> do<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.520> I

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
the next steps I don't really do that I

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.910 
the next steps I don't really do that I
put<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.570> clear<00:03:56.900> coat<00:03:57.110> on<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.440> immediately

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
put the clear coat on and immediately

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.470 
put the clear coat on and immediately
started<00:03:58.280> doing<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.580> black<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.090> immediately

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
started doing the black and immediately

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.120 
started doing the black and immediately
started<00:03:59.810> wiping<00:04:00.080> it<00:04:00.170> off<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.290> then<00:04:00.620> rinsed<00:04:01.040> it

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
started wiping it off and then rinsed it

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.590 
started wiping it off and then rinsed it
off<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.459> sink<00:04:01.640> all<00:04:01.940> in<00:04:02.090> under<00:04:02.240> an<00:04:02.450> hour

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
off in the sink all in under an hour

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.390 
off in the sink all in under an hour
well<00:04:03.140> under<00:04:03.410> an<00:04:03.470> hour<00:04:03.560> actually<00:04:03.800> I<00:04:04.040> think<00:04:04.280> I

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
well under an hour actually I think I

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.920 
well under an hour actually I think I
did<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.580> whole<00:04:04.730> thing<00:04:04.760> in<00:04:04.940> about<00:04:05.209> 25-30

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
did the whole thing in about 25-30

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.259 
did the whole thing in about 25-30
minutes<00:04:06.050> and<00:04:06.740> it<00:04:06.890> kind<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.190> shows<00:04:07.430> but<00:04:07.880> at<00:04:08.120> the

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
minutes and it kind of shows but at the

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.000 
minutes and it kind of shows but at the
same<00:04:08.450> time<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.989> looks<00:04:09.170> pretty<00:04:09.410> good<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:09.890> what

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
same time it looks pretty good for what

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.490 
same time it looks pretty good for what
it<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.160> I'm<00:04:10.670> not<00:04:10.730> making<00:04:11.209> any<00:04:11.450> claims<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:12.290> I'm

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
it is I'm not making any claims that I'm

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.930 
it is I'm not making any claims that I'm
good<00:04:12.739> at<00:04:12.769> this<00:04:13.040> or<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.370> I<00:04:13.519> really<00:04:13.790> know<00:04:13.910> what

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
good at this or that I really know what

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.770 
good at this or that I really know what
I'm<00:04:14.090> doing<00:04:14.600> at<00:04:15.500> all<00:04:15.709> really<00:04:16.340> but<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:17.120> think<00:04:17.480> it

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
I'm doing at all really but I think it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.449 
I'm doing at all really but I think it
works<00:04:17.989> for<00:04:18.260> what<00:04:18.500> I've<00:04:18.590> done<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.980> think<00:04:19.160> you

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
works for what I've done I think you

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.400 
works for what I've done I think you
guys<00:04:19.609> can<00:04:19.850> do<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.090> too<00:04:20.209> it's<00:04:20.450> very<00:04:20.570> easy<00:04:21.049> does

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
guys can do it too it's very easy does

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.780 
guys can do it too it's very easy does
it<00:04:21.440> take<00:04:21.680> a<00:04:21.709> lot<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:21.919> time<00:04:22.160> there's<00:04:22.430> not<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.610> lot

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
it take a lot of time there's not a lot

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.610 
it take a lot of time there's not a lot
of<00:04:22.820> materials<00:04:23.300> involved<00:04:23.570> it's<00:04:23.960> all<00:04:24.200> stuff<00:04:24.530> I

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
of materials involved it's all stuff I

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.320 
of materials involved it's all stuff I
got<00:04:24.800> at<00:04:24.890> Joanne's<00:04:25.280> which<00:04:25.669> is<00:04:25.850> pretty<00:04:26.120> much<00:04:26.210> the

same as Michaels any hobby store
probably<00:04:28.790> even<00:04:29.060> Walmart<00:04:29.270> might<00:04:29.690> have<00:04:29.840> some<00:04:29.990> of

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
probably even Walmart might have some of

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.780 
probably even Walmart might have some of
this<00:04:30.169> stuff<00:04:30.410> just<00:04:30.620> oil<00:04:31.130> paint<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.550> paint

thinner terpenoid that's all it is you

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.469 
thinner terpenoid that's all it is you
could<00:04:33.740> probably<00:04:34.280> work<00:04:34.490> with<00:04:34.550> other<00:04:35.000> stuff<00:04:35.360> you

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:07.900 
goes into the cracks here's the reason
why<00:05:07.010> you<00:05:07.130> might<00:05:07.280> want<00:05:07.340> to<00:05:07.550> wear<00:05:07.669> gloves

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
why you might want to wear gloves

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.030 
why you might want to wear gloves
because<00:05:08.150> if<00:05:08.479> you<00:05:08.570> have<00:05:08.720> paint<00:05:09.050> on<00:05:09.229> your<00:05:09.380> finger

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
because if you have paint on your finger

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.590 
because if you have paint on your finger
and<00:05:10.070> you<00:05:10.310> touch<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.820> on<00:05:11.000> its<00:05:11.150> wet

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
and you touch that on its wet

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.540 
and you touch that on its wet
you<00:05:11.810> got<00:05:11.930> a<00:05:11.960> fingerprint<00:05:12.410> I<00:05:12.620> was<00:05:13.039> not<00:05:13.220> careful

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
you got a fingerprint I was not careful

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.760 
you got a fingerprint I was not careful
I<00:05:13.880> did<00:05:14.120> not<00:05:14.270> take<00:05:14.450> my<00:05:14.599> time<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:15.050> want<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:15.590> just
