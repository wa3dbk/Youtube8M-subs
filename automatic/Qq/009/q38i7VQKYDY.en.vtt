good<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.870> quite<00:00:46.110> agile<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.010> other<00:00:47.129> thing

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
good is that quite agile the other thing

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.860 
good is that quite agile the other thing
is<00:00:47.340> lacking<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> speed<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.750> other

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
is lacking is a bit of speed but other

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.850 
is lacking is a bit of speed but other
than<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.680> good

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
than that it's a really good

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
than that it's a really good
shot-stopper<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> best<00:00:51.180> ones<00:00:51.660> i

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
shot-stopper and one of the best ones i

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.630 
shot-stopper and one of the best ones i
can<00:00:52.020> find<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.500> cheap<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> first

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
can find that is cheap when you first

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.029 
can find that is cheap when you first
start<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> league<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> we're<00:00:55.949> gonna

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
start in the league and so we're gonna

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.799

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
the free kicks on them were brilliant

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.900 
the free kicks on them were brilliant
you<00:03:10.560> got<00:03:10.709> one<00:03:10.830> little<00:03:10.980> curl<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> ball<00:03:11.550> but

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
you got one little curl the ball but

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.250 
you got one little curl the ball but
you've<00:03:12.030> also<00:03:12.150> got<00:03:12.450> them<00:03:12.600> one<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.959> can<00:03:13.080> drive

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260

the<00:03:13.440> ball<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.620> long<00:03:13.860> pod<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.370> could<00:03:14.730> hit<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.970> from

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the ball a long pod it could hit it from

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.880 
the ball a long pod it could hit it from
miles<00:03:15.269> out<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.690> that's<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.440> reason<00:03:16.500> I've<00:03:16.769> got

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
miles out so that's the reason I've got

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.229 
miles out so that's the reason I've got
those<00:03:17.069> two<00:03:17.280> they<00:03:17.549> worked<00:03:17.760> really<00:03:17.790> well<00:03:18.000> and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
those two they worked really well and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.240 
those two they worked really well and
the<00:03:18.329> passing<00:03:18.720> together<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.769> can't<00:03:20.040> beat<00:03:20.220> that

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
the passing together you can't beat that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.770 
the passing together you can't beat that
in<00:03:20.579> my<00:03:20.790> opinion<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.299> want<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> knock<00:03:21.630> through

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
in my opinion I want to knock through

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.330 
in my opinion I want to knock through
