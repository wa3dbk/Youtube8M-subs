00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
problem is that the motion recognition

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.770 
problem is that the motion recognition
is<00:02:12.319> inconsistent<00:02:13.319> at<00:02:13.470> best<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:14.190> also<00:02:14.630> it's<00:02:15.630> a

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
is inconsistent at best but also it's a

is inconsistent at best but also it's a
handheld<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.500> mean<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.769> would<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:16.980> silly<00:02:17.370> on

handheld I mean this would be silly on
home<00:02:17.819> consoles<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:18.599> on<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> handheld<00:02:19.170> it's

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
just pointless and sadly things don't

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.309 
just pointless and sadly things don't
improve<00:02:23.220> much<00:02:23.700> after<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.269> cast<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.750> line<00:02:24.959> and

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
improve much after you cast the line and

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.229 
improve much after you cast the line and
the<00:02:25.410> fish<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.769> this<00:02:25.860> game<00:02:26.130> are<00:02:26.340> incredibly
