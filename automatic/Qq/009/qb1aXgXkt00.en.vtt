thinking Meganium might get sleep powder
but<00:02:29.660> now<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.780> was<00:02:29.930> like<00:02:30.020> nah<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> decided<00:02:31.670> to

do go for another dragon dance and he is

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160 
do go for another dragon dance and he is
gonna<00:02:37.280> go<00:02:37.430> for<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.670> Giga<00:02:37.820> Drain<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.959> Giga

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
gonna go for the Giga Drain the Giga

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.630 
gonna go for the Giga Drain the Giga
Drain<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.560> not<00:02:39.740> gonna<00:02:39.860> do<00:02:40.040> much<00:02:40.220> because<00:02:40.430> of

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
Drain is not gonna do much because of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.390 
Drain is not gonna do much because of
the<00:02:40.700> 1.5<00:02:41.560> defense<00:02:42.560> boost<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:43.040> mean<00:02:43.190> special

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
the 1.5 defense boost I mean special

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400 
the 1.5 defense boost I mean special
defense<00:02:43.700> boots<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.120> get<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> sand<00:02:44.840> so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
defense boots that I get in the sand so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.990 
defense boots that I get in the sand so
it<00:02:45.470> doesn't<00:02:45.680> even<00:02:45.740> do<00:02:45.920> half<00:02:46.130> which<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.430> perfect

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
it doesn't even do half which is perfect

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.190 
it doesn't even do half which is perfect
because<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.420> means<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.660> can<00:02:47.780> get<00:02:47.900> up<00:02:47.990> another

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
because that means I can get up another

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.130 
because that means I can get up another
dragon<00:02:48.560> dance<00:02:48.680> if<00:02:48.860> need<00:02:49.280> be<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:50.420> am<00:02:50.510> at<00:02:50.720> +2

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
dragon dance if need be but I am at +2

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.190 
dragon dance if need be but I am at +2
so<00:02:51.980> I'm<00:02:52.190> pretty<00:02:52.370> sure<00:02:52.490> that<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.940> HP<00:02:53.480> bug<00:02:53.870> will

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
so I'm pretty sure that the HP bug will

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.380 
so I'm pretty sure that the HP bug will
be<00:02:54.320> able<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.620> take<00:02:54.800> out<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.070> Meganium<00:02:55.610> now

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
be able to take out the Meganium now

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.970 
be able to take out the Meganium now
here<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:57.050> where<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.230> am<00:02:57.470> sadly<00:02:57.709> mistaken

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
here is where I am sadly mistaken

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.810 
here is where I am sadly mistaken
because<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.640> HP<00:02:58.970> bug<00:02:59.209> does<00:02:59.989> not<00:03:00.260> take<00:03:00.950> out<00:03:01.160> the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
because the HP bug does not take out the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.270 
because the HP bug does not take out the
Meganium<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.870> am<00:03:02.989> way<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.530> front<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.160> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.890 
Meganium and I am way in front of the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
narration because of the freaking

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.380 
narration because of the freaking
