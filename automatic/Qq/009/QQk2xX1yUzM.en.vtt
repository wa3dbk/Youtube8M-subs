city<00:00:23.420> actually<00:00:24.420> now<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.170> think<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
city actually now that I think about it

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.500 
city actually now that I think about it
a<00:00:26.039> lot<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.119> aircraft<00:00:27.689> showed<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.260> vice<00:00:28.439> city

a lot of aircraft showed up in vice city
anyway<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.810> continued<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.560> used

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
anyway it continued to be used

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.680 
anyway it continued to be used
throughout<00:00:32.430> all<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> games<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.480> way<00:00:33.570> up

talking about the performance of
aircraft<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.590> bit

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
aircraft is going to be a little bit

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.970 
aircraft is going to be a little bit
different<00:00:41.510> when<00:00:42.510> talking<00:00:42.780> about<00:00:42.989> aircraft<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
different when talking about aircraft I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.060 
different when talking about aircraft I
will<00:00:44.129> now<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.460> refer<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.940> acceleration<00:00:45.510> as

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
will now have refer to acceleration as

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
will now have refer to acceleration as
takeoff<00:00:47.070> time<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.300> amount<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> time<00:00:48.960> it

takeoff time or the amount of time it
takes<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.620> your<00:00:49.800> aircraft<00:00:50.430> airborne

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
takes to get your aircraft airborne

takes to get your aircraft airborne
speed<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> handling<00:00:53.370> however<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:54.360> remain

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
speed and handling however will remain

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.770 
speed and handling however will remain
the<00:00:55.289> same<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> maverick<00:00:57.030> has<00:00:57.059> relatively

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the same now the maverick has relatively

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.290 
the same now the maverick has relatively
slow<00:00:58.199> take<00:00:58.530> off<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> helicopter<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
slow take off because the helicopter and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
slow take off because the helicopter and
you<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> wait<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> few<00:01:01.500> seconds<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you have to wait a few seconds for the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
you have to wait a few seconds for the
engine<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> reach<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.180> proper<00:01:03.539> speed<00:01:03.870> before

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
engine to reach a proper speed before

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.190 
engine to reach a proper speed before
you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.769> become<00:01:04.920> airborne<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.990> if<00:01:06.990> people

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you can become airborne and if people

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.320 
you can become airborne and if people
are<00:01:07.439> shooting<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.729> could<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
are shooting at you you could have a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.260 
are shooting at you you could have a
problem<00:01:09.990> however<00:01:10.799> once<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:11.760> airborne

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
problem however once you get an airborne

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
problem however once you get an airborne
you're<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> find<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> Maverick

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you're going to find that the Maverick

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
you're going to find that the Maverick
is<00:01:13.770> relatively<00:01:14.369> fast<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.240> handles<00:01:16.049> very

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
is relatively fast and handles very

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.870 
is relatively fast and handles very
nicely<00:01:16.939> now<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.210> far<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.540> appearances<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:19.290> I

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
nicely now as far as appearances go I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.730 
nicely now as far as appearances go I
have<00:01:20.880> no<00:01:21.060> idea<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.720> based<00:01:21.900> off<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
have no idea what it's based off of I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.170 
have no idea what it's based off of I
really<00:01:23.310> don't<00:01:23.460> know<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> first<00:01:23.850> thing<00:01:24.030> about

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
really don't know the first thing about

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.289 
really don't know the first thing about
helicopter<00:01:25.110> manufacturers<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> me<00:01:26.909> this

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
helicopter manufacturers so to me this

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.440 
helicopter manufacturers so to me this
just<00:01:27.600> looks<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> very<00:01:28.259> generic<00:01:28.560> design

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
just looks like a very generic design

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.910 
just looks like a very generic design
however<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> design<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.229> has<00:01:31.530> gone

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
however it's a design that has gone

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
however it's a design that has gone
relatively<00:01:32.670> unchanged<00:01:33.659> throughout<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
relatively unchanged throughout the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.850 
relatively unchanged throughout the
game's<00:01:34.350> history<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> anyway<00:01:37.020> that's<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
game's history so anyway that's a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
game's history so anyway that's a
maverick<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.729> long<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.060> helicopters<00:01:39.720> go<00:01:39.960> it's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
maverick as long as helicopters go it's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310 
maverick as long as helicopters go it's
pretty<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.790> fact<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.210> daresay<00:01:42.750> it's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
pretty good in fact I daresay it's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.899 
pretty good in fact I daresay it's
probably<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> all-round<00:01:44.399> best<00:01:44.670> helicopter

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
probably the all-round best helicopter

00:01:44.909 --> 00:02:05.790 
probably the all-round best helicopter
in<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.229> GT<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:55.040> very<00:01:56.040> good<00:01:56.310> okay<00:01:57.119> okay

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:53.309 

bloom<00:02:06.160> their<00:02:06.370> best<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:08.130> go<00:02:09.130> it's<00:02:09.490> good

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:09.120 

hey<00:02:53.920> funny

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.660
