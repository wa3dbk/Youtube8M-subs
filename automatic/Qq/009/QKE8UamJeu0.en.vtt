00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.570 
and complexity was really a great coup
for<00:01:11.670> British<00:01:12.600> national<00:01:13.020> collections<00:01:13.590> what's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
very very interesting about this drawing

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.570 
very very interesting about this drawing
it's<00:01:17.520> how<00:01:17.700> technically<00:01:18.330> complex<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.580> it's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it's how technically complex it is it's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300 
it's how technically complex it is it's
executed<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> whole<00:01:21.900> range<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.130> different

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310

think<00:01:30.030> what<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.670> bharatas<00:01:32.670> first

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
think what we see here is bharatas first

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
think what we see here is bharatas first
compositional<00:01:34.350> idea<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.729> after<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
compositional idea and then after the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.819 
compositional idea and then after the
Pope<00:01:36.630> had<00:01:36.840> said<00:01:37.020> he<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.380> wanted<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
Pope had said he really wanted to

that flaming brand at the very left edge

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.499 
that flaming brand at the very left edge
so<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.289> we<00:02:07.439> see<00:02:07.770> through<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.970> kind<00:02:09.270> of

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
so that we see through a kind of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.080 
so that we see through a kind of
darkened<00:02:11.300> framework<00:02:12.830> into<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:13.980> moment<00:02:14.940> of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
darkened framework into this moment of

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.290 
darkened framework into this moment of
wonderful<00:02:15.569> illumination<00:02:16.440> where<00:02:17.430> light<00:02:17.970> seems

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
wonderful illumination where light seems

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.960 
wonderful illumination where light seems
to<00:02:18.450> emanate<00:02:18.660> from<00:02:19.319> Christ<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:20.190> think<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:20.910> is

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
to emanate from Christ I think this is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.690 
to emanate from Christ I think this is
also<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.780> very<00:02:22.470> great<00:02:22.800> feature<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> drawing

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
also a very great feature of the drawing

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.630 
also a very great feature of the drawing
that<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.150> see<00:02:24.420> right<00:02:24.930> back<00:02:25.530> into<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.980> very<00:02:26.310> far

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
that we see right back into the very far

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.180 
that we see right back into the very far
distance<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.480> even<00:02:28.319> there<00:02:28.530> there's<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.890> kind

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
distance and even there there's a kind

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.550 
distance and even there there's a kind
of<00:02:29.400> TR<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.060> school<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> moment<00:02:30.989> where<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
of TR of school a moment where the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.460 
of TR of school a moment where the
