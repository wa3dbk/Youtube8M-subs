00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.110
 hello you love and welcome too 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.120
 our second part of hand puppets 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.160
 make yourself easy with lara and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.030
 martin mc donald often steering 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.760
 today it's about mending and 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.150
 rework the doll heads we have 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.080
 The doll heads dried on the stove 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.670
 which was a mistake 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.559
 because they are too fast 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.610
 dried and they have deep cracks 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.040
 as you can see here, it is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.780
 advisable the doll heads at normal 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.390
 room temperature to dry 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.290
 It takes us two days to do that 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.610
 took a while to mend and 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.590
 reworking the doll heads something too 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.440
 long time we turn off the video here 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.119
 on time lapse to mend we have 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.150
 something taken from the modeling clay 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.790
 and soaked in some water by it 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.600
 It gets soft and you can do it well in the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.820
 tears 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.160
 It is important that the cracks 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.710
 completely filled out otherwise 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.290
 The doll's heads can do exactly this 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.720
 make break later 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.330
 it works best with the fingers and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.880
 a little screwdriver with one 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.940
 You can brush the edges well later 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.270
 Smooth so that you can tear later 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.789
 no longer sees then comes yet 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.520
 to fine-tune something again 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.470
 nose the filling of dents that 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.130
 rework the contours and such 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.350
 further we also noticed when 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.569
 to mend and rework 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.119
 the surface of the head with something 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:04.580
 longer soaked modeling clay and 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.590
 some water gets rubbed in after that 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.590
 Dry the surface beautifully and smoothly 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.770
 you can paint them better 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.970
 if necessary, can mend and 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.910
 rework done several times 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.370
 sometimes you can see a mistake 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.590
 only the next day or like it 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.220
 a little not to like what you 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.500
 It is desirable to change before painting 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.290
 it is advisable to take one or two more heads 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.510
 to dry for a few days 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.970
 because the color otherwise evaluate the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.709
 Modeling compound prevents and the color 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.430
 also on the wet modeling clay 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.700
 we are not holding up properly 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.700
 beautiful 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.769

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.959
