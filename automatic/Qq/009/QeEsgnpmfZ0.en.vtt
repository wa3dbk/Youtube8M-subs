00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.820
 I'm going until the end of 2010 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.479
 after the race day 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.840

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.840
 everybody when we start making some names on patient starts 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.000

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.250
 and he works his body 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.890
 in general 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.550
 paying more attention to the arms at the upper part of the back of 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.610
 trapeze henrique 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.020
 arm strength elasticity stretching 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.710
 the line 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.690
 it's very similar to trapeze 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.480
 in theory this is a milestone 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.060
 Do you also work on balance? 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.549
