00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hi, this recipe is a cheap and delicious 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.410
 yields a lot but unfortunately many 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.420
 people make mistakes every day, I usually 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.820
 I'll do it on the nosephone but I'll try 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.049
 for you on average what goes the recipe 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.049
 Today is the tempura 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.810
 and that all ingredients conforming to 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.480
 description of the video in a pan on fire 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.390
 Medium heat oil for frying tempurÃ¡s 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.539
 in a bowl put a cup of 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.509
 chopped peppers a cup 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.790
 of cabbage cut into strips one full of 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.100
 potatoes cut into sticks a cup of 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.260
 pods cut in half a cup of 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.449
 carrot cut into sticks and a cup 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.760
 onion cut into medium slices 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.839
 add a teaspoon of salt and a 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.839
 cup of ice cold water 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.820
 mix everything with your hands and add 2 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.890
 cups of wheat flour and one 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.140
 teaspoon of baking soda 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.330
 mix thoroughly until ingredients are 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.759
 wrapped in a thick dough that gives 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.009
 to make piles if you need 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.409
 add more water, flour is 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.180
 important that the oil is very hot and 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.860
 to see if he is hot he plays a 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.329
 matches and when he 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.970
 will enter the point 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.930
 the advice of a catcher on your side of 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.090
 spaghetti 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.560
 add batches in the oil and 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.370
 fry until both sides are well 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.340
 this is to choose a little bit of the 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.850
 oil and put on paper towel is 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.850
 ready 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.340
 the city hall is very crunchy the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.780
 advice you use a well chilled and ribbon 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.340
 he does not oil very hot 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.780
 Another tip I can give is that you 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.030
 cuts more or less the ingredients 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.189
 same size and avoid cutting too much 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.569
 because you can run the risk of 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.340
 they get cross when the dough already 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.319
 ready about half 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.939
 centimeter is already great and then you 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:57.950
 can cut a little thicker 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.500
 because he is already softer and ends up 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.270
 getting older I usually use these 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.460
 ingredients I've spent here a video 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.110
 but you can put cabbage zucchini 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.880
 broccoli flower 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.140
 there are people even put eggplant and I think 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.060
 that looks good too 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.400
 When I have a scale, I used a cup. 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.620
 240 ml measuring the place and 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.360
 ingredients side by side will row 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.670
 dinho and do no notion of how much more 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.349
 or less it is important that the mass 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.569
 stay more or less like the video does not 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.150
 a lot of sauce not too hard because at the time 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.400
 that you fry with the risk of the thunderstorm 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.480
 April being that format together 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.720
 Scone 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.640
 check out this and other sects on the blog 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.049
