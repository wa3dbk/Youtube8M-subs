00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
rollers can stick easier and now I'm

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.000 
rollers can stick easier and now I'm
going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.960> detangle<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.430> hair<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.890> now<00:01:04.890> I'm

going to detangle the hair and now I'm
just<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> put<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.540> roller<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.530> hair

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
just going to put the roller in the hair

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.010 
just going to put the roller in the hair
and<00:01:08.400> I'm<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.549> showing<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.000> how<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.330> rolled<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and I'm just showing you how I rolled it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.190 
and I'm just showing you how I rolled it
up<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:11.189> did<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.970> words<00:01:12.299> instead<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.720> outwards

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
up I did it in words instead of outwards

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
up I did it in words instead of outwards
because<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.680> looks<00:01:13.860> better<00:01:14.040> when<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> go

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
because it looks better when you go

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.530 
because it looks better when you go
inwards<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.189> believe<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.970> sure<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
inwards I believe but I'm not sure I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.060 
inwards I believe but I'm not sure I
mean<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.020> inwards<00:01:19.439> outwards<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
mean you can do inwards outwards but I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.609 
mean you can do inwards outwards but I
did<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> inwards<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.780> ended<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.140> making

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
did it inwards and I ended up making

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
did it inwards and I ended up making
that<00:01:22.860> section<00:01:23.220> smaller<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that section smaller because that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.020 
that section smaller because that
section<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.600> too<00:01:24.900> big<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
section was too big and this is just a

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.590 
section was too big and this is just a
closer<00:01:27.479> view<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> rolled<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.670> hair<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
closer view on how I rolled the hair and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560 
closer view on how I rolled the hair and
I<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.229> put<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> bobby<00:01:31.560> pin<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.340> secure<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.130 
I just put a bobby pin to secure the
roller<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.329> hair<00:01:36.780> looked

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
roller and this is what the hair looked

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.840 
roller and this is what the hair looked
like<00:01:37.229> once<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.799> finished<00:01:38.159> putting<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.610> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the sink with two towels so that the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.249 
the sink with two towels so that the
steam<00:02:04.110> could<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:05.299> marinate<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.659> hair<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.369 
steam could like marinate the hair it
just<00:02:07.320> makes<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.770> set<00:02:08.039> better<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:10.289> I'm

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
just makes it set better that way so I'm

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.290
