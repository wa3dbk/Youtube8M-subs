00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.769
 Gentlemen today is the day of the planet earth 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.299
 as you can see we are picking up trash this 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.580
 is to motivate them because I'm with the 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.500
 brigade of creative art and what is 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.780
 It is what we do something in favor of 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.460
 the ecology we are going to pick up quite 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.470
 trash that is around here and donate some 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.470
 how many saplings follow this example 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.119
 as creative art we are joining 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.460
 just to raise awareness from the 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.010
 children and that they go away in family justly 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.570
 to reforest to collect garbage and 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.670
 look for specific places that are 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.510
 as neglected damaged 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.699
 they must foster in them the culture of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.550
 take care of the planet so we put more 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.110
 life to this place and we say good 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.360
 excellent we are going to carry these little trees 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.269
 to the area where the neighbors suggest us 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.519
 so that if they give themselves and they who live 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.190
 here they will commit to water the 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:06.580
 true if the idea is that we take care 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.610
 protect keep the place and see 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.550
 so more beautiful and so we will produce 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.759
 more oxygen and we are entering the area 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.460
 where are we going to place the trees and I 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.180
 I want children to learn from 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.280
 little ones 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.230
 to have this is the spirit of caring for 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.690
 planet not because this is where we live 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.870
 and not to let it deteriorate the 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.729
 exact planet's day that's the 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.770
 message do what you can 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.720
 do what is in your hands and this goes 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.729
 to improve little by little there is quite 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.110
 trash usually tell me we give them 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.110
 but it's awesome 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.460
 we found everything a little silver 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.790
 lighters that there are up to diapers 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.450
 down there I can not believe we're going to 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.450
 pick them up 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.620
 because we realized that I was 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.300
 too sloppy pretty dry with 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.980
 a lot of garbage and then many 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.930
 neighbors told us that we can come 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.209
 here and then we join a brigade 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.340
 to come and pick up trash up here 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.540
 there is garbage in the middle of a tree that 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.909
 lack of respect 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.829
 There's a lot of junk ready 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.710
 plastic yes but when we found 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.570
 liquor bottles and yes 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.030
 Well the intention is that you 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.660
 contagien of this feeling in favor of 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.970
 planet glasses 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.970
 with care let's go 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.100
 because let's say 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.470
 This is what you also know 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.000
 contagien of this ecological feeling 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.310
 and then have a happy day of the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 earth so every month they come to 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.160
 collect garbage to collect with 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.770
 How are these guys? 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.209
 entrepreneurs who set the example I 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.600
 dismissal I'm tabata Jalil and together 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.600
 we make 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.890
 ah 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.890
