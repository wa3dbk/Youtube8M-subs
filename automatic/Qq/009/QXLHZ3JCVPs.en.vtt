really<00:00:10.070> a<00:00:11.470> good<00:00:12.470> idea<00:00:12.620> to<00:00:12.920> make

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
really a good idea to make

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.349 
really a good idea to make
this<00:00:15.110> is<00:00:15.349> the<00:00:15.469> thermostat<00:00:15.860> housing<00:00:16.359> water

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
this is the thermostat housing water

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.420 
this is the thermostat housing water
won't<00:00:17.720> do<00:00:18.050> it<00:00:18.230> anywhere<00:00:18.619> out<00:00:19.369> of<00:00:19.430> plastic<00:00:20.090> that

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
won't do it anywhere out of plastic that

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.020 
won't do it anywhere out of plastic that
really<00:00:22.430> a<00:00:22.460> good<00:00:22.609> idea

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.720 

and<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.510> imagine<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.110> it's<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.290> to<00:00:28.470> cost

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
and you imagine what it's going to cost

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.080 
and you imagine what it's going to cost
Knesset<00:00:29.730> breaks<00:00:31.310> one<00:00:32.310> thing<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:33.030> is

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
Knesset breaks one thing I do like is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.870 
Knesset breaks one thing I do like is
I'm<00:00:34.050> assuming<00:00:34.650> that<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.700> water

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
I'm assuming that this is the water

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.850 
I'm assuming that this is the water
filter<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:37.940> love<00:00:38.940> stuff<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.630> I<00:00:39.840> wish<00:00:40.739> I

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
filter I love stuff like that I wish I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.910 
filter I love stuff like that I wish I
could<00:00:41.010> put<00:00:41.130> one<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> those<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.580> my<00:00:41.640> Tahoe<00:00:42.920> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
could put one of those on my Tahoe and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760 
could put one of those on my Tahoe and
I'm<00:00:44.520> guessing<00:00:44.970> that<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.530> right<00:00:46.530> there's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
I'm guessing that this is right there's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
I'm guessing that this is right there's
the<00:00:46.949> fuel<00:00:47.190> filter<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.790> mean<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.000> few<00:00:48.300> fresh

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the fuel filter I mean a few fresh

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.160 
the fuel filter I mean a few fresh
straight<00:00:49.230> leg

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.450 

and<00:00:55.540> this<00:00:56.540> right<00:00:56.870> here<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:57.380> can't<00:00:58.160> see<00:00:58.309> the

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
and this right here I can't see the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.060 
and this right here I can't see the
other<00:00:58.489> line<00:00:59.020> but<00:01:00.020> it's<00:01:00.170> going<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.649> intake

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
other line but it's going to the intake

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.750 
other line but it's going to the intake
and<00:01:01.399> it's<00:01:02.390> Phyllis<00:01:03.020> Illinois<00:01:03.470> I'm<00:01:04.220> assuming

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
and it's Phyllis Illinois I'm assuming

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.000 
and it's Phyllis Illinois I'm assuming
that<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:04.970> is<00:01:05.210> probably<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:06.760> purge<00:01:07.760> solenoid

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
that this is probably the purge solenoid

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.100 
that this is probably the purge solenoid
there<00:01:10.010> just<00:01:10.250> look<00:01:10.369> at<00:01:10.550> someone<00:01:10.759> I<00:01:11.210> could<00:01:11.990> be

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
there just look at someone I could be

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.660 
there just look at someone I could be
wrong

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
wrong

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.920 
wrong
but<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:14.210> think<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:14.540> do<00:01:16.600> I'm<00:01:17.600> letting<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
but I think you do I'm letting the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.420 
but I think you do I'm letting the
engine<00:01:18.110> run<00:01:18.440> because<00:01:18.650> I<00:01:18.830> want<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.070> see<00:01:19.280> his

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
engine run because I want to see his

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.540 
engine run because I want to see his
both<00:01:19.640> fans<00:01:19.940> when<00:01:20.240> come<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.630> or<00:01:21.620> this<00:01:21.860> one

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
both fans when come on or this one

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.460 
both fans when come on or this one
I<00:01:23.590> got<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.740> idling<00:01:25.570> this<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.750> not<00:01:26.960> really<00:01:27.440> a

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
I got it idling this is not really a

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.150 
I got it idling this is not really a
smooth<00:01:27.890> engine<00:01:30.100> kind<00:01:31.100> of<00:01:31.220> shakes

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.420 

also<00:01:35.820> notice<00:01:36.120> it's<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.630> valve<00:01:36.930> here

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
also notice it's got a little valve here

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.930 
also notice it's got a little valve here
well<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> guess<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:40.430> intake<00:01:41.430> package

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
well the I guess is the intake package

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.110 
well the I guess is the intake package
passage

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.399 

didn't<00:01:49.780> seem<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.020> make<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.200> difference

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:06.959 

now<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> got<00:01:56.250> grease<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.670> finger

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:14.750 

I<00:02:07.470> guess<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.619> makes<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.890> different<00:02:09.280> hierarchy

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:24.490 

neither<00:02:15.390> families<00:02:15.810> kick<00:02:15.989> on<00:02:16.200> yet

air filter box on here they're going to
eliminate<00:03:33.320> these<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.790> guarantee<00:03:35.150> they're

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
eliminate these and I guarantee they're

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.470 
eliminate these and I guarantee they're
there<00:03:35.690> for<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> purpose

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.660 

factories<00:03:39.290> are<00:03:39.410> snowmobiles<00:03:40.280> like<00:03:40.460> this

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
factories are snowmobiles like this

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.730 
factories are snowmobiles like this
for<00:03:40.850> no<00:03:40.970> reason<00:03:41.390> alright<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.960> both<00:03:42.140> came<00:03:42.470> on

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
for no reason alright it both came on

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.650 
for no reason alright it both came on
they<00:03:43.280> found<00:03:43.490> the<00:03:43.670> camera<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.209> had<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.420> speed

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
they found the camera and had to speed

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.070 
they found the camera and had to speed
the<00:03:44.840> engine<00:03:45.110> up<00:03:46.330> pulling<00:03:47.330> out<00:03:47.510> quite<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> bit<00:03:47.959> of

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
the engine up pulling out quite a bit of

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.620 
the engine up pulling out quite a bit of
heat<00:03:48.400> but<00:03:49.400> they<00:03:49.490> really<00:03:49.790> quiet<00:03:50.030> can't<00:03:50.450> even

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
heat but they really quiet can't even

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.340 
heat but they really quiet can't even
hear<00:03:53.410> and<00:03:54.410> then<00:03:54.620> we<00:03:54.770> close<00:03:54.950> this<00:03:55.160> shut<00:03:55.400> off<00:03:56.350> can

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
hear and then we close this shut off can

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.440 
hear and then we close this shut off can
even<00:03:57.560> hear<00:03:58.870> an<00:03:59.870> air<00:04:00.080> today<00:04:00.320> blowing<00:04:00.830> off<00:04:00.980> with

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
even hear an air today blowing off with

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:14.520 
even hear an air today blowing off with
really<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.480> lot<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:12.310> guess<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.489> new<00:04:13.640> easy

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
really a lot I guess the new easy

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.670 
really a lot I guess the new easy
because<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.890> radiators<00:04:16.400> are<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:16.730> efficient

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
because the radiators are so efficient

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.009 
because the radiators are so efficient
it<00:04:18.680> don't<00:04:18.859> take<00:04:19.010> much<00:04:19.040> air<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.579> cool<00:04:19.700> them<00:04:19.880> off

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it don't take much air to cool them off

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.300 
it don't take much air to cool them off
because<00:04:21.019> I<00:04:21.230> mean<00:04:21.410> this<00:04:21.530> arm<00:04:21.739> is<00:04:21.859> laying<00:04:22.100> for

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
because I mean this arm is laying for

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.860 
because I mean this arm is laying for
probably<00:04:22.669> 20<00:04:23.030> minutes<00:04:23.060> before<00:04:23.570> they<00:04:23.660> kicked

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
probably 20 minutes before they kicked

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.130 
probably 20 minutes before they kicked
on<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:25.820> is<00:04:25.940> kind<00:04:26.120> of<00:04:26.240> cool<00:04:26.419> here<00:04:26.720> but<00:04:26.780> it's<00:04:27.020> not

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
on it is kind of cool here but it's not

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.520 
on it is kind of cool here but it's not
really<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.470> cold<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:29.720> know<00:04:29.810> what<00:04:29.960> yeah<00:04:30.290> have

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
really that cold you know what yeah have

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.850 
really that cold you know what yeah have
a<00:04:30.560> good<00:04:30.680> day

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
a good day

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.710 
a good day
oh<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:31.550> want<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:31.970> I<00:04:34.060> guess<00:04:35.060> if<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.240> turn<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.630> air

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
oh I want to I guess if I turn the air

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.210 
oh I want to I guess if I turn the air
conditioner<00:04:36.140> on<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.530> will<00:04:36.710> probably<00:04:36.919> blow

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
conditioner on it will probably blow

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.720 
conditioner on it will probably blow
harder<00:04:38.470> let's<00:04:39.470> see<00:04:39.650> all<00:04:39.919> right<00:04:39.980> turn<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.580> air

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
harder let's see all right turn the air

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.659 
harder let's see all right turn the air
conditioning<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.360> both<00:04:42.230> fans<00:04:42.530> came<00:04:42.830> on<00:04:43.160> but

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
conditioning on both fans came on but

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.940 
conditioning on both fans came on but
they<00:04:43.820> blew<00:04:44.150> slow<00:04:45.080> like<00:04:45.320> they<00:04:45.470> did<00:04:45.650> when<00:04:45.919> they

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
they blew slow like they did when they

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.240 
they blew slow like they did when they
was<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.490> coming<00:04:46.790> on<00:04:47.260> thermostatically<00:04:48.260> but

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
was just coming on thermostatically but

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.340 
was just coming on thermostatically but
I<00:04:49.280> decided<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.880> on<00:04:50.270> show<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.780> guys<00:04:51.020> something

about the defroster didn't work that
well<00:06:35.090> it<00:06:35.420> was<00:06:35.510> like<00:06:35.690> you<00:06:35.840> know<00:06:35.930> defroster<00:06:36.470> wood

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650

it<00:06:37.160> will<00:06:37.310> clear<00:06:37.610> the<00:06:37.730> windshield<00:06:38.300> but

it will clear the windshield but
everything<00:06:39.320> else<00:06:39.560> will<00:06:39.680> be<00:06:39.710> fogged<00:06:40.190> up<00:06:40.370> and

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
everything else will be fogged up and

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.570 
everything else will be fogged up and
people<00:06:41.630> couldn't<00:06:41.900> see<00:06:42.130> so<00:06:43.130> I<00:06:43.160> guess<00:06:43.400> they

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
people couldn't see so I guess they

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.310 
people couldn't see so I guess they
decided<00:06:44.060> to<00:06:44.090> make<00:06:44.300> them<00:06:44.450> like<00:06:44.600> American<00:06:45.080> cars

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
decided to make them like American cars

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.190 
decided to make them like American cars
but<00:06:46.040> when<00:06:46.220> you<00:06:46.310> put<00:06:46.520> it<00:06:46.640> on<00:06:46.760> the<00:06:46.940> froster<00:06:47.450> the

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
but when you put it on the froster the

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.160 
but when you put it on the froster the
air<00:06:48.320> condition<00:06:48.770> will<00:06:48.890> come<00:06:49.070> on<00:06:49.220> on<00:06:49.430> its<00:06:49.940> own
