00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
feel like a really big match at least to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.790 
feel like a really big match at least to
me<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.750> feel<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> they've

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
me do you feel like this is a they've

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.960 
me do you feel like this is a they've
done<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> good<00:00:20.100> job<00:00:20.160> building<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.730> match

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
done a good job building up that match

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.269 
done a good job building up that match
really<00:00:21.570> good<00:00:21.750> yeah<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:22.560> part<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
really good yeah and I think part of it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.790 
really good yeah and I think part of it
is<00:00:23.310> um<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.699> think<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.289> Cena's<00:00:25.289> interviews

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
is um I think that Cena's interviews

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
is um I think that Cena's interviews
have<00:00:26.039> been<00:00:26.070> very<00:00:26.820> different<00:00:27.180> from<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> usual

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
have been very different from the usual

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.419 
have been very different from the usual
Signet<00:00:27.990> interview<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> he's<00:00:28.949> portrayed

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
Signet interview and he's portrayed

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.179 
Signet interview and he's portrayed
Lesnar<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.199> very<00:00:31.199> different<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:31.830> everybody

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
Lesnar as very different from everybody

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
Lesnar as very different from everybody
else<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> he's<00:00:32.730> gone<00:00:32.850> against<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
else that he's gone against so now you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.049 
else that he's gone against so now you
feel<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> same<00:00:35.000> type<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
feel like it's not the same type of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
feel like it's not the same type of
match<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.630> usual<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> course<00:00:37.680> Paul

broadcasters to be there the video stuff

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.270 
broadcasters to be there the video stuff
that<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:42.930> did<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.230> him<00:00:43.260> brought<00:00:44.100> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that they did with him brought this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
that they did with him brought this
enough<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> say<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.050> he<00:00:46.140> says<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
enough to say a lot but when he says it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
enough to say a lot but when he says it
it<00:00:46.770> kind<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.309> resonates<00:00:47.760> real<00:00:47.940> well<00:00:48.149> so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it kind of like resonates real well so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.860 
it kind of like resonates real well so
yeah<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.500> far<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.860> single<00:00:50.489> match

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
yeah I think as far as a single match

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.119 
yeah I think as far as a single match
it's<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.500> built<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.770> better<00:00:52.949> than<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it's it was built up better than the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's it was built up better than the
first<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.260> it's<00:00:55.260> been<00:00:55.500> built<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.829> better

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
first one and it's been built up better

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
first one and it's been built up better
than<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:57.000> know<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:58.109> say<00:00:58.230> anything<00:00:58.440> since

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
than you know I would say anything since

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
than you know I would say anything since
May<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.039> Cena<00:00:59.309> wrong<00:00:59.460> maybe<00:00:59.760> probably<00:01:00.660> yeah

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
May what Cena wrong maybe probably yeah

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.270 
May what Cena wrong maybe probably yeah
you<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.379> gonna<00:01:01.500> say<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you know and I was gonna say do you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.319 
you know and I was gonna say do you
think<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.609> they've<00:01:02.760> learned<00:01:03.030> anything<00:01:03.210> from

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
think that they've learned anything from

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.460 
think that they've learned anything from
this<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> mean<00:01:04.140> there's<00:01:04.320> obviously

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
this because I mean there's obviously

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
this because I mean there's obviously
there's<00:01:05.189> bigger<00:01:05.460> matches<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.939> are<00:01:06.060> gonna

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
there's bigger matches that are gonna

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.640 
there's bigger matches that are gonna
get<00:01:06.390> more<00:01:06.570> attention<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.260> people<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.560> always

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
get more attention but people are always

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.560 
get more attention but people are always
talking<00:01:07.890> about<00:01:08.070> why<00:01:08.880> aren't<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.330> making

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
talking about why aren't you making

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.240 
talking about why aren't you making
matches<00:01:09.960> seem<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> little<00:01:10.830> bit<00:01:10.920> bigger<00:01:11.100> than

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
matches seem a little bit bigger than

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.380 
matches seem a little bit bigger than
life<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.610> don't<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.240> for

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
life I don't think you can do that for

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.399 
life I don't think you can do that for
every<00:01:12.479> main<00:01:12.720> event<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> every<00:01:13.229> pay-per-view

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
every main event of every pay-per-view

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.890 
every main event of every pay-per-view
but<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.860> times<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.509> wonder<00:01:15.810> if

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
but at times you can and I wonder if

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
but at times you can and I wonder if
they<00:01:16.020> learn<00:01:16.259> something<00:01:16.590> from<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.070> situation

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
they learn something from a situation

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
they learn something from a situation
like<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.090> from<00:01:18.240> other<00:01:18.420> Brock<00:01:18.689> Lesnar

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
like this or from other Brock Lesnar

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.200 
like this or from other Brock Lesnar
feuds<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.670> where<00:01:20.790> maybe<00:01:20.939> they

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
feuds that they have to where maybe they

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.850 
feuds that they have to where maybe they
can<00:01:21.360> bleed<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> little<00:01:22.439> bit<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
can bleed that over a little bit and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.190 
can bleed that over a little bit and
some<00:01:23.040> other<00:01:23.159> things<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:24.170> well<00:01:25.170> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
some other things that they do well I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.749 
some other things that they do well I
mean<00:01:25.500> again<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> wonder<00:01:26.460> one<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
mean again when you wonder one of the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.100 
mean again when you wonder one of the
unique<00:01:27.060> things<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> Lesnar<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.080> not

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
unique things is is that Lesnar is not

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.649 
unique things is is that Lesnar is not
there<00:01:28.409> every<00:01:28.500> week<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.400> him<00:01:29.670> every<00:01:30.329> match<00:01:30.479> he

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
there every week so him every match he

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.960 
there every week so him every match he
does<00:01:30.869> feels<00:01:31.259> more<00:01:31.439> special<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.490> so

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
does feels more special because of it so

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.310 
does feels more special because of it so
you<00:01:33.090> can't<00:01:33.420> do<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> necessarily<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you can't do it necessarily with the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.289 
you can't do it necessarily with the
Cena<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.729> only<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> dream

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

Cena you know you can only do a dream
match<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.020> never<00:01:37.140> been<00:01:37.290> done<00:01:37.470> before

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
match when it's never been done before

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.530 
match when it's never been done before
this<00:01:37.950> has<00:01:38.100> actually<00:01:38.369> been<00:01:38.460> done<00:01:38.520> once<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
this has actually been done once but it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.990 
this has actually been done once but it
was<00:01:39.630> two<00:01:39.750> years<00:01:39.930> ago<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.460> nature

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
was two years ago and it was the nature

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.850 
was two years ago and it was the nature
of<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.240> match<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.899> could<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> again

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
of a match that you could see it again

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.249 
of a match that you could see it again
and<00:01:44.210> they<00:01:45.210> didn't<00:01:45.450> they<00:01:45.630> didn't<00:01:45.810> rush<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.079> back

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and they didn't they didn't rush it back

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
and they didn't they didn't rush it back
so<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.880> pretty<00:01:47.970> fresh<00:01:48.450> again

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
so now it's pretty fresh again

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.749 
so now it's pretty fresh again
so<00:01:49.350> yeah<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.920> fact<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
so yeah the fact that you know and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.679 
so yeah the fact that you know and
originally<00:01:51.060> when<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.210> did<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.360> first<00:01:51.509> match

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
originally when they did the first match

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.850 
originally when they did the first match
they<00:01:51.869> were<00:01:51.960> never<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> go<00:01:52.380> back<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
they were never going to go back to it

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
they were never going to go back to it
but<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:53.640> they're<00:01:53.820> back<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.630> how

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
but now they're back to it is just how

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.539 
but now they're back to it is just how
it<00:01:54.930> worked<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.799> originally<00:01:56.100> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
it worked out because originally this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.770 
it worked out because originally this
match<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.180> Brock<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.630> Braun

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
match was going to be Brock and Braun

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.590 
match was going to be Brock and Braun
and<00:01:57.990> Daniel<00:01:58.680> Bryan<00:01:58.770> right<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.149> also<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and Daniel Bryan right and they also the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.639 
and Daniel Bryan right and they also the
other<00:02:00.750> thing<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.320> gonna<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.560> very

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
other thing I think it's gonna be very

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.200 
other thing I think it's gonna be very
unique<00:02:02.070> too<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.610> most<00:02:03.090> people

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
unique too is I think most people

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.580 
unique too is I think most people
believe<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.600> Brock<00:02:03.869> Lesnar<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.350> going<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
believe that Brock Lesnar is going to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.230 
believe that Brock Lesnar is going to
win<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> championship<00:02:05.250> yeah<00:02:05.670> how<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:05.880> they<00:02:06.060> go

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
could move him into a role where maybe

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.319 
could move him into a role where maybe
he's<00:03:47.889> not<00:03:48.069> on<00:03:48.280> TV<00:03:48.670> every<00:03:48.880> week<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.239> they

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
you know because I mean if the idea is

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.270 
you know because I mean if the idea is
Roman<00:05:45.720> reigns<00:05:45.750> when's<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.169> rumble<00:05:46.500> and<00:05:46.680> the

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
Roman reigns when's the rumble and the

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.219 
Roman reigns when's the rumble and the
fans<00:05:47.520> have<00:05:47.850> decided<00:05:48.389> the<00:05:48.810> same<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:49.139> I<00:05:49.169> don't

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
fans have decided the same and I don't

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:50.659

think they will you know but like they

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.760 
think they will you know but like they
did<00:05:50.850> with<00:05:50.910> Batista<00:05:51.419> but<00:05:52.050> just<00:05:52.350> let's<00:05:52.530> say<00:05:52.650> that

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
did with Batista but just let's say that

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.680 
did with Batista but just let's say that
they<00:05:52.950> do<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.310> they<00:05:53.370> just<00:05:53.400> resent<00:05:53.940> Batista<00:05:54.600> I

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
they do and they just resent Batista I

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.900 
they do and they just resent Batista I

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
mean I'm to resent Roman then you've

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.070 
mean I'm to resent Roman then you've
undermined<00:05:57.210> everything<00:05:57.510> that<00:05:57.960> you're

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
undermined everything that you're

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.779 
undermined everything that you're
working<00:05:58.349> for<00:05:58.530> so<00:05:59.039> at<00:05:59.130> that<00:05:59.220> point<00:05:59.520> you<00:05:59.700> know

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
working for so at that point you know

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.400 
working for so at that point you know
maybe<00:06:00.000> it's<00:06:00.180> better<00:06:00.330> to<00:06:00.539> just<00:06:00.570> keep<00:06:00.810> Daniel

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
maybe it's better to just keep Daniel

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.650 
maybe it's better to just keep Daniel
Bryan<00:06:01.680> in<00:06:02.099> the<00:06:02.190> back<00:06:02.310> burner<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.700> not<00:06:03.510> have

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
Bryan in the back burner and not have

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.300 
Bryan in the back burner and not have
him<00:06:03.750> make<00:06:03.900> because<00:06:04.229> if<00:06:04.380> someone<00:06:04.830> says<00:06:05.070> what

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
him make because if someone says what

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.200 
him make because if someone says what
wouldn't<00:06:05.460> be<00:06:05.520> great<00:06:05.729> if<00:06:05.849> he<00:06:05.880> does<00:06:06.030> like<00:06:06.180> a

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
wouldn't be great if he does like a

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.540 
wouldn't be great if he does like a
