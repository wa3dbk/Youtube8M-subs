it's it's you should definitely use it
if<00:02:25.710> when<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.980> lock<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.580> past<00:02:26.790> 12<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.270> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
if when you lock it this past 12 that is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.660 
if when you lock it this past 12 that is
because<00:02:28.050> 12<00:02:28.410> shots<00:02:28.710> propel<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.310> isn't<00:02:29.550> that

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
because 12 shots propel it isn't that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.140 
because 12 shots propel it isn't that
much<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.360> these<00:02:30.750> way<00:02:31.590> weird<00:02:32.100> needle<00:02:32.760> pellets

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
go right through the target and can hit

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.199 
go right through the target and can hit
people<00:02:34.800> behind<00:02:35.160> them<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.090> me<00:02:36.180> doing

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
people behind them as you see me doing

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.620 
people behind them as you see me doing

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
right now and here you seem using the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.650 
right now and here you seem using the
frags<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.740> drop<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.670> flash<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.300> much

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
frags the drop of the flash a is much

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.860 
frags the drop of the flash a is much
much<00:02:43.110> higher<00:02:43.410> than<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.910> special<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.720> means

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
much higher than the special that means

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.540 
much higher than the special that means
the<00:02:45.990> drop<00:02:46.200> off<00:02:46.320> at<00:02:46.500> eight<00:02:46.680> instead<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.190> six

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
the drop off at eight instead of six

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.750 
the drop off at eight instead of six
meaning<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.000> do<00:02:48.120> more<00:02:48.300> damage<00:02:48.480> or<00:02:48.720> distance

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
meaning you do more damage or distance

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.220 
meaning you do more damage or distance

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
when you lock it you should use them

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.220 
when you lock it you should use them

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
good rounds of this past 12 because the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.030 
good rounds of this past 12 because the
fast<00:03:33.000> rapid<00:03:33.450> fire<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.350> past<00:03:34.590> well<00:03:34.860> that

fast rapid fire of this past well that
didn't<00:03:35.220> make<00:03:35.280> any<00:03:35.340> sense<00:03:35.519> either<00:03:35.820> but<00:03:36.330> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
didn't make any sense either but the
