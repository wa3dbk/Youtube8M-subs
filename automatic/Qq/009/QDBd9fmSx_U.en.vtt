00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
way the way that I was able to maximize

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.090 
way the way that I was able to maximize
my<00:04:21.060> savings<00:04:21.540> is<00:04:21.750> by<00:04:21.900> stacking<00:04:22.560> stacking<00:04:22.770> is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
my savings is by stacking stacking is

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.909 
my savings is by stacking stacking is
when<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.370> take<00:04:23.639> two<00:04:23.910> coupons<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.740> store<00:04:25.740> coupon

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
