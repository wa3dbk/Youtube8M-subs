00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 very good to all big and fat and already 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.569
 is right here daily video and I'm 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.570
 here good so with the warfare 3 many 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.400
 you will say seen before I was sixth, this is not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.200
 it can be true who distracting 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.389
 this heat and that leads I hate it 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.940
 it's a good shit, not the truth is that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.189
 sure that many will like you already 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.689
 most in April is known by this 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.779
 warmth because you already know that I brought 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.300
 many pretty good games to me 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.189
 channel and most I think that if we 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.990
 we put to count the videos the majority 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 are to keep three because good 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.010
 because I was very good at this game what 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.530
 I caught pretty good and you want me not to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 I miss a little bit less not though and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.730
 good when I was so to speak of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.530
 fashion warfare 3 when good there was 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.629
 come out and it was the last heat had 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.969
 come out I remember that if you want to continue 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.100
 bringing items as Warfare2 of 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.199
 nuclear with difficult things like that of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.620
 for four or centex or things 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.460
 style 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.219
 and I also brought 4 games so 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.260
 so to speak do not leave abandoned 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.660
 those call of duty and now that has been 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.850
 like the whites 2, well, you want 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.659
 that not once reach the prestige 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.640
 teacher who 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.369
 I ended up coming to the end in my account 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 primary good recently, less than 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.530
 a week that I think is good 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.990
 one does not feel like anything to get 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.329
 do diamond things and that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.700
 Well now I have the 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.409
 submachine guns forgive the pistols and 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.920
 the rocket launchers so good to me 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.810
 some machine guns would be missing some 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 year rifles sniper rifles 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.849
 I also have them and well some 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.289
 assault rifles some more special 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:43.439
 I have two specials left, it's already 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.079
 no no no you do not feel like doing it and 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.770
 good you start to do games and something 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.810
 like that and then good ends the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.909
 final tired you a bit because I do not know 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.429
 this one is confused a little exploited 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.560
 so as the two do not put me 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.929
 for the comments some things that you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.359
 like to see more different than a 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.530
 starting I know something is to happen 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.769
 and I had it interesting because 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.750
 I'm probably going to do it so 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.730
 good in warfare 3 well you want that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.720
 you did not have many weapons you had many 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.810
 things that 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.020
 is doing well and good here today I am 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.850
 bringing a game with the class 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.850
 predetermined with the first one that gives you 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.770
 I do not know if it's the grenadier I do not know how it 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.050
 called the truth but good as it is 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.780
 scavenger because it came pretty good for 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.670
 become a lady because that's how you had more bullets 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.030
 how you had two weapons and good as 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.800
 you are watching the gusts do not get 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.770
 do not throw them away I keep them there the flipper 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.230
 the drone and the help package and good 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.110
 I was playing with four more people 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.760
 I was playing without a micro, so no 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.380
 did not carry as much help as well 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.500
 say that many maybe it is that hai 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.420
 yes that but good when you play 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.250
 like to play with friends with colleagues 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.440
 because you want that this game is not so 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.910
 we had it but if you do not buy it 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.340
 Shopping to play only you buy it 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.090
 to play or not with more people and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.040
 Well, if you play with your PC with friends 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.020
 yours or with people you know 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.580
 you're going to have a better time and it's just 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.860
 that's why I usually play with 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.590
 with more people instead of playing alone, not 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.840
 to be that I want some game to play 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.819
 I just play like that 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.230
 I have quite a few games as a 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:28.230
 departure offered by the editor to my house 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.660
 well I took it out and it was amazing 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.379
 I was playing alone I put on and I do not know 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.480
 he believed 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.670
 and I least did not believe that game that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.739
 I had been taken out so good assures 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.489
 before I bring her one day with him 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:43.440
 and good more things yes yes good if you want 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.230
 that I keep bringing from time to time as 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.049
 something like once a week or a 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.630
 once a month that he opposes I have 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.549
 lots of warfare activities 3 yes 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.130
 the white is 2 I would not have left could 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.140
 have been like a month without playing the 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.480
 play and would have games or more still 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.280
 because of knowing that you start inventing 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.959
 the triple more I tried a lot 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.120
 of times until it did not come out then 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.700
 they came out a lot of doubles more than 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.170
 I have saved there and also I 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.670
 I know when I tried the double 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.849
 moving it by teams well then 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.070
 also I left me only 13 something 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.109
 style so good you can not 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.180
 put out there for the comments I 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.400
 comment if I already had what I 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.919
 I'm doing 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.080
 damn damn that person who 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.530
 decided that on January 8 all 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.320
 we had to go back to the institute or 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.940
 the university or whatever it was that 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.590
 who who really came up 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.160
 decide that date and not a little more 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.080
 late 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.840
 my mother imagine that you will all have 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.669
 raised today good because it gave me crying 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.630
 saying why because I have to 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.220
 go back to the institute today to whatever it was and 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.320
 the truth is that I imagine that all 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.030
 you will be exhausted but good five 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.560
 minutes but you can swallow it 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.660

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.340

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.080

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.320
