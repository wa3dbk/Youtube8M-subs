side this one is your steering dual
rates<00:06:20.180> dual<00:06:21.080> rates<00:06:21.379> are<00:06:21.740> used<00:06:22.129> to<00:06:22.580> increase<00:06:22.699> or

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
rates dual rates are used to increase or

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.040 
rates dual rates are used to increase or
decrease<00:06:23.269> the<00:06:23.800> servo<00:06:24.800> travel<00:06:25.369> or<00:06:25.749> in<00:06:26.749> other

decrease the servo travel or in other

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.889 
decrease the servo travel or in other
words<00:06:27.319> I<00:06:27.529> can<00:06:27.740> say<00:06:27.769> that<00:06:28.669> dual<00:06:28.969> rates<00:06:29.209> are<00:06:29.569> used

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:29.899 
words I can say that dual rates are used

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:33.239 
words I can say that dual rates are used
to<00:06:30.769> actually<00:06:31.369> select<00:06:31.610> between<00:06:32.180> two<00:06:32.689> different

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:33.249 
to actually select between two different

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:35.859 
to actually select between two different
sensitivities<00:06:34.249> of<00:06:34.519> your<00:06:34.879> server<00:06:35.149> movements

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:35.869 
sensitivities of your server movements

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:39.399 
sensitivities of your server movements
this<00:06:36.379> means<00:06:36.649> using<00:06:37.099> steering<00:06:38.029> dual<00:06:38.269> rates<00:06:38.569> you

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:39.409 
this means using steering dual rates you

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.679 
this means using steering dual rates you
can<00:06:39.439> actually<00:06:39.860> choose<00:06:40.580> between<00:06:41.149> two

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:41.689 
can actually choose between two

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.589 
can actually choose between two
different<00:06:41.740> steering<00:06:42.879> sensitivities<00:06:43.879> that<00:06:44.419> is

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
different steering sensitivities that is

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.730 
different steering sensitivities that is
soft<00:06:44.959> steering<00:06:45.499> and<00:06:46.149> very<00:06:47.149> quick<00:06:47.740> steering

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
soft steering and very quick steering

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.299 
soft steering and very quick steering
for<00:06:49.519> tight<00:06:49.789> cornering<00:06:50.439> alright<00:06:51.439> this<00:06:52.039> was

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:52.309 
for tight cornering alright this was

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:54.339 
for tight cornering alright this was
pretty<00:06:52.639> much<00:06:52.729> it<00:06:53.089> it's<00:06:53.389> very<00:06:53.810> easy<00:06:54.050> to<00:06:54.229> use
