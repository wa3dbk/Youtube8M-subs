00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
alright now that we practiced that into

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.540 
alright now that we practiced that into
our<00:00:09.120> tongues<00:00:09.450> numb<00:00:09.950> let's<00:00:10.950> move<00:00:11.190> forward<00:00:11.429> to

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
our tongues numb let's move forward to

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.330 
our tongues numb let's move forward to
actually<00:00:11.730> breaking<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> note<00:00:12.450> over<00:00:12.750> okay<00:00:13.380> so

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
actually breaking the note over okay so

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.250 
actually breaking the note over okay so
I'm<00:00:14.910> gonna<00:00:15.030> put<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.299> call<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.690> my<00:00:15.809> mouth<00:00:15.990> and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
I'm gonna put the call to my mouth and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.529 
I'm gonna put the call to my mouth and
really<00:00:16.710> focus<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.490> hand<00:00:17.760> placement<00:00:18.090> make

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
really focus on your hand placement make

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.400 
really focus on your hand placement make
sure<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.869> right

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
sure it's right

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.220 
sure it's right
mouth<00:00:20.189> placement<00:00:20.850> tip<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> tongue<00:00:21.930> down

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
mouth placement tip of the tongue down

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
mouth placement tip of the tongue down
and<00:00:22.859> we're<00:00:23.010> applying<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.519> low<00:00:23.850> deep<00:00:24.180> sound

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
and we're applying that low deep sound

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.140 
and we're applying that low deep sound
and<00:00:24.930> then<00:00:25.320> we're<00:00:25.439> gonna<00:00:25.529> use<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.760> tongue

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and then we're gonna use that tongue

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.560 
and then we're gonna use that tongue
movement<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.869> hit<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.170> case<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:29.179> now<00:00:30.179> might

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
movement to hit that case out now might

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.669 
movement to hit that case out now might
as<00:00:30.599> well<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:30.840> even<00:00:30.900> talk<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.439> anymore

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
as well not even talk about anymore

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.770 
as well not even talk about anymore
let's<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.279> jump<00:00:32.520> into<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.690> I'm

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
let's just jump into it and do it so I'm

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.290 
let's just jump into it and do it so I'm
gonna<00:00:33.870> start<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.320> slow<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:35.940> gonna<00:00:36.090> raise

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
gonna start off slow and I'm gonna raise

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.819 
gonna start off slow and I'm gonna raise
the<00:00:36.450> back<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.899> tongue<00:00:37.140> into<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> K

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the back of the tongue into the K

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:54.340 
the back of the tongue into the K
position

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.810 

now<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.620> patient<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.220> this<00:00:56.400> if<00:00:56.580> you<00:00:56.700> don't

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
now be patient with this if you don't

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
now be patient with this if you don't
get<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.360> couple<00:00:57.570> times<00:00:57.900> don't<00:00:58.500> get

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
get the first couple times don't get

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.799 
get the first couple times don't get
over<00:00:59.250> anxious<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.910> don't<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.210> discouraged

over anxious or don't get discouraged

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.479 
over anxious or don't get discouraged
and<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.170> really<00:01:01.470> make<00:01:01.680> sure<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.950> focus<00:01:02.190> on

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and just really make sure you focus on

and just really make sure you focus on
everything<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.970> practice<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.690> point<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
everything we practice to this point is

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
everything we practice to this point is
it<00:01:04.680> takes<00:01:04.890> practice<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.760> everybody's<00:01:06.210> going

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it takes practice not everybody's going

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.830 
it takes practice not everybody's going
to<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.690> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> first<00:01:07.020> couple<00:01:07.350> times<00:01:07.820> just

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
to get it on the first couple times just

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.480 
to get it on the first couple times just
take<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.020> slow<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:10.979> feel<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
take it slow and really feel what that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.760 
take it slow and really feel what that
cause<00:01:11.790> doing<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.290> want<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> get

cause doing and you don't want to get
discouraged<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:14.550> start<00:01:14.790> forcing<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> air

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
discouraged and start forcing the air

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
discouraged and start forcing the air
into<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> call<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.320> don't<00:01:16.440> want<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> start

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
into the call you don't want to start

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.740 
into the call you don't want to start
going<00:01:17.190> what<00:01:19.970> because<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.330> gonna<00:01:21.510> help

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
going what because that's not gonna help

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
going what because that's not gonna help
remember<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.800> want<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> take<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.399> tongue

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
remember we want to take that tongue

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.160 
remember we want to take that tongue
movement<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.330> want<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.690> tongue<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.020> move

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
movement and we want that tongue to move

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:36.310 
movement and we want that tongue to move
up<00:01:25.350> slow<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.220> natural<00:01:26.670> position<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.270> going

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.440 

because<00:01:37.320> remember<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.550> raise<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.149> tongue

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
because remember as we raise that tongue

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.749 
because remember as we raise that tongue
that<00:01:39.869> air<00:01:40.110> pressure<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.710> building<00:01:41.130> naturally

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that air pressure is building naturally

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.490 
that air pressure is building naturally
we<00:01:41.880> don't<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.330> force<00:01:42.660> more<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.289> air

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
we don't have to force more out of air

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.139 
we don't have to force more out of air
out<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> our<00:01:43.979> lungs<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.520> build<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.880> pressure

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
out of our lungs to build that pressure

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.850 
out of our lungs to build that pressure
up<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.570> tongue<00:01:45.810> moving<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> roof<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
up that tongue moving to the roof of the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.590 
up that tongue moving to the roof of the
mouth<00:01:47.039> is<00:01:47.369> getting<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.000> build<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:48.450> than

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
mouth is getting to build more than

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.670 
mouth is getting to build more than
enough<00:01:48.780> pressure<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.440> need<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
enough pressure than what we need to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440 
enough pressure than what we need to
break<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.009> call<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.910> let's<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.240> keep

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
break that call so let's just keep

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:24.410 
break that call so let's just keep
practicing<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> using<00:01:52.830> that<00:01:52.860> low<00:01:53.250> sound<00:02:23.420> now

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
practicing it using that low sound now

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.850 
practicing it using that low sound now

call and you're not getting it and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.750 
call and you're not getting it and
you're<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:27.870> getting<00:02:28.200> discouraged<00:02:28.760> it's

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
you're just getting discouraged it's

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.170

okay<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.360> mean<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.810> happens<00:02:31.230> slow<00:02:31.830> down<00:02:32.099> back<00:02:32.940> up

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
okay I mean it happens slow down back up

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.750 
okay I mean it happens slow down back up
a<00:02:33.330> couple<00:02:33.360> steps<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:34.890> blow<00:02:35.160> into<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.550> back

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
a couple steps going blow into the back

right now and you notice and you're
starting<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.440> grunt<00:02:49.800> back<00:02:50.550> up<00:02:50.760> even<00:02:51.060> further

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
starting to grunt back up even further

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.150 
starting to grunt back up even further
okay<00:02:51.810> there's<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.349> know<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.620> isn't<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:53.010> race

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
okay there's you know this isn't a race

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.550 
okay there's you know this isn't a race
to<00:02:53.430> get<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.790> end<00:02:53.970> back<00:02:54.660> up<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.140> practice

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
to get to the end back up and practice

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.260 
to get to the end back up and practice
just<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.010> low<00:02:56.190> sound<00:02:56.520> of

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.970 

and<00:03:03.270> then<00:03:03.540> once<00:03:03.810> you've<00:03:04.020> got<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.350> again<00:03:04.740> then

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
and then once you've got that again then

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.010 
and then once you've got that again then
move<00:03:05.160> forward<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:07.880> end<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.630> back<00:03:09.810> end

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
move forward to the end of the back end

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.960 
move forward to the end of the back end
of<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.170> call<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:11.010> try<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.370> again<00:03:11.520> like<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
of the call and then try it again like I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.810 
of the call and then try it again like I
said<00:03:12.270> be<00:03:12.510> patient<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.230> just<00:03:14.070> be<00:03:14.580> patient

to<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:52.020> able<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.200> practice<00:03:52.380> that<00:03:52.770> note<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.250> if

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
to be able to practice that note and if

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.430 
to be able to practice that note and if
you<00:03:53.820> blow<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.210> thousand<00:03:54.690> times<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:55.200> want<00:03:55.380> to

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
you blow it a thousand times you want to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.070 
you blow it a thousand times you want to
be<00:03:55.530> exactly<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.550> same<00:03:56.580> a<00:03:57.240> thousand<00:03:57.870> times

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
be exactly the same a thousand times

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.350 
be exactly the same a thousand times
reason<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:58.860> that<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.580> because<00:03:59.730> as<00:04:00.150> we

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
reason for that it's because as we

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.570 
reason for that it's because as we
become<00:04:00.690> consistent<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.590> use<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.100> in<00:04:02.220> blowing

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
become consistent and use it in blowing

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.640 
become consistent and use it in blowing
that<00:04:02.760> note<00:04:03.030> we're<00:04:03.750> gonna<00:04:03.810> start<00:04:04.200> taking<00:04:04.530> that

that note we're gonna start taking that
note<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.160> we're<00:04:05.280> gonna<00:04:05.400> start<00:04:05.760> varying<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.270> up

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
note and we're gonna start varying it up

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.880 
note and we're gonna start varying it up
a<00:04:06.510> little<00:04:06.570> bit<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.140> get<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.350> little<00:04:07.440> bit<00:04:07.739> more
