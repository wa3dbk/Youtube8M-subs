00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
Davidson off it makes their season I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.420 
Davidson off it makes their season I
think<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.410> different<00:03:13.739> for<00:03:13.980> us<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.220> mean

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
think so it's different for us I mean

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.880 
think so it's different for us I mean
they<00:03:14.850> used<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.090> do<00:03:15.209> us<00:03:15.360> back<00:03:15.600> when<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.470> first<00:03:16.680> got

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
they used to do us back when I first got

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.610 
they used to do us back when I first got
here<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.190> we<00:03:17.790> played<00:03:18.209> those<00:03:18.360> teams<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.900> that

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
here and we played those teams and that

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.520 
here and we played those teams and that
would<00:03:19.769> make<00:03:19.920> our<00:03:20.100> season<00:03:20.340> coming<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:21.480> be<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.989> top

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
would make our season coming to be a top

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.199 
would make our season coming to be a top
ranked<00:03:22.769> team<00:03:22.830> but<00:03:23.190> now<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.370> expect<00:03:23.580> that<00:03:24.060> we're

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
ranked team but now we expect that we're

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.580 
ranked team but now we expect that we're
going<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.420> out-compete<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.230> beat<00:03:25.380> those

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
going to out-compete and beat those

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.210 
going to out-compete and beat those
teams<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.340> mean<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.600> goes<00:03:28.350> everybody<00:03:29.040> on
