zero<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> ten<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.030> your<00:00:33.149> starting<00:00:33.510> zone<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
zero to ten in your starting zone and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
zero to ten in your starting zone and
then<00:00:34.380> 10<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.710> 15<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.309> usually<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> Berens<00:00:36.030> or

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
then 10 to 15 I usually go to Berens or

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.229 
then 10 to 15 I usually go to Berens or
west<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.410> all<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.649> your<00:00:37.770> alliance<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> then

west of all of your alliance and then

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.400 
west of all of your alliance and then
that's<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.480> doesn't<00:00:39.870> take<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.110> long<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that's that doesn't take that long it

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.340 
that's that doesn't take that long it
takes<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.739> an<00:00:40.860> hour<00:00:40.950> promptly<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.910> then<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
takes like an hour promptly and then and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.889 
takes like an hour promptly and then and
then<00:00:44.040> once<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.489> hit<00:00:44.579> 15<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.480> every<00:00:45.750> single

way up to 55 which is then when you go

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.369 
way up to 55 which is then when you go
to<00:00:56.640> blasted<00:00:57.600> lands<00:00:57.750> which<00:00:57.960> isn't<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> hard

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to blasted lands which isn't that hard

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
to blasted lands which isn't that hard
to<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.039> any<00:00:59.550> quest<00:00:59.879> 258<00:01:00.390> and

to get to you and any quest 258 and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.639 
to get to you and any quest 258 and
that's<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> did<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.140> took<00:01:01.289> me<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> whole

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that's what I did that took me a whole

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.520 
that's what I did that took me a whole
day<00:01:01.890> out<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.850> first<00:01:03.090> day<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.539> 58<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
day out on the first day I was 58 of the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.580 
day out on the first day I was 58 of the
like<00:01:04.680> real<00:01:04.890> time<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.150> probably<00:01:06.630> first<00:01:07.260> 12

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
like real time so probably first 12

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
like real time so probably first 12
hours<00:01:07.740> probably<00:01:08.100> took<00:01:08.310> me<00:01:08.400> 12<00:01:08.610> hours<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.000> go

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
hours probably took me 12 hours to go

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.840 
hours probably took me 12 hours to go
from<00:01:09.150> 0<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.920> 58<00:01:10.920> which<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> long<00:01:11.430> stretch<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
from 0 to 58 which is a long stretch you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
from 0 to 58 which is a long stretch you
know<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.060> entire<00:01:12.360> expansion<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.020> did<00:01:13.229> in

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
know it's entire expansion that I did in

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.700 
know it's entire expansion that I did in
one<00:01:14.070> day<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> real<00:01:14.460> time<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.170> then<00:01:16.170> suddenly

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
one day of real time and then suddenly

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.130 
one day of real time and then suddenly
move<00:01:16.979> into<00:01:17.100> BC<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.810> Burning

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
move into BC and a you know Burning

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.740 
move into BC and a you know Burning
Crusade<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.590> Outland<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.670> 58<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> 68

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
Crusade the Outland and that's 58 to 68

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
Crusade the Outland and that's 58 to 68
so<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> did<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.130> did<00:01:23.189> every<00:01:23.880> single

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so what I did is I did every single

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
so what I did is I did every single
dungeon<00:01:24.360> once<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> same<00:01:25.140> thing<00:01:25.380> but

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
dungeon once you know the same thing but

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.920 
dungeon once you know the same thing but
and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> dungeons<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> Quai<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and then the dungeons in the Quai the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
and then the dungeons in the Quai the
quests<00:01:28.320> inside<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.799> dungeon<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.310> you're

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
quests inside of the dungeon and you're

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.969 
quests inside of the dungeon and you're
not<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.720> enough<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.259> actually<00:01:31.290> go
