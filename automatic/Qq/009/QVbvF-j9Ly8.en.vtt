00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
small like this instead of this is the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.069 
small like this instead of this is the
difference<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> need<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:39.079> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
big one is fire and this one doesn't so

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.180 
big one is fire and this one doesn't so
