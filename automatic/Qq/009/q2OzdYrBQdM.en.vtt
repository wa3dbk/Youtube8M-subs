we unbox in our previous video that see

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.340 
we unbox in our previous video that see
if<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.240> wants<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.540> come<00:02:22.690> off<00:02:22.810> as<00:02:22.960> nicely<00:02:23.170> as

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
last time it's getting there so is the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.490 
last time it's getting there so is the
trickiest<00:02:28.720> part<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.020> getting<00:02:29.200> these<00:02:29.290> things

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
trickiest part of getting these things

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.450 
trickiest part of getting these things
out<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:30.010> try<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.460> get<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.880> peeled<00:02:31.810> off<00:02:32.020> or

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
out is try and get this peeled off or

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:42.860 
out is try and get this peeled off or
get<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.640> Facebook<00:02:34.270> cut<00:02:34.540> out<00:02:34.660> either<00:02:34.990> way

here's the rock aries one this one just

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.310 
here's the rock aries one this one just
seems<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.720> have<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> little<00:03:53.990> bit<00:03:54.050> more<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.260> a

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
shiny finish or whatever to it so then

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.320 
shiny finish or whatever to it so then
take<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:01.240> energy<00:04:02.240> infusion<00:04:02.810> wheel<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:05.150> spin

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
take the energy infusion wheel and spin

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.240 
take the energy infusion wheel and spin
row<00:04:05.630> until<00:04:05.930> they<00:04:06.080> fall<00:04:06.380> into<00:04:06.590> place<00:04:06.740> there

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:18.850 

Betsy<00:04:10.630> pick<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.900> face<00:04:12.350> bolt<00:04:17.020> which<00:04:18.020> doesn't

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
Betsy pick the face bolt which doesn't

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.650 
Betsy pick the face bolt which doesn't
want<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.100> tighten<00:04:19.370> oh<00:04:21.430> go<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:23.270> let's<00:04:23.390> put<00:04:23.570> the

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
want to tighten oh go so let's put the

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.000 
want to tighten oh go so let's put the
spin<00:04:23.840> track<00:04:24.020> in<00:04:24.170> first<00:04:24.440> I<00:04:24.680> am<00:04:24.980> a<00:04:25.010> genius

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
spin track in first I am a genius

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.180 
spin track in first I am a genius
alright<00:04:28.510> so<00:04:29.510> spin<00:04:29.960> track<00:04:30.430> then<00:04:31.430> face<00:04:31.940> bolt

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
alright so spin track then face bolt

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:42.730 
alright so spin track then face bolt
still<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.220> noob<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.580> guess<00:04:38.950> alright<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.780> then<00:04:42.590> we

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
still a noob I guess alright and then we

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.880 
still a noob I guess alright and then we
can<00:04:42.860> take<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.250> performance<00:04:43.820> tip<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:48.590> so

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
can take the performance tip like so

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.590 
can take the performance tip like so
give<00:04:51.890> them<00:04:51.950> a<00:04:52.100> slight<00:04:52.400> tighten<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.210> know<00:04:53.540> I'm

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
give them a slight tighten I know I'm

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.540 
give them a slight tighten I know I'm
using<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.930> wrong<00:04:54.050> side<00:04:54.350> phone<00:04:54.620> but<00:04:55.040> I<00:04:55.250> don't

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
using the wrong side phone but I don't

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.590 
using the wrong side phone but I don't
make<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.880> too<00:04:56.150> tight

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
make it too tight

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.170 
make it too tight
so<00:04:57.470> those<00:04:57.650> hold<00:04:57.890> by<00:04:58.640> the<00:04:58.700> person<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.090> bought

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
so those hold by the person you bought

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.570 
so those hold by the person you bought
the<00:04:59.360> previous<00:04:59.660> two<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.110> these<00:05:00.380> two<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:00.890> tighten

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
the previous two and these two I tighten

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.340 
the previous two and these two I tighten
one<00:05:01.730> a<00:05:01.760> bit<00:05:02.330> too<00:05:02.450> tight<00:05:02.630> actually<00:05:02.990> very<00:05:03.200> hard

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
one a bit too tight actually very hard

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.010 
one a bit too tight actually very hard
to<00:05:03.410> take<00:05:03.470> apart<00:05:03.770> so<00:05:04.240> make<00:05:05.240> sure<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.390> don't<00:05:05.510> over

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
to take apart so make sure I don't over

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.870 
to take apart so make sure I don't over
tighten<00:05:06.170> them<00:05:06.320> this<00:05:06.500> time<00:05:06.740> I<00:05:06.980> thought<00:05:07.700> I<00:05:07.790> had

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
tighten them this time I thought I had

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.730 
tighten them this time I thought I had
to<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.150> know<00:05:08.270> make<00:05:08.750> sure<00:05:08.780> they're<00:05:09.260> tight<00:05:09.500> so

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
to you know make sure they're tight so

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.810 
to you know make sure they're tight so
like<00:05:09.890> when<00:05:10.100> they<00:05:10.190> battle<00:05:10.430> they<00:05:10.490> don't<00:05:10.670> fall

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
like when they battle they don't fall

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.170 
like when they battle they don't fall
apart<00:05:10.910> some<00:05:11.330> like<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.600> but<00:05:12.340> anyway<00:05:13.340> here<00:05:14.030> is

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
apart some like that but anyway here is

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.450 
apart some like that but anyway here is
our<00:05:14.390> cyber<00:05:14.810> Pegasus<00:05:15.290> fully<00:05:15.590> assembled<00:05:16.040> -<00:05:16.430> a
