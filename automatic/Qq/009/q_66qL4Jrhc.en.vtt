00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.669
 Hello dear runner 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.829
 we have a very special one today 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.900
 Guest here and the friederike feil 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.969
 hello friederike carlotta vita nice 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.920
 you're here thank you look forward 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.599
 yes, I am also the free card namely 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.070
 Really aware of the topics that we 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.699
 today they discuss it actively 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.660
 Sportswoman has studied in the USA 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.039
 Nutritionist in and is on the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.779
 latest what was so issues such as 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.939
 decrease metabolism and healthy 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.920
 Nutrition concerns so I do not know 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.360
 if you know it but from 25 it's okay 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.829
 unfortunately downhill 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.039
 Now we have this limit 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.620
 unfortunately also the notes 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.870
 cravings and ligaments begin to hurt 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.969
 The skin will not be heavy anymore 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.449
 so taut me earlier develop 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.379
 the first wrinkles but you can do something 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.480
 do about it 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.910
 yes and that is exactly my question 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.440
 what should I do now so what 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.460
 I can do without artificial now 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.190
 to help out a lot 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.850
 So without immediately operate now 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.460
 have to 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 to stay nice anyway 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.360
 Silica very important and silicic acid 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.060
 For example, tears are bananas so who 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.470
 Four bananas can be fine 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.090
 supply silicic acid 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.799
 just as good a chance or oats but it 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.689
 there is also a plant that is the 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.540
 Silica is the most common plant 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.119
 horsetail horsetail 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.610
 grows everywhere and is really optimal 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.460
 to strengthen tendons and ligaments is good 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.369
 for beautiful skin is great for the hair 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.049
 and nails fingernails and thereby remains 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.310
 you just boys so you can be seen 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.869
 we are the wrinkles away but I have to 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.329
 I have to grow that in the garden now 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.369
 or or how hate yes or you could be in 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.960
 Growing garden, however, is a lot 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.399
 work you can easily with one 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.409
 working concentrate 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.600
 because it takes then just one day 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.159
 teaspoon of horsetail extract and 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.259
 then you are actually well prepared 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.570
 so to speak, they fold and stay young 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.439
 Great, yes, we should wear it 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.630

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.140
