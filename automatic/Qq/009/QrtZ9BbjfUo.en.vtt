first launched basically every board on
the<00:00:19.470> market<00:00:19.859> had<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> conventional<00:00:20.699> camber

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the market had a conventional camber

the market had a conventional camber

profile and then the crazy guys at
libtech<00:00:23.880> came<00:00:24.359> up<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.490> can

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
libtech came up with this and you can

libtech came up with this and you can

than the conventional camber profile

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.540 
than the conventional camber profile
which<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.380> curve<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.160> profile

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
which would curve like that the profile

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.020 
which would curve like that the profile
on<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.850> board<00:00:33.120> curves<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.500> other<00:00:34.710> way<00:00:35.030> now

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
on this board curves the other way now

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
on this board curves the other way now
this<00:00:36.210> has<00:00:36.420> three<00:00:37.250> fairly<00:00:38.250> distinct

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
this has three fairly distinct

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.209 
this has three fairly distinct
advantages<00:00:39.450> firstly<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.800> contact

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
advantages firstly because the contact

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.979 
advantages firstly because the contact
points<00:00:41.550> at<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> tip<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.239> tail<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.690> board

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
points at the tip and tail of this board

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.069 
points at the tip and tail of this board
are<00:00:43.290> raised<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.850> much<00:00:45.180> harder<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.750> dig<00:00:45.930> your

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
are raised it's much harder to dig your

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840 
are raised it's much harder to dig your
edge<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.410> when<00:00:46.590> you're<00:00:46.710> turning<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.700> is

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
edge in when you're turning and this is

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
edge in when you're turning and this is
great<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.270> beginners<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.680> means

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
great for beginners because it means

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.160 
great for beginners because it means
you're<00:00:50.039> less<00:00:50.190> likely<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.579> scorpion<00:00:51.180> secondly

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you're less likely to scorpion secondly

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.770 
you're less likely to scorpion secondly

the banana shape and the lifted nose and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.740 
the banana shape and the lifted nose and
tail<00:00:54.960> give<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> board<00:00:56.309> overall<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.510> more

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
tail give the board overall a more

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
tail give the board overall a more
playful<00:00:58.079> feel<00:00:58.530> than<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> conventional<00:00:59.070> camber

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

and little switch ups butters that kind
of<00:01:08.100> thing<00:01:08.340> those<00:01:08.850> two<00:01:09.470> also<00:01:10.470> mean<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of thing those two also mean that the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
of thing those two also mean that the
banana<00:01:12.479> shape<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> great<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.380> rail<00:01:13.560> riding

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
banana shape is great for rail riding

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.219 
banana shape is great for rail riding
because<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.880> much<00:01:15.060> easier<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.450> press<00:01:15.840> than<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
because it's much easier to press than a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.410 
because it's much easier to press than a
conventional<00:01:16.409> camber<00:01:17.040> board<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:18.150> then

conventional camber board and it's then
you're<00:01:18.570> less<00:01:18.750> likely<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.110> dig<00:01:19.350> your<00:01:19.470> edge<00:01:19.650> in

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you're less likely to dig your edge in

a<00:01:43.470> wavy<00:01:43.979> edge<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:45.210> rather<00:01:45.420> than<00:01:45.630> having<00:01:45.840> a

little kind of a bumps down the edge and
that<00:01:52.470> basically<00:01:53.159> acts<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.700> bread<00:01:53.939> knife

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
really bites into the turns so it's less

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.090
