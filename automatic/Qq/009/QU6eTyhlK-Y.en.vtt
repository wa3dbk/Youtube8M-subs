00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
we are beginning to think about more

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.940 
we are beginning to think about more
sophisticated<00:01:59.310> equipment<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.420> them<00:02:00.799> in<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
sophisticated equipment for them in the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
sophisticated equipment for them in the
future<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.299> piece<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.630> equipment<00:02:03.719> is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
future but this piece of equipment is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.459 
future but this piece of equipment is
for<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.100> them<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.520> finally

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
for now this is for them to finally

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.330 
for now this is for them to finally
bring<00:02:07.469> about<00:02:07.710> victory<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> battlefield

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
bring about victory on the battlefield

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
bring about victory on the battlefield
against<00:02:09.030> an<00:02:09.119> insurgency<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.410> gonna<00:02:10.500> do

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
against an insurgency and it's gonna do

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.980 
against an insurgency and it's gonna do
that<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.039> them

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
that for them

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.900 
that for them
keeping<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.620> balance<00:02:12.950> between<00:02:13.130> current<00:02:13.790> and

we'll<00:02:20.930> see<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> test<00:02:21.320> of<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.530> as<00:02:21.890> Afghan

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
we'll see a test of that as Afghan

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.220 
we'll see a test of that as Afghan
