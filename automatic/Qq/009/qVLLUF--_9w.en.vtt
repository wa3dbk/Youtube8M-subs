hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:03.120> we're<00:00:03.389> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.540> talk<00:00:03.629> about<00:00:03.780> how<00:00:04.049> to

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
segment we're going to talk about how to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.630 
segment we're going to talk about how to
transplant<00:00:04.710> orchids

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
transplant orchids

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.150 
transplant orchids
now<00:00:06.210> orchids<00:00:06.660> are<00:00:06.839> such<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> beautiful<00:00:07.830> plant

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
now orchids are such a beautiful plant

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.120 
now orchids are such a beautiful plant
and<00:00:08.490> they<00:00:09.210> do<00:00:09.269> so<00:00:09.780> well<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.650> certain

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
and they do so well in certain

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.370 
and they do so well in certain
situations<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.210> some<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.660> my<00:00:12.840> east<00:00:13.080> facing

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
situations I have some on my east facing

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.770 
situations I have some on my east facing
window<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.099> my<00:00:14.130> kitchen<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.360> do<00:00:15.420> so

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
window in my kitchen and they do so

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.450 
window in my kitchen and they do so
beautifully<00:00:16.410> they<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.890> grow<00:00:17.130> year-round

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
beautifully they just grow year-round

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.630 
beautifully they just grow year-round
and<00:00:18.000> they<00:00:18.480> bloom<00:00:18.840> periodically<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.130> they're

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and they bloom periodically and they're

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.689 
and they bloom periodically and they're
just<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.939> beautiful<00:00:20.970> plant<00:00:21.590> but<00:00:22.590> they<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.830> get

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
just a beautiful plant but they do get

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.429 
just a beautiful plant but they do get
big<00:00:24.119> over<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> years<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.230> bit

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
big over the years and a little bit

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.170 
big over the years and a little bit
crowded<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.949> their<00:00:26.070> pots<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.730> there's<00:00:26.970> some

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
crowded for their pots so there's some

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.670 
crowded for their pots so there's some
simple<00:00:27.510> rules<00:00:27.689> when<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.019> transplant<00:00:28.470> them

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
simple rules when you transplant them

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.599 
simple rules when you transplant them
that<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.949> should<00:00:28.980> follow

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
that you should follow

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.720 
that you should follow
so<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.539> pot<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.439> orchid<00:00:32.040> came<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> pot

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
so this pot this orchid came in the pot

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.160 
so this pot this orchid came in the pot
just<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.750> probably<00:00:33.989> not

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
just like this and it's probably not

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.340 
just like this and it's probably not
even<00:00:34.440> too<00:00:34.829> big<00:00:35.070> right<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.180> leave<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.230> in

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
even too big right now to leave it in

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
even too big right now to leave it in
the<00:00:37.440> pot<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.800> like<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.250> rebound

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the pot they like to be rebound

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
the pot they like to be rebound
so<00:00:39.300> being<00:00:39.570> crowded<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> good<00:00:40.530> thing<00:00:40.770> for

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
so being crowded is a good thing for

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.209 
so being crowded is a good thing for
them<00:00:41.270> but<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.420> also<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.829> lot<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
them but they also like to have a lot of

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.369 
them but they also like to have a lot of
room<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> roots<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.180> grow<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.230> this

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
room for the roots to grow and in this

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.680 
room for the roots to grow and in this
pot<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:47.219> seem<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:48.030> stagnant<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
pot they seem to be a little stagnant it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.090 
pot they seem to be a little stagnant it
doesn't<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.350> air<00:00:49.500> into<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> pot

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
doesn't get a lot of air into the pot

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.580 
doesn't get a lot of air into the pot
there's<00:00:50.370> no<00:00:50.520> drainage<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
there's no drainage and so I'm going to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860 
there's no drainage and so I'm going to
put<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:52.920> into<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.280> regular<00:00:53.969> pot<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.449> think

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
put them into a regular pot and I think

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
put them into a regular pot and I think
that<00:00:55.469> it'll<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.800> better<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.129> found<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that it'll do better I found that they

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.099 
that it'll do better I found that they
do<00:00:56.760> better<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.149> pots<00:00:57.510> where<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.989> get

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
do better in pots where they can get

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.470 
do better in pots where they can get
drainage<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:59.039> more<00:00:59.280> air<00:00:59.489> so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
drainage and have a little more air so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.479 
drainage and have a little more air so
with<00:01:00.750> orchids<00:01:01.620> especially<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> most

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
with orchids especially the most

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.750 
with orchids especially the most
important<00:01:03.030> factor<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.019> good<00:01:04.650> drainage<00:01:04.920> so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
important factor is good drainage so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.330 
important factor is good drainage so
putting<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.360> rocks<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.409> gravel<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
putting some rocks or gravel on the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.490 
putting some rocks or gravel on the
bottom<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.790> container<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.630> marbles<00:01:10.170> or

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
bottom of your container or marbles or

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.060 
bottom of your container or marbles or
moss<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.250> anything<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.659> water<00:01:13.070> dries

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
moss or anything so that the water dries

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
moss or anything so that the water dries
out<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.909> best<00:01:15.090> thing<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> do

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
out is the best thing that you can do

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.320 
out is the best thing that you can do
for<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.950> basically<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.090> two

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
for them and then basically the two

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
for them and then basically the two
materials<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.020> I've<00:01:19.140> used<00:01:19.380> most<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:20.130> my

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
materials that I've used most for my

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.820 
materials that I've used most for my
orchids<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.150> straight<00:01:21.780> bark<00:01:22.049> dust<00:01:22.350> plant

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
orchids are straight bark dust plant

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.170 
orchids are straight bark dust plant
them<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> bark<00:01:23.490> dust<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.970> then

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
them right in the bark dust and then

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.749 
them right in the bark dust and then
straight<00:01:24.450> moss<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.950> moss<00:01:26.189> out<00:01:26.610> of

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
straight moss so I just get moss out of

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
straight moss so I just get moss out of
some<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> my<00:01:27.090> other<00:01:27.360> plants<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:27.960> around<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
some of my other plants or around the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.310 
some of my other plants or around the
house<00:01:28.560> under<00:01:29.040> trees<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:31.049> put<00:01:31.290> some

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
house under trees and I just put some

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.580 
house under trees and I just put some
moss<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.310> big<00:01:32.700> chunks<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.170> orchid

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
moss in big chunks in with the orchid

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.920 
moss in big chunks in with the orchid
and<00:01:34.829> sometimes<00:01:35.820> I'll<00:01:36.000> put<00:01:36.150> some<00:01:36.329> soil<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> with

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and sometimes I'll put some soil in with

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
and sometimes I'll put some soil in with
it<00:01:37.079> too<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.530> seems<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it too because it seems to like it and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.539 
it too because it seems to like it and
then<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:40.200> always<00:01:40.350> nice<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.890> separate<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
then it's always nice to separate the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.730 
then it's always nice to separate the
roots<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.000> bit<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.420> these<00:01:42.840> roots<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.350> don't<00:01:43.590> look

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
roots a bit to these roots or don't look

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.960 
roots a bit to these roots or don't look
that<00:01:43.890> healthy<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.340> haven't<00:01:44.610> had<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> lot<00:01:44.939> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that healthy they haven't had a lot of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.510 
that healthy they haven't had a lot of
oxygen<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.110> by<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.500> giving<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.100> some<00:01:47.310> little

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
oxygen so by just giving it some little

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
oxygen so by just giving it some little
more<00:01:47.729> air<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> lot

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
more air I think it's going to do a lot

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.139 
more air I think it's going to do a lot
better<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> put<00:01:50.970> that

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
better so I'm just going to put that

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.770 
better so I'm just going to put that
right<00:01:51.509> into<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> pot<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.939> found<00:01:54.540> two

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
right into the pot and then I found two

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630 
right into the pot and then I found two
orchids<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.439> little<00:01:55.890> bit<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.159> soil<00:01:56.399> they

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
orchids like a little bit of soil they

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
orchids like a little bit of soil they
seem<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.119> better<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.689> tiny<00:01:58.290> bit

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
seem to do better with a little tiny bit

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.770 
seem to do better with a little tiny bit
of<00:01:58.469> compost<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.610> mix<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.119> some<00:02:00.509> moss

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
of compost so I mix it with some moss

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
of compost so I mix it with some moss
and<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.250> putting<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.670> top<00:02:02.880> layer<00:02:03.180> with<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and I'm just putting a top layer with it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.330 
and I'm just putting a top layer with it
as<00:02:03.780> well<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:06.750> bet<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.860> orchid

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
as well and I bet you that this orchid

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
as well and I bet you that this orchid
is<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.030> ten<00:02:09.270> times<00:02:09.539> better<00:02:09.780> now<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
is going to do ten times better now that

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.230 
is going to do ten times better now that
I've<00:02:10.500> given<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.039> little<00:02:11.220> more<00:02:11.400> air<00:02:11.610> in

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
I've given it a little more air in

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.270 
I've given it a little more air in
pot<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.840> bet<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.440> work<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.740> will<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> lot

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
pot I bet this work it will do a lot

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.410 
pot I bet this work it will do a lot
better<00:02:14.460> now<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.030> gotten<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.330> little

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
better now that it's gotten a little

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.110 
better now that it's gotten a little
more<00:02:15.570> air<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.200> some<00:02:16.500> fresh<00:02:16.770> moss<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.940> some

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
more air and some fresh moss and some

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.360 
more air and some fresh moss and some
fresh<00:02:18.330> soil<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.990> I'm<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:19.980> put<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.250> back

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
fresh soil and I'm going to put it back

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.190 
fresh soil and I'm going to put it back
in<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> kitchen<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.240> hopefully<00:02:21.810> it'll<00:02:21.960> bloom

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
in the kitchen and hopefully it'll bloom

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.860 
in the kitchen and hopefully it'll bloom
next<00:02:22.560> year
