thread you can get this texture and so
basically<00:00:27.500> what<00:00:27.650> ideas<00:00:27.919> I'd<00:00:28.070> I've<00:00:28.279> been

gold and the iron ore and the coal or
really<00:00:48.800> happy<00:00:49.579> with<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.879> gold<00:00:50.119> or<00:00:50.330> I<00:00:50.479> think

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
really happy with the gold or I think

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.560 
really happy with the gold or I think
that<00:00:50.930> looks<00:00:51.170> really<00:00:51.440> nice<00:00:51.710> it's<00:00:52.570> basically

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
that looks really nice it's basically

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.969 
that looks really nice it's basically
took<00:00:53.869> a<00:00:53.930> image<00:00:54.920> of<00:00:55.159> gold<00:00:55.460> ore<00:00:55.790> and<00:00:56.830> reduced<00:00:57.830> it

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
took a image of gold ore and reduced it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.799 
took a image of gold ore and reduced it
in<00:00:58.100> size<00:00:58.369> so<00:00:58.790> that's<00:00:59.000> pretty<00:00:59.420> much<00:00:59.540> what<00:00:59.750> it

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
in size so that's pretty much what it

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.799 
in size so that's pretty much what it
looks<00:00:59.960> like<00:01:00.080> in<00:01:00.260> real<00:01:00.379> life<00:01:01.239> so<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:02.570> cannot

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
looks like in real life so that cannot

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.929 
looks like in real life so that cannot
really<00:01:03.019> nice<00:01:03.260> then<00:01:03.589> I<00:01:03.650> got<00:01:03.830> my<00:01:03.949> Daisy<00:01:04.220> in<00:01:04.790> the

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.469 
really nice then I got my Daisy in the
Rose<00:01:06.100> those<00:01:07.100> are<00:01:07.280> kind<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.520> cool<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:08.060> didn't

little<00:02:29.710> different<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.420> dirts<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.720> little

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
little different and the dirts a little

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.980 
little different and the dirts a little
different<00:02:33.180> Sam's<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.330> little<00:02:34.510> different<00:02:34.780> and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
different Sam's a little different and

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.100 
different Sam's a little different and
the<00:02:35.140> gravel<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.620> quite<00:02:36.250> different<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.670> think

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the gravel is quite different I think

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.360 
the gravel is quite different I think
kind<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.200> stands<00:02:38.770> out<00:02:38.890> little<00:02:39.850> rocks<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.810> there

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
kind of stands out little rocks in there

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.530 
kind of stands out little rocks in there
so<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.850> then<00:02:43.120> there's<00:02:43.420> a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
so I like that then there's a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.150 
so I like that then there's a
cobblestone<00:02:43.960> I've<00:02:44.200> been<00:02:44.350> kind<00:02:44.710> of<00:02:44.770> messing

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
cobblestone I've been kind of messing

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.870 
cobblestone I've been kind of messing
with<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.460> I'm<00:02:45.610> not<00:02:46.800> sure<00:02:47.800> about<00:02:48.460> this<00:02:48.730> one

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
with that I'm not sure about this one

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.460 
with that I'm not sure about this one
yet<00:02:49.060> but<00:02:49.240> I<00:02:49.450> think<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.750> like<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:52.110> sure<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.290> was<00:02:53.440> a

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
yet but I think I like it sure it was a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.060 
yet but I think I like it sure it was a
lot<00:02:53.800> looks<00:02:54.100> like<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:57.750> entryway<00:02:58.750> there<00:02:59.070> and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
lot looks like on the entryway there and

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.710 
lot looks like on the entryway there and
then<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.400> can<00:03:00.520> see<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.820> doors<00:03:01.120> there<00:03:01.420> I

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
then you can see the doors there I

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.000 
then you can see the doors there I
thought<00:03:02.050> that<00:03:02.260> was<00:03:02.380> kind<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.709> white

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
thought that was kind of the white

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.660 
thought that was kind of the white
stoles<00:03:03.700> from<00:03:04.200> somebody's<00:03:05.200> image<00:03:05.980> on<00:03:06.610> google

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
stoles from somebody's image on google

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.479 
stoles from somebody's image on google
and<00:03:07.390> made<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.200> into<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.500> door<00:03:08.770> it's<00:03:09.130> really<00:03:09.280> nice

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
and made it into a door it's really nice

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.990 
and made it into a door it's really nice
looking<00:03:09.820> door<00:03:10.290> credit<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.410> whoever<00:03:11.470> made<00:03:11.920> that

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
looking door credit to whoever made that

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.140 
looking door credit to whoever made that
then<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.330> just<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.570> basic<00:03:13.780> mission<00:03:14.290> style
