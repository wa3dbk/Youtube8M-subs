around these reeds and I think I'm just

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.199 
around these reeds and I think I'm just
going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.100> flip<00:03:02.340> I'm<00:03:02.549> going<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> flip<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.000> I'm

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
going to flip I'm going to flip to I'm

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.300 
going to flip I'm going to flip to I'm
blue<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.600> face<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.769> don't<00:03:04.920> get<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.100> bite

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
blue in the face if I don't get a bite

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.770 
blue in the face if I don't get a bite
doing<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.760> then<00:03:06.030> I'll<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.360> something<00:03:06.600> else

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
doing that then I'll do something else

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.050 
doing that then I'll do something else
but<00:03:07.140> I've<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:07.799> got<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.310> believe<00:03:08.400> that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
but I've just got to believe that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.759 
but I've just got to believe that
there's<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.660> bass<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:10.140> hearing<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.470> reeds

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
there's a bass up hearing the reeds

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.640 
there's a bass up hearing the reeds
somewhere<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:12.690> think<00:03:13.079> about<00:03:13.230> hook<00:03:13.410> ones

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
somewhere and I think about hook ones

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.800 
somewhere and I think about hook ones
probably<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.400> pretty<00:03:15.090> good<00:03:15.180> fish<00:03:15.540> I

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
probably going to be pretty good fish I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.110 
probably going to be pretty good fish I
don't<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.200> that's<00:03:16.560> my<00:03:16.709> hopes<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.760> got<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.940> hope

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
don't it that's my hopes you got a hope

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.000 
don't it that's my hopes you got a hope
for<00:03:18.299> something<00:03:18.540> like<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.870> when<00:03:19.200> you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
for something like that when you

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.680 
for something like that when you
probably<00:03:20.340> only<00:03:20.489> get<00:03:20.910> one<00:03:21.239> or<00:03:21.269> two<00:03:21.420> bites

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
probably only get one or two bites

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.420 
probably only get one or two bites
hopefully<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:22.380> going<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.530> happen<00:03:22.739> if<00:03:23.160> not

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
hopefully it's going to happen if not

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
so you kind of have to have a little

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.250 
so you kind of have to have a little
strategy<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:20.820> be<00:05:21.120> committed<00:05:21.419> to<00:05:21.630> an<00:05:21.930> area

strategy and be committed to an area

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.480 
strategy and be committed to an area
once<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.680> get<00:05:22.830> in<00:05:22.979> there

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.400 
out of one of these hoagies I mean the
Mirage<00:05:47.430> drives<00:05:47.910> just<00:05:48.330> just<00:05:48.870> makes<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.229> easy

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410
