00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello letting go of the steering wheel a few 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 instants at 130 kilometers hour where 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.910
 much longer at low speed 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.570
 in traffic jams it's today 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.969
 possible 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.949
 I invite you to discover the mercedes 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.760
 class e riddled with assistant at the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.050
 conduct 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.970
 we are not far the car 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.970
 autonomous by car 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.799
 Here we are on highways at 110 km / hour 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.119
 110 120 kilometers an hour so I can 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.709
 let go of my steering wheel because all the lights 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.910
 are green 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.739
 materialized by a small steering wheel towards 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.930
 my dashboard so the assistant 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.190
 directional and functional it me 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.260
 remember then from time to time 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.450
 put your hands on the steering wheel because 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.010
 actually we can not let go 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.630
 flying over a little twenty 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.280
 seconds 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.980
 we have to show that we are always 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.400
 present except a low traffic jam 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.830
 speed 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.510
 all this possible thanks to a radar 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.720
 the front that continuously calculates the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.280
 distance from the distance and the speed of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.459
 the car ahead of you is 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.860
 also two stereo cameras located in 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.989
 the windshield who have a global vision 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.440
 everything that's going on around 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.269
 vehicle 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.940
 that's this technology is available 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.220

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.750

 very soon for the car totally 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.549
 autonomous and there are still a few years 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.260
 to have a car capable of going 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.180
 all by one from point a to point b 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.180

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:41.500
 I start reverse 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.500
 and then everything happens by itself 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.049
