into humus here which is my little again
I<00:01:51.990> haven't<00:01:52.500> used<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.159> forever<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
I haven't used this thing and forever I

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.630 
I haven't used this thing and forever I
kind<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.770> quivered<00:01:56.130> enzyme<00:01:56.430> kind

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
kind of just go for quivered enzyme kind

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.090 
kind of just go for quivered enzyme kind
of<00:01:56.729> try<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.290> zone<00:01:58.740> where

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
of try it like I was in that zone where

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.300 
of try it like I was in that zone where
I<00:01:59.579> didn't<00:02:00.299> know<00:02:00.450> what<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:01.079> doing<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.890> want

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I didn't know what I was doing so I want

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.550 
I didn't know what I was doing so I want
to<00:02:02.460> sleep<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.939> fast<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.630> before<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.320> look

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
to sleep as fast as I can before I look

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.889 
to sleep as fast as I can before I look
like<00:02:04.710> an<00:02:04.829> idiot<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.549> makes<00:02:05.790> any<00:02:05.880> sense<00:02:06.030> um

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
like an idiot if that makes any sense um

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.719 
like an idiot if that makes any sense um
so<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> guess<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:08.250> revolve<00:02:08.550> around

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so I guess that can revolve around

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.219 
so I guess that can revolve around
today's<00:02:09.119> question<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.780> question<00:02:09.959> could

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
today's question to this question could

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.199 
today's question to this question could
be<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.560> what<00:02:11.039> was<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> longest<00:02:11.670> time<00:02:11.700> period

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
be like what was the longest time period

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.990 
be like what was the longest time period
you<00:02:12.239> went<00:02:12.540> without

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you went without

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.160 
you went without

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
want to go for extreme speed because you

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.460 
want to go for extreme speed because you
know<00:04:56.090> he<00:04:56.210> still<00:04:56.390> has<00:04:56.510> that<00:04:56.600> spiritomb<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.290> I

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
look like an idiot last time I for

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.380 
look like an idiot last time I for
extreme<00:04:59.930> speed<00:05:00.230> so<00:05:01.040> uh<00:05:01.070> he's<00:05:01.850> gonna<00:05:02.000> go<00:05:02.120> back

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
extreme speed so uh he's gonna go back

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.420 
extreme speed so uh he's gonna go back
into<00:05:02.540> this<00:05:02.690> thing<00:05:02.750> I'm<00:05:03.380> just<00:05:03.860> gonna<00:05:03.980> go<00:05:04.190> for

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
into this thing I'm just gonna go for

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.960 
into this thing I'm just gonna go for
the<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.820> safe<00:05:05.090> stone<00:05:06.050> edge<00:05:06.290> or<00:05:06.590> flare<00:05:07.520> blitz<00:05:07.790> I

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
the the safe stone edge or flare blitz I

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.180 
the the safe stone edge or flare blitz I
believe<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.510> didn't<00:05:09.290> really<00:05:09.380> want<00:05:09.830> to<00:05:09.980> have

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
believe I didn't really want to have

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.580 
believe I didn't really want to have
recoil<00:05:10.790> yet<00:05:11.180> because<00:05:11.390> if<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.690> got<00:05:11.900> recoiled

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
recoil yet because if I got recoiled

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.560 
recoil yet because if I got recoiled
only<00:05:12.920> switch<00:05:13.160> I<00:05:13.340> would<00:05:13.880> only<00:05:14.000> be<00:05:14.330> able<00:05:14.450> to

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
only switch I would only be able to

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.140 
only switch I would only be able to
switch<00:05:14.780> in<00:05:14.900> a<00:05:14.990> few<00:05:15.170> more<00:05:15.290> times<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:16.000> go<00:05:17.000> for

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
switch in a few more times so go for

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.940 
switch in a few more times so go for
storage<00:05:17.480> unfortunately<00:05:18.140> for<00:05:18.260> me<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.380> hit<00:05:18.680> he

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
storage unfortunately for me I hit he

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.270 
storage unfortunately for me I hit he

year I believe in my revised version of
this<00:05:43.280> team<00:05:43.520> I<00:05:43.550> have<00:05:43.880> some<00:05:44.060> different<00:05:44.480> move

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
this team I have some different move

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.780 
this team I have some different move
sets<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.290> I<00:05:45.680> don't<00:05:46.010> use<00:05:46.220> Pharaoh<00:05:46.490> seat

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.640 
sets and I don't use Pharaoh seat
anymore<00:05:46.970> conspiracy<00:05:47.750> that's<00:05:47.870> definitely<00:05:48.470> the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
anymore conspiracy that's definitely the

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.860 
anymore conspiracy that's definitely the
weakest<00:05:48.980> link<00:05:49.220> this<00:05:49.700> team<00:05:49.970> is<00:05:50.000> way<00:05:50.300> too<00:05:50.360> fast

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
weakest link this team is way too fast

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.570 
weakest link this team is way too fast
to<00:05:51.080> have<00:05:51.200> a<00:05:51.230> pharaoh<00:05:51.560> see<00:05:51.890> just<00:05:52.160> hang<00:05:52.400> in<00:05:52.550> there

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
to have a pharaoh see just hang in there

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.940 
to have a pharaoh see just hang in there
slowing<00:05:53.090> it<00:05:53.210> down<00:05:53.240> so<00:05:54.080> I'm<00:05:54.110> I<00:05:54.590> think<00:05:54.890> I

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
slowing it down so I'm I think I

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.680 
slowing it down so I'm I think I
replaced<00:05:55.310> it<00:05:55.430> was<00:05:55.550> something<00:05:55.880> else<00:05:56.090> I'm<00:05:56.360> not

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
replaced it was something else I'm not

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.330 
replaced it was something else I'm not
really<00:05:56.870> too<00:05:57.110> sure<00:05:57.140> what<00:05:57.530> it<00:05:57.650> was<00:05:57.800> but<00:05:57.860> it's

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
really too sure what it was but it's

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.430 
really too sure what it was but it's
definitely<00:05:58.610> not<00:05:58.940> as<00:05:59.090> Pharaoh<00:05:59.270> see<00:05:59.510> um<00:05:59.750> at

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
definitely not as Pharaoh see um at

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.140 
definitely not as Pharaoh see um at
least<00:06:00.620> in<00:06:00.860> this<00:06:00.950> situation<00:06:01.280> first<00:06:01.669> he's<00:06:01.850> doing

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
least in this situation first he's doing

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.170 
least in this situation first he's doing
something<00:06:02.570> he<00:06:02.690> paralyzed<00:06:03.140> the<00:06:03.260> crowd<00:06:03.470> no<00:06:03.770> but

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
something he paralyzed the crowd no but

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.430 
something he paralyzed the crowd no but
it's<00:06:05.180> not<00:06:05.330> really<00:06:05.480> doing<00:06:05.780> much<00:06:05.900> for<00:06:06.169> me<00:06:06.260> here

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
it's not really doing much for me here

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.159 
it's not really doing much for me here
he's<00:06:07.160> gonna<00:06:07.310> go<00:06:07.490> for<00:06:07.520> rapid<00:06:08.090> spin<00:06:08.360> which<00:06:08.900> gonna

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
he's gonna go for rapid spin which gonna

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.690 
he's gonna go for rapid spin which gonna
get<00:06:09.320> rid<00:06:09.470> of<00:06:09.530> my<00:06:09.650> rocks<00:06:09.919> from<00:06:10.190> earlier<00:06:10.520> which

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
get rid of my rocks from earlier which

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.940 
get rid of my rocks from earlier which
were<00:06:10.880> kind<00:06:11.390> of<00:06:11.540> pointless<00:06:11.900> because<00:06:12.290> there<00:06:12.860> was

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
were kind of pointless because there was

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.500 
were kind of pointless because there was
really<00:06:13.100> no<00:06:13.280> point<00:06:13.490> in<00:06:13.669> sitting<00:06:13.850> my<00:06:14.090> rocks<00:06:14.360> I

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
really no point in sitting my rocks I

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.760 
really no point in sitting my rocks I
probably<00:06:14.690> should<00:06:14.870> have<00:06:14.900> exploded<00:06:15.290> or<00:06:15.560> stone

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
probably should have exploded or stone

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.260 
probably should have exploded or stone
edge<00:06:15.919> because<00:06:16.190> he<00:06:16.280> just<00:06:16.430> rabbits<00:06:16.820> pinned<00:06:17.060> them

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
edge because he just rabbits pinned them

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.630 
edge because he just rabbits pinned them
away<00:06:17.480> anyways<00:06:17.840> I<00:06:18.140> go<00:06:18.740> for<00:06:18.980> leech<00:06:19.100> seed<00:06:19.370> um

obviously<00:06:20.480> you<00:06:20.720> can<00:06:20.840> just<00:06:20.990> wrap<00:06:21.230> the<00:06:21.440> spin

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
obviously you can just wrap the spin

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.680 
obviously you can just wrap the spin
that<00:06:21.890> if<00:06:22.040> he<00:06:22.130> feels<00:06:22.400> like<00:06:22.610> it<00:06:22.760> but<00:06:23.300> he's<00:06:23.510> gonna

that if he feels like it but he's gonna

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.470 
that if he feels like it but he's gonna
