00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.940 

so<00:01:46.810> as<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.140> see<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.530> get<00:01:47.710> eight

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
so as you can see you get eight

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.130 
so as you can see you get eight
different<00:01:48.460> sizes<00:01:48.610> for<00:01:49.060> each<00:01:49.270> hand<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.049> you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
different sizes for each hand so you

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.200 
different sizes for each hand so you
will<00:01:50.439> have<00:01:50.619> numerous<00:01:51.369> choices<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:52.030> choose

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
will have numerous choices to choose

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.120 
will have numerous choices to choose
from<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:52.720> just<00:01:52.900> go<00:01:53.049> ahead<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.470> see<00:01:53.680> which<00:01:53.860> size

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
from so just go ahead and see which size

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.800 
from so just go ahead and see which size
that's<00:01:54.520> better<00:01:54.790> or<00:01:54.909> like<00:01:55.299> what<00:01:55.450> design<00:01:55.780> you

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
that's better or like what design you

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.780 
that's better or like what design you
want<00:01:56.049> on<00:01:56.200> which<00:01:56.380> nail<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.430> are<00:01:57.610> gonna

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
want on which nail and you are gonna

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.070 
want on which nail and you are gonna
have<00:01:57.970> some<00:01:58.210> left<00:01:58.420> over<00:02:00.659> then<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:01.930> want

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
have some left over then you just want

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.899 
have some left over then you just want
to<00:02:02.140> take<00:02:02.320> some<00:02:02.350> nail<00:02:02.680> polish<00:02:03.009> remover<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.580> go

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
to take some nail polish remover and go

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.249 
to take some nail polish remover and go
over<00:02:04.180> your<00:02:04.210> nails<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.750> way<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.110> don't

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
over your nails so that way you don't

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.719 
over your nails so that way you don't
have<00:02:05.380> anything<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:06.039> them<00:02:06.310> that's<00:02:06.549> gonna

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
have anything on them that's gonna

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.820 
have anything on them that's gonna
prevent<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.450> nail<00:02:08.020> wrap<00:02:08.229> from<00:02:08.410> really

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
prevent the nail wrap from really

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.630 
prevent the nail wrap from really
sticking<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.220> your<00:02:09.399> nails<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:12.220> nail<00:02:12.400> wrap

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
sticking to your nails so the nail wrap

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.790 
sticking to your nails so the nail wrap
itself<00:02:13.030> sits<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.630> between<00:02:14.019> these<00:02:14.140> two<00:02:14.440> clear

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
itself sits in between these two clear

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.890 
itself sits in between these two clear
layers<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.459> backing<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.269> I'm<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:16.660> filling

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
layers of backing so I'm just filling

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.259 
layers of backing so I'm just filling
the<00:02:17.050> first<00:02:17.260> one<00:02:17.470> off<00:02:17.650> then<00:02:18.160> pressing<00:02:18.700> down<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
the first one off then pressing down the

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.940 
the first one off then pressing down the
nail<00:02:19.450> wrap<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.930> see<00:02:20.140> where<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.410> want<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.800> and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
nail wrap to see where I want it and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.780 
nail wrap to see where I want it and
then<00:02:21.220> taking<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> second<00:02:22.390> one<00:02:22.480> off<00:02:22.630> as<00:02:22.810> well

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.550 

so<00:02:27.790> first<00:02:28.060> I'm<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.110> pressing

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
so first I'm just going in and pressing

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.350 
so first I'm just going in and pressing
the<00:02:29.650> middle<00:02:29.770> part<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.400> my<00:02:30.640> finger<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.270> then

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
the middle part with my finger and then

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.150 
the middle part with my finger and then
I'm<00:02:31.660> going<00:02:31.960> around<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.320> edges<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.830> pressing

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
I'm going around the edges and pressing

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.440 
I'm going around the edges and pressing
that<00:02:33.280> down<00:02:33.520> with<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.850> orange<00:02:34.210> stick

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.729 

so<00:02:39.450> then<00:02:39.599> you<00:02:39.780> want<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.989> take<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> nail<00:02:40.470> file

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
so then you want to take the nail file

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.399 
so then you want to take the nail file
and<00:02:41.069> file<00:02:41.610> off<00:02:41.879> in<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.299> excess<00:02:42.750> nail<00:02:42.959> wrap<00:02:43.200> up

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
and file off in the excess nail wrap up

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.830 
and file off in the excess nail wrap up
on<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> edges<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.269> use<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.599> more

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
on the edges and you can use the more

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.110 
on the edges and you can use the more
coarse<00:02:46.319> side<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.099> nail<00:02:47.220> file<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.819> this<00:02:48.060> is

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
coarse side of the nail file and this is

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.059 
coarse side of the nail file and this is
going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.480> file<00:02:48.689> off<00:02:48.959> any<00:02:49.230> excess<00:02:49.650> nail<00:02:49.829> wraps

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
going to file off any excess nail wraps

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.819 
going to file off any excess nail wraps
a<00:02:50.250> lot<00:02:50.459> faster<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.989> can<00:02:52.140> also<00:02:52.319> use<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
a lot faster but you can also use the

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.319 
a lot faster but you can also use the
smooth<00:02:53.099> side<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.879> will<00:02:54.030> kind<00:02:54.269> of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
smooth side and that will kind of

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.300 
smooth side and that will kind of
prevent<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> edges<00:02:55.260> from<00:02:55.560> peeling<00:02:55.920> later

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
prevent the edges from peeling later

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.610 
prevent the edges from peeling later
which<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:57.060> find<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:57.540> better<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.290> going

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
which I find is better but it is going

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.170 
which I find is better but it is going
to<00:02:58.709> take<00:02:58.859> a<00:02:58.890> lot<00:02:59.159> longer<00:03:01.909> here<00:03:02.909> I'm<00:03:03.000> just

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
to take a lot longer here I'm just

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.390 
to take a lot longer here I'm just
taking<00:03:03.480> off<00:03:03.599> any<00:03:03.930> excess<00:03:04.620> nail<00:03:04.890> wrap<00:03:05.099> around

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
taking off any excess nail wrap around

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.979 
taking off any excess nail wrap around
my<00:03:05.489> cuticle<00:03:05.970> area<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.510> because<00:03:06.810> my

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
my cuticle area just because my

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.140 
my cuticle area just because my
fingernails<00:03:07.590> are<00:03:07.859> so<00:03:08.159> tiny<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.730> it's<00:03:08.849> really

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
fingernails are so tiny that it's really

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.729 
fingernails are so tiny that it's really
hard<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.480> find<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.900> right<00:03:10.019> sizes<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:13.530> here

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
hard to find the right sizes now here

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.110 
hard to find the right sizes now here

like that and just paint the rest of
them<00:04:02.830> like<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.190> similar<00:04:03.670> color<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.330> nail

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.449 
them like a similar color to the nail
wrap<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:05.170> could<00:04:05.590> just<00:04:05.739> paint<00:04:05.950> all<00:04:06.129> my<00:04:06.280> nails

like pink and then put that little pink
sticker<00:04:08.470> on<00:04:08.560> my<00:04:08.650> ring<00:04:08.950> now

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.610 

and<00:04:13.420> here<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.660> wanted<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.960> show<00:04:14.050> you<00:04:14.260> guys<00:04:14.290> this

and here I wanted to show you guys this
quick<00:04:14.860> little<00:04:15.160> tip<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.580> found<00:04:15.910> that<00:04:16.090> works

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
quick little tip that I found that works

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.500 
quick little tip that I found that works
from<00:04:16.570> my<00:04:16.810> nails<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.650> do<00:04:17.769> have<00:04:18.100> gel<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.150> top<00:04:19.209> of

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
from my nails so I do have gel on top of

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.880 
from my nails so I do have gel on top of
my<00:04:19.660> own<00:04:19.810> nails<00:04:20.079> or<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.320> lot<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.470> people<00:04:20.739> always

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
my own nails or a lot of people always

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.620 
my own nails or a lot of people always
ask<00:04:21.010> if<00:04:21.430> they're<00:04:21.579> my<00:04:21.730> real<00:04:21.850> nails<00:04:22.240> they're<00:04:22.510> my

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
ask if they're my real nails they're my

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.150 
ask if they're my real nails they're my
real<00:04:22.780> nails<00:04:22.990> but<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.230> have<00:04:23.350> gel<00:04:23.620> on<00:04:23.740> top<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:24.010> them

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
real nails but I have gel on top of them

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.010 
real nails but I have gel on top of them
so<00:04:24.310> they're<00:04:24.490> really<00:04:24.790> long<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.720> tends<00:04:25.990> to

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
so they're really long and it tends to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.620 
so they're really long and it tends to
kind<00:04:26.200> of<00:04:26.290> curve<00:04:26.590> at<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.890> edge<00:04:27.040> so<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.150> found<00:04:28.480> out

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
kind of curve at the edge so I found out

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.670 
kind of curve at the edge so I found out
when<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.810> was<00:04:28.990> doing<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.260> nail<00:04:29.440> wraps

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
when I was doing the nail wraps

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.810 
when I was doing the nail wraps
sometimes<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.250> was<00:04:30.370> like<00:04:30.400> crease<00:04:30.790> just

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
sometimes it was like crease just

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.820 
sometimes it was like crease just
because<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.480> is<00:04:31.570> curved<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.200> mean<00:04:32.380> this

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
because it is curved so I mean this

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.380 
because it is curved so I mean this
isn't<00:04:33.040> applied<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.610> if<00:04:33.670> you<00:04:33.760> have<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:33.940> short

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
isn't applied to you if you have a short

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.480 
isn't applied to you if you have a short
straight<00:04:34.720> nails<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:35.530> if<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:35.830> happens<00:04:36.070> to

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
straight nails but if this happens to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.400 
straight nails but if this happens to
you<00:04:36.610> I<00:04:36.640> found<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.180> like<00:04:37.450> kind<00:04:37.690> of<00:04:37.810> pulling<00:04:38.200> on

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
you I found that like kind of pulling on

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.620 
you I found that like kind of pulling on
it<00:04:38.470> at<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.950> very<00:04:39.220> edge<00:04:39.520> like<00:04:39.880> pulling<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.330> down

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
it at the very edge like pulling it down

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.630 
it at the very edge like pulling it down
kind<00:04:41.260> of<00:04:41.380> stretching<00:04:41.860> it<00:04:41.950> will<00:04:42.130> help<00:04:42.430> with

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
kind of stretching it will help with

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.530 
kind of stretching it will help with
that<00:04:42.670> so<00:04:43.150> that's<00:04:43.420> what<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:43.660> did

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.730 

and<00:04:49.540> now<00:04:49.780> you're<00:04:49.930> done<00:04:50.230> there's<00:04:50.470> just<00:04:50.620> how

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
really cool because you can do all these

really cool because you can do all these
different<00:04:59.650> designs<00:05:00.010> and<00:05:00.340> it's<00:05:00.820> gonna<00:05:01.030> take

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
different designs and it's gonna take

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.360 
different designs and it's gonna take
you<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.420> lot<00:05:01.720> shorter<00:05:02.290> of<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.680> time<00:05:02.890> than<00:05:03.160> if<00:05:03.280> you

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
you a lot shorter of a time than if you

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.550 
you a lot shorter of a time than if you
were<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.580> paint<00:05:04.030> them<00:05:04.180> on<00:05:04.300> so<00:05:04.720> yeah<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.440> think
