00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.610
 hello at any time but that's it for 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.680
 new video so as you could 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.470
 see him on facebook or instagram 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.060
 I did I actually tested the little ones 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.869
 placemats made of polymer clay so 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.129
 there I have the effects of the webcam and on 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.930
 the tutorials that I could see was in 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.150
 low polymer so I had 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.420
 looked at several and all so funds 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.790
 quite thick and I do not like you too much 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.519
 type polymer clay tutorial placemats and you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.460
 find the same tutorial like me 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.940
 and so I tested like this 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.930
 so that's nice thing game 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.440
 what a formality is nice but 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.230
 not bad and loses so that's where 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.730
 and speak so I tested already 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.730
 firstly like that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.740
 Klasnic 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.909
 it's a step it's nice frankly 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.270
 as a result 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.039
 mip I think it's a plus 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.039
 but the result is very very beautiful 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.480
 like this so I hated 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.470
 so always with awepa but in 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.470
 much finer 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.700
 as much more transparent 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.640
 but it's not easy because 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.409
 this world so maybe it's because 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.550
 that's where I panicked 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.720
 but its size 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.720
 to exploit 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.680
 that's it 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.040
 more realistic 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.040
 all this 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.910
 to make plots would approve 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.750
 to really do it all is not huge the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.120
 difference but 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.620
 so I was asked from their farm I 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.789
 am going to want to make a myth by knowing 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.789
 that's a word had to leave everything 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.060
 so I'm going to take your cream of eight 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.550
 women 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:26.910
 and instead they use a small beep 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:29.730
 it's a little classic so you have to 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.210
 not a lot of material then already in 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.170
 all the tutorials 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.880
 what I did here says it matters 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.830
 that you have cookie cutters like 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.760
 that's very nice but I'm going 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.760
 use something else 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.890
 so already I'm going to their place at 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.030
 I will not do it with a 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.950
 punch 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.260
 I do it with 1.6 like that 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.260
 increase 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 e 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.680
 I will do my works 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680
 and father's grave 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.480
 you have 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:19.280
 something like this describe you a 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:22.760
 little bit followed there we 'll leave it on 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.760
 plastic 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.310
 and we are going to make the little words 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.870
 sweet then to make small patterns 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.970
 but it is here utensils like that 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.130
 sharp or include in the facts alone 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.130
 true competitor it works very well 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:34.510
 I'll do it anyway like that 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.980
 you can leave it's like 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.880
 son is we can find in 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.550
 baked hot bakery 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.220
 it's very pretty like that but at this 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.130
 moment there is not really a lap what 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.260
 past one after so you see them 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.360
 small effects that the chisel gives that 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.590
 really nice so after he 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.530
 should avoid having small 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.790
 spikes like that there is not knock knock 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.340
 would be better to have some things a little 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.030
 like that does the cutting of 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.560
 so that it does well 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.560
 so we will continue 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.819
 so here I made some small dots 

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:26.649
 all over I do not know if you're going 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:26.649
 see 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.319
 this is very light and it is rather 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.319
 nice comparison 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:43.760
 that's fine, and that's it 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.350
 for the little tutorial then I do not you 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.610
 not necessarily recommend taking the 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.960
 coal not why because in fact 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.460
 when you make your little c 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.889
 is vast and the dough tends to 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.620
 expand and that's so it's not 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.910
 inevitably the good dough to take I 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.860
 think that with polymer clay you 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.830
 will not be bothered so take more of the 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.910
 polymer clay 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.560
 that's what it can give with 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.790
 little cupcake on it so there are no 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.150
 not mounted short but that makes it makes 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.150
 pretty good 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.240
 so here are your little bacteria or 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.240
 things like that you can do this 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.770
 kind of small decorations so this is 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.330
 here I hope that the little video you 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.580
 please do not hesitate to subscribe to 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.960
 comment to give your opinion on the 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.110
 result I tell you so very very 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.110
 soon
