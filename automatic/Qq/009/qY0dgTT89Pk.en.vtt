00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.919 
directly in the middle of a conversation
we'd<00:02:06.280> be<00:02:06.369> having<00:02:06.549> about<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.240> movie<00:02:07.570> we<00:02:07.689> saw<00:02:07.869> on

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
we'd be having about a movie we saw on

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.949 
we'd be having about a movie we saw on
TV<00:02:08.170> last<00:02:08.350> night<00:02:09.030> no<00:02:10.030> preparation<00:02:10.750> whatsoever

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
TV last night no preparation whatsoever

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.100 
TV last night no preparation whatsoever
and<00:02:11.769> it's<00:02:11.950> just<00:02:12.459> because<00:02:12.970> well<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.080> to

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
and it's just because well I like to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.510 
and it's just because well I like to
think<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.400> because

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
think it's just because

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.340 
think it's just because
we<00:02:16.580> had<00:02:16.670> done<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.210> many<00:02:17.420> more<00:02:17.690> shows<00:02:17.960> than<00:02:18.230> they

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
we had done so many more shows than they

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.350 
we had done so many more shows than they
had<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.430> might<00:02:19.610> also<00:02:19.640> think<00:02:20.030> it's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
had but you might also think it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.350 
had but you might also think it's
because<00:02:20.720> they're<00:02:21.470> better<00:02:21.650> than<00:02:21.860> we<00:02:21.980> are

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
because they're better than we are

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.040 
because they're better than we are
I<00:02:24.430> think<00:02:25.430> either<00:02:25.700> answer<00:02:25.880> could<00:02:26.210> be<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.900> can

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
I think either answer could be you can

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.890 
I think either answer could be you can
make<00:02:27.170> an<00:02:27.320> argument<00:02:27.470> for
