00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.080
 we try to invent names and I thought 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 that it will be easier to just gash vidosik 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.789
 and continue to do so if all zashib 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.320
 all ride in this like put 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.670
 and today you are invited to speculate on 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.849
 the topic of the metro why because the metro is 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.710
 a thing that weighs so many people up 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.260
 see me i'm worried just for me 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.510
 unknown i'm worried about the most weighing thing in 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.160
 subway these people are not those cute people with 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.079
 with whom you constantly communicate and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.210

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 but in general we are whipping with you 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.969

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.160
 it is to you in the car to stand in front of you 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 and spoil the mood for the whole next 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 day 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.800

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.129

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.119

 and so every day crappy so here you are 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.220
 you're not going to touch anyone like that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.900
 you stick into the wall just polish there and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.580
 everything just to not look at anyone 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.049
 not to touch anyone at all so that everything was 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.200
 get stuck just drive from one 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.090
 station to another and then sharply raise 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.890
 her eyes notice how abruptly everything is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 begin with both eyes from you all 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 looked at you and tried 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 somehow I do n’t know learn it this damn 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.299
 very strange but nothing strange 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.869
 because here if comes to the whisk 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.060
 and the chick is cool because the chicks 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.670
 go into the car and you have the right to them 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.500
 see they enter your carriage like 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.780
 would go it didn’t sound 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.170
 it is in your car becomes before 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.229
 you and you have every right to watch 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.729
 them on the ass and not only on the face too 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.329
 you can look at many others 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.829
 places too can this be okay but we 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.689
 a bit away from the topic and here on 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.299
 the next station is deceived grandmother 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.430
 and how do you think exactly where it will be 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.320
 in the half-empty car correctly 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.330
 in front of you and she will be in front of you 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.400
 just so often Taurus about you 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.349
 bag of bags of vegetables 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.780
 no it was not a joke about old men 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.849
 just bags of vegetables and here you are 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.720
 and trying to calm yourself breaks 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.290
 between flashes of anger that is ready but in 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.239
 this moment 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.370
 the train will stop at the next station 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.430
 this transfer station is therefore all 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.439
 people go out and you feel joy but 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.390
 then comes new heaps of nations for 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.519
 squeeze and fuck you still go 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.290
 three stops to endure some 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.730
 moral of this all let's try 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.489
 take advantage of one 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.730
 ancient chinese saying of ancient 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.980
 Chinese philosopher whose name was lu 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.230
 bite-bite 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.030
 but there you just have a pause 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.060
 between words it is different 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:00.720
