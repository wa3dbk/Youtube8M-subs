okay<00:00:01.050> well<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.380> vehicle<00:00:02.090> clearly<00:00:03.090> has<00:00:03.799> bad

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
okay well this vehicle clearly has bad

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.340 
okay well this vehicle clearly has bad
steering<00:00:05.400> after<00:00:05.730> doing<00:00:06.029> just<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.600> 50,000

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
steering after doing just on the 50,000

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.000 
steering after doing just on the 50,000
miles<00:00:08.990> there's<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.260> reason<00:00:10.380> why<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.679> say<00:00:10.980> this

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
miles there's the reason why I say this

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.660 
miles there's the reason why I say this
is<00:00:11.309> because<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:12.059> turn<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.480> steering<00:00:12.840> wheel

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
is because I can turn the steering wheel

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.910 
is because I can turn the steering wheel
considerably<00:00:14.670> before<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.450> car<00:00:15.660> responds<00:00:16.199> you

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
considerably before the car responds you

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.040 
considerably before the car responds you
know<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.070> get<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.520> lot<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.880> cars<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.570> it's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
know I get this a lot of cars it's it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.019 
know I get this a lot of cars it's it's
warm<00:00:19.320> bushes<00:00:19.740> maybe<00:00:19.980> even<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.340> steering<00:00:20.760> box

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
warm bushes maybe even a steering box

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.349 
warm bushes maybe even a steering box
and<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.980> after<00:00:22.980> 50,000<00:00:23.730> miles<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.090> wouldn't

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and it's after 50,000 miles I wouldn't

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.120 
and it's after 50,000 miles I wouldn't
expect<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.779> Mercedes<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.500> behaving<00:00:25.830> like

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130
