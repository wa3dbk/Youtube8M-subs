there without worrying about bumps or
cracks<00:00:29.640> forming<00:00:30.360> around<00:00:30.480> your<00:00:30.690> borders

cracks forming around your borders

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.880 
cracks forming around your borders
because<00:00:31.170> we've<00:00:31.320> had<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.680> nightmares

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
because we've had a lot of nightmares

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.880 
because we've had a lot of nightmares
where<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:33.449> used<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.629> use<00:00:33.780> cardboard<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.589> from

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
where we used to use cardboard and from

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.369 
where we used to use cardboard and from
the<00:00:35.010> bumpy<00:00:35.249> drives<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.730> everything<00:00:36.379> but

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
the bumpy drives and everything but

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.680 
the bumpy drives and everything but
timing<00:00:37.649> got<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.190> we'd<00:00:38.760> set<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.539> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
timing got there we'd set it up and the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.259 
timing got there we'd set it up and the
border<00:00:39.960> would<00:00:40.050> separate<00:00:40.550> from<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.969> next

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
border would separate from the next

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.310 
border would separate from the next
plate<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.629> then<00:00:42.719> you'd<00:00:42.839> have<00:00:42.929> to<00:00:43.050> call<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.289> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
plate and then you'd have to call out a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.259 
plate and then you'd have to call out a
decorator<00:00:43.769> to<00:00:43.949> scrape<00:00:44.159> your<00:00:44.370> border<00:00:44.640> reboard

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
decorator to scrape your border reboard

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.849 
decorator to scrape your border reboard
ER<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.170> waste<00:00:46.319> time<00:00:46.409> in<00:00:46.679> let<00:00:46.800> me

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
ER it and then just waste time in let me

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.619 
ER it and then just waste time in let me
it<00:00:47.460> does<00:00:47.640> cost<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> little<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.300> because<00:00:48.390> you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it does cost a little more because you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.149 
it does cost a little more because you
are<00:00:48.659> using<00:00:49.019> plastic<00:00:49.199> on<00:00:49.530> plastic<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
are using plastic on plastic but it

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.619 
are using plastic on plastic but it
saves<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.489> many<00:00:50.640> problems<00:00:51.089> but<00:00:51.179> it's<00:00:51.329> worth<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
saves so many problems but it's worth it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.410 
saves so many problems but it's worth it
to<00:00:51.749> us<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.069> never<00:00:53.280> asked<00:00:54.179> you<00:00:54.269> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
to us and then we never asked you to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.079 
to us and then we never asked you to
return<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> plates<00:00:55.579> because<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
return the plates because of all the

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.239 
return the plates because of all the
grease<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.839> never<00:00:57.989> comes<00:00:58.229> off<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.739> good<00:00:59.039> as

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
grease and it never comes off as good as

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.610 
grease and it never comes off as good as
a<00:00:59.280> brand<00:00:59.789> new<00:00:59.969> plastic<00:01:00.479> plate<00:01:00.659> so<00:01:01.409> we<00:01:01.499> always

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a brand new plastic plate so we always

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.110 
a brand new plastic plate so we always
start<00:01:01.889> with<00:01:01.920> fresh<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.819> already

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
start with fresh so I already

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
start with fresh so I already
pre-measured<00:01:03.389> this<00:01:03.929> one<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.549> much

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
pre-measured this one it it's so much

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.010 
pre-measured this one it it's so much
better<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.060> since<00:01:06.180> you're<00:01:06.329> on<00:01:06.479> plastic<00:01:06.899> on

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
better but since you're on plastic on

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.969 
better but since you're on plastic on
plastic<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.829> you're<00:01:07.950> not

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
plastic because then if you're not

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.340 
plastic because then if you're not
exactly<00:01:08.340> centered<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.329> part<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.020> plastic

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
exactly centered then part your plastic

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
exactly centered then part your plastic
plate<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.619> showing<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> cause<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
plate is showing and it just can cause a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.130 
plate is showing and it just can cause a
few<00:01:13.079> problems<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:14.000> always<00:01:15.000> stab<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.899> of<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
few problems I always stab one of the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.679 
few problems I always stab one of the
marks<00:01:16.380> I've<00:01:16.560> made<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.090> kind<00:01:18.329> of<00:01:18.420> roll<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
marks I've made and kind of roll it

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.499 
marks I've made and kind of roll it
around<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:19.020> little<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.119> cut

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
around a little bit so I know to cut

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.130 
around a little bit so I know to cut
where<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.740> cake<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> icing<00:01:23.430> meet<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:25.020> use

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
where the cake and the icing meet we use

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.749 
where the cake and the icing meet we use
the<00:01:25.289> bandsaw<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> cut<00:01:25.890> through<00:01:26.159> our<00:01:26.189> plastic

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the bandsaw to cut through our plastic

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.179 
the bandsaw to cut through our plastic
once<00:01:27.630> again<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> saves<00:01:28.259> time<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> money<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
once again it saves time and money you

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:38.950 
once again it saves time and money you
just<00:01:29.789> have<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.969> be<00:01:30.060> careful<00:01:30.180> when<00:01:30.509> using<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.780 

you<00:01:39.740> always<00:01:39.890> want<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.220> use<00:01:40.430> when<00:01:40.610> you're<00:01:40.700> going

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
you always want to use when you're going

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.920 
you always want to use when you're going
through<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.119> saw<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.450> always<00:01:41.690> want<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.869> use

the pillar that you suck through as your

the pillar that you suck through as your
guide<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.810> will<00:01:44.960> be<00:01:45.080> your<00:01:45.260> closest<00:01:45.710> marker<00:01:46.220> in

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.399 
plastic shavings from the saw out of the
pillar<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:53.690> that<00:01:53.840> they<00:01:53.930> don't<00:01:54.080> go<00:01:54.229> into<00:01:54.350> your

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
pillar so that they don't go into your

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.050 
pillar so that they don't go into your
cake<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:54.890> then<00:01:55.580> you're<00:01:55.670> going<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.820> always

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
cake and then you're going to always

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.200 
cake and then you're going to always
stick<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.720> non<00:01:57.229> cut<00:01:57.590> end<00:01:57.830> into<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.820> plastic

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
stick the non cut end into the plastic

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.530 
stick the non cut end into the plastic
piece<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:01.340> then<00:02:01.490> line<00:02:01.700> up<00:02:01.729> your<00:02:01.850> marks<00:02:02.210> and

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
piece and then line up your marks and

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.370 
piece and then line up your marks and
then<00:02:03.530> because<00:02:03.860> our<00:02:04.009> case<00:02:04.280> come<00:02:04.550> out<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:05.380> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
then because our case come out of the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.830 
then because our case come out of the
cooler<00:02:06.619> before<00:02:06.860> their<00:02:07.190> ice<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:08.119> always<00:02:08.450> stab

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
cooler before their ice we always stab

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.820 
cooler before their ice we always stab
it<00:02:09.759> four<00:02:10.759> times<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.930> help<00:02:12.350> relieve<00:02:12.620> any

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
it four times to help relieve any

bubbling<00:02:13.519> outside<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.000> edge<00:02:14.150> hopefully<00:02:14.660> all

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
bubbling outside the edge hopefully all

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.979 
bubbling outside the edge hopefully all
the<00:02:14.989> air<00:02:15.080> will<00:02:15.200> escape<00:02:15.350> up<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.630> solved<00:02:17.930> a

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
the air will escape up and that solved a

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.590 
the air will escape up and that solved a
lot<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.170> issues<00:02:18.850> okay<00:02:19.850> your<00:02:20.000> corn<00:02:20.209> syrup

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
lot of issues okay your corn syrup

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
level plate and then you just want to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.050 
level plate and then you just want to
fill<00:03:08.329> in<00:03:08.540> where<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.340> little<00:03:10.549> bit<00:03:10.670> separate
