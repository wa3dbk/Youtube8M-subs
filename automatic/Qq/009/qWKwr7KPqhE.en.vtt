00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.760 
when talking with a lot of guys is
that's<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.420> one<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:34.689> we<00:01:34.780> folk<00:01:35.020> focus<00:01:35.530> on<00:01:35.680> the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
that's the one that we folk focus on the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.109 
that's the one that we folk focus on the
most<00:01:35.979> because<00:01:36.189> it<00:01:36.340> kind<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.520> makes<00:01:36.700> sense<00:01:36.880> like

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
most because it kind of makes sense like

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.370
