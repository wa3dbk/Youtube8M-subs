00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:24.679
 national national union 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:27.619
 social security workers today 8 of 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.659
 June 2015 considered sum 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.010
 importance to do the following 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:35.440
 clarification 1 before the approval of the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.989
 buds of the so-called reforms 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.870
 structural reforms for the 62nd legislature in 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.039
 the Chamber of Deputies and its overwhelming 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.170
 most 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.960
 we were promoting the vote of punishment 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.469
 to those political parties that have 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.890
 betrayed in such a way that we could 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.739
 remove them curules and make the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.039
 next legislature one more congress 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.400
 balanced otherwise the twelfth 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.590
 structural reform of the health sector 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.289
 it would start walking 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.689
 with a brutal onslaught towards this 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:16.689
 sector is to say after June 7 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.549
 they will come against us with everything 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.130
 counting on the complicity and 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.659
 collusion of the union itself 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 national insurance workers 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.460
 social 2 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.970
 in the audio of the technical advice that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.619
 appears on youtube with the audio 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.070
 of infamy in the voice of daniel karam 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.590
 then director of links is heard 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.340
 one of the solutions that I propose is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 liquidate massively all 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.590
 active workers of the institute 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.800
 Mexican Social Security we pay them 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.369
 your retirement and we hire you again 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.759
 but no longer with a retirement scheme but with 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.259
 Through afores this will come out more 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.840
 cheap 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.810
 Dr. Valdemar agrees with 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.080
 this textually 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.360
 so almost two months ago I arrive 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.739
 general of zone number 68 where they are 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.519
 is asking for the file of all the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.209
 workers, that would start that 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.430
 pilot plan I leave this information to your 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.420
 consideration 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.569
 3 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.349
 in defense of the social security of 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.050
 right to health from the rejection of the 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.319
 privatization of the sector and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.140
 homologation of pensions in defense 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.540
 of our collective contract 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.810
 benefits heritage and source of 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.350
 work we must take all the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.459
 legal actions within our reach and not 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.650
 it's not through a national strike 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.459
 we work with people with 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.760
 human beings we take care of lives and 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.519
 we can not and must not do so 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.790
 it is very clear we can not leave in the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.629
 abandonment to our patients 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.859
 4 before the growing demand of the base 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.680
 worker because of the loss of confidence 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:31.040
 lying lie and or silence with that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.840
 the national executive committee is conducted 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.519
 of the national workers' union 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.769
 of social security this the union 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.519

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.379
 to any political party that does not 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.400
 distort in our goal our 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.280

 and dissident in the foot of dissident struggle 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.350
 it means is an adjective that says that 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.850
 decides that it is contrary to 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:45.360
 determined opinion belief doctrine u 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.690
 organization and of course I 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.950
 show contrary to the doctrine and way 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.350
 that the executive committee has followed 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.470
 national trade union of 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.870
 social security workers 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.390
