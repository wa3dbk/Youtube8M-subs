about<00:01:10.320> his<00:01:10.440> start<00:01:10.680> ties<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.570> power<00:01:12.570> cord

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
about his start ties a power cord

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.270 
about his start ties a power cord
I<00:01:14.270> think<00:01:14.870> if<00:01:14.990> he<00:01:15.110> improves<00:01:15.470> skin<00:01:15.740> even<00:01:15.950> he's

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
I think if he improves skin even he's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.190 
I think if he improves skin even he's
got<00:01:16.430> potential<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:17.510> obviously<00:01:17.840> off<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.170> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
got potential it's obviously off to a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.440 
got potential it's obviously off to a
good<00:01:18.350> start<00:01:18.460> but<00:01:19.460> i<00:01:19.520> think<00:01:19.760> you<00:01:20.240> know<00:01:20.270> we're

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450
