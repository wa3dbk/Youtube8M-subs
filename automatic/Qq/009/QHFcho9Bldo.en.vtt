00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
model cars and a really small

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.710 
model cars and a really small
it's<00:01:51.380> really<00:01:51.740> impressive<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.760> it's<00:01:53.540> not

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
it's really impressive and it's not

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.870 
it's really impressive and it's not
explainable<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.500> couldn't<00:01:54.860> never<00:01:55.220> imagine

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
explainable I couldn't never imagine

what<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.090> was<00:01:56.180> like<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.840> was<00:01:56.960> pretty<00:01:57.200> good

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
what it was like so it was pretty good

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.770 
what it was like so it was pretty good
it's<00:01:58.010> so<00:01:58.190> fast<00:01:58.490> man<00:01:58.760> we're<00:01:59.210> going<00:01:59.360> close<00:01:59.660> to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
it's so fast man we're going close to

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.240 
200 miles an hour brunch straight so
surprisingly<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.170> looks<00:02:03.410> fast<00:02:03.680> outside<00:02:04.100> the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
like there's any grip there and then you

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.050 
like there's any grip there and then you
try<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.040> push<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> little<00:02:13.370> bit<00:02:13.640> you're<00:02:13.820> right

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
realizes a lot more than you think you

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.680 
realizes a lot more than you think you
know<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.340> shock<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.760> systems<00:02:17.150> but<00:02:17.300> I

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
know it's a shock to the systems but I

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.570 
know it's a shock to the systems but I
quite<00:02:18.170> enjoyed<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.770> then<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:18.980> did<00:02:19.100> long<00:02:19.340> to

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
quite enjoyed it and then we did long to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.550 
quite enjoyed it and then we did long to
our<00:02:19.730> change<00:02:20.000> kind<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.050> went<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.230> wrong<00:02:21.350> way<00:02:21.410> to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
our change kind of went the wrong way to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.140 
our change kind of went the wrong way to
the<00:02:21.770> second<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.340> was<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.580> bit<00:02:22.910> more

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
the second one was a bit more

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.120 
the second one was a bit more
nerve-racking<00:02:23.660> than<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.900> first<00:02:24.320> run<00:02:24.530> it's

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
nerve-racking than the first run it's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.890 
nerve-racking than the first run it's
good<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.340> experience<00:02:25.460> how<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> car<00:02:26.360> moves

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
good to experience how the car moves

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.260 
good to experience how the car moves
around<00:02:27.140> on<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:28.130> road<00:02:28.490> course<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:29.060> lot
