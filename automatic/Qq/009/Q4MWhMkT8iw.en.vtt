00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.289
 I think thibault would want to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.210
 to see what it can bring to life 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.410
 the shadow is signed between the points of which 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.210
 they will quickly restore confidence 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.759
 in mix but want to get in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.590
 situation to make the stage and do the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.390
 race and will not be held anymore 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.269
 to be in the same situation we undergo 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.030
 suddenly we suffer we want to become again 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:46.350
 actor of what is happening on the tour 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.850
 So that's a little dirty 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.180
 global I think she had to have they 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180
 go with 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.350
 at that time we all understood thibaut 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.000
 pinot will lose a lot of time the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.440
 Most French, anyway 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.720
 those who were close to the podium the year 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.360
 past and in a general way every 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 favorites within the fdj in the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.040
 preparation for this first step of 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.590
 Mountain 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 we did not want to imagine a 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 such a medium scenario we all met 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.950
 we broadcast from the first week of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.930
 negatives of the positives and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.030
 we remobilized for the steps that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.100
 arrive and thibaut still ambition 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.170
 for the steps 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.010
 there are no worries today it is 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.830
 felt pretty good so 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.360
 we helped a little bit the movistar to the 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.750
 close to the collar also to get back 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.300
 in front to be able to protect thibault at 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.970
 better after the race was done in 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.130
 the last pass is this particular too 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.640
 this is the first pass of the tour c 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.030
 directly an arrival at the summit there are 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.200
 big damage and it's heat for 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.490
 obvious in drawing the conclusions not 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.549
 more even if in which have crushed the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.649
 race david and had to wait for a 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.710
 fifty kilometers see if all 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.060
 was in order 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.119
 the young or bronchitis after 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.080
 fifty kilometers he smelled well he 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.399
 felt he had good people 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.020
 minimal and we can try 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.100
 we can try tables that's why 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.730
 that we bring principle is a little to the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.860
 pursuit but hey when he arrived 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.360
 at the foot after 1 km he has it is fast 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.220
 back to reality but not people 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 continues we wanted to see where we are and 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.530
 today we have seen we are far from 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.260
 account 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.530
 very far from the account now we're going 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.890
 go in the breakaways 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.000
 we'll see there are still ten days 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.200
 but now, please make some predictions 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.940
 it's a bit difficult for each movement 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.980
 morning we had made it his summer 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.360
 at the stage the goals but could not 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.580
 to hold them we were quickly brought back to the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.560
 reality well ben that going back 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.420
 behind the finish line to his bus 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.120
 the first words of thibaut pinot 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.400
 to express only helplessness 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.989
 the Franche Comtois postponed 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.940
 much later maybe even in 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.730
 the alps his ambitions for this ride 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.489
 2015 on 150 terminals I really had to 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.410
 good legs I was happy so 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.640
 So here I am, the team wants me 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.810
 motivated to ride we were going to 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.280
 we participate in the race 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.590
 not suffer the race we did in 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.230
 first week 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.540
 but here I am at the foot of 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.590
 the more one goes up to 200 g mr makes a point 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.780
 side after two edges after 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.120
 two kilometers so a failure to the 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.909
 pedal it's clear it's over 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.140
 I do not have legs I hope to recover 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.580
 my legs in the third week but 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.940
 in the Pyrenees I can find my 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.650
 legs 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.060
 last year that's for sure 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.140
 years and years like who are 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.640
 that's how we did it 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.060
 beautiful season until then and we arrive on 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.470
 the tour mary sue the tour we are not at 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.920
 our level and that's the sport 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.920
 it's like that
