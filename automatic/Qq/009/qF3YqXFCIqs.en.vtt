00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.560 
whole bunch of regrets
I<00:04:14.330> once<00:04:15.330> owned<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.690> mirror<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:17.389> bought<00:04:18.389> it<00:04:18.479> for

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
I once owned a mirror I bought it for

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.629 
I once owned a mirror I bought it for
32,000<00:04:19.410> pounds<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.040> needed<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> lot<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.519> work

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
32,000 pounds and needed a lot of work

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.780 
32,000 pounds and needed a lot of work
the<00:04:21.449> car<00:04:21.690> was<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> bit<00:04:22.079> rusty<00:04:22.470> but<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.490> was<00:04:23.610> all

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
the car was a bit rusty but it was all

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.719 
the car was a bit rusty but it was all
that<00:04:24.000> sold<00:04:24.540> it<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.780> Swedish<00:04:24.870> guy<00:04:25.530> for<00:04:25.919> 38,000

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
that sold it to a Swedish guy for 38,000

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.980 
that sold it to a Swedish guy for 38,000
pounds<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.120> thought<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.360> did<00:04:27.570> really<00:04:27.780> well

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
pounds and I thought I did really well

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.260 
pounds and I thought I did really well
and<00:04:28.199> today<00:04:28.530> had<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.340> restored<00:04:29.910> them<00:04:30.060> your<00:04:30.240> other

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
and today had I restored them your other

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.210 
and today had I restored them your other
than<00:04:30.780> restoring<00:04:31.080> one<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.470> these<00:04:31.590> other<00:04:31.830> cars

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
than restoring one of these other cars

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.189 
than restoring one of these other cars
I've<00:04:32.490> been<00:04:33.090> looking<00:04:33.389> down<00:04:33.419> the<00:04:33.720> profit<00:04:34.080> of

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
I've been looking down the profit of

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.650 
I've been looking down the profit of
approximately<00:04:34.290> half<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.130> million<00:04:35.460> pounds<00:04:35.660> and

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
approximately half a million pounds and

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.600 
approximately half a million pounds and
I<00:04:36.870> never<00:04:37.139> took<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:37.830> thought<00:04:38.010> yeah<00:04:38.250> okay

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
I never took that just thought yeah okay

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.340 
I never took that just thought yeah okay
I'll<00:04:38.760> get<00:04:38.970> another<00:04:39.090> one<00:04:39.330> and<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.720> solve<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.139> and

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
I'll get another one and I solve it and

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.530 
I'll get another one and I solve it and
never<00:04:41.100> found<00:04:41.340> one<00:04:41.580> so<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.910> newer<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.300> one<00:04:42.449> of

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
never found one so the newer is one of

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.900 
never found one so the newer is one of
the<00:04:42.630> biggest<00:04:42.810> regrets<00:04:43.229> I've<00:04:43.380> ever<00:04:43.530> had<00:04:43.740> in<00:04:44.040> my

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
about it at 10 I try not to think about

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.090 
about it at 10 I try not to think about
it<00:04:51.630> because<00:04:51.750> if<00:04:52.050> I<00:04:52.169> think<00:04:52.229> about<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.919> kind

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100
