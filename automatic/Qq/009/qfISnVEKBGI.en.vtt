00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.580
 2 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.930
 8th 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.079
 at the stand of ca the of the Vils 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.009
 was also the Finnish manufacturer Murdochs 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.069
 grown to see a GC 240 drain in front of one or two arms in action 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.159
 This is 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.800
 What 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 This is 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.599
 v 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.599
 Finally, the features of the 1 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.289
 yes who a frame and they device 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:38.390
 from Finland 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 Percent of Nowak's brand has that and she's talked about overdrawn base 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.480
 is there to bring frames well into the earth vibrating or closing 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.860
 pull to remove 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.780
 that has created percent 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.000
 the big difference to all the others besides 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.469
 it has a string handle that is percent 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.440
 The arms can be ripened well on the side 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.740
 the excited percent is attached to the excavator like any other component 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.010
 that's like a spoon like a door camera like a pair of scissors 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 by means of either firmly rooted or quick-change system 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.079
 that works for all systems that is 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.230
 Basically, any commercially available dolly excavator 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.050
 The device will work with it the only requirement is the excavator 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.900
 must have a hammer attachment because we work on the hammer there 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.910
 that allows that with this device 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.540
 the RAM can be easily recorded directly 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.370
 without it before 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.530
 must strike and enjoyment 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.670
 the driver can see him at the Goodbye Gaal on pipe or sheet piles or girders 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.130
 pick up directly from the earth 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.210
 and a vibrate 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.470
 the whole thing is electronically controlled 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.610
 because the driver serve 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.930
 Percent angle 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.910
 That did not recognize good from the cabin and also not whether he was straight 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.210
 we have a computer for it, which takes over 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.950
 Angle sensors that detect the geometry 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.300
 and allow the excavator basically by itself the pipe 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.569
 or the carrier brings in the driver only needs to feed 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.060
 We have machines of different sizes for excavators from 15 tons up to 40 tons 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.339
 and there are two different series one that we see here now 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.359
 with and light shaped arms for missing and wearer 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.319
 from press office cm to about 60 centimeters in diameter 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.639
 and a machine that gives the percent to sheet piles and sluggish from 1 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:35.579
 The implements of this machine are very widely scattered once in the classic 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.149
 Spezialtiefbau where simply sheet piling or support for excavation pit securing 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.699
 be introduced 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:42.919
 in the foundation 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.079
 Pipes or beams as foundation 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.469
 or very many hydraulic engineering 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.910
 Viol with this device in further 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.159
 Distance to the excavator tore the ball 7 to 9 meters from the excavator 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.729
 Pinger can be introduced 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.549
 mka 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.209
 here 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.209
 Dr 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.900
 on the air around the clock 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.600
 like the Wii 2 and Euro in front of 24 points the woman
