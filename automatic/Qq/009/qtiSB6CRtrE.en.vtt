00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.500
 details of tournament coverage 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.440

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.810
 the decree of two days of national mourning 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.720
 let's show them the barracks area 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.880
 in which fire occurs there what 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.860
 we are seeing marked on the street 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.619
 azara pass to 1,245 is the address all 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.020
 is to all that apple is covered by 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.189
 what was this deposit the street 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.950
 rocha also street regiment by 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.649
 behind the barracks area in which 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.210
 this fire happens that we are 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.119
 working live in the place told us 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 Laura, at this time, the fire 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.560
 is controlled is still being searched 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.890
 because there is a suspicion that it could 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.990
 there are two people who have not yet 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.130
 been found is full barracks very 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.890
 also close to the mouth an area where 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.289
 is between mixed houses 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.869
 individuals and also deposits and 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.759
 factories as well told us laura mayo 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.500
 I remove this industrial cord that with the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.500
 the passage of time has been transforming 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.470
 but there were these old deposits that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.709
 we calculate will have approximately no 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.929
 less than 100 years at least they are 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.179
 so from its construction we go on 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.709
 I live once again with laura's work 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.140
 May what is happening at this moment 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.689
 laura propped up some of the other 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.829
 walls of the place needed to do it or 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.829
 that decision was not made 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 if you are looking at the image, look at this 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.959
 great tree that is really close to 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.519
 this metal structure and also this 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.260
 wall that one does not really know what they're going 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.599
 to do now if you are going to stand 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.510
 if they are going to prop it up or if really 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.400
 they will have to shoot down to be able to 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.220
 enter more quickly and enter 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.650
 air told us inside and so 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.390
 without the need or without the risk of 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.939
 rekindle the fire remember that the air 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.480
 rekindle the fire to enter with a 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:44.389
 optical vision much more amplified this 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.970
 tree is burning in flames again 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.379
 turn it off it turns on again turn it off 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.810
 with which we say that in its magnitude 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.200
 superior fire is controlled but 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.629
 As there are always fires, there are 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.150
 spotlights with flames with flare lagoons 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.959
 who are working from land we see 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.390
 this great 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.359
 fire engine of patricians and 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.790
 that big crane that is working 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:14.469
 from above on the outside of this great 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.510
 warehouse that locates all this apple that 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.760
 you were looking at the map and 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.799
 I clarify that of course to be located 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.140
 geographically they cut the avenue 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.879
 patricians because the patrician avenue 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.620
 is behind everything you are 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.049
 seeing here the patricians avenue is the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.139
 that separates the porteño neighborhood from barracas 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.750
 from the Buenos Aires neighborhood of the mouth 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.579
 we are usually in the heart in 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.040
 the heart of the mouth and the heart of 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.689
 barracas we say as always the old 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.840
 industrial cord guys where also 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:48.730
 there are a lot of houses of 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.790
 staple wood veneer cardboard 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.069
 also that make a beautiful postcard 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.409
 to be painted and photographed but that 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.329
 to the work of the fires at the time of 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.760
 the fires all that tradition all 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.560
 that story to which I appeal every time 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.720
 that I can turn against us because 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.870
 because they are materials that are lit 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.989
 fire in minute 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.909
 which often does not give time to 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.890
 the volunteer firefighters of the mouth and 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.799
 also barracks and patricians for 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.449
 arrive on time in the embrace we say the 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.519
 street patricio the avenue sorry 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.669
 patricians is totally cut off because 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.949
 because there's a fast corridor there 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.780
 that they enter and so that they leave 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.790
 only the ambulances but also 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.220
 the fire trucks and also the 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.710
 hydrant trucks of the federal police 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.139
 who have worked together 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.930
 all these forces from the first 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.840
 morning hours more than 30 ambulances 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.940
 from the same circling permanently 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.550
 for these apples and hosted here in 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.720
 the margins of the streets that cut 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.740
 this street quinquela martín and the young 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.050
 son bill is no longer where we are 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.330
 bet we only average 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.280
 block with already presented the police 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.050
 federal so that the neighbors do not 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.220
 move so that people do not pass a 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.830
 side of the other especially so that 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.960
 we the members of the press do not 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.160
 advance on the focus of work that 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.710
 is being carried forward and that you 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.450
 are not seeing now in the air laura 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.289
 if you like we are going to review information 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.539
 I was giving 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.759
 respect to injured people are 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.539
 seven were moved by the same 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.710
 all of them five to the hospital argerich 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.619
 two were transferred to the hospital 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.960
 churruca also a person was 

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:29.180
 transferred to the penna hospital and the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.659
 seventh person to the hospital bouquets mejía 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.479
 that is there a little lower on the 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.099
 mexico street also there very close to 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.270
 barracks that were the hospitals to the 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.309
 that people were derived 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.619
 wounds are seven some of them 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:44.749
 they were in serious condition information by 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:46.099
 Of course it is useful at this time 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:48.469
 once for the relatives of any of the 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.059
 people who suffered injuries in this 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.979
 they say clearly the attention is on 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.809
 now in the seven injured seven 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.119
 people who are fighting for their lives 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:58.159
 they have confirmed it in the last hours 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:06:00.740
 including Alberto growing and we saw him 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.990
 very dismayed throughout this 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.990
 tomorrow because of course they are 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.270
 teammates of the teams of 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.379
 rescue they work in the city they 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.749
 makes police firefighters 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.449
 federal government as the guards of 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:15.499
 government of the city ​​of buenos aires- and 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.660
 pointed out growing and that most 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:20.800
 has polytrauma 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.860
 and they are fighting for their lives and you have to 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.290
 say also that two of the victims 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.650
 fatal died from injuries 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.830
 caused in the barracks depot in 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.540
 noon and seven hours are 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.880
 fighting for his clear life and what he 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.190
 suppose it's also that there could be two 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.470
 people who will function as firefighters 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.790
 private firefighters who worked in this 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.410
 place just for what he explained 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.230
 just our partner is not what it is 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.780
 of highly flammable material and by 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.910
 there they had that guard that should 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.230
 have it a place like this we 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.570
 let's share a new pause 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.690
 we are alive in this tragic fire 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.910
 in barracks day of national mourning for the 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.570
 death of nine people in following 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.570
 we're back
