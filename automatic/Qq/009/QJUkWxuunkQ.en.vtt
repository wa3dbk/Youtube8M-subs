 You must have a ace up his sleeve 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.450
 we could say it like that which we jump 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.140
 here and we collide, nothing happens because 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.620
 is that I am indestructible in truth I am 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.890
