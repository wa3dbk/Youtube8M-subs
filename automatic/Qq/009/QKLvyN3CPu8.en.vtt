quiet<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:12.930> that's<00:01:13.290> probably<00:01:13.439> why<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.680> wasn't

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
quiet a so that's probably why it wasn't

quiet a so that's probably why it wasn't
selling<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.369> maybe<00:01:14.670> something<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> don't

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
edition collection and it was quite

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
edition collection and it was quite

one<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.740> looks<00:04:23.070> may<00:04:23.370> look<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.610> little<00:04:23.639> bit

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
one is it looks may look a little bit

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.610 
one is it looks may look a little bit
more<00:04:24.030> expensive<00:04:24.330> because<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.930> has<00:04:25.020> red<00:04:25.259> lines

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
more expensive because it has red lines

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.710 
more expensive because it has red lines
down<00:04:26.009> it<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:26.699> not<00:04:26.789> your<00:04:26.970> basic<00:04:27.330> jersey

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720

down it so it's not your basic jersey
material<00:04:27.840> either<00:04:28.289> it's<00:04:28.770> just<00:04:28.949> it<00:04:29.070> just<00:04:29.160> looks

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
material either it's just it just looks

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.070 
material either it's just it just looks
a<00:04:29.460> little<00:04:29.580> bit<00:04:29.759> more<00:04:29.880> expensive<00:04:30.270> than<00:04:31.020> the

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
a little bit more expensive than the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.990 
a little bit more expensive than the
usual<00:04:31.410> ones<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.740> get<00:04:31.919> from<00:04:31.979> there<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.580> thought

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
usual ones you get from there I thought

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.430 
usual ones you get from there I thought
