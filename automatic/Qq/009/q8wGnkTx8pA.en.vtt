00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.450
 I bring skill the thing gets intense 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.750
 I nailed it to three and I do not know what 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.059
 after that the other side is 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.820

 Teasing because practicing what I hate 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.149

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.640
 organism try it in your mind do not you 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.739
 feel is not coherent you are simply 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.090
 outstanding but independent why 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.130
 that farewell I'm going to leave you are 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.760
 instrumental do not confuse racism with 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.760
 Social Darwinism 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.920
 where it can only find no 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.380
 you can win the unicaja that happens so 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.320
 You already look at me when you're losing 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.979
 begins to fill go to the track 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.350
 while not with the title you remember 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.050
 then there is a difference with styles 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.390
 trees you know what punctuality does not values 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.040
 your values things have happened are not 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.530
 fuller so you fulera come with you 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.660
 exalted state children would come 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.399
 Surprising what he is doing that does not happen 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.200
 nothing if you are bitter right now 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.580
 that's why the signature is left you are 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.080
 a couple of clowns for the client not 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.130
 compare creatives noticing a dog 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.899
 chusco with pension mounted on pieces 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.820
 I understood the pieces 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.039
 since it happens normal I bring style is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.700
 obvious hit this I dream to be with 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.700
 Unicorn 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.720
 first I was jumping it sprouts me with 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.130
 roses expollection miseries consider if what 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.130
 only one who listens to all the police 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.080
 Hahaha 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.310
 I thought it only costs to do it because it's 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.310
 a world there are no sheep 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.480
 I become that's why he has a 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.130
 very good style you know I'm going to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.860
 focus it as you know your dreams if 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.960
 we were there to look for it 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.940
 here it is a clown in his 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.130
 sentence this recorded a hug 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.170
 controversial couples but not the 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.810
 You can not humiliate with me because 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.730
 you have nightmares and get inside no 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.070
 you can as is the monologue of the day of 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.140
 both I am the psychologist then the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.660
 I'm really I have children going to 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.670
 do if on top of your ignorance he 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.210
 get into the freddy super nightmares 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.180
 but ends up worse than Jason in his childhood 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.640
 he says he killed he sells not only in the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.410
 shadow of murder so I do it to 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.060
 every time there are no traces that in 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.900
 stars the stars you do not see yourself in the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.900
 mirror is narrating 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.780
 in the time 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.040
 twenty-one 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.870
 the truth are the reasons for the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.240
 sones improvisations is not about the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.400
 aspirations head everything as if the 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.840
 actions not of emotions as you know 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.700
 that to all its fat simply of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.350
 Tunisia firm scale in the channel 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.400
 revolution is going to speak to me artist that 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.100
 is the current government has to 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.709
 system will implant in talking about 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.610
 revolution of the heart and a moment 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.610
 before then think 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.340
 all contemporaries the difference is 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.680
 they represent two rungs then to your 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.519
 time what you say youth because 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.430
 they are our apprentices that is wrong 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.430
 the year but you went on the air and 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.560
 surface that you can scale with your 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.590
 own inks your life you are going to tie 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.209
 predicted the day he deposits in singing 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.160
 it is understood that this rhythm is also 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.110
 is with metaphors because at night 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.739
 they're going to go out and talk about the love 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.739
 surface 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.230
 and although mathematics does not cling 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.190
 underground the days on earth 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.470
 at the time I got the feelings 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.750
 let's be sad, powder is one of his 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.710
 experiences do not want to plant your 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.900
