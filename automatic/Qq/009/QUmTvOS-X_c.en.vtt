00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
first instrument that I opened up is a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.990 
first instrument that I opened up is a
what<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:09.929> was<00:00:10.500> inspired<00:00:11.219> from<00:00:11.340> Mayan

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
what it's was inspired from Mayan

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.789 
what it's was inspired from Mayan
instruments<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.690> pre-columbian<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.679> an

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
instruments in pre-columbian it's an

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.260 
instruments in pre-columbian it's an
offset<00:00:14.509> instrument<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.460> as<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.760> see<00:00:17.789> it

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
offset instrument and as you can see it

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420 
offset instrument and as you can see it
has<00:00:18.300> two<00:00:18.690> different<00:00:18.869> chambers<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.800> right<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
has two different chambers a right and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.840 
has two different chambers a right and
left<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.590> it's<00:00:22.590> cross<00:00:22.859> harmonizing<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
left and it's cross harmonizing the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.759 
left and it's cross harmonizing the
notes<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.900> basically<00:00:25.519> demonstrate<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.769> try

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
notes so basically demonstrate and try

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.370 
notes so basically demonstrate and try
to<00:00:28.830> talk<00:00:29.070> at<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> same<00:00:29.369> time<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.199> play

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
to talk at the same time so if you play

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.600 
to talk at the same time so if you play
the<00:00:31.500> right<00:00:31.619> chamber<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.040> tone<00:00:35.340> on

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the right chamber you get that tone on

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.799 
the right chamber you get that tone on
the<00:00:36.000> left<00:00:36.210> side<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.860> those<00:00:44.040> two

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
the left side so you have those two

00:00:44.809 --> 00:01:14.520 
the left side so you have those two
counter<00:00:45.809> tones<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.520> together<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.300> go

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.810 

so<00:01:15.530> that's<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.890> sound<00:01:16.100> of<00:01:16.340> this<00:01:16.490> particular

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
so that's the sound of this particular

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:36.149 
so that's the sound of this particular
instrument

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.399 

you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.870 

I

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.800 

you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.050 

you

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:11.430 

you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.680 

and<00:02:12.440> that's<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.190> sample<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.300> triple

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and that's the sample of the triple

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.230 
and that's the sample of the triple
flute
