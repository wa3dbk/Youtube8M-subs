00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:50.869 
your first car right exactly I got to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:52.600 
your first car right exactly I got to
keep<00:00:51.049> used<00:00:51.350> it's<00:00:51.799> got<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:51.949> few<00:00:52.159> years<00:00:52.250> and

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
keep used it's got a few years and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.549 
keep used it's got a few years and
that's<00:00:52.820> bad<00:00:53.089> but<00:00:53.540> it<00:00:53.659> still<00:00:53.869> drives<00:00:54.049> that's

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
that's bad but it still drives that's

that's bad but it still drives that's
the<00:00:54.769> main<00:00:54.949> thing<00:00:55.269> you<00:00:56.269> span<00:00:56.570> is<00:00:56.720> usually<00:00:57.140> the

the main thing you span is usually the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.009 
the main thing you span is usually the
case<00:00:57.530> forecast<00:00:58.250> pain<00:00:58.850> has<00:00:59.059> not<00:00:59.089> come<00:00:59.629> off<00:00:59.750> yet

case forecast pain has not come off yet

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.840 
case forecast pain has not come off yet
but<00:01:00.259> it's<00:01:00.439> also<00:01:00.710> not<00:01:01.009> nice<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.580> look<00:01:01.670> at

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
but it's also not nice to look at
