00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.420
 and again, state holding idea could blindfold 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.720
 what does it help 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.559
 after the card etc 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.539
 By the way, percent to and Profumo managers stand 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.759
 I thought again and again Deuce what comes up and I like that 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.789
 have supported so far 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.079
 okay 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.079
 10 Chechens per cent 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.189
 that worried us 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.520
 actually with two sparkling clean 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.750
 possible 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.980
 Although I only want to stand in the rain, I want nothing written 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 deleted for over old YouTube Strutz Hagenow 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.030
 it is movement 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.060
 I have been charged by Ko Klitschko 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.740
 There are really "Cordless places" made by me 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.780
 yes, yes 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.800
 Nobody has Marcel Cordes 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.010
 no idea Rome 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.040
 "Maybe the game was not quite as perfect for the other one 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
 Crysis 2 it seems possible in the important games 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.090
 former Marko tribe Tuszik more 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.140
 You are tall 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.840
 The game dictates that I used to shake open mind too 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 in the end, they would quickly come back 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460
 there you can still hear a lot 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.990
 now swimming in the way 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.270
 Therefore, the management also feels what they really are 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.869
 Bernese master is made 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:15.779
 I figured 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:20.249
 it could be something on bin Laden's Pokemon Ranger that's gonna be adventure after all 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.719
 he play through Walldorf 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.789
 Appelt and provider 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.789
 plays berth 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.309
 Pablo Casals and timeless 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.569
 He thinks so 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.569
 Klopp this is Vogts 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.829
 otherwise the only portable version 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.149
 I have to say already 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.729
 February 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.729
 except for the final 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.249
 and the conspiracy 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.169
 really can not quite understand 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.699
 Effect also refer to the SV and costs 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:10.859
 can not do anything 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.859
 although Cisco to the team and for me 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.539
 Game day should be 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.379
 I was a bit confused 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.809
 parried 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.309
 I am the best 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.299
 which, of course, anyway 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.299
 currently just what the 50th 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:54.309
 Asmussens full again 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:56.939
 Server man 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.939
 except a quotation for the result 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:05.089
 Tim Pflacke need 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.409
 here and this percent 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.599
 for the Porsche bands among you 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.599
 50 this track and injured 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.699
 still limited use 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.699
 he had to emphasize 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:24.490
 Commander the fortunes before 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.590
 Marc Gabriel player and you 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.590
 were allowed too 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.569
 to strengthen a crew there 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.569
 and taken over by Trier 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.999
 Katie represented even more 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.759
 I am sure that the fight will be 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.159
 from the 84th 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.159
 anyway in the harbor at 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.539
 There were very many at the point to enjoy Red 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.409
 Politicians to play and get through 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.740
 Of course, taking a long time can sometimes be hiring 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.879
 they are that 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.710
 with four routes each 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.710
 Has 32 routes 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.169
 fifty hundred Kuegler 50 pence 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.059
 when I'm so WEEKLY 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:30.830
 firmly the whole time 4 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.800
 32 times 4 routes 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.280
 that is, if I did not demand rags from the Rovers and the whole body 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.749
 on 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.800
 and then all those races until 7 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.680
 nocturnal escapades relationships 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.889
 did not have to complete 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.729
 evil of the game really 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.169
 and found opposition to many others 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.169
 concerned Marpert 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.680
 Bader owns the brand image of the smallest scope of play 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.580
 it is often still common here 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.580
 Wow 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:13.590
 quiet 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.599
 the chip-title ambitions
