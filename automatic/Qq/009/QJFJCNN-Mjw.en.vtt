00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
did such a you can call the big step or

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.110 
did such a you can call the big step or
not<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.590> he<00:00:37.590> hasn't<00:00:37.800> been<00:00:38.280> back<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.670> tour<00:00:38.879> in

not but he hasn't been back on tour in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.380 
not but he hasn't been back on tour in
15<00:00:39.510> years<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.219> he<00:00:41.219> needed<00:00:41.640> some<00:00:41.850> time<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.090> think

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
15 years so he needed some time to think

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
15 years so he needed some time to think
about<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> especially<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
about it and especially I think the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010 
about it and especially I think the
practice<00:00:44.700> week<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> good<00:00:45.360> idea<00:00:45.480> from<00:00:45.870> both

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
practice week was a good idea from both

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.250 
practice week was a good idea from both
of<00:00:46.050> us<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.730> how<00:00:47.760> he<00:00:47.940> got<00:00:48.149> along<00:00:48.329> with

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
of us and just see how he got along with

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.900 
of us and just see how he got along with
everybody<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:49.950> wasn't<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.250> problem<00:00:50.460> which

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
everybody and it wasn't a problem which

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.840 
everybody and it wasn't a problem which
I'm<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.149> surprised<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> thought<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.430> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
I'm not surprised so I thought if I you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
I'm not surprised so I thought if I you
know<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.660> could<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> few<00:00:55.140> weeks

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
know if you could do a few weeks

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
know if you could do a few weeks
together<00:00:55.739> throughout<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.280> year<00:00:56.520> maybe<00:00:56.879> 10

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
together throughout the year maybe 10

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.900 
together throughout the year maybe 10
maybe<00:00:57.390> 12<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:58.559> could<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.859> something<00:00:59.309> fresh

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
maybe 12 they could be something fresh

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
maybe 12 they could be something fresh
something<00:00:59.940> new<00:01:01.609> inspiring<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.090> him<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.290> know

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
something new inspiring and him you know

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410 
something new inspiring and him you know
being<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> legend<00:01:05.070> he<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.090> someone<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
team and like that I think we can build
on<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.760> how<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.570> goes<00:01:15.840> in

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
on that and then see how it goes in

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.719

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.740 
I've tried many things so we can debate
you<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:47.009> 7lu<00:01:47.670> team<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.939> coach<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.479> him

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you know with 7lu team I coach and him

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.630 
you know with 7lu team I coach and him
about<00:01:49.229> ways<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.250> come<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> net<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.329> but

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
about ways to come to the net or not but

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.740 
about ways to come to the net or not but
clearly<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.850> important<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> take<00:01:54.479> time<00:01:54.509> away

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
clearly it's important to take time away

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.830 
clearly it's important to take time away
from<00:01:55.439> your<00:01:56.040> opponent<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:57.000> dictate<00:01:57.420> play<00:01:57.689> as

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
from your opponent to dictate play as

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
from your opponent to dictate play as
well<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.200> much<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.610> then<00:01:59.729> also

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
well as much as you can but then also

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.670 
well as much as you can but then also
you<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.390> able<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.320> miss<00:02:01.469> too

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you have to be able not to to miss too

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.260 
you have to be able not to to miss too
much<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.610> able<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.909> physically

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
much you have to be able to physically

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.719 
much you have to be able to physically
stay<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> rally<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.920> mentally<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.490> well

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
stay in the rally and mentally as well

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.839 
stay in the rally and mentally as well
and<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> combination<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.459> many<00:02:08.610> things

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
and so it's a combination of many things

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.040 
and so it's a combination of many things
now<00:02:09.149> against<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:10.349> good<00:02:10.500> players<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:11.069> know

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
now against the good players we know

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.720 
now against the good players we know
at<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.410> top<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:13.400> gonna<00:02:13.520> be<00:02:13.670> interesting

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
at the top so it's gonna be interesting

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.840 
at the top so it's gonna be interesting
to<00:02:14.060> see<00:02:14.420> what<00:02:14.990> he<00:02:15.080> has<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.230> say<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.610> some

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.550 
to see what he has to say I have some
idea<00:02:17.180> but<00:02:17.750> then<00:02:18.440> am<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.220> able<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:20.380> make<00:02:21.380> that

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
idea but then am I able to make that

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.650 
idea but then am I able to make that
happen<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.070> match<00:02:22.220> yet<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:22.760> don't<00:02:23.000> know
