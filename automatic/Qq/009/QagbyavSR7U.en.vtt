00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hi everybody thanks for stopping back

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.110 
hi everybody thanks for stopping back
today<00:00:03.560> today<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.620> want<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.009> do<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> car<00:00:05.640> audio

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
today today I want to do a car audio

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.049 
today today I want to do a car audio
update<00:00:06.690> making<00:00:07.620> some<00:00:07.830> changes<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.429> my<00:00:08.550> system

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
update making some changes to my system

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.450 
update making some changes to my system
again<00:00:09.410> I<00:00:10.410> just<00:00:10.820> figured<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:12.000> time<00:00:13.250> I'm<00:00:14.250> not

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
again I just figured it's time I'm not

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.010 
again I just figured it's time I'm not
unhappy<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:15.000> anything<00:00:15.540> that's<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.870> my

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
unhappy with anything that's in my

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.980 
unhappy with anything that's in my
system<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.859> want<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.970> know<00:00:18.060> requests<00:00:18.810> for

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
system just want you know requests for

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.519 
system just want you know requests for
better<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.350> better<00:00:19.500> performance<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.500> did<00:00:22.500> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
better and better performance so I did a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.009 
better and better performance so I did a
bit<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.769> research<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> came

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
bit of research and this is what I came

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.259 
bit of research and this is what I came
up<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.580> I'm<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> try<00:00:27.090> out<00:00:27.500> all<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
up with I'm going to try out all the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.120 
up with I'm going to try out all the
Hertz<00:00:30.269> speakers<00:00:31.550> they<00:00:32.550> are<00:00:33.350> well<00:00:34.350> first<00:00:34.649> off<00:00:34.860> I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
Hertz speakers they are well first off I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.660 
Hertz speakers they are well first off I
was<00:00:35.489> looking<00:00:35.760> for<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.110> best<00:00:37.489> mid<00:00:38.489> bass

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
was looking for really the best mid bass

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.209 
was looking for really the best mid bass
driver<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.210> could<00:00:39.480> find<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.140> these<00:00:40.950> ones

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
driver I could find and these ones

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.700 
driver I could find and these ones
continuously<00:00:41.940> come<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> best

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
continuously come up as some of the best

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.119 
continuously come up as some of the best
so<00:00:44.239> these<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> Hertz<00:00:45.840> high<00:00:46.110> energy<00:00:46.590> this

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so these are the Hertz high energy this

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.479 
so these are the Hertz high energy this
is<00:00:47.430> their<00:00:47.850> high<00:00:48.780> energy<00:00:48.930> XL<00:00:49.620> version<00:00:49.890> which<00:00:50.280> is

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
is their high energy XL version which is

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.150 
is their high energy XL version which is
higher<00:00:51.090> power<00:00:51.390> handling<00:00:51.980> slightly<00:00:52.980> higher

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
higher power handling slightly higher

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.420 
higher power handling slightly higher
efficiency<00:00:54.500> these<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.739> notorious<00:00:56.399> for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
efficiency these are notorious for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.389 
efficiency these are notorious for
having<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.390> incredible<00:00:57.930> mid<00:00:58.109> bass<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.739> we're

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
having just incredible mid bass so we're

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.639 
having just incredible mid bass so we're
going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.820> how<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.120> do

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
going to see how they do

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.860 
going to see how they do
there's<00:01:01.649> woven<00:01:02.039> cone<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.550> got<00:01:02.760> their<00:01:03.030> V<00:01:03.600> cone

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
there's woven cone it's got their V cone

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.080 
there's woven cone it's got their V cone
shape<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:05.540> they<00:01:06.540> look<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:06.840> neat<00:01:08.060> but<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
shape here they look pretty neat but I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
shape here they look pretty neat but I
looked<00:01:09.450> into<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> mill<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> woofers<00:01:10.560> their

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
looked into the mill a woofers their

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.570 
looked into the mill a woofers their
top-of-the-line

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
top-of-the-line

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.410 
top-of-the-line
and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.950> think<00:01:13.950> they're<00:01:14.100> probably<00:01:14.340> great<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and I think they're probably great but I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
and I think they're probably great but I
know<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.750> lot<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.080> people<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.490> have

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
know a lot of people out there that have

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
know a lot of people out there that have
tried<00:01:17.850> both<00:01:18.119> actually<00:01:18.659> prefer<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> midbass

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
tried both actually prefer the midbass

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.550 
tried both actually prefer the midbass
on<00:01:19.799> these<00:01:20.009> say<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> bit<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.210> punch

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
on these say they have a bit more punch

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.149 
on these say they have a bit more punch
so<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:24.770> has<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> huge

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so that's what I'm going for has a huge

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.370 
so that's what I'm going for has a huge
magnet<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:27.110> I'll<00:01:28.110> give<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
magnet on the back I'll give you a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.240 
magnet on the back I'll give you a
close-up<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.890> these<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.280> two<00:01:30.799> cast<00:01:31.799> aluminum

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
close-up of these here two cast aluminum

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.280 
close-up of these here two cast aluminum
chassis<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.390> open<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.840> deeper

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
chassis it's all open it is a bit deeper

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
chassis it's all open it is a bit deeper
than<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> woofers<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:38.790> now

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
than the woofers I have in there now

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450 
than the woofers I have in there now
it's<00:01:39.090> 10<00:01:39.299> millimeters<00:01:39.900> deeper<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.860> may<00:01:41.220> have

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it's 10 millimeters deeper so I may have

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.649 
it's 10 millimeters deeper so I may have
to<00:01:41.840> make<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> spacer<00:01:43.560> or<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.210> hair

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
to make a spacer or just go a hair

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.600 
to make a spacer or just go a hair
deeper<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.229> I'm<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> try<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> still<00:01:47.430> fit

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
deeper but I'm going to try to still fit

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.210 
deeper but I'm going to try to still fit
them<00:01:47.700> behind<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> factory<00:01:48.509> grilles<00:01:49.070> so<00:01:50.070> we'll

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
them behind the factory grilles so we'll

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.480 
them behind the factory grilles so we'll
see<00:01:50.399> how<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.579> goes<00:01:51.920> but<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> heavy

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
see how that goes but it is a heavy

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.359 
see how that goes but it is a heavy
driver

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
driver

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.709 
driver
therefore<00:01:56.369> ohm<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.119> say<00:01:57.299> they<00:01:57.420> handle

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
therefore ohm they they say they handle

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.340 
therefore ohm they they say they handle
250<00:01:58.439> watt<00:01:58.590> speak<00:01:59.479> 125<00:02:00.479> watts<00:02:00.689> continuous

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
250 watt speak 125 watts continuous

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
250 watt speak 125 watts continuous
which<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.100> over<00:02:02.369> twice<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> power<00:02:03.030> handling

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
which is over twice the power handling

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.440 
which is over twice the power handling
of<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.990> right<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.180> these<00:02:06.180> things

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
of what I have right now so these things

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.059 
of what I have right now so these things
should<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.780> able<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.990> rock<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.409> good

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
should be able to rock out good

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.990 
should be able to rock out good
also<00:02:09.069> my<00:02:09.399> sensitivity<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.539> going<00:02:10.810> from<00:02:11.200> 91

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
also my sensitivity is going from 91

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.070 
also my sensitivity is going from 91
decibels<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:14.970> 93.5<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.300> these<00:02:16.450> woofers<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.020> I'm

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
decibels to 93.5 on these woofers so I'm

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.840 
decibels to 93.5 on these woofers so I'm
going<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.290> get<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.410> bit<00:02:17.709> more<00:02:17.890> output<00:02:18.430> for<00:02:18.700> my

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
going to get a bit more output for my

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.990 
going to get a bit more output for my
watts<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.650> less<00:02:20.650> amplifier<00:02:21.280> distortion<00:02:21.850> at

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
watts so less amplifier distortion at

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.420 
watts so less amplifier distortion at
the<00:02:22.120> same<00:02:22.330> volume<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.990> what<00:02:23.230> what<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.770> equals

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
the same volume is what what that equals

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.949 
the same volume is what what that equals
so<00:02:25.000> I'm<00:02:25.060> pretty<00:02:25.209> excited<00:02:25.540> about<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:27.569> then<00:02:28.569> I

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
so I'm pretty excited about that then I

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.530 
so I'm pretty excited about that then I
went<00:02:29.590> with<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.980> tweeter<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:33.790> wanted<00:02:34.300> I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
went with the the tweeter I wanted I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.479 
went with the the tweeter I wanted I
mean<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.200> foundation<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.800> any<00:02:36.010> speaker

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
mean the the foundation of any speaker

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.330 
mean the the foundation of any speaker
to<00:02:36.640> me<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.900> tweeter<00:02:38.230> if<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:39.069> tweeter

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
to me is if the tweeter if the tweeter

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.520 
to me is if the tweeter if the tweeter
isn't<00:02:39.700> good<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.690> speaker<00:02:41.019> doesn't<00:02:41.230> sound

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
isn't good the speaker doesn't sound

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.160 
isn't good the speaker doesn't sound
good<00:02:41.739> or<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.130> speaker<00:02:42.430> system<00:02:42.700> as<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:44.050> this

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
good or the speaker system as in this

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.780 
good or the speaker system as in this
case<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.840> wanted<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.590> fantastic<00:02:48.550> Twitter

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
case so I wanted a fantastic Twitter

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.130 
case so I wanted a fantastic Twitter
that<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.800> really<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.940> know<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.300> was<00:02:52.720> looking<00:02:52.989> at

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
that is really you know I was looking at

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.290 
that is really you know I was looking at
high-end<00:02:53.709> tweeters<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.190> home<00:02:54.489> audio<00:02:54.790> but<00:02:55.090> I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
high-end tweeters for home audio but I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.509 
high-end tweeters for home audio but I
wanted<00:02:56.080> something<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.530> was<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.830> bit<00:02:57.190> more

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
wanted something that was a bit more

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.270 
wanted something that was a bit more
compact<00:02:58.120> like<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.780> car<00:02:59.019> tweeters<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.860> I<00:02:59.890> look

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
compact like the car tweeters so I look

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.940 
compact like the car tweeters so I look
for<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.550> really<00:03:00.820> fantastic<00:03:01.350> car<00:03:02.350> Twitter<00:03:02.620> and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
for a really fantastic car Twitter and

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.640 
for a really fantastic car Twitter and
this<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.700> what<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.060> found<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.380> Hertz

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
this is what it found this is the Hertz

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.360 
this is what it found this is the Hertz

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
this is their top of line tweeter

this is their top of line tweeter
they're<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:11.170> real<00:03:11.410> heavy<00:03:11.650> there<00:03:11.950> there<00:03:12.310> in

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
they're the real heavy there there in

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.860 
they're the real heavy there there in
this<00:03:12.610> machined<00:03:13.650> aluminum<00:03:14.650> enclosure<00:03:15.870> and

this machined aluminum enclosure and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.350 
this machined aluminum enclosure and

kettle<00:03:23.500> on<00:03:23.620> dome<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:24.160> think<00:03:24.340> they<00:03:24.459> call<00:03:24.670> it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
kettle on dome I think they call it

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.330 
kettle on dome I think they call it
whatever<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.750> material<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.920> but<00:03:27.220> it's

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
whatever that material it is is but it's

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.750 
whatever that material it is is but it's
a<00:03:27.400> soft<00:03:27.670> elements<00:03:27.940> like<00:03:28.180> it's<00:03:28.329> all<00:03:28.480> tone<00:03:28.690> clear

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
a soft elements like it's all tone clear

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.970 
a soft elements like it's all tone clear
power<00:03:30.760> handling<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.540> huge<00:03:31.570> on<00:03:32.380> these<00:03:32.560> it's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
power handling is huge on these it's

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.190 
power handling is huge on these it's
that<00:03:33.519> mean<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:33.790> got<00:03:33.940> 180<00:03:34.540> watts<00:03:34.750> written<00:03:35.110> on

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
that mean it's got 180 watts written on

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.780 
that mean it's got 180 watts written on
the<00:03:35.290> back<00:03:35.470> but<00:03:35.739> if<00:03:35.829> it<00:03:35.950> handles<00:03:36.280> half<00:03:36.519> that

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
the back but if it handles half that

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.140 
the back but if it handles half that
that's<00:03:37.450> plenty

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
that's plenty

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.250 
that's plenty
because<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.269> sensitivity<00:03:41.049> on<00:03:41.079> these<00:03:41.410> is<00:03:41.680> 95

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
because the sensitivity on these is 95

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.190 
because the sensitivity on these is 95
that's<00:03:44.260> way<00:03:44.560> up<00:03:44.709> there<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.780> we<00:03:46.780> probably<00:03:46.900> won't

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
that's way up there so we probably won't

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.750 
that's way up there so we probably won't
be<00:03:47.260> using<00:03:47.290> 30<00:03:47.739> watt<00:03:47.920> still<00:03:48.190> but<00:03:48.489> I'm<00:03:48.579> going<00:03:48.700> to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
be using 30 watt still but I'm going to

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.099 
be using 30 watt still but I'm going to
put<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:48.970> hundred<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.450> ten<00:03:49.690> on<00:03:49.930> them<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:51.400> to

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
put a hundred and ten on them just to

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.580 
put a hundred and ten on them just to
just<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.170> be<00:03:53.320> sure

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
just to be sure

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.199 
just to be sure
actually<00:03:54.519> I<00:03:54.579> think<00:03:54.640> Birgitte<00:03:55.480> was<00:03:55.600> 137<00:03:56.380> but

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
actually I think Birgitte was 137 but

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.710 
actually I think Birgitte was 137 but
you<00:03:58.209> know<00:03:59.250> at<00:04:00.250> car<00:04:00.730> running<00:04:01.060> larger<00:04:01.480> be<00:04:01.690> a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
you know at car running larger be a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.150 
you know at car running larger be a
little<00:04:01.930> bit<00:04:02.019> less<00:04:02.760> for<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.880> subwoofer<00:04:05.160> I'm

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
little bit less for the subwoofer I'm

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.289 
little bit less for the subwoofer I'm
going<00:04:06.609> I'm<00:04:07.510> going<00:04:07.900> down<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> single<00:04:09.700> 10<00:04:10.090> inch

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
going I'm going down to a single 10 inch

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.810 
going I'm going down to a single 10 inch
driver<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:11.709> this<00:04:12.010> one<00:04:12.220> here<00:04:12.489> this<00:04:12.609> is<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
driver is this one here this is the

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
driver is this one here this is the
Hertz<00:04:13.269> high<00:04:13.540> energy<00:04:13.930> 10<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.880> has<00:04:15.940> their<00:04:16.540> Veeck

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
Hertz high energy 10 it has their Veeck

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.039 
Hertz high energy 10 it has their Veeck
own<00:04:17.400> design

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
own design

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.770 
own design
so<00:04:19.349> it's<00:04:19.470> got<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.709> same<00:04:20.660> v-shape<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:23.780> I'm

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
so it's got that same v-shape in it I'm

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.610 
so it's got that same v-shape in it I'm
going<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.259> 110<00:04:25.889> because<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:27.419> started<00:04:28.319> with<00:04:28.409> two

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
going to 110 because I started with two

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.339 
going to 110 because I started with two
tens<00:04:28.889> that<00:04:29.250> was<00:04:29.430> really<00:04:29.970> too<00:04:30.150> much<00:04:30.330> base<00:04:30.599> to<00:04:31.020> be

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
tens that was really too much base to be

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.100 
tens that was really too much base to be
nice<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:31.800> balanced<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.759> then<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.360> went<00:04:33.509> to<00:04:33.599> 112

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
nice and balanced and then I went to 112

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.339 
nice and balanced and then I went to 112
and<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.680> was<00:04:34.860> still<00:04:35.129> really<00:04:35.460> too<00:04:35.699> much<00:04:35.879> space

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
and that was still really too much space

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.480 
and that was still really too much space
I<00:04:37.909> had<00:04:38.909> to<00:04:39.470> so<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.620> was<00:04:40.710> too<00:04:40.860> much<00:04:40.979> base<00:04:41.220> try<00:04:41.430> to

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
I had to so it was too much base try to

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.189 
I had to so it was too much base try to
turn<00:04:41.729> it<00:04:41.879> down<00:04:41.909> to<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.449> point<00:04:42.750> where<00:04:43.050> it

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
turn it down to a point where it

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.960 
turn it down to a point where it
actually<00:04:43.530> wasn't<00:04:43.680> functioning<00:04:44.490> well<00:04:44.699> it

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
actually wasn't functioning well it

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.990 
actually wasn't functioning well it
actually<00:04:45.120> needs<00:04:45.449> more<00:04:45.780> power<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.729> kind

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
actually needs more power so it it kind

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.909 
actually needs more power so it it kind
of<00:04:48.060> wants<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.479> be<00:04:48.599> louder<00:04:48.900> than<00:04:49.199> I<00:04:49.440> want<00:04:49.830> to

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
of wants to be louder than I want to

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.390 
of wants to be louder than I want to
play<00:04:50.099> it<00:04:50.280> so<00:04:50.520> so<00:04:51.479> I<00:04:51.530> think<00:04:52.530> I'm<00:04:52.800> going<00:04:53.009> to<00:04:53.039> solve

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
play it so so I think I'm going to solve

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.680 
play it so so I think I'm going to solve
that<00:04:53.520> with<00:04:53.880> this<00:04:54.240> here<00:04:55.159> Hertz<00:04:56.159> high<00:04:56.370> energy<00:04:56.789> 10

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
that with this here Hertz high energy 10

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.399 
that with this here Hertz high energy 10
this<00:04:58.229> is<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:58.470> single<00:04:58.919> single<00:04:59.699> coil<00:04:59.940> 4<00:05:00.360> ohm

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
this is a single single coil 4 ohm

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.550 
this is a single single coil 4 ohm
I<00:05:01.440> don't<00:05:02.250> need<00:05:02.340> multiple<00:05:02.819> coils<00:05:03.289> it's<00:05:04.289> a<00:05:04.409> lot

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
I don't need multiple coils it's a lot

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.140 
I don't need multiple coils it's a lot
easier<00:05:04.740> when<00:05:04.949> it's<00:05:05.250> just<00:05:05.490> 4<00:05:05.699> ohm<00:05:05.819> and<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.030> only

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
easier when it's just 4 ohm and you only

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:13.159 
easier when it's just 4 ohm and you only
have<00:05:06.330> two<00:05:06.479> wires<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.930> hook<00:05:07.050> up<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:08.840> have<00:05:10.759> 500<00:05:12.169> 500

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
have two wires to hook up I have 500 500

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.080 
have two wires to hook up I have 500 500
watts<00:05:13.319> RMS<00:05:13.800> on<00:05:14.039> tap<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.550> need<00:05:14.699> a<00:05:14.729> little<00:05:14.940> bit

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
watts RMS on tap so I need a little bit

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.070 
watts RMS on tap so I need a little bit
more<00:05:15.270> efficiency<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:18.090> with<00:05:18.659> the<00:05:18.780> single

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
more efficiency so with the single

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.020 
more efficiency so with the single
driver<00:05:19.319> that'll<00:05:19.650> help<00:05:19.770> but<00:05:20.069> this<00:05:20.400> is<00:05:20.610> also<00:05:20.819> I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
driver that'll help but this is also I

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.589 
driver that'll help but this is also I
think<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.569> sensitivity<00:05:22.080> on<00:05:22.169> this<00:05:22.319> is<00:05:22.550> 89

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
think the sensitivity on this is 89

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.260 
think the sensitivity on this is 89
which<00:05:24.599> is<00:05:24.750> another<00:05:24.990> 3<00:05:25.319> DB<00:05:26.009> above<00:05:26.400> my<00:05:26.819> 12<00:05:27.120> inch

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
which is another 3 DB above my 12 inch

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.230 
which is another 3 DB above my 12 inch
and<00:05:27.539> 60<00:05:28.380> being<00:05:28.680> change<00:05:29.009> above<00:05:29.340> my<00:05:29.610> tens<00:05:29.909> that<00:05:30.210> I

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
and 60 being change above my tens that I

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.559 
and 60 being change above my tens that I
had<00:05:30.479> so<00:05:31.759> so<00:05:32.759> that<00:05:32.909> should<00:05:33.090> give<00:05:33.210> me<00:05:33.240> some<00:05:33.419> good

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
had so so that should give me some good

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.450 
had so so that should give me some good
output<00:05:33.750> for<00:05:34.110> my<00:05:34.199> power<00:05:34.409> plus<00:05:34.919> I<00:05:35.130> here<00:05:35.310> this

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
output for my power plus I here this

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.779 
output for my power plus I here this
one's<00:05:35.699> real<00:05:36.569> fast<00:05:36.900> it's<00:05:37.259> it's<00:05:37.949> not<00:05:38.219> not<00:05:38.759> a

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
one's real fast it's it's not not a

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.029 
one's real fast it's it's not not a
power<00:05:39.060> hog<00:05:39.419> it's<00:05:39.750> just<00:05:40.380> real<00:05:40.560> fast<00:05:40.830> and

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
power hog it's just real fast and

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.730 
power hog it's just real fast and
accurate<00:05:41.430> so<00:05:41.699> we'll<00:05:42.690> see<00:05:42.900> how<00:05:43.080> it<00:05:43.110> goes<00:05:43.409> I'll

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
accurate so we'll see how it goes I'll

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.330 
accurate so we'll see how it goes I'll
show<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.699> install<00:05:45.599> when<00:05:45.779> I<00:05:45.810> do<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.169> and<00:05:46.500> we'll

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
show the install when I do it and we'll

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.219 
show the install when I do it and we'll
get<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.669> hear<00:05:47.880> it<00:05:47.909> again<00:05:48.060> once<00:05:48.509> I<00:05:48.750> got<00:05:48.990> all<00:05:49.110> this

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
get to hear it again once I got all this

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.230 
get to hear it again once I got all this
installed<00:05:49.740> I<00:05:50.009> think<00:05:50.580> I'm<00:05:50.669> going<00:05:50.789> to<00:05:50.880> have<00:05:51.090> to

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
installed I think I'm going to have to

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.790 
installed I think I'm going to have to
fabricate<00:05:51.870> some<00:05:53.330> some<00:05:54.330> fiberglass<00:05:54.779> pods<00:05:55.289> for

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
fabricate some some fiberglass pods for

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.120 
fabricate some some fiberglass pods for
the<00:05:55.979> tweeters<00:05:56.430> so<00:05:56.969> I'm<00:05:57.659> going<00:05:57.840> to<00:05:57.900> get<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.800> do

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
the tweeters so I'm going to get to do

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.339 
the tweeters so I'm going to get to do
fiberglass<00:05:59.729> my<00:05:59.940> first<00:06:00.240> time<00:06:00.479> too<00:06:00.810> so<00:06:01.199> we'll

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
fiberglass my first time too so we'll

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.120 
fiberglass my first time too so we'll
see<00:06:01.529> how<00:06:01.650> that<00:06:01.710> goes<00:06:03.020> all<00:06:04.020> right<00:06:04.229> well<00:06:04.770> thanks

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
see how that goes all right well thanks

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.339 
see how that goes all right well thanks
