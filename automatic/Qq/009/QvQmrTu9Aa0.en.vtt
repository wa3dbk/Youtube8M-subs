00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:31.980
 we're just going to show the size of the chest 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.590
 to read go we will get the year yes yes 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 we should have taken this one then 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:43.080
 here it is the size of the chest is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.320
 strange mastery thanks a lot to 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.320
 you 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.620
 didon and bedie we are waiting for bratton 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.880
 is a stamp is on how you go back 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.260
 I found your remark very correct 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.370
 to finally say it's a car that goes 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.690
 play left there I go it's 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.940
 car 40 it would be perfect from 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.090
 hubert finally at the drivers vtc 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.040
 there you were would have pascal allias of the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.540
 place 1000 balls thirty thousand balls 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.660
 virus and sympathetic 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.160
 you do not learn black hands the inside of the 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.259
 black wall and all that is that musi 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:24.200
 immediately and it's true that at this 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.520
 fare there may have cost a car 6 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.350
 99 gr that will pilar right look who's going 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.520
 father precisely to hubert users 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.810
 not what is the hybrid because it 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.540
 is and gets out everything will not be forbidden 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.680
 in barry when you see attack 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.680
 she is sweet years 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.990
 French elegance tornadoes have 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.060
 finally left eternal France it's 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.000
 it's a rallying cry about perot 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.500
 sporting sweet sather and figaro 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.869
 share two days to the envy his share already the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.170
 big press in the morning and we 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.580
 recruit the size almost seven hours 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.380
 in the morning we get drunk and given 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.210
 the one on board to please my dear 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.220
 renault to you what I love you do 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.470
 not me too I'm very proud of them 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.180
 be part of those loves of his 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.560
 this very special caste of people who 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.049
 try to cars very regularly 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.850
 as a little younger a little bit that in 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.890
 a strange world I would like until 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.019
 a few words you talk to me about the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.230
 driving because yesterday you said a 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.459
 thing in the conversation on Thursday at sahm 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.780
 scream a little bit and it's a 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.250
 phrase I too so it is important that 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.480
 how can we explain why that 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.360
 moulin a hybrid so that grinds its 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.239
 ulule it makes the moped 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.019
 it's been flying from conakry to 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.690
 expiration 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.090
 that's what life is like when you take off 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.950
 to say that we put full gas and after 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.100
 the car are doing their own thing and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.600
 accelerates the acceleration pace so is 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.910
 slight connections between 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.290
 acceleration the translation that this 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.470
 acceleration who to what 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.880
 so it's due to a phenomenon it's a 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.530
 torque converter which is a 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.350
 system by the way not by belt 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.030
 same mechanical if I'm not sure about 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.209
 this car is the grosso system 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.130
 modo of the prius 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.989
 yes quite since 1999 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.720
 so it's less serious however safe 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.220
 than on the prius because the kicker and 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.269
 more powerful so this car does 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.959
 187 horses 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:26.540
 so if we accelerate halfway was 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.770
 in the rain yes so we can accelerate 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.750
 half 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.250
 to push back a little less 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.900
 to skate a little less and that 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.460
 enough it's true that on the acceleration 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 the car and powerful we are all from 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.090
 very quickly above speeds 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.180
 legalities then this is the disadvantage of 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.040
 converters of systems cvt and 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.820
 pardon more accurately his readings to 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.090
 all hybrids whose outcome appears 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.240
 on the lexus or the last mx350 that's 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.700
 although I can say even worse than on 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.220
 on this car that said that this manager 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.170
 also you have to drive slowly 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.240
 we must accelerate and learn to 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.240
 decelerate the car continues to advance 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.590
 because the system corrects 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.600
 multiplication it's like on a 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.190
 moped what deep down yeah it's finally 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.120
 if it's not a cousin fart a little 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.400
 surprising it's a little surprising 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.380
 second question is that beautiful mom 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.810
 since we know that in the figaro readership 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.760
 hard words absolutely does that 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.030
 beautiful mom can be seduced by one by 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.950
 a 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.600
 a ford mondeo hybrids or other 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.830
 question you who know people well 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 who still buy cars 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.210
 who is a car like that 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.520
 so we do not have the prestige we are going to say 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.840
 of a lexus or a wii it is a 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.910
 car that is very well built 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.440
 that a formidable strong chassis during 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.870
 very long time had no good chassis 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.030
 we can say and then um how 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.920
 would I say a flip with the focus 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.630
 is there it's really a cat it's 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.820
 wonderful that is very well suspended 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.040
 which is very comfortable it is a sedan 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.330
 we have room we were so low and 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.330
 still a bit early 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.710
 yes it's a little all that to the customer 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.900
 of the sedan now is subsidiary 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.910
 see residuals again one 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.910
 buy suv 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.030
 so we could have imagined that ford 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.100
 launches this system on his suv kuga of a 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.060
 apart and on the other hand it comes out a plug 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.350
 in hybrid 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:22.370
 oh yes I recharge yes after the battle 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:25.610
 where it is good that there is the hybrid in 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.530
 the range but it's true that it's a 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.320
 little bit compared to golf saguenay 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.880
 to the audi e-tron that are hybrids 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.870
 rechargeable very nice there we do not 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.460
 can not do a lot of kilometers 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.580
 it's a very small battery I think 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.170
 that it's 1.4 kilo watt then on the 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.790
 two little german well we can 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.870
 to do 30 km is to say if we have a 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.490
 suburban habitat 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.410
 you can work the distension 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.120
 detroit here is the goal is there like 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.500
 I was quite there is because 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.040
 that albi to recharge you floor 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.330
 yes absolutely we will need I do not know 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.660
 no question of marketing of 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.980
 standardization of approval I do not know 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.190
 I did not answer my question 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.280
 but in his snow suits it's clcc 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.660
 noodle lovers lovers 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.350
 big sedans maybe even more than 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.780
 50 years maybe even over 50 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:15.920
 that says every day the beginning of the 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.030
 life is the beginning but it was a 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.830
 big car and gones got very 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.870
 well finished all the annals nothing 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.270
 all that very well ah yes to fight 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.680
 we finished very well but everything is very 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.790
 well assured but at the level of the whole 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.050
 it's a people it's very plastic 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.790
 commits then it's not a first man 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.650
 there is no key that ensures a 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.529
 first a bmw an audi or a 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.719
 mercedes for sure but for a 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:38.149
 cars of generalist structures 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:39.649
 rather my opinion in the at the top of the 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.939
 basket fans their environment very 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:44.059
 nice it's well built the 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:49.059
 plastics are mus and it's quite 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:49.059
 nice it's very aggressive it broke
