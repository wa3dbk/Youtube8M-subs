videos and you can compare it with guns

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.940 
videos and you can compare it with guns
you're<00:01:32.490> familiar<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:33.170> now<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> one<00:01:34.619> more

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you're familiar with now the one more

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.090 
you're familiar with now the one more
statistic<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.790> gonna<00:01:35.970> go<00:01:36.119> over<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.229> this

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
statistic I'm gonna go over is that this

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
statistic I'm gonna go over is that this
gun<00:01:38.430> has<00:01:38.700> better<00:01:39.210> hipfire<00:01:39.810> than<00:01:40.079> normal

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
gun has better hipfire than normal

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.399 
gun has better hipfire than normal
because<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> bullpup<00:01:42.210> weapon<00:01:42.600> so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
because it is a bullpup weapon so

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.899 
because it is a bullpup weapon so
compared<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.520> MX<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.930> PDW<00:01:46.649> has<00:01:46.909> 25%

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
compared to the MX for the PDW has 25%

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.889 
compared to the MX for the PDW has 25%
better<00:01:48.630> hipfire<00:01:49.200> than<00:01:49.890> any<00:01:50.189> non<00:01:50.610> bullpup<00:01:51.240> PDW

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
better hipfire than any non bullpup PDW

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
better hipfire than any non bullpup PDW
so<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:53.040> gonna<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.280> getting<00:01:53.549> really

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
so you're gonna be getting really

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.630 
so you're gonna be getting really
astounding<00:01:55.079> hipfire<00:01:55.470> even<00:01:55.950> without<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.369> laser

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
astounding hipfire even without a laser

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
astounding hipfire even without a laser
sight<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> put<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> laser<00:01:57.630> sight<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.259> as

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
sight and if you put a laser sight on as

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
sight and if you put a laser sight on as
you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.250> gameplay<00:01:59.490> the<00:02:00.299> hipfire

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you can see in this gameplay the hipfire

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.490 
you can see in this gameplay the hipfire
is<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.729> phenomenally<00:02:02.729> accurate<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.500> really

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
is just phenomenally accurate and really

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.350 
is just phenomenally accurate and really
you<00:02:05.100> should<00:02:05.130> try<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.610> stick<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.180> close

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
you should try to stick to close

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
doing well again laser sight absolutely

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.490 
doing well again laser sight absolutely
would<00:03:23.910> recommend<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.420> do<00:03:24.660> not<00:03:24.780> use<00:03:24.960> anything

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
would recommend that do not use anything

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.560 
would recommend that do not use anything
over<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.920> laser<00:03:26.100> sight<00:03:26.370> for<00:03:27.210> barrel

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
over the laser sight for barrel

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.510 
over the laser sight for barrel
definitely<00:03:28.350> put<00:03:28.560> on<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.770> sound<00:03:29.070> side<00:03:29.310> thus

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
definitely put on the sound side thus

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.030 
definitely put on the sound side thus
answer<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.120> great<00:03:30.450> because<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.080> already<00:03:31.740> have

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
answer is great because you already have

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.250 
answer is great because you already have
a<00:03:32.070> pretty<00:03:32.520> high<00:03:32.880> bullet<00:03:33.390> velocity<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.020> you're

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
a pretty high bullet velocity and you're

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.880 
a pretty high bullet velocity and you're
not<00:03:34.530> gonna<00:03:34.800> be<00:03:34.980> really<00:03:35.550> needing<00:03:36.740> you're<00:03:37.740> not

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
not gonna be really needing you're not

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.320

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
gonna be needing bullet velocity you're

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.030 
gonna be needing bullet velocity you're
not<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.810> should<00:03:40.020> not<00:03:40.200> be<00:03:40.350> getting<00:03:40.470> kills<00:03:40.890> at

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
not you should not be getting kills at

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.250 
not you should not be getting kills at
