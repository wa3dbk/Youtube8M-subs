00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.640
 hello everybody, one more little world to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.680
 you 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.540
 and today I talk a little about manga a 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.400
 Mango is one of the most sought after fruit 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.490
 the world and demand has increased 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.130
 domestic and foreign markets. 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.530
 reaching compensating prices but for 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.900
 that you have this in your culture is 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.720
 it is necessary to adopt cultivation practices 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.410
 proper management and care 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.739
 required as irrigation fertilization 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.480
 suitable 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.280
 the hose is easy to grow 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.340
 rapid growth and that the past 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.190
 north of productive south of the country though 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.560
 be vigorous and can reach 20 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.720
 children's height meters the commercials 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.630
 and it is recommended that by means of 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.430
 prune to keep it with three meters of height 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.040
 the hose has can be grown in 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.330
 vases with a capacity of at least 50 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.730
 liters of sun 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.490
 planting can include 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.340
 produce some fruits to count on the good 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.830
 drainage and fertilization during the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.290
 whole year mainly organic 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.740
 the change must also come from 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.750
 grafting until the 19th century there 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.850
 the propagation process was done 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.040
 just by seed and plants 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.930
 took too long to produce because they were 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.540
 easier to care for and develop 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.010
 quickly the grafted seedlings are the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.800
 more suitable for planting 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.810
 hose in the second year of cultivation 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.760
 already produce the fruits with the same 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.810
 characteristics of the mothers generated by 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.660
 mother plant 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.780
 on the other hand plants originating from 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.900
 Seeds take seven or more years to 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.879
 fruits and are still vulnerable to 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.280
 emergence of sleeves with characteristics 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.230
 different from the type that originated them 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.269
 Good, now I'll start talking a little 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.670
 more about cultivation between realities 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.459
 of most common and commercialized 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.150
 in the market are on board a heart of 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.260
 ox 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.160
 keith harding adam extreme and more 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.530
 rustic like carlota sword and 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.400
 rosinha as well as several known 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.439
 regionally take arts and palmer are 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.439
 considered the best for export 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.920
 the propagation is recommended to be done by 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.420
 swell day 11 meters 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.700
 ensuring loyalty of the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.310
 characteristics of the mother plant to the fruits 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.930
 and early production through seeds 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.989
 the propagation only important for 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.300
 genetic improvement work . 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.670
 can result in plants and fruits as 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.000
 different from the variety used 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.170
 to the crossroads disputing in the good field a 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.880
 environment 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.370
 as it is a climate plant 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.560
 the ideal is that the cultivation of 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.630
 hose occur in places of 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.010
 hot temperature where the plant has 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.750
 better production capacity 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.709
 especially when irrigated 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.810
 correctly 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.640
 however it can be developed in 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.489
 all states of the country 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.769
 good little planting can be 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.470
 performed in any type of sun though 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.420
 not be tolerated by the plant 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.660
 because it causes root rot 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.850
 and death on sandy and very dry soil 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.920
 however precise and irrigation as is the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.450
 case of the inland petroleum region 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.030
 from pernambuco 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.640
 the spacing will lead with pruning to 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.530
 keep down and canopy to stop 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.560
 the hose these days a dot 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.720
 more aggressive suggested setback 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.060
 by 6 1 and 6 4 meters 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.880
 recommended pit size is 40 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.350
 for 40 or 40 and now care 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.239
 people will mix with land of 20 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.480
 tanning dung books 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.450
 similar but 250 grams of organic 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.970
 superphosphate and 250 grams of 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.070
 limestone for manure betting should be 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.769
 made since the first year of planting 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.420
 shaping the cup 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.489
 protect the rotated branch with the 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.820
 positioning of copper-based pulp 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.550
 or latex paint attention to the attack of 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.740
 as with leaf shackles and 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.590
 trunk of the hose in addition to perforations 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.960
 by drills in the branches looks for a 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.700
 agricultural engineer in the region to obtain 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.729
 the guidelines on chemical control 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.479
 when the fruits began to ripen 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.820
 protect the 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.039
 fruit flies bagging 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.500
 paper bags method that avoids 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.120
 need for agrochemical applications 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.850
 Well here you have some care that the 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.160
 people can fight without sometimes having 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.140
 that use good chemical video 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.210
 Where is the plant that likes this? 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.099
 be still this comment shares 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.450
 videos grow on the channel and even 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.450
 until the next video
