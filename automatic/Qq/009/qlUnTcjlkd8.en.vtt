00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
time the script came I found it very

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.050 
time the script came I found it very
shallow

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
shallow

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960 
shallow
I<00:00:27.090> felt<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.720> action<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.740> there<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.220> felt<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
I felt the action was there I felt the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.999 
I felt the action was there I felt the
storyline<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.690> there<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> development<00:00:31.949> of

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
storyline was there the development of

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.779 
storyline was there the development of
the<00:00:32.070> character<00:00:33.949> he<00:00:34.949> was<00:00:35.070> almost<00:00:35.190> humanoid

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
the character he was almost humanoid

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:37.369 
the character he was almost humanoid
rather<00:00:36.089> than<00:00:36.269> being<00:00:36.420> human<00:00:36.839> and<00:00:36.960> they<00:00:37.199> said

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
rather than being human and they said

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.799 
rather than being human and they said
well<00:00:37.559> talked<00:00:38.249> to<00:00:38.370> us<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.690> we

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
well talked to us and that's and we

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.719 
well talked to us and that's and we
basically<00:00:40.100> rebuilt<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.280> bit<00:00:41.429> of<00:00:41.519> Sam's

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:41.729 
basically rebuilt a bit of Sam's

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.610 
basically rebuilt a bit of Sam's
character<00:00:42.269> that<00:00:42.569> was<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.839> very<00:00:43.019> first<00:00:43.229> game<00:00:43.440> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
character that was the very first game I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.959 
character that was the very first game I
think<00:00:43.800> what's<00:00:44.190> different<00:00:44.249> about<00:00:44.519> what<00:00:44.699> we're

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
think what's different about what we're

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.020 
think what's different about what we're
doing<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.510> title<00:00:45.749> is<00:00:46.819> we're<00:00:47.819> combining
