00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
on you want to have a hose clamp so you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.040 
on you want to have a hose clamp so you
slide<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.259> drain<00:02:07.469> tubing<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.950> here

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
slide the drain tubing on here

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.440 
slide the drain tubing on here
you<00:02:09.650> can<00:02:09.800> pose<00:02:10.010> clamp<00:02:11.920> tighten<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:12.980> up<00:02:13.450> and

you can pose clamp tighten it up and
you're<00:02:14.570> in<00:02:14.660> business<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:15.950> simple

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
you're in business so it's that simple

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.720 
you're in business so it's that simple
in<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.850> out<00:02:16.970> make<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.900> connection<00:02:18.730> you're

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
in and out make the connection you're

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.790 
in and out make the connection you're
there<00:02:19.940> now<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.990> not<00:02:21.140> made<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.500> come<00:02:21.650> in

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
there now this is not made to come in

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.410 
there now this is not made to come in
and<00:02:21.890> out<00:02:22.010> all<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.220> time<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:23.030> know<00:02:23.120> once<00:02:23.360> you

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and out all the time you know once you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.140 
and out all the time you know once you
get<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.840> it's<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.460> can<00:02:25.700> get<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.030> back

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
get it in it's in you can get it back

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.730 
get it in it's in you can get it back
out<00:02:26.390> but<00:02:26.660> it's<00:02:26.810> probably<00:02:27.170> not<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> really<00:02:27.710> good

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
out but it's probably not a really good

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.920 
out but it's probably not a really good
thing<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.070> do<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.520> as<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.210> pressure<00:02:29.480> pushes

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
thing to do that as the pressure pushes

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.420 
thing to do that as the pressure pushes
against<00:02:30.230> it's<00:02:30.440> going<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.650> expand<00:02:31.010> out<00:02:31.190> and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
against it's going to expand out and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.530 
against it's going to expand out and
that's<00:02:31.580> what<00:02:31.820> makes<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.150> seal<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:34.450> there<00:02:35.450> you

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
that's what makes the seal so there you

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.930 
that's what makes the seal so there you
have<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.250> don't<00:02:37.250> know<00:02:37.310> how<00:02:37.400> much<00:02:37.520> easier<00:02:37.730> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
have it I don't know how much easier it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.450 
have it I don't know how much easier it
can<00:02:38.120> be<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.020> this<00:02:39.710> is<00:02:39.890> cheating<00:02:40.280> but

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
can be this is a this is cheating but

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.050 
can be this is a this is cheating but
guess<00:02:40.940> what<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.690> works<00:02:42.790> if<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.850> have<00:02:43.940> any

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
guess what it works if you have any

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.550 
guess what it works if you have any
questions<00:02:44.420> about<00:02:44.540> what<00:02:44.930> kind<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.230> fittings

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560
