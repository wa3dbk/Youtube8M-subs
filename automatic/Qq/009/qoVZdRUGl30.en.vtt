and<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.420> basically<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.050> open<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.559> your

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and so basically you just open up your

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.990 
and so basically you just open up your
bottom<00:00:38.760> vent<00:00:39.030> down<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.610> this

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
bottom vent down here and then this

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.170 
bottom vent down here and then this
basically<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:43.040> has<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.070> screw<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> goes

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
basically just has one screw that goes

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
basically just has one screw that goes
through<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:47.399> just

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
through it and then it just you just

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
through it and then it just you just
screw<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> back<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.530> you'll

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
screw it in on the back and so you'll

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
screw it in on the back and so you'll
just<00:00:49.770> plug<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.370> fan<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.870> the

I'm actually going to be doing is a when
I<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.449> time<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> swing<00:00:58.260> by<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
I get time I'm going to swing by a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.520 
I get time I'm going to swing by a
hardware<00:00:58.829> store<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.579> get<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.840> stainless<00:01:01.500> steel

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
hardware store and get a stainless steel

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
hardware store and get a stainless steel
plug<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.579> will<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.149> go<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
plug that will actually just go in that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.479 
plug that will actually just go in that
hole<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.989> sits<00:01:04.260> flush<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.860> looks<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.159> lot<00:01:05.309> better

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
hole it sits flush it looks a lot better

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.160 
hole it sits flush it looks a lot better
and<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.030> obviously<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> hold<00:01:07.020> up

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and it obviously is going to hold up

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.850 
and it obviously is going to hold up
longer<00:01:07.619> than<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.400> tape<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.290> maybe

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
longer than this tape so this this maybe

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.410 
longer than this tape so this this maybe
took<00:01:11.280> two<00:01:11.549> minutes<00:01:11.760> install<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.299> way

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
took two minutes install and so the way

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
took two minutes install and so the way

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
center area that I just showed you guys

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.770 
center area that I just showed you guys
and<00:01:58.619> then<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.610> way<00:01:59.729> I've<00:01:59.850> got<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> set<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.750> I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and then the way I've got to set up is I

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.520 
and then the way I've got to set up is I
have<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> little<00:02:01.430> terracotta<00:02:03.049> pan<00:02:04.049> that's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
have a little terracotta pan that's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
have a little terracotta pan that's
wrapped<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.100> aluminum<00:02:05.549> foil<00:02:06.020> down<00:02:07.020> below<00:02:07.409> this

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
wrapped in aluminum foil down below this

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.380 
wrapped in aluminum foil down below this
bottom<00:02:08.099> great<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.580> kind<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> acting<00:02:09.270> as

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
bottom great that's kind of acting as

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.570 
bottom great that's kind of acting as
the<00:02:09.509> heat<00:02:09.720> diffuser<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.340> is

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the heat diffuser and then what I do is

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.230 
the heat diffuser and then what I do is
I<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.730> take<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> little

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
I just take like a little

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.740 
I just take like a little
circular<00:02:14.430> luminal<00:02:15.430> baking<00:02:15.880> pan<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.150> fill<00:02:16.630> it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
with water and that water will actually

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.120 
with water and that water will actually
last<00:02:19.840> quite<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.290> while<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:22.660> may<00:02:23.380> have<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.770> put

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
out shot of the little mini here with

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.480 
out shot of the little mini here with
the<00:02:44.620> digi<00:02:44.950> cue<00:02:46.620> attached<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.070> I've<00:02:48.310> got

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
the digi cue attached to it so I've got

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.370 
the digi cue attached to it so I've got
the<00:02:48.640> 10<00:02:48.970> CFM<00:02:49.750> fan<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:51.810> that's<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:53.020> little<00:02:53.140> bit

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the 10 CFM fan and that's a little bit

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.670 
the 10 CFM fan and that's a little bit
overkill<00:02:53.920> for<00:02:53.980> these<00:02:54.460> little<00:02:54.730> minis<00:02:55.170> but<00:02:56.170> I've

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
overkill for these little minis but I've

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.740 
overkill for these little minis but I've
got<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.010> damn<00:02:57.460> purred<00:02:57.700> about<00:02:58.000> halfway<00:02:58.270> down

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
got it damn purred about halfway down

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.350 
got it damn purred about halfway down
and<00:02:59.160> so<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:01.180> got<00:03:01.360> this<00:03:01.540> thing<00:03:01.780> up<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.970> 225<00:03:03.970> in

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
and so it got this thing up to 225 in

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.810 
and so it got this thing up to 225 in
about<00:03:04.570> 10<00:03:04.990> minutes

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
about 10 minutes

some of that ash fall down below so I

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.650

and that's all you got to do to refuel

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.330 
and that's all you got to do to refuel
it<00:05:38.960> all<00:05:39.960> right<00:05:40.080> guys<00:05:40.230> we're<00:05:40.530> at<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.830> four<00:05:41.190> and

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
it all right guys we're at the four and

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.490 
it all right guys we're at the four and
a<00:05:41.370> half<00:05:41.400> hour<00:05:41.760> mark<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.390> the<00:05:42.480> internal<00:05:43.170> temp

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
a half hour mark and the internal temp

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.730 
a half hour mark and the internal temp
on<00:05:43.680> this<00:05:43.860> but<00:05:44.130> is<00:05:44.400> at<00:05:44.670> 180<00:05:45.350> so<00:05:46.350> I'm<00:05:46.500> thinking

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
on this but is at 180 so I'm thinking

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.260 
on this but is at 180 so I'm thinking
that's<00:05:46.800> probably<00:05:47.100> got<00:05:47.220> just<00:05:47.490> about<00:05:47.580> one<00:05:47.970> hour

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
that's probably got just about one hour

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.950 
that's probably got just about one hour
left

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
left

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.500 
left
one<00:05:49.410> thing<00:05:49.590> I<00:05:49.680> meant<00:05:49.920> to<00:05:50.040> mention<00:05:50.330> around<00:05:51.330> the

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
one thing I meant to mention around the

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.630 
one thing I meant to mention around the
three-hour<00:05:52.020> mark<00:05:52.350> when<00:05:52.590> I<00:05:52.620> refueled<00:05:53.280> is<00:05:53.460> that

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
three-hour mark when I refueled is that

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.220 
three-hour mark when I refueled is that
I<00:05:53.670> actually<00:05:54.080> bumped<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.380> digi<00:05:55.770> queue<00:05:56.040> up<00:05:56.190> to

I actually bumped the digi queue up to

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.220 
I actually bumped the digi queue up to
275<00:05:58.230> because<00:05:59.000> some<00:06:00.000> of<00:06:00.030> our<00:06:00.240> plans<00:06:00.600> change

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230
