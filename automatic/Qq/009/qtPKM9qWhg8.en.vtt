20 yards farther through the wind so not

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
20 yards farther through the wind so not
only<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.850> great<00:00:39.000> spin<00:00:39.480> rotation<00:00:40.050> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
only is it a great spin rotation but

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.350 
only is it a great spin rotation but
it's<00:00:40.590> piercing<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.610> piercing<00:00:41.969> ball<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it has much more control can actually

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.799 
it has much more control can actually
feel<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> ball<00:00:44.640> rotating<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> grooves

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:46.920> feel<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> compression<00:00:47.489> so

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you can actually feel the compression so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
you can actually feel the compression so
it's<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.270> nice<00:00:48.420> between<00:00:49.350> having<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.100> a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
to think as the ball felt a little bit

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.990 
to think as the ball felt a little bit
heavier<00:02:41.080> than<00:02:41.170> normal<00:02:41.680> but<00:02:42.070> on<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.610> green<00:02:42.820> it

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
I mean you line up the tracking lines

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.670 
I mean you line up the tracking lines
and<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.660> would<00:02:46.780> go<00:02:46.900> straight<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.500> hole<00:02:47.650> I

was<00:03:19.209> kind<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.420> interesting<00:03:19.810> because<00:03:19.900> I've

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
was kind of interesting because I've

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.800
