 as a matter of ecological awareness 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:15.299
 on the one hand, a country that produces almost 700 million tons of food per 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.019
 year 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.239
 around four tonnes per inhabitant 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:20.449
 from the other 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.630
 44 million Brazilians who are starving what is the same as the entire population

 of the states of sÃ£o paulo and rio de janeiro 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.880
 this data degenerates 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.530
 have led some people to radicalize lifestyle 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.240
 people were not left until they could not carry 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.130
 one of the solutions proposed by the institute akatu de sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.680
 is to reduce carbon consumption 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.750
 on a hectare of land only 50 kilograms can be produced while in the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.390
 even space could be harvested 22 thousand kilos of potato 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.920

 could help the practice of afghanistan 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.940
 this does not happen because of a detail of the legislation
