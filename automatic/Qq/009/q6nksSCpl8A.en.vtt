so out here today you you ran a saab 9
for<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.280> 3200<00:00:51.210> meter<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.750> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
for the 3200 meter and you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.190 
for the 3200 meter and you
in<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.260> almost<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.670> flat<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> 1600

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
in a almost a for flat for the 1600

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.950 
in a almost a for flat for the 1600
meter<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.640> about<00:00:56.760> pretty<00:00:57.210> tough<00:00:57.510> double

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
meter so it's about pretty tough double

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
I'm sure that the 3,200 wouldn't have

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.359 
I'm sure that the 3,200 wouldn't have
been<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.640> fast<00:01:12.000> without<00:01:12.119> Ryan<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.040> yeah<00:01:14.040> as<00:01:14.250> I
