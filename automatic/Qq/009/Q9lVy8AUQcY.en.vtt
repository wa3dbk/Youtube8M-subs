potatoes I think I spent a dollar fifty

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.920 
potatoes I think I spent a dollar fifty
on<00:00:36.930> them<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> pound<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.460> something<00:00:38.930> those

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

are just seed potatoes and here's the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.350 
are just seed potatoes and here's the
results<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.350> far<00:00:44.660> see<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.350> three<00:00:47.360> four

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
results so far see one two three four

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
results so far see one two three four
five<00:00:48.840> six<00:00:53.090> from<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.239> I've<00:00:54.360> seen<00:00:54.390> online<00:00:55.289> on

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
five six from what I've seen online on

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.729 
five six from what I've seen online on
YouTube<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:57.050> when<00:00:58.050> they<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.320> tall<00:00:58.530> enough

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
YouTube here when they get tall enough

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.220 
YouTube here when they get tall enough
you<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.129> bury<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.660> three<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.989> six

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you just bury them so that three to six

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.090 
you just bury them so that three to six
inches<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:01.710> showing<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.690> then<00:01:03.920> rinse<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
inches are showing and then rinse and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.250 
inches are showing and then rinse and
repeat<00:01:05.430> when<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:05.939> taller<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.479> very

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
repeat when they get taller then very

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.899 
repeat when they get taller then very
I'm<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> three<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> six<00:01:08.189> inches<00:01:08.340> until<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I'm up to three to six inches until you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.370 
I'm up to three to six inches until you
get<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> top<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.840> they'll<00:01:10.290> be

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
get to the top and then they'll be

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.750 
get to the top and then they'll be
coming<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> top<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:13.260> they

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
coming out in the top and then when they

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.230 
coming out in the top and then when they
flowered<00:01:14.760> those<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:15.930> new<00:01:16.110> potatoes

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
flowered those would be new potatoes

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
flowered those would be new potatoes
when<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> let<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> plant<00:01:18.990> die<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> guess<00:01:20.130> then

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
when you let the plant die I guess then

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
when you let the plant die I guess then
those<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:21.090> those<00:01:21.689> will<00:01:21.840> store<00:01:22.080> longer

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
those are more those will store longer

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.060 
those are more those will store longer
but<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> plan<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:24.470> using<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.619> pressure

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
