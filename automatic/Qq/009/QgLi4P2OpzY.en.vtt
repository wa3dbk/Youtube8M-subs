alright<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.580> arguably<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.089> hardest

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
alright so this is arguably the hardest

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.910 
alright so this is arguably the hardest
level<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.350> game<00:00:18.109> I<00:00:19.109> don't<00:00:19.650> think<00:00:19.710> it's

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
level in the game I don't think it's

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.140 
level in the game I don't think it's
hard<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.449> for<00:00:21.449> some<00:00:21.600> people<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.260> so

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
hard but for some people it can be so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.300 
hard but for some people it can be so

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
final setup it's not really hard at all

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.249

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.940 
stand off the last time off in this game
but<00:01:50.780> usually<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.959> do<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.349> I<00:01:52.470> give<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> fuel

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but usually what I do is I give a fuel

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.740 
but usually what I do is I give a fuel
rod<00:01:53.099> cannon<00:01:53.459> to<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:53.819> of<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.119> guys<00:01:56.000> dare<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.360> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
rod cannon to one of the guys dare and I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.059 
rod cannon to one of the guys dare and I
give<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.950> rocket<00:01:59.789> launcher<00:01:59.819> to<00:02:00.179> buck<00:02:01.069> and

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
give the rocket launcher to buck and

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.800 
give the rocket launcher to buck and
since<00:02:02.670> there's<00:02:02.880> another<00:02:03.119> rocket<00:02:03.509> launcher

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
since there's another rocket launcher

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.589 
since there's another rocket launcher
there<00:02:03.989> you<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.739> one<00:02:04.920> too<00:02:05.099> along<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:05.939> all
