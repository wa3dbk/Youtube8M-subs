 for example rain 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.020
 thus 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.040
 in that complete folder as you can see I already have it installed 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.040

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.500
 cope is the central file 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.030
 gatwick street 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.870
 regarding the way 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.870
 he replaced it all 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.930
 you copy all this again 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.070
 Here are the original models 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.030
 webber 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.400
 and enough of the models just in case if you knew how to replace and you do not like 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.530
 models with three penalties was replaced 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 copies of that folder 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.840
 you go to the desk with three bars 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 how you can die answer was not already installed

 and when I finish it takes fatal with three faults 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.460
 more modern 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.950
 we hope he ends up copying 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.950
 and we are going to run with three suits 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.830
 we enter 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.830
 I do not play meza

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.609
 pomegranate 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.009
 now if that context came yesterday 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.419
 and will go out with our with 3 30 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.479

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.189
 Search of destiny I answered new era 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.149
 folders 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:39.119
 if you get it out of your configuration 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:41.159
 it replaces like this 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.119
 and for had configuration 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.629
 you look for this file in the answer and new era 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.229
 usher pompei 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.089
 wolves remove 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.389
 and to put time to tell this country 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.679
 does not necessarily enter the console of Contepec brings from these the district 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:56.639
 server 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.689
 i here on this day a workshop 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.740
 rectify the time that lasts longer 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.729
 for example 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.179
 the file 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:09.179
 and mountains and I will answer with the time that you are looking 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.619
 and now 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.619
 we enter with 3 brings 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.829
 we take away the music 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.069
 and how can you see that it is loaded with content extracted with your configuration 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.609
 iu regrets map options 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.549
 unfortunately this way other connect with 3 30 are compatible with 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.149
 the maps of c4 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.499
 but with the hostage maps and they are compatible 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.519
 some zombie maps 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.229
 i of course the maps for more 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.229
 I recommend you rock by on this map 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.089
 Let's act with the box explaining how you woke up 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.449
 for example 9 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.449
 inception players I did not remove any option of weapons 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.290
 p 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.599
 the blank votes 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.869
 to act for example 9 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.479
 with you second they are smoking 10 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.279
 one in rd 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.599
 but what fits 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.789
 eleven 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.430
 and there we are vox 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.150
 now in another way 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.219
 for example if you want to play 

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.919
 one with 13 6 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.340
 change that mode the most accurate bombs list 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.680
 and you have entered st 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 I understand the game 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:34.479
 diges efe 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.460
 gone little join terrorists 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.460
 if you want to still have some ally down the console 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.389
 low vopium 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.479
 and put st 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.479
 as you can see added bonfatti to your team 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.979
 and that is the whole configuration in particular the malmo 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.139
 for you 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.969
 so you can train if you do not enter your house 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.099
 in this one like and oakland or three hours followed by cnec internet 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.809
 and he lost his mad part 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.750
 and I did not want to say goodbye without sending a greeting 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.159

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.979
