00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
one the thing is that I honestly believe

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.590 
one the thing is that I honestly believe
that<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:02.010> should<00:01:02.039> bump<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> saturation

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that they should bump up the saturation

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
that they should bump up the saturation
within<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> game<00:01:04.229> black<00:01:04.500> ops<00:01:04.530> 2<00:01:04.860> itself<00:01:05.280> just

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
pretty much I personally will use this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.910 
pretty much I personally will use this
one<00:01:23.790> online<00:01:23.990> unless<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.200> feel<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.650> goofing

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
one online unless I feel like goofing

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.260 
one online unless I feel like goofing
around<00:01:26.340> pretty<00:01:26.549> much<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.880> apart<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
around pretty much but apart from that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.260 
around pretty much but apart from that
this<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.720> doesn't<00:01:27.960> seem<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.710> practical

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
this one doesn't seem really practical

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.880 
this one doesn't seem really practical
next<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.810> eotech<00:01:31.259> side<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
next up for the eotech side we have the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.429 
next up for the eotech side we have the
surfboard<00:01:32.700> reticle<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.259> pretty

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
surfboard reticle this one is pretty

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.200 
surfboard reticle this one is pretty
cool<00:01:34.710> mainly<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.610> focus<00:01:36.090> on

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
cool mainly because they just focus on

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.539 
cool mainly because they just focus on
the<00:01:36.360> center<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> reticle<00:01:37.470> itself<00:01:37.829> which

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the center of the reticle itself which

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.850

bad with that reticle and they lost but

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
bad with that reticle and they lost but
at<00:01:49.560> least<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.829> also<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> new<00:01:50.460> reticle<00:01:50.909> for

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
at least we also have a new reticle for

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.940 
at least we also have a new reticle for
the<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> cock<00:01:51.540> slide<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> abyss

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the a cock slide and this is the abyss

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.340 
the a cock slide and this is the abyss
reticle<00:01:53.579> now<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.570> once<00:01:54.780> again<00:01:55.020> seems

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
reticle now this one once again seems

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.050 
reticle now this one once again seems
pretty<00:01:55.619> decent<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.100> actually<00:01:56.310> think<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
pretty decent I actually think that you

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.359 
pretty decent I actually think that you
could<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.420> well<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.619> reticle<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.219> once

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
could do well with this reticle so once

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.580 
could do well with this reticle so once
again<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.759> give<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.509> tell<00:02:01.259> me<00:02:01.380> what

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
again just give it a go and tell me what

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.980 
again just give it a go and tell me what
you<00:02:01.619> would<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:03.000> next<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.659> actually

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you would think now next up we actually

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
you would think now next up we actually
have<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> new<00:02:04.500> calling<00:02:04.979> card<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.460> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
have the new calling card and I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.889 
have the new calling card and I
personally<00:02:06.030> don't<00:02:06.210> really<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.630> one

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
personally don't really like this one

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.270 
personally don't really like this one
actually<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.320> seems<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:07.979> bit<00:02:08.129> too

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
actually it seems a little bit too

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.490 
actually it seems a little bit too
simple<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.879> ask<00:02:08.970> me<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.379> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
simple if you ask me it is really just a

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.960 
simple if you ask me it is really just a
simple<00:02:10.830> wave<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.190> basically

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
simple wave that's basically

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.790 
simple wave that's basically
it<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.240> if<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.960> like<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.410> know<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.620> give
