kind<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.849> where<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.120> don't<00:03:48.510> read<00:03:48.840> anything

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
kind of where you don't read anything

kind of where you don't read anything
you<00:03:49.799> know<00:03:49.920> from<00:03:50.219> her<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:51.000> was<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.329> was<00:03:51.510> more<00:03:51.750> of

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
you know from her so was it was more of

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.729 
you know from her so was it was more of
that<00:03:52.129> quality<00:03:53.129> I<00:03:53.430> think<00:03:53.930> we<00:03:54.930> had<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.140> hadn't

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
that quality I think we had it hadn't

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.800 
that quality I think we had it hadn't
been<00:03:55.769> different<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.579> know<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:59.510> hard<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.659> know

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
been different you know and hard to know

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.720 
been different you know and hard to know
because<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.200> know<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.620> evolves<00:04:02.430> as<00:04:02.579> you're

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
because you know it evolves as you're

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.259 
because you know it evolves as you're
doing<00:04:02.909> it<00:04:03.349> United<00:04:04.349> start<00:04:04.590> all<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.879> a<00:04:05.939> sudden

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
doing it United start all of a sudden

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.059 
doing it United start all of a sudden
you<00:04:06.359> you<00:04:06.930> look<00:04:07.170> at<00:04:07.319> something<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:07.950> go

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
you you look at something and you go

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.530 
you you look at something and you go
that<00:04:08.280> would<00:04:08.430> be<00:04:08.579> nice<00:04:08.760> for<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.060> character

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
that would be nice for that character

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.009 
that would be nice for that character
you<00:04:10.379> know<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.859> role<00:04:11.579> of<00:04:11.609> Tasha<00:04:12.060> took<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:15.019> there

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
you know the role of Tasha took on there

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.110 
you know the role of Tasha took on there
were<00:04:16.410> certain<00:04:16.739> things<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.699> weren't

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
were certain things that that weren't

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.310 
were certain things that that weren't
written<00:04:18.449> about<00:04:19.199> her<00:04:19.470> but<00:04:19.769> just<00:04:20.130> from<00:04:21.030> my<00:04:21.269> own

my own personal life I brought to it or
my<00:04:24.570> own<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.470> know<00:04:25.500> concept<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.340> how<00:04:26.460> someone

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
my own you know concept of how someone

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.170 
my own you know concept of how someone
in<00:04:27.030> that<00:04:27.150> situation<00:04:27.979> might<00:04:28.979> might<00:04:29.580> respond

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
in that situation might might respond

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.629 
in that situation might might respond
and<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:31.320> know<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.620> there<00:04:31.770> was<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:31.889> certain<00:04:32.250> kind

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
and you know so there was a certain kind

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.670 
and you know so there was a certain kind
of<00:04:32.960> inner<00:04:34.190> fragility<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.849> to<00:04:36.300> Tasha<00:04:36.570> she<00:04:37.080> had

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
of inner fragility to to Tasha she had

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.210 
of inner fragility to to Tasha she had
no<00:04:37.979> parents<00:04:38.970> had<00:04:39.449> no<00:04:39.599> family<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:40.710> know<00:04:40.830> was<00:04:41.039> it

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
no parents had no family you know was it

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.690 
no parents had no family you know was it
was<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.400> was<00:04:42.090> a

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
was a was a

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.580 
was a was a
survivor<00:04:44.700> and<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.389> was<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.510> victim<00:04:46.020> as<00:04:46.230> a<00:04:46.260> child

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
survivor and it was a victim as a child

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.480 
survivor and it was a victim as a child
and<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.870> in<00:04:49.080> decorah<00:04:49.710> far<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.190> pretty

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
and so in that in decorah far is pretty

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.390 
and so in that in decorah far is pretty
pretty<00:04:51.300> fragile<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:52.320> even<00:04:53.010> though<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:54.270> great

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
pretty fragile and even though the great

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.580 
pretty fragile and even though the great
contrast<00:04:56.400> for<00:04:56.850> being<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.210> physically<00:04:57.870> able

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
contrast for being so physically able

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.970 
contrast for being so physically able
and<00:04:59.190> so<00:04:59.790> seemingly<00:05:00.389> able<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.440> handle<00:05:01.830> any

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
and so seemingly able to handle any

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.670 
and so seemingly able to handle any
situation<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.970> fact<00:05:03.300> inside<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.290> her<00:05:04.410> she<00:05:04.560> was

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
situation in fact inside of her she was

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.390 
situation in fact inside of her she was
quite<00:05:07.280> scared<00:05:09.230> so<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.500> was<00:05:10.770> always<00:05:11.040> trying<00:05:11.220> to

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
quite scared so I was always trying to

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.629 
quite scared so I was always trying to
find<00:05:12.000> ways<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.780> kind<00:05:13.230> of<00:05:13.380> let<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.430> out<00:05:14.490> a

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
find ways to kind of let that out a

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.450 
find ways to kind of let that out a
little<00:05:15.000> bit<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.810> know<00:05:16.010> certainty<00:05:17.010> come

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
little bit you know certainty come
