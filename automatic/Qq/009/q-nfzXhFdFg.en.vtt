00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.419
 hello if it does not exist or that I am very well 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.759
 this time I want to give you some advice 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.219
 which is short but simple 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.650
 useful especially for all lovers 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.110
 of the top architecture a council 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.240
 about how can we 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.790
 photograph our designs our 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.060
 constructions in a way that 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.340
 appreciate all the exterior including 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.710
 course the roof of until the last 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.140
 plant of our construction by 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.059
 example if I wanted to take a picture of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.890
 this design that I just did that is 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.800
 one of the most recent in fact up 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.370
 the moment is by the way a house based 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.620
 in the Mediterranean style and good here 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 we have the incognito of photography not what 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 pressed 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 well it was an ugly medium factory but what 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.070
 what I wanted to show you is that this part 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.579
 from here it is not appreciated well in the photo 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 that I took because you can not see the roof of 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.519
 my last floor then when I took 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.399
 a picture of the whole house, yes, a 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.970
 the best if you can see all the 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:11.340
 garden and pretty much of the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.670
 outside but this room in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.470
 specific is not going to look good and from what 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.390
 way some cinemas will be solved 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.300
 for example we have here the option in the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.760
 home store 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.030
 of the roofs for example if I 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.640
 I want to change the roof for example to 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.910
 the green tiles good a 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.990
 little more complete the house but still 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.300
 so this thing here keeps getting in the way 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.070
 photography of my design 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.990
 and well I also have to be 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.110
 calculating so that the medium leaves the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.180
 good picture the house or the design come out 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.340
 complete in the photograph then good 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.580
 what can we do to not be dealing 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.010
 with all this 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.940
 it's very simple let's use the hack 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.580
 to make skyscrapers is exactly the 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.380
 same hack the steps steps and if 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.090
 you do not know yet how to do 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.430
 skyscraper or how to install the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.890
 programs that are required above all 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.480
 to make skyscrapers I invite you to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.720
 check the videos that I'm going to leave in the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.340
 description of this same video that there 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.380
 I will leave the links for you 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.420
 can see the tutorials since 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.160
 it is not the purpose of this video but 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.560
 just give them quick advice 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.100
 what I'm going to do then to give them 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.880
 an example of this is to modify the value 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.380
 of this this part of the building that 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.400
 you are seeing here that you have 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.170
 four plants I'm going to modify it to 8 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.260
 using the program that usually I 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.400
 I occupy to make my vacations once 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.100
 that I'm here in the menu 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.670
 construction of flats I'm going to go 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.080
 the program well this is the one that I 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.300
 I use but if you use 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.460
 others can use that other program 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.740
 with the sad if they are used to 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.370
 work and I'm going to put the number here 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.370
 four 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.090
 it brings me back to the game 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.010
 I'll buy a fifth plant is 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:19.480
 quite expensive by the way and good now 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.760
 I'm going again someone well 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.920
 number 5 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.580
 the list of results is going 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.580
 smaller 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.519
 how can I keep building 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.969
 plants I will eliminate the plant number 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.030
 5 that I had built and I go back to 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:42.550
 number that I had initially that 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.370
 they are 4 plants 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.250
 again come back to game at number 4 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.610
 and now my total results are 8 already 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.490
 it's quite minor since there are very few 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.980
 results is useful for this point already 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.360
 I can perform my daughter and I am 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.160
 erasing all the results that 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.810
 they only have a sportiness for 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.700
 removable equipment does not serve me but 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.520
 well this depends on the program that 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.370
 you are using and now I am going to 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.150
 modify the results to the number 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.150
 8 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.130
 but the game 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.760
 the most important step of all is to make 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.800
 like we modified a room 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.510
 but actually I'm going to give it to the cache and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.950
 this means that the little arrow does not appear anymore 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.830
 to keep watching 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.130
 the supposed upper floors that I have 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.620
 that are eight supposedly but in 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.550
 This is going to help me 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.830
 from the imaginary plant number eight 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.820
 I can take the pictures that my 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.440
 construction to my liking as you can see 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.100
 this number of plants that I have put is 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.010
 more than enough to be able 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.849
 and visualize the whole construction in a 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.309
 single take 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.919
 Now I can take the photograph now 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:08.039
 be incognito of photography yo 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.949
 personally I do not like it that much because 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:14.189
 I feel that the image comes out a little 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.469
 low quality in my case I take the 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.809
 screenshots when you can 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:21.569
 mainly with the proper function of 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:23.459
 my device and I have an ipad like that 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.610
 that in my case the photographs are taken 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:29.009
 with the home button and the rest button 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.029
 pressing them at the same time but if 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.249
 you have another device 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:34.999
 obviously, I guess the steps 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.999
 they will change 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.120
 I will take the pictures to my liking 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.450
 well at the moment I finished doing 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.330
 all the shots to my taste if more 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.370
 I want to take more pictures 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.160
 to my house because web I can go back to 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.810
 repeat the same steps now I 'm going to 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.650
 go to the city view a moment to 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.680
 show them something 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.009
 and that remained apparently deformed 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.410
 for the eight floors that I modify 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.860
 but this is not a problem because 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:21.490
 we can erase those you can delete these 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.490
 plants to spare without any problem 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.340
 from the floor construction menu 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:34.960
 so my construction will be again the 

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:37.259
 same as before 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.330
 but I'll have already taken those 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:42.580
 spectacular photographs 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.099
 Well, that's all for now, as you see 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.449
 it's a pretty simple advice if 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:49.240
 we already have the 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:51.310
 tools to make skyscrapers and if 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.099
 no good I reiterate that there I leave you 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.780
 the links the links an inscription of 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.389
 my video so they learn to do it 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.039
 I hope this is useful for you 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.379
 all to all and marc and texts so 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.599
 talented people out there and good 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:08.909
 without anything else to add I say goodbye and 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:08.909
 I see them until the Box Montero Chao
