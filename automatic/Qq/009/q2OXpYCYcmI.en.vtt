is down and everything but when I go

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.350 
is down and everything but when I go
further<00:03:32.709> when<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.310> do<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.580> little<00:03:33.880> bit<00:03:34.030> longer

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
further when I do a little bit longer

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.440 
further when I do a little bit longer
than<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:34.959> then<00:03:35.860> there's<00:03:36.160> something<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:37.239> is

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
than that then there's something that is

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.720 
than that then there's something that is
the<00:03:37.930> point<00:03:38.230> where<00:03:38.530> magic<00:03:38.709> is<00:03:39.010> happening<00:03:39.580> that

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
the point where magic is happening that

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.060 
the point where magic is happening that
is<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.880> point<00:03:40.239> where<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.810> actually<00:03:41.070> find

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
is the point where I can actually find

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.729 
is the point where I can actually find
something<00:03:42.310> out<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.120> like<00:03:43.630> not<00:03:44.049> conscious

right now or actually I can jump on that

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.380 
right now or actually I can jump on that
like<00:03:48.880> higher<00:03:49.269> level<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.900> consciousness<00:03:50.350> and

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
like higher level of consciousness and
