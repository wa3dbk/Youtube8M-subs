00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
to play more shooters with the cops and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.230 
to play more shooters with the cops and
robbers<00:01:31.290> theme<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.830> on<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.370> think<00:01:33.030> there

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
robbers theme going on I think there

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.150 
robbers theme going on I think there
needs<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.780> more<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.320> them<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.740> there<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
needs to be more of them and there was a

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.340 
needs to be more of them and there was a
point<00:01:35.460> where<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> wondered<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.050> day<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
point where I wondered what a day to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
point where I wondered what a day to
would<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.830> like<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.610> cops<00:01:38.850> could<00:01:39.210> be

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
would be like if the cops could be

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
would be like if the cops could be
controlled<00:01:39.810> by<00:01:40.020> players<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> graphics

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
controlled by players and the graphics

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.820 
controlled by players and the graphics
were<00:01:41.520> given<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.940> massive<00:01:42.330> overhaul<00:01:42.830> hardline

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
were given a massive overhaul hardline

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.860 
were given a massive overhaul hardline
turned<00:01:44.160> out<00:01:44.400> to<00:01:44.580> be<00:01:44.760> DA's<00:01:45.060> answer<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
turned out to be DA's answer to that

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.710 
turned out to be DA's answer to that
question<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.650> found<00:01:47.340> playing<00:01:47.850> hard<00:01:48.120> line<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> lot

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
question I found playing hard line a lot

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.020 
question I found playing hard line a lot
more<00:01:49.020> satisfying<00:01:49.740> than<00:01:49.890> playing<00:01:50.310> any<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.910> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
more satisfying than playing any of the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.210 
more satisfying than playing any of the
other<00:01:51.240> battlefields<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.260> think<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.190> was

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
other battlefields I think it was

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.460 
other battlefields I think it was
largely<00:01:53.760> due<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.420> lack<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.630> tanks<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
largely due to the lack of tanks in the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.040 
largely due to the lack of tanks in the
game<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:56.250> felt<00:01:56.730> more<00:01:57.030> free<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.480> roam<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.870> map

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
game so I felt more free to roam the map

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.800 
game so I felt more free to roam the map
in<00:01:58.320> fast<00:01:58.620> vehicles<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.430> never<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.570> liked

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
in fast vehicles I never really liked

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.080 
in fast vehicles I never really liked
tanks<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.320> battlefield<00:02:01.950> I've<00:02:02.280> always<00:02:02.670> thought

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
tanks in battlefield I've always thought

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.220 
tanks in battlefield I've always thought
