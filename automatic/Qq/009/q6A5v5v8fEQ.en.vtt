00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.539
 wheels of one of the main pieces of this 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.949
 models is a suspension like her 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.949
 works you see on video 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 essentially the only functions that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.990
 possess this car it's a turn 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.450
 wheels and turning as rear 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.970
 so and the front wheels that helps 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 reduce turning radius if 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.050
 view this on board from the point 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.080
 view of a set of parts then the greatest 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.880
 interest u present all the details 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.580
 suspension related 2 yellow 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.210
 gear knoby two long and steering 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.880
 slats 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.280
 Well , in fact, everything here can still be attributed 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.039
 here are these big wheels although they are not 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 is a rare detail 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.450
 if you are a fan of collecting models just 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.340
 put on the shelf something big for you 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 minus appearance will be big 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.759
 hole in the trunk but it is always possible 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.069
 modify the most stickers from this 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.800
 I did not use the set as I will sort it out 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.959
 its on the details but show you the picture on 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.740
 which you can check out like this 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.740
 will be with them 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.380
 generally speaking, I do not recommend 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.990
 you this kit for purchase 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.220
 just because you can save a little 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.890
 more and buy a crawler 98 93 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.680
 there are all the same features but available 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.540
 remote control can be said 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.540
 what is the playability of this model 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.000
 almost missing but this is just mine 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.190

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.320
