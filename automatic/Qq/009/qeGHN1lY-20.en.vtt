but<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.300> think<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.290> acknowledgement<00:01:14.100> for

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
but I think the acknowledgement for

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.300 
but I think the acknowledgement for
himself<00:01:15.560> finding<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.800> he<00:01:17.010> was<00:01:17.130> happy

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
himself finding out that he was happy

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.360 
himself finding out that he was happy
and<00:01:17.730> possibly<00:01:18.330> grounded<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.920> than<00:01:20.130> he<00:01:20.220> has

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
and possibly grounded more than he has

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.130 
and possibly grounded more than he has
been<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.760> last<00:01:20.940> ten<00:01:21.390> years<00:01:21.420> because<00:01:21.930> now

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
been in the last ten years because now

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710 
been in the last ten years because now
he<00:01:22.410> may<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.160> safe<00:01:23.400> more<00:01:23.730> secure<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.450> people

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
he may be safe more secure with people

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.580 
he may be safe more secure with people
he<00:01:24.840> loves

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.370 

I<00:01:27.619> think<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:29.060> really<00:01:29.360> important<00:01:29.869> and<00:01:30.049> a

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
I think that is really important and a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.580 
I think that is really important and a
big<00:01:30.590> life<00:01:31.159> hurdle<00:01:31.640> for<00:01:31.670> alder<00:01:32.240> have<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.320> felt

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
big life hurdle for alder have you felt

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.590 
big life hurdle for alder have you felt
like<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.890> ambassador<00:01:34.579> of<00:01:34.610> arrow<00:01:35.060> on<00:01:35.420> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
like the ambassador of arrow on the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.520 
like the ambassador of arrow on the
flash<00:01:35.869> crossovers<00:01:37.659> not<00:01:38.659> really<00:01:39.079> I<00:01:39.110> find<00:01:39.380> that

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
flash crossovers not really I find that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.029 
flash crossovers not really I find that
she<00:01:39.710> has<00:01:39.829> a<00:01:39.860> really<00:01:40.130> important<00:01:40.850> role<00:01:42.039> in

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
she has a really important role in

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.380 
she has a really important role in
connecting<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:44.689> worlds<00:01:45.170> because<00:01:45.770> she's<00:01:46.039> so

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
connecting the worlds because she's so

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.149 
connecting the worlds because she's so
