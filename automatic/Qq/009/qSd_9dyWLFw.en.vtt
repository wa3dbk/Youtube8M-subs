when I was doc I make doc likes to pick

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.270 
when I was doc I make doc likes to pick
the<00:04:43.280> stage<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.610> this<00:04:43.700> box<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.240> just<00:04:44.690> feel<00:04:44.840> like

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
the stage in this box I just feel like

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.730 
the stage in this box I just feel like
it's<00:04:46.280> easier<00:04:46.820> to<00:04:46.970> trap<00:04:47.270> Fox<00:04:47.600> it's<00:04:48.290> a<00:04:48.470> small

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
it's easier to trap Fox it's a small

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.409 
it's easier to trap Fox it's a small
space<00:04:48.889> but<00:04:49.250> it's<00:04:49.400> not<00:04:49.550> like<00:04:49.760> yo<00:04:49.970> she's<00:04:50.210> in<00:04:50.330> a

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
space but it's not like yo she's in a

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.940 
space but it's not like yo she's in a
sense<00:04:50.630> consists<00:04:51.050> of<00:04:51.110> platforms<00:04:51.590> are<00:04:51.680> moving

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
sense consists of platforms are moving

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.430 
sense consists of platforms are moving
and<00:04:52.040> kind<00:04:52.220> of<00:04:52.310> like<00:04:52.430> messes<00:04:53.419> like<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.660> think<00:04:53.900> the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
and kind of like messes like I think the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.290 
and kind of like messes like I think the
platform's<00:04:55.100> mess<00:04:55.280> up<00:04:55.460> faster<00:04:55.910> characters

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
platform's mess up faster characters

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.270 
platform's mess up faster characters
like<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:56.990> think<00:04:57.200> that's<00:04:57.320> why<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.470> but<00:04:57.830> here's

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
like I think that's why I but here's

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.430 
like I think that's why I but here's
what<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.460> think<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.880> think<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.690> object<00:05:00.320> of

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
what I think I think that the object of

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.010 
what I think I think that the object of
that<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.370> think<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.760> this<00:05:02.660> stages

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
that is that I think that this stages

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.840 
that is that I think that this stages
actually<00:05:03.440> takes<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.010> most<00:05:04.160> excellent<00:05:04.669> again

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
actually takes the most excellent again

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.909 
actually takes the most excellent again
but<00:05:05.360> just<00:05:05.510> people<00:05:05.750> mess<00:05:05.900> up<00:05:06.080> more<00:05:06.320> that's<00:05:06.740> true

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
but just people mess up more that's true

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.680 
but just people mess up more that's true
it's<00:05:07.039> like<00:05:07.220> because<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.150> platforms

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
it's like because of the platforms

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.330 
it's like because of the platforms
because<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:09.139> how<00:05:09.229> creative<00:05:09.919> you<00:05:09.950> have<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.250> be

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
because you how creative you have to be

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.969 
because you how creative you have to be
with<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.639> yeah<00:05:11.320> it<00:05:12.320> actually<00:05:12.440> takes<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.830> most

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
with it yeah it actually takes the most

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.710 
with it yeah it actually takes the most
movement<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.580> adaptation<00:05:14.419> you<00:05:14.510> ever<00:05:14.600> get

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
movement and adaptation you ever get

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.450 
movement and adaptation you ever get
your<00:05:14.750> wave<00:05:14.990> lands<00:05:15.229> like<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.680> different<00:05:16.220> angle

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
your wave lands like a different angle

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.550 
your wave lands like a different angle
like<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.669> whole<00:05:16.789> time<00:05:17.200> treatment<00:05:18.200> I'm<00:05:18.320> your

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
like the whole time treatment I'm your

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.870 
like the whole time treatment I'm your
shield<00:05:18.800> dropping<00:05:19.130> matters<00:05:19.340> more<00:05:19.550> here<00:05:19.789> than
