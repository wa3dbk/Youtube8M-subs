00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.620 

oK<00:00:07.160> you've<00:00:07.400> learned<00:00:08.360> three<00:00:08.660> notes<00:00:09.280> C<00:00:10.280> B<00:00:10.880> and<00:00:11.120> D

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
oK you've learned three notes C B and D

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.860 
oK you've learned three notes C B and D
and<00:00:11.900> you're<00:00:12.890> almost<00:00:13.040> halfway<00:00:13.519> through<00:00:13.870> the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
and you're almost halfway through the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.009 
and you're almost halfway through the
task<00:00:15.139> of<00:00:15.440> learning<00:00:15.470> the<00:00:15.830> seven<00:00:16.189> natural<00:00:16.369> notes

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:17.019 
task of learning the seven natural notes

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.919 
task of learning the seven natural notes
there's<00:00:18.019> a<00:00:18.079> couple<00:00:18.230> things<00:00:18.409> I<00:00:18.589> want<00:00:18.740> to<00:00:18.769> say

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:19.929 
there's a couple things I want to say

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.659 
there's a couple things I want to say
first<00:00:20.929> is<00:00:21.169> a<00:00:21.439> lot<00:00:21.890> of<00:00:22.009> people<00:00:22.189> know<00:00:22.369> what's

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:22.669 
first is a lot of people know what's

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.939 
first is a lot of people know what's
called<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:23.089> octave<00:00:23.539> technique<00:00:24.079> which<00:00:24.679> means

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
called the octave technique which means

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.859 
called the octave technique which means
if<00:00:25.159> you<00:00:25.279> know<00:00:25.460> this<00:00:26.449> shape<00:00:28.479> you<00:00:29.479> know<00:00:29.630> what

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
if you know this shape you know what

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.799 
if you know this shape you know what
that<00:00:30.019> note<00:00:30.259> is<00:00:30.439> because<00:00:30.739> it's<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.279> same<00:00:31.809> based

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
that note is because it's the same based

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.470 
that note is because it's the same based
on<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.170> shape<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:33.649> an<00:00:33.769> octave<00:00:34.250> I<00:00:37.300> don't<00:00:38.300> want

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
on the shape of an octave I don't want

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.180 
on the shape of an octave I don't want
you<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.660> do<00:00:38.809> that<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.940> it<00:00:40.940> takes<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.239> lot<00:00:41.420> of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
you to do that and it takes a lot of

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.279 
you to do that and it takes a lot of
practice<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.219> break<00:00:43.609> that<00:00:43.789> habit<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.960> try<00:00:45.170> and

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
practice to break that habit to try and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.729 
practice to break that habit to try and
fun<00:00:45.469> but<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.190> will<00:00:46.339> be<00:00:46.489> rewarded<00:00:47.059> if<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.739> do

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
fun but you will be rewarded if you do

okay<00:01:01.929> so<00:01:02.929> we've<00:01:03.170> learned<00:01:03.469> C<00:01:04.060> B<00:01:05.060> and<00:01:05.290> D<00:01:07.420> now<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
okay so we've learned C B and D now the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.990 
okay so we've learned C B and D now the
next<00:01:09.110> set<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.530> notes<00:01:10.160> we're<00:01:10.430> going<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.820> learn

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
next set of notes we're going to learn

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.560 
next set of notes we're going to learn
are<00:01:11.300> going<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.870> be<00:01:11.990> F<00:01:12.200> E<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.220> G<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.180> reason<00:01:14.480> why

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
are going to be F E and G the reason why

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.600 
are going to be F E and G the reason why
we're<00:01:14.780> learning<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.230> notes<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:15.680> this<00:01:15.890> order

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
we're learning the notes in this order

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.710 
we're learning the notes in this order
is<00:01:16.760> because<00:01:17.240> there's<00:01:17.480> a<00:01:17.540> relationship

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
is because there's a relationship

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.160 
is because there's a relationship
there's<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.810> pattern<00:01:21.260> that<00:01:22.150> helps

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
there's a pattern that helps

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.070 
there's a pattern that helps
memorization<00:01:25.570> when<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.660> know<00:01:26.780> when<00:01:27.050> you

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
memorization when you know when you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.850 
memorization when you know when you
learn<00:01:27.260> C<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.910> B<00:01:29.120> is<00:01:29.420> right<00:01:29.690> behind<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.620> one

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
learn C the B is right behind it one

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.900 
learn C the B is right behind it one
fret<00:01:31.160> and<00:01:32.050> D<00:01:33.050> is<00:01:33.350> one<00:01:33.770> whole<00:01:34.040> step<00:01:34.190> higher<00:01:34.610> than

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
fret and D is one whole step higher than

in<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.250> same<00:01:39.840> relationship<00:01:40.840> f<00:01:41.940> has<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:42.970> note

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
in the same relationship f has a note

G<00:01:52.540> so<00:02:00.240> we're<00:02:01.240> gonna<00:02:01.330> start<00:02:01.660> with<00:02:01.750> F<00:02:02.080> as<00:02:02.350> our

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
G so we're gonna start with F as our

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.460 
G so we're gonna start with F as our
pivot<00:02:04.090> our<00:02:04.440> anchor<00:02:05.440> note<00:02:05.790> our<00:02:06.790> home<00:02:07.120> base<00:02:07.470> for

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
pivot our anchor note our home base for

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.530 
pivot our anchor note our home base for
the<00:02:08.530> second<00:02:08.890> half<00:02:09.070> of<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.540> memorization

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
the second half of this memorization

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.300 
the second half of this memorization
process<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.610> f<00:02:12.880> on<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.510> high<00:02:13.660> E<00:02:13.690> string<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:14.310> on

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
process so f on the high E string is on
