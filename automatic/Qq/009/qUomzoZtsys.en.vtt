00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
idea at a time

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
idea at a time
I<00:01:10.409> actually<00:01:10.860> prefer<00:01:11.310> baking<00:01:12.000> them<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.420> frying

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I actually prefer baking them to frying

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.210 
I actually prefer baking them to frying
them<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> makes<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> process<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
them because it makes the process go a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
them because it makes the process go a
little<00:01:14.430> faster<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.119> starting<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:15.810> first

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
little faster I'm starting with my first

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
little faster I'm starting with my first
tortilla<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.890> frying<00:01:17.100> pan<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.729> that

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
tortilla in my frying pan and to that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.249 
tortilla in my frying pan and to that
I'm<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.360> add<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> layer<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.049> cheese

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.530 
I'm going to add a layer of cheese
cheese<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.340> critical<00:01:20.909> because<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.330> really

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
cheese is critical because it's really

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.210 
cheese is critical because it's really
the<00:01:21.659> glue<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.259> keeps<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.650> quesadillas
