alright we're back with straight bar as

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.770 
alright we're back with straight bar as
it's<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.290> straight<00:00:07.589> bar<00:00:07.830> barbell<00:00:08.370> curls<00:00:09.210> state

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780

barbell<00:00:12.090> curls<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.019> mass<00:00:13.259> builder<00:00:13.710> so

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
barbell curls is the mass builder so

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.220 
barbell curls is the mass builder so
just<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.370> we<00:00:14.549> did<00:00:14.759> heavy<00:00:15.450> bench<00:00:15.719> pressing

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
just like we did heavy bench pressing

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
just like we did heavy bench pressing
first<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.770> straight<00:00:17.070> bar<00:00:17.310> which<00:00:17.550> was<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
first with a straight bar which was the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.359 
first with a straight bar which was the
mass<00:00:18.029> builder<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.539> chest<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.859> instance

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
mass builder for chest in this instance

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.820 
mass builder for chest in this instance
we're<00:00:20.699> using<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.090> straight<00:00:21.449> bar<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.380> curls

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
we're using a straight bar for the curls

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.830 
we're using a straight bar for the curls
it's<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.160> compound<00:00:23.609> movement<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> recruits

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's a compound movement and it recruits

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.140 
it's a compound movement and it recruits
a<00:00:25.050> lot<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.439> muscle<00:00:25.740> fiber<00:00:25.980> requires<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.880> lot<00:00:27.119> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
a lot of muscle fiber requires a lot of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.029 
a lot of muscle fiber requires a lot of
strength<00:00:27.570> energy<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> mouse

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
strength energy but it is the mouse

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.009

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
little hit a red line to keep our energy

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.209 
little hit a red line to keep our energy
levels<00:00:37.649> up<00:00:41.149> I<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> medium<00:00:43.320> grip<00:00:43.590> kind<00:00:44.129> of

do two sets close and to set slide I'm

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.550 
do two sets close and to set slide I'm
going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> demonstrate<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:28.049> little<00:01:28.290> closer

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

is<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.009> bicep<00:01:32.579> bi<00:01:32.909> meaning<00:01:33.240> two<00:01:33.360> has<00:01:33.840> two

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
is the bicep bi meaning two has two

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.460 
is the bicep bi meaning two has two
heads<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.310> works<00:01:35.579> both<00:01:35.820> heads<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.479> take
