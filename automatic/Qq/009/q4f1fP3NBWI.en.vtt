00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
well okay so now we're going to test the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.470 
well okay so now we're going to test the
pH<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.380> water<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:45.400> system<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.970> quoted

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
pH of this water this system is quoted

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.500 
pH of this water this system is quoted
for<00:02:46.690> 11<00:02:47.290> plus<00:02:47.950> ph<00:02:48.700> depending<00:02:49.270> upon<00:02:49.360> your

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
source water at level 4 let's see what

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:05.960 
source water at level 4 let's see what
we<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:53.020> here

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.730 

so<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.140> quickly<00:03:07.590> climbing<00:03:08.040> past<00:03:08.430> 11<00:03:09.290> up<00:03:10.290> past

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
so it's quickly climbing past 11 up past

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.760 
so it's quickly climbing past 11 up past
11<00:03:11.340> 111<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:13.790> almost<00:03:14.790> 11<00:03:15.270> 3<00:03:15.630> this<00:03:16.500> system

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
11 111 to almost 11 3 this system

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.440 
11 111 to almost 11 3 this system
because<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.510> 11<00:03:19.320> plates<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.730> 800

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
because of the 11 plates and the 800

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.660 
because of the 11 plates and the 800
watts<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.810> power<00:03:21.960> is<00:03:22.320> really<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> be

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
watts of power is really going to be

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.480 
watts of power is really going to be
able<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.060> deliver<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:25.290> high<00:03:25.680> ph<00:03:26.160> water

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
able to deliver this high ph water

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.750 
able to deliver this high ph water
without<00:03:27.300> any<00:03:27.860> solutions<00:03:28.860> added<00:03:29.280> into<00:03:29.640> the

without any solutions added into the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.380 
without any solutions added into the
system<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:31.760> you'll<00:03:32.760> see<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.150> still

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
system and you'll see it's still

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.050 
system and you'll see it's still
climbing<00:03:33.780> we<00:03:34.020> have<00:03:34.170> almost<00:03:34.550> 11.4<00:03:35.550> here<00:03:35.850> and

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
climbing we have almost 11.4 here and

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.820 
climbing we have almost 11.4 here and
again<00:03:36.780> that's<00:03:36.960> going<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.290> depend<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.710> little

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
again that's going to depend a little

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.310 
again that's going to depend a little
