00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
of special attack to work with it's a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.439 
of special attack to work with it's a
rock<00:00:19.980> water<00:00:20.250> type<00:00:20.550> as<00:00:20.789> well<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.270> means

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
rock water type as well which means

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.640 
rock water type as well which means
we're<00:00:21.689> actually<00:00:21.779> starting<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.260> see<00:00:22.350> something

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
we're actually starting to see something

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.710 
we're actually starting to see something
that<00:00:22.859> gives<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.490> more<00:00:23.720> resistances

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
that gives you a lot more resistances

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.150 
that gives you a lot more resistances
well<00:00:25.019> not<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> lot<00:00:25.320> more<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.769> least<00:00:25.949> more

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
well not a lot more but at least more

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.429 
well not a lot more but at least more
resistances<00:00:26.760> then<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.570> weaknesses<00:00:28.050> you

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
resistances then we then weaknesses you

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
resistances then we then weaknesses you
are<00:00:28.619> four<00:00:28.830> times<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.070> week<00:00:29.160> against<00:00:29.429> grass<00:00:29.699> so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
are four times a week against grass so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.060 
are four times a week against grass so
try<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.480> avoid<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.170> much<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.380> possible

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
try to avoid that as much as possible

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.290 
try to avoid that as much as possible
you<00:00:32.279> also<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.550> weakness<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> electric

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
you also have weakness to electric

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.420 
you also have weakness to electric
ground<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.809> fighting<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.500> overall<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:35.399> too

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
ground and fighting but overall not too

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.760 
ground and fighting but overall not too
bad<00:00:35.850> let's<00:00:36.300> hop<00:00:36.480> into<00:00:36.630> Pokemon<00:00:36.989> showdown<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
bad let's hop into Pokemon showdown and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.979 
bad let's hop into Pokemon showdown and
then<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.250> see<00:00:38.430> why<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.360> star<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.780> good

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
then we see why on the star so good

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.410 
then we see why on the star so good
because<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> focus<00:00:42.239> sash

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
because it's going to be a focus sash

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.900 
because it's going to be a focus sash
Pokemon<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.469> uses<00:00:43.890> shell<00:00:44.190> smash<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.730> don't

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
Pokemon that uses shell smash you don't

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.190 
Pokemon that uses shell smash you don't
really<00:00:45.030> need<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> worry<00:00:45.480> about<00:00:45.660> anything<00:00:45.960> else

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
really need to worry about anything else

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.110 
really need to worry about anything else
at<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.500> point<00:00:46.739> now<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> need<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.879> is

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
at that point now what you need to do is

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.439 
at that point now what you need to do is
just<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> 252<00:00:49.860> speed<00:00:50.190> 252<00:00:51.120> special

going to be the problem here and a lot
of<00:02:49.810> them<00:02:49.930> are<00:02:50.140> going<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.380> hit<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.590> super

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
of them are going to hit you super

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.530 
of them are going to hit you super
effective<00:02:51.280> which<00:02:51.430> could<00:02:51.700> be<00:02:51.820> even<00:02:52.300> more

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
effective which could be even more

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.600 
effective which could be even more
problem<00:02:52.959> after<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.010> was<00:02:54.160> also<00:02:54.430> thinking

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
problem after that I was also thinking

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.420 
problem after that I was also thinking
that<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.060> could<00:02:55.270> use<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.630> as<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:56.020> setup<00:02:56.830> Pokemon

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
that you could use it as a setup Pokemon

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.310 
that you could use it as a setup Pokemon
instead<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.270> a<00:02:58.360> sweeping<00:02:58.720> kind<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:58.989> Pokemon

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
instead of a sweeping kind of Pokemon

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.440 
instead of a sweeping kind of Pokemon
that<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.830> use<00:03:00.010> shell<00:03:00.250> smash<00:03:00.550> with<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.209> focus

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
that you use shell smash with that focus

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.540 
that you use shell smash with that focus
ash<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.020> now<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.230> have<00:03:02.530> pretty<00:03:02.980> much<00:03:03.070> out

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
ash and now you have pretty much out

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.550 
ash and now you have pretty much out
speed<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.120> your<00:03:04.150> opponent<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:05.020> set<00:03:05.200> up<00:03:05.290> stealth

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
just like this idea because instead of

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.100 
just like this idea because instead of
using<00:03:26.680> focus<00:03:27.310> ash<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:27.820> set<00:03:28.209> up<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.540> stealth<00:03:28.900> rock

power is stealth rocks it's kind of

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.100 
power is stealth rocks it's kind of
taking<00:03:42.310> my<00:03:42.400> extra<00:03:42.820> coverage<00:03:43.239> for<00:03:43.660> sweeping

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
two that can work as well then we also

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.740 
two that can work as well then we also
just<00:03:48.250> have<00:03:48.400> Swiss<00:03:48.760> swim<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.269> almost<00:03:49.630> are

speed<00:03:52.269> is<00:03:52.420> double<00:03:52.780> well<00:03:52.989> that<00:03:53.230> means<00:03:53.500> we<00:03:53.769> can

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
speed is double well that means we can

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.280 
speed is double well that means we can
just<00:03:53.980> set<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:54.970> up<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.209> rain<00:03:55.450> team<00:03:55.720> either<00:03:55.959> in

like<00:03:58.209> if<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.930> could<00:03:59.080> get<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.590> work<00:03:59.620> you

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
like if you could get it to work you

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.860 
like if you could get it to work you
have<00:04:00.400> some<00:04:00.700> other<00:04:00.850> options<00:04:01.390> here<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.720> this

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
have some other options here that this

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.390
