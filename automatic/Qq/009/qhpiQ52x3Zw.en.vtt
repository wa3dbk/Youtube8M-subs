 it was okay you 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.720
 Today's Video A Video That Matters 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.240
 A lot of people today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.580
 How is my man's diet like? 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.590
 a lot of people ask me on the page judged 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.780
 What diet do you eat that is 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.210
 like before training after training 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.610
 How many calories do you eat per day? 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.800
 It was your diet like when you started and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.510
 as you now have many doubts that 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.300
 revolves around this not the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.309
 Weight loss focuses on even segmentation 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.800
 So talk a little bit to you today. 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.899
 how's my good eating going? 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.730
 training every day at the time of the judgment 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.630
 a lot of people know that I train 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.480
 everyday 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.340
 From 6 in the morning until 7 in the morning 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.050
 Wow, but just an order and stay the day. 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.670
 whole in the gym is not what I 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.340
 I want to pass on to you so you can win. 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.110
 a nice body what matters is not all 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.509
 Time you train, how many hours? 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.300
 hours, you are dedicated to taking care of your 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.520
 This is how I eat. 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.800
 day at four thirty in the morning and 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.350
 rolling up to five type with the cellphone 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.570
 sleep a little sleep five 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.330
 hours every day before my 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.130
 workout I drink black coffee with sugar is the 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.290
 Only place I put sugar in the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.000
 My food in the cafe I can not 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.040
 have coffee with sweetener not yet 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.590
 I was able to make sense but I put a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.229
 little bit to dance and I also count 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.820
 packed with some protein to 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.400
 me and energy in training because the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.409
 tapioca is a rapid carbohydrate 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.390
 then the body is 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.580
 waking fast must rain quickly 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.500
 and will give me a base of energy and the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.930
 time is usually stuffed 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.820
 tapioca or with chicken and curd or 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.159
 then a ham and cheese that for me is 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.470
 normal and ham and regular cheese 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.180
 I used to eat turkey ham 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.729
 but here on the big field very difficult 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.510
 already without a car without them and smoked 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.820
 smoked 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.300
 I really like it and gave it like brand ham. 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.520
 which has less sodium and with and as 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.520
 would be normal started with once a day 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.760
 no problem we show she was born 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.320
 with being in itself only once lost before 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.420
 there are many people who say that 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.040
 I said before the training is very good in the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.440
 which does very well but I think 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.420
 This goes from person to person and to me. 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.520
 You're being super good when you come back. 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.130
 currently taking one dose and 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.710
 with water around nine o'clock in the 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.200
 I'm going to eat breakfast tomorrow, too. 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.630
 serves to recover the energy lost in the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.180
 train I usually eat a carbohydrate or 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.240
 protein also often varies with 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.760
 a stuffed whole-wheat bread sandwich or 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.670
 so I eat a tapioca or else I 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.830
 as the died boot with granola but is 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.320
 and I have been as long as I am. 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.450
 avoiding medicine really then it is 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.550
 this basically by nine in the morning I 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.590
 I will not if I go and train on that day of 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.620
 morning came with a lighter thing like 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.020
 a fruit or with some a biscuit 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.480
 integral a thing lighter than the 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.209
 my sandwich back around noon 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.400
 time I currently have lunch 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.080
 I'm on a strict diet so much that I 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.000
 I did not like this pot's picture. 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 week is going to take even though I do not have 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.470
 cooked I'm thinking more of 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.450
 restaurant, what I do until forever 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.850
 enough ldu had a choice of 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.550
 carbohydrate is white rice with a 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.459
 a bit of beans or a potato or a 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.410
 cassava or else I eat rice and potatoes 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.290
 How did I say a little bit about each one? 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.600
 championship does not hurt does not need our 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.769
 carbohydrate mixture may 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.780
 if you eat a little of one 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.580
 little bit of gold will not hurt 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.350
 will not you get the amount that you 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.300
 currently accustomed to average 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.160
 face and in addition put another 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.810
 carbohydrate for who is really going to be 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.700
 a little excess, that's what 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.690
 I have done I get a pretty salary 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.430
 salad 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.810
 I really like talking about vegetables and 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.830
 when you have enough vegetables in your 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.560
 restaurant 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.480
 then I and it reduces a little carbohydrate type 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.130
 rice potato these things the hardest time 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.930
 carbon 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.240
 vegetables and I always get a 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.310
 protein in preference to white meat 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.250
 if you do not have the same red meat 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.630
 preferably without fat without sauce or 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.850
 who were healthier in the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.460
 restaurant I'm currently eating 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.709
 and then after lunch I usually get 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.690
 want to eat sweet like me taking 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.690
 chromium picolinate reduced 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.880
 but when will still often or 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.990
 like sugar-free chewing gum that's a tip 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.580
 very good 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.710
 Or sometimes I eat a woman. 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.750
 our powdered milk thinks that the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.360
 despair is not for example a spoon 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.310
 of planted tea taste in 33 heats one 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.710
 good medicine without a spoon 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.200
 I think chocolate chocolate is very 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.240
 willingness with the society of 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.520
 12 incredible not saying what it is to be that I 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.260
 I do that but sometimes I do as soon as 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.930
 Shoot the first stone who never ate 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.210
 the chicks direct the lava finally there 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.700
 at three in the afternoon and have a snack 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.560
 usually something more protein or 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.020
 so I did not have time to prepare for 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.420
 example of an egg that has eaten or 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.300
 then take some protein supplement as 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.820
 albumin or caffeine or else I eat one 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.370
 Practical thing depending on training 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.810
 that I have had of what happens on a daily basis to 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.490
 I can come in and eat later. 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.690
 cereal bar for example a 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.850
 wholemeal biscuit 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.460
 but this varies greatly in the snacks where 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.400
 currently have not been fixed there when 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.320
 I get home from work if I do 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.130
 something confusing or muay thai with my 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.800
 husband 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.900
 Then I eat a little something else and I 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.700
 gave better support at night as 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.860
 a natural sandwich or as a 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.140
 protein with carbohydrate so as not to leave 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.460
 the body is to go without it 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.920
 energetic 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.170
 there I with a spit a drug that is the 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.110
 that I am one of the things that I eat more 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.570
 it was like an omelet with some a bit 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.430
 of carbohydrate along with a 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.660
 Rice a little bit 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.400
 sweet potato 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.590
 but this varies a lot now or else 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.630
 trained and I make dinner only buy 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.390
 have salad usually eat chicken fillet 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:01.000
 with salad or else I eat omelet 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.610
 even with a lot of soy 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.349
 get together 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.180
 you have sincere times that the 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.830
 chicken software or there are times when I 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.930
 How are egg whites? 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.509
 Israel is because I really do not have 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.180
 patience to prepare the night that 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.219
 already gets tired if you train then 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.129
 is this people after dinner does not 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:22.580
 like nothing else at supper because I usually 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:25.789
 dinner 1 and 7 6 8 hours some 96 because 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.879
 I wake up early to train so I do not 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:31.099
 like nothing after that and I only have the 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:33.169
