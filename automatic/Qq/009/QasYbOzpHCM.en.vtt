00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:17.440
 and very good to all you guys welcome 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.630
 again more to the good channel I wanted to give you 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.100
 the thanks that we surpass already the 600 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.289
 subscribers the truth that is a 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.450
 outrageous and also tell you that the 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.949
 description you will have the lad's channel 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.320
 that male the miniature that the truth is 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.289
 the good priest and go with the trasteo 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.999
 itself and I have to say from now on 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.589
 is a treaty in which little channel is 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:38.649
 currency but it is a sure is to say that no 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.390
 We lose nothing whatever you do good 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.219
 that we have to make gentlemen we have 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.050
 that to do a very very easy thing we have 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.600
 that go to the transfer market not 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.089
 as always and we have to go not instead 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.710
 for example players or consumable at 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.929
 personal nozzle hotel to the last 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.139
 option that we have to do for example 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.179
 we have the first coaches but that 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.519
 I remember more like this trainers 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.010
 physical fitness goalkeepers and 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.479
 physiotherapists, we have to look for 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.340
 in some of those four since 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.450
 coaches this is contrary not 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.680
 do they work 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.570
 It does not work I really do not have 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.100
 tried but I think it does not work well 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.630
 What do we have to do? 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.299
 of those for example in first 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.409
 coaches and look for the maximum price 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.409
 150 coins 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.479
 it's not going to come out very much because we have to 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.360
 put gold quality not as normal 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.399
 we look for something bright nothing bad not 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.079
 bright do not look for it for example I 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.450
 I'm looking for it and you have to 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.719
 turning the page and looking for me I recommend 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.610
 make this trade or at a time in the 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.530
 that the envelope comes out that is to say in time 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.439
 when it comes out for example tomorrow you know that 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.030
 the two of the bundesliga you can do it 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.310
 at that time since people are not going to 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.770
 be aware of nothing and go have 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.619
 the opportunity to sign a lot of good 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.270
 when we arrived I have already done everything 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.220
 the transfer is not as pushing see 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.840
 two dice ribbons coins maximum no 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.849
 bid more because you are going to lose coins 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.280
 keep in mind that I did not put more and 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.920
 they surpass it because nothing to look for another I have 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.599
 to tell you that I'm going to wear an 80 or 70 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.429
 percent of the bid that you make as 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.739
 let's see now it's 47 points that 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.299
 I made me take 33 the truth that is not 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.220
 nothing bad and good as you see there I am 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.560
 removing those who do not serve me 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.540
 it's very easy sir we have to now that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.390
 we have to do can discard it and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.150
 we take out 240 coins to say 40 coins 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.790
 of benefits I think I took a 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.720
 if I do not remember more thousand and so coins in 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.180
 barely half an hour or good less less me 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.950
 I think less since it is already I know what 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.710
 I could do it if it's not all auto 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.940
 thinking that I'm going to take you 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.460
 players for example can be a 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.860
 partidito and when you come back you already have 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.110
 at least 20 or 30 bought and already 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.920
 discard it is very easy as you see 240 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.480
 coins 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.459
 another thing to get a lot more 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.290
 coins is to put it on sale but what 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.730
 happens is that they are going to take a lot and not what 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.070
 tried but I think it takes a lot 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.840
 because there are people that not only happened to him 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.760
 but puja madelÃ³n is no more seeks 400 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.370
 coins for uncles of this that not 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.530
 they serve for nothing I believe and good gentlemen 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.970
 very easy I recommend you do everything and 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.820
