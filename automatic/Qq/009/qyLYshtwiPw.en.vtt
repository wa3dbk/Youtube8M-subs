this<00:00:27.230> here<00:00:27.950> is<00:00:28.100> what<00:00:28.280> have<00:00:28.580> called<00:00:28.940> a<00:00:29.410> CPM

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
this here is what have called a CPM

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.590 
this here is what have called a CPM
machine<00:00:31.570> for<00:00:32.570> bending<00:00:33.320> my<00:00:33.470> knee<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:35.030> got

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
machine for bending my knee and I got

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.890 
machine for bending my knee and I got
set<00:00:35.960> right<00:00:36.140> now<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.640> 10<00:00:37.640> degrees<00:00:38.000> 295<00:00:38.720> degrees

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
set right now to 10 degrees 295 degrees

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.220 
set right now to 10 degrees 295 degrees
and<00:00:39.430> basically<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:40.610> just<00:00:41.230> encourages

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
and basically it just encourages

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.350 
and basically it just encourages
circulation<00:00:43.160> through<00:00:43.400> my<00:00:43.520> knee<00:00:43.580> and<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.270> know

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
circulation through my knee and you know

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.900 
circulation through my knee and you know
I<00:00:44.390> can't<00:00:44.630> bend<00:00:45.080> it<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.350> far<00:00:45.590> on<00:00:45.620> my<00:00:45.739> own<00:00:45.910> it's

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
I can't bend it that far on my own it's

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
I can't bend it that far on my own it's
pretty<00:00:47.260> pretty<00:00:48.260> tedious<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.950> boring<00:00:49.160> but

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
pretty pretty tedious and boring but

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.930 
pretty pretty tedious and boring but
it's<00:00:50.930> got<00:00:51.110> to<00:00:51.200> be<00:00:51.290> done<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:51.860> end<00:00:52.640> up<00:00:52.760> just

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
it's got to be done and end up just

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.930 
it's got to be done and end up just
playing<00:00:53.890> Fifa<00:00:54.890> over<00:00:55.130> here<00:00:55.309> my<00:00:55.489> brother<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:55.910> I

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
playing Fifa over here my brother and I

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.880 
playing Fifa over here my brother and I
ended<00:00:56.210> up<00:00:56.360> playing<00:00:56.989> for<00:00:57.290> about<00:00:57.440> two<00:00:57.620> hours<00:00:57.860> a

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
ended up playing for about two hours a

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.350 
ended up playing for about two hours a
day<00:00:57.980> I'm<00:00:58.190> getting<00:00:58.340> better<00:00:58.640> slowly<00:00:59.030> but<00:00:59.330> surely

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
day I'm getting better slowly but surely

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.170 
day I'm getting better slowly but surely
it's<00:01:00.320> about<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.920> spot<00:01:01.190> this<00:01:01.340> one<00:01:01.580> there's

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
it's about the spot this one there's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.810 
it's about the spot this one there's
nothing<00:01:02.450> too<00:01:02.660> much<00:01:02.810> to<00:01:03.110> it<00:01:03.260> other<00:01:03.470> than<00:01:03.820> just

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
nothing too much to it other than just

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.820 
nothing too much to it other than just
bends<00:01:05.089> back<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:05.600> forth<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:06.350> get<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.619> little

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
bends back and forth and I get a little

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.040 
bends back and forth and I get a little
bit<00:01:06.920> of<00:01:07.009> pain<00:01:07.190> at<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.430> start<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:07.960> after<00:01:08.960> that

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
bit of pain at the start and after that

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.770 
bit of pain at the start and after that
it's<00:01:09.430> pretty<00:01:10.430> straightforward<00:01:10.670> playing<00:01:11.660> an

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
it's pretty straightforward playing an

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.630 
it's pretty straightforward playing an
old<00:01:11.869> trafford<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.440> think<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.680> was<00:01:12.770> at<00:01:13.130> 75th

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
old trafford I think it was at 75th

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.050 
old trafford I think it was at 75th
minute<00:01:14.259> so<00:01:15.259> a<00:01:15.860> ball<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.430> kind<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:16.790> skidded

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
minute so a ball that kind of skidded

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.870 
minute so a ball that kind of skidded
away<00:01:17.300> from<00:01:17.540> me<00:01:17.690> and<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:19.490> know<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:19.610> thought<00:01:19.850> I

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
away from me and you know I thought I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.219 
away from me and you know I thought I
could<00:01:20.060> win<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.330> tackle<00:01:20.750> went<00:01:20.930> down<00:01:21.110> the

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
could win the tackle went down the

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.920 
could win the tackle went down the
ground<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:22.850> know<00:01:22.880> obviously<00:01:23.300> he<00:01:23.509> came<00:01:23.750> in

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
ground and you know obviously he came in

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.620 
ground and you know obviously he came in
and<00:01:24.290> and<00:01:25.009> caught<00:01:25.220> me<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:26.060> above<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.479> knee

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
and and caught me just above the knee

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.870 
and and caught me just above the knee
and<00:01:26.869> at<00:01:27.590> any<00:01:27.770> time<00:01:27.860> when<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.399> think<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.700> could

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
and at any time when you think you could

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.280 
and at any time when you think you could
be<00:01:29.000> injured<00:01:29.270> whether<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:29.660> gonna<00:01:29.840> be<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:30.080> game

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
be injured whether it's gonna be a game

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.669 
be injured whether it's gonna be a game
or<00:01:30.649> you<00:01:31.280> know<00:01:31.369> three<00:01:32.000> games<00:01:32.240> six<00:01:33.140> months<00:01:33.470> he

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
or you know three games six months he

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.770 
or you know three games six months he
you<00:01:34.190> always<00:01:34.520> want<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:34.940> be<00:01:35.030> on<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.270> field<00:01:35.509> so

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
you always want to be on the field so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.169 
you always want to be on the field so
for<00:01:36.050> me<00:01:36.140> mentally<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.770> was<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.910> hardest

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
for me mentally that was the hardest

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.700 
for me mentally that was the hardest
part<00:01:38.270> in<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.630> waiting<00:01:38.899> game<00:01:38.929> was<00:01:39.319> not<00:01:39.530> knowing

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
part in the waiting game was not knowing

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.770 
part in the waiting game was not knowing
you<00:01:40.250> know<00:01:40.369> what<00:01:40.850> was<00:01:41.000> wrong<00:01:41.149> with<00:01:41.330> me<00:01:41.450> how<00:01:41.630> long

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
you know what was wrong with me how long

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.190 
you know what was wrong with me how long
I<00:01:41.869> was<00:01:41.990> going<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.200> be<00:01:42.289> out<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:42.819> had<00:01:43.819> to<00:01:43.940> try<00:01:44.119> and

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
I was going to be out and had to try and

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.830 
I was going to be out and had to try and
remain<00:01:45.200> positive<00:01:45.910> here's<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:47.300> other<00:01:47.450> machine

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
remain positive here's the other machine

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.529 
remain positive here's the other machine
we<00:01:48.050> have<00:01:48.080> it's<00:01:48.500> called<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.860> compex

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
we have it's called the compex

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.749 
we have it's called the compex
machine<00:01:50.539> and<00:01:50.890> basically<00:01:51.890> because<00:01:52.220> I'm<00:01:52.369> losing

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
machine and basically because I'm losing

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.570 
machine and basically because I'm losing
as<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.899> can<00:01:54.050> see<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.289> my<00:01:54.470> quads<00:01:54.830> here<00:01:55.280> this

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
as you can see of my quads here this

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.490 
as you can see of my quads here this
one's<00:01:55.759> kind<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.060> depleting<00:01:56.539> because<00:01:56.750> I'm

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
one's kind of depleting because I'm

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.980 
one's kind of depleting because I'm
non-weight-bearing<00:01:57.950> right<00:01:58.429> now<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:58.990> this

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
non-weight-bearing right now so this

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.830 
non-weight-bearing right now so this
machine<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:00.500> designed<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:01.390> stimulate<00:02:02.390> my

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
machine is designed to stimulate my

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.020 
machine is designed to stimulate my
quads<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.770> can't<00:02:04.250> really<00:02:04.369> do<00:02:04.610> right<00:02:04.789> now

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
quads that I can't really do right now

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.529 
quads that I can't really do right now
we<00:02:05.780> had<00:02:06.319> an<00:02:06.410> MRI<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.069> was<00:02:08.030> waiting<00:02:08.209> for<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
we had an MRI and was waiting for the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.809 
we had an MRI and was waiting for the
results<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.860> doctor<00:02:10.220> told<00:02:10.490> me<00:02:10.610> he<00:02:10.700> was

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
results and the doctor told me he was

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.880 
results and the doctor told me he was
gonna<00:02:10.910> call<00:02:11.180> me<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.750> let<00:02:11.930> me<00:02:12.050> know<00:02:12.200> he<00:02:12.530> told<00:02:12.740> me

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
gonna call me and let me know he told me

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.380 
gonna call me and let me know he told me
first<00:02:13.160> four<00:02:13.459> o'clock<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.880> then<00:02:14.000> he<00:02:14.090> told<00:02:14.240> me

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
first four o'clock and then he told me

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.720 
first four o'clock and then he told me
six<00:02:14.630> o'clock<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.230> had<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.069> consult<00:02:16.459> with<00:02:16.520> some

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
six o'clock and had to consult with some

does a little warm up thing here as you
can<00:03:06.630> see<00:03:07.010> it's<00:03:08.010> already<00:03:08.160> starting<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.880> get

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
can see it's already starting to get

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.070 
can see it's already starting to get
crazy<00:03:09.540> over<00:03:09.959> here<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:12.269> warm-up<00:03:12.600> session

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
crazy over here and the warm-up session

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.830 
crazy over here and the warm-up session
runs<00:03:13.470> for<00:03:13.880> three<00:03:14.880> or<00:03:14.970> four<00:03:15.150> minutes<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.660> then

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
runs for three or four minutes and then

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.710 
runs for three or four minutes and then
it<00:03:16.560> starts<00:03:16.980> doing<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.640> contraction<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.569> it

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
it starts doing that contraction so it

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.830 
it starts doing that contraction so it
flexes<00:03:19.530> my<00:03:19.650> muscles<00:03:20.010> really<00:03:20.160> tight<00:03:20.489> for<00:03:21.450> I

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
flexes my muscles really tight for I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.259 
flexes my muscles really tight for I
think<00:03:22.290> thirty<00:03:22.680> seconds<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.310> then<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.549> has<00:03:23.730> 15

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
think thirty seconds and then it has 15

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.990 
think thirty seconds and then it has 15
seconds<00:03:24.750> just<00:03:25.040> pulsating<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.640> keep

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
seconds just pulsating like this to keep

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.780 
seconds just pulsating like this to keep
the<00:03:27.060> muscles<00:03:27.709> moving<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.890> then<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.099> flexes

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the muscles moving and then it flexes

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.970 
the muscles moving and then it flexes
them<00:03:29.910> again<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.780> think<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.830> first

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
them again so I think that the first

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.640
