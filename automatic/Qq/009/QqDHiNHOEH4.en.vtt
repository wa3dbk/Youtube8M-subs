00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
earlier this morning we put the boat

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.030 
earlier this morning we put the boat
lanes<00:00:26.359> in

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.040 

now<00:00:31.520> I'm<00:00:31.580> awake<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:33.500> we're<00:00:34.280> getting<00:00:34.520> ready

now I'm awake and we're getting ready

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.700 
now I'm awake and we're getting ready
but<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.740> skier<00:00:36.980> buoy<00:00:37.300> arms<00:00:38.300> off<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.410> notice

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
but the skier buoy arms off you notice

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.820 
but the skier buoy arms off you notice
the<00:00:39.920> skier<00:00:40.610> entry<00:00:41.060> gates<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:45.320> boat<00:00:45.560> lanes

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
the skier entry gates and the boat lanes

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.210 
the skier entry gates and the boat lanes
and<00:00:46.190> this<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.640> first<00:00:47.710> buoy<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:49.100> we're

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
and this is the first buoy that we're

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.850 
and this is the first buoy that we're
going<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.430> attach<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:50.750> PVC<00:00:51.140> pipe<00:00:51.320> that<00:00:51.710> is

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
going to attach the PVC pipe that is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:12.130 
going to attach the PVC pipe that is
about<00:00:52.040> six<00:00:52.340> feet<00:00:52.400> under<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:52.970> boat<00:00:53.210> line<00:01:11.140> pipe

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
about six feet under this boat line pipe

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.260 
about six feet under this boat line pipe
right<00:01:12.350> here<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:13.250> got<00:01:13.430> caps<00:01:13.670> on<00:01:13.880> each<00:01:14.000> end

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
right here it's got caps on each end

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.260 
right here it's got caps on each end
it's<00:01:15.170> what<00:01:15.649> we<00:01:15.770> call<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.009> buoyancy<00:01:16.580> chamber<00:01:17.119> to

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's what we call a buoyancy chamber to

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.050 
it's what we call a buoyancy chamber to
keep<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.960> middle<00:01:18.290> of<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> arm<00:01:19.060> somewhat

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
keep the middle of the arm somewhat

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.930 
keep the middle of the arm somewhat
afloat<00:01:20.600> not<00:01:20.869> on<00:01:20.990> top<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.410> water<00:01:21.560> but<00:01:21.940> gives

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
afloat not on top of the water but gives

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.969 
afloat not on top of the water but gives
it<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.119> little<00:01:23.270> bit<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.509> lifts<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.080> arm

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
it a little bit of lifts of the arm

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.430 
it a little bit of lifts of the arm
doesn't<00:01:25.250> curve<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:25.940> shorten<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.259> distance

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
doesn't curve and shorten the distance

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.270 
doesn't curve and shorten the distance
from<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.160> boat<00:01:28.790> line<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.720> ski<00:01:29.930> boot<00:01:30.280> the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
from the boat line to the ski boot the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.210 
from the boat line to the ski boot the
very<00:01:31.970> end<00:01:32.210> short<00:01:32.780> section<00:01:33.259> it's<00:01:33.830> got<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.009> buoy

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
very end short section it's got a buoy

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.450 
very end short section it's got a buoy
on<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.520> end<00:01:34.640> of<00:01:34.790> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100 

we're<00:01:41.790> getting<00:01:42.060> ready<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> bolt<00:01:42.480> it<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
we're getting ready to bolt it on and
