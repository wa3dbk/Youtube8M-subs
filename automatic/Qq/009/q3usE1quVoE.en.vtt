get better gear and how to win gunfights
and<00:00:28.320> nonetheless<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.150> 30<00:00:30.420> kill<00:00:30.840> game

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and nonetheless this is the 30 kill game

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.380 
and nonetheless this is the 30 kill game
which<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.550> impressive<00:00:33.059> in

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
which is actually really impressive in

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.750 
which is actually really impressive in
my<00:00:33.570> opinion<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.230> team<00:00:34.440> deathmatch<00:00:34.860> because

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
my opinion for team deathmatch because

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.150 
my opinion for team deathmatch because
the<00:00:35.910> score<00:00:36.180> limits<00:00:36.540> 10,000<00:00:37.500> points<00:00:37.649> i<00:00:37.860> believe

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the score limits 10,000 points i believe

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.630 
the score limits 10,000 points i believe
so<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.570> less<00:00:39.899> time<00:00:40.230> than<00:00:40.710> control

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so you have less time than control

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
so you have less time than control
obviously<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.719> domination<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.530> team

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
obviously just like domination and team

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.160 
obviously just like domination and team
deathmatch<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.489> call<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> duty<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.020> an

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
deathmatch in call of duty it's just an

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.369 
deathmatch in call of duty it's just an
easy<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.680> reference<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.489> game<00:00:47.760> too<00:00:48.000> but

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
easy way to reference this game too but

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.740 
easy way to reference this game too but
yeah<00:00:49.379> i<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:49.770> 30<00:00:50.070> kills<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.879> probably<00:00:51.420> my

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
yeah i get 30 kills and it's probably my

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.319

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
thing about the game is so if you can do

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.609 
thing about the game is so if you can do
that<00:01:17.460> that'd<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.299> sweet<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.320> i'll<00:01:19.439> get

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
that that'd be pretty sweet but i'll get

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.920 
that that'd be pretty sweet but i'll get
into<00:01:19.979> how<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.490> better<00:01:20.670> geared<00:01:21.090> there's<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
into how to get better geared there's a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
into how to get better geared there's a
few<00:01:22.290> ways<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.220> actually<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:24.030> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
few ways well there's actually a kind of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
few ways well there's actually a kind of
different<00:01:24.540> ways<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.290> geared<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
different ways you can get geared but in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.460 
different ways you can get geared but in
my<00:01:26.610> opinion<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.720> faster<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
my opinion it's a little faster if you

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.520 
my opinion it's a little faster if you
play<00:01:28.740> clash<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.880> doing<00:01:30.509> instances<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
play clash then doing instances all the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.710 
play clash then doing instances all the
time<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.520> play<00:01:32.759> clash<00:01:33.119> usually

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
time because if you play clash usually

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
time because if you play clash usually
the<00:01:33.900> games<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.290> pretty<00:01:34.500> fast<00:01:34.799> like<00:01:34.979> team

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the games are pretty fast like team

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.429 
the games are pretty fast like team
death<00:01:35.549> match<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:36.000> cod<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:36.930> about<00:01:37.140> five

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
death match in cod there about five

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.260 
death match in cod there about five
minutes<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> chance<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.030> getting

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
minutes and you have a chance of getting

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.660 
minutes and you have a chance of getting
two<00:01:39.450> pieces<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:41.310> my<00:01:41.520> experience

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
two pieces of here and in my experience

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
two pieces of here and in my experience
i've<00:01:42.360> only<00:01:42.540> played<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.990> few<00:01:43.110> dungeons<00:01:43.770> or

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.219 
i've only played a few dungeons or
instances<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:45.000> whatever<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.750> may<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
instances or whatever you may want to

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.889 
instances or whatever you may want to
call<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:47.520> heroic<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.270> two<00:01:48.479> normal

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
call it it one heroic and two normal

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.499 
call it it one heroic and two normal
ones<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.350> level<00:01:49.649> 20<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.670> took<00:01:50.880> about<00:01:51.119> 30

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
ones for level 20 and they took about 30

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.740 
ones for level 20 and they took about 30
to<00:01:51.780> 40<00:01:52.110> minutes<00:01:52.290> each<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.939> my<00:01:54.119> opinion<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
to 40 minutes each so in my opinion you

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
to 40 minutes each so in my opinion you
can<00:01:54.930> get<00:01:55.110> more<00:01:55.350> gear<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.549> get

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
can get more gear because you can get

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.660 
can get more gear because you can get
more<00:01:56.969> games<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.600> clash<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.460> if

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
more games of clash in but that's if

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you're just trying to get gear if you're

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.730 
you're just trying to get gear if you're

here you don't even have to play
multiplayer<00:02:11.489> but<00:02:12.480> i've<00:02:12.780> really<00:02:13.230> enjoyed<00:02:13.260> well

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
multiplayer but i've really enjoyed well

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.100 
multiplayer but i've really enjoyed well
player<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.519> what<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.030> pop<00:02:15.390> stomp<00:02:15.750> so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
player that's what I do I pop stomp so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.229 
player that's what I do I pop stomp so
that's<00:02:16.769> all<00:02:16.920> I've<00:02:17.099> really<00:02:17.550> been<00:02:17.730> doing<00:02:18.090> I've

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that's all I've really been doing I've

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.170 
that's all I've really been doing I've
only<00:02:18.450> played<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.319> few<00:02:19.519> dungeon<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:20.849> i'll

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
only played a few dungeon so i'll

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.990 
only played a few dungeon so i'll
probably<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:22.019> more<00:02:22.049> of<00:02:22.470> those<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.819> win

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
probably do more of those but to win

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.300 
probably do more of those but to win
gunfights<00:02:24.629> it's<00:02:24.959> really<00:02:25.379> easy<00:02:25.769> just<00:02:26.010> aim<00:02:26.250> for

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
gunfights it's really easy just aim for

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.699 
gunfights it's really easy just aim for
the<00:02:26.700> dome<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.450> straight<00:02:27.690> head<00:02:27.959> shots<00:02:28.290> if<00:02:28.530> you

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
the dome just straight head shots if you

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.949 
the dome just straight head shots if you
hit<00:02:28.920> them<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.250> head<00:02:29.340> they'll<00:02:30.180> die<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.750> much

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
hit them in the head they'll die so much

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.830 
hit them in the head they'll die so much
faster<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.680> kind<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.099> similar<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.060> halo<00:02:33.420> with

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
faster it's kind of similar to halo with

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.900 
faster it's kind of similar to halo with
them<00:02:34.230> having<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.739> shield<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.340> if<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.700> aim<00:02:35.879> for

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
them having a shield so if you aim for

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.570 
them having a shield so if you aim for
the<00:02:36.209> head<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.930> drops<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.560> shield<00:02:37.830> really<00:02:38.310> fast

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
the head it drops the shield really fast

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.460 
the head it drops the shield really fast
and<00:02:38.849> then<00:02:38.940> they<00:02:39.150> take<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.420> lot<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.750> damage<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and then they take a lot of damage of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.809 
and then they take a lot of damage of
course<00:02:40.739> if<00:02:40.980> you're<00:02:41.099> shooting<00:02:41.310> them<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
course if you're shooting them in the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.330 
course if you're shooting them in the
head<00:02:41.940> after<00:02:42.329> they<00:02:42.810> lose<00:02:43.650> their<00:02:43.860> shield<00:02:44.129> and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
head after they lose their shield and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.789 
head after they lose their shield and
you<00:02:44.489> can<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.819> they're<00:02:45.060> got<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.329> head<00:02:45.540> shot<00:02:45.810> I'd

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
you can see they're got a head shot I'd

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.069 
you can see they're got a head shot I'd
say<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.129> get<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.640> fifty<00:02:48.150> percent<00:02:48.540> head<00:02:48.750> shots

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
say I get like fifty percent head shots

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.830 
say I get like fifty percent head shots
for<00:02:49.379> all<00:02:49.620> my<00:02:49.890> all<00:02:50.549> my<00:02:50.610> kills<00:02:51.150> about<00:02:51.480> fifty

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
for all my all my kills about fifty

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.750 
for all my all my kills about fifty
percent<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.319> them<00:02:52.500> are<00:02:52.620> head<00:02:52.799> shot<00:02:53.069> just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
percent of them are head shot just

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.640 
percent of them are head shot just
because<00:02:53.940> it's<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.660> much<00:02:54.720> easier<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:55.500> win

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
because it's just so much easier to win

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.890 
because it's just so much easier to win
the<00:02:55.829> gun<00:02:56.010> fight<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.299> aren't<00:02:57.540> aiming

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the gun fight so if you aren't aiming

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.680 
the gun fight so if you aren't aiming
for<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.170> dome<00:02:58.590> do<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.790> you'll<00:02:59.940> win<00:03:00.150> so

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
for that dome do that and you'll win so

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.220 
for that dome do that and you'll win so
much<00:03:00.900> more<00:03:01.140> gunfights<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:02.549> trust<00:03:02.790> me<00:03:03.030> and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
much more gunfights just trust me and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.960 
much more gunfights just trust me and
yeah<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.829> do<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.190> because<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.760> call<00:03:05.940> of

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
yeah just do that because in call of

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.880 
yeah just do that because in call of
duty<00:03:06.090> its<00:03:06.510> kind<00:03:06.569> of<00:03:06.810> like<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.019> one<00:03:07.319> shot<00:03:07.560> if<00:03:07.769> you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
duty its kind of like a one shot if you

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.369 
duty its kind of like a one shot if you
go<00:03:08.069> for<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> head<00:03:08.609> but<00:03:09.329> usually<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.019> can<00:03:10.200> kill

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
go for the head but usually you can kill

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.960 
go for the head but usually you can kill
them<00:03:10.500> pretty<00:03:10.769> fast<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:11.670> shoot<00:03:11.819> them

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
them pretty fast if you just shoot them

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.849 
them pretty fast if you just shoot them
in<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.120> chest<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.349> game<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
in the chest but this game the

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.680 
in the chest but this game the
difference<00:03:14.250> between<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.760> chest<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.329> head<00:03:15.450> is

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
difference between the chest and head is

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.589 
difference between the chest and head is
like<00:03:16.049> insane<00:03:16.650> because<00:03:17.400> if<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:18.120> aim<00:03:18.299> for<00:03:18.329> the

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
like insane because if you aim for the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.530 
like insane because if you aim for the
chest<00:03:18.630> will<00:03:19.139> die<00:03:19.319> probably<00:03:19.790> half<00:03:20.790> as<00:03:21.030> quick<00:03:21.329> as

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
chest will die probably half as quick as

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.120 
chest will die probably half as quick as
if<00:03:21.720> you're<00:03:21.930> aiming<00:03:22.200> for<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.440> head<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:22.980> if

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
if you're aiming for the head so if

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.379
