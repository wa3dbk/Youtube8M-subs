here<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.110> tutorial<00:00:13.320> we're<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:14.009> to

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
here and in this tutorial we're going to

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.709 
here and in this tutorial we're going to
be<00:00:14.130> talking<00:00:14.309> about<00:00:14.429> landscape<00:00:15.150> photography

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
be talking about landscape photography

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.500 
be talking about landscape photography
now<00:00:16.619> what<00:00:17.160> happens<00:00:17.520> when<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.730> really<00:00:18.210> try<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
now what happens when we really try and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.580 
now what happens when we really try and
capture<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.960> Vista

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
capture a Vista

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.830 
capture a Vista
we<00:00:20.279> can't<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.730> point<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.359> camera<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
we can't just point a camera at the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.390 
we can't just point a camera at the
landscape<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.439> click<00:00:22.680> that's<00:00:22.859> not<00:00:23.100> enough

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
landscape and click that's not enough

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.790 
landscape and click that's not enough
really<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.390> we're<00:00:24.510> thinking<00:00:24.630> about<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.260> what

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
really what we're thinking about is what

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800 
really what we're thinking about is what
we're<00:00:25.920> experiencing<00:00:26.910> we're<00:00:27.330> taking<00:00:27.630> cues

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
we're experiencing we're taking cues

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.929 
we're experiencing we're taking cues
from<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:28.170> kinds<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.740> things<00:00:29.010> like<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.640> sights

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
from all kinds of things like the sights

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.640 
from all kinds of things like the sights
we're<00:00:30.179> seeing<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.660> also<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> sounds<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
we're seeing but also the sounds the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
we're seeing but also the sounds the
smells<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:32.460> we're<00:00:32.579> trying<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.090> make

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
smells what we're trying to do is make

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.819 
smells what we're trying to do is make
an<00:00:33.360> emotional<00:00:33.930> connection<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.380> our<00:00:34.530> viewer

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
an emotional connection with our viewer

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.069 
an emotional connection with our viewer
and<00:00:35.100> that's<00:00:35.460> quite<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> tall<00:00:36.030> order<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:36.960> we

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and that's quite a tall order but if we

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.869 
and that's quite a tall order but if we
think<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.410> ourselves<00:00:37.500> well<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.460> are<00:00:38.790> our

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
think to ourselves well what are our

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.549 
think to ourselves well what are our
images<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.600> about<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.320> makes<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
images really about then it makes the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.990 
images really about then it makes the
other<00:00:40.739> decisions<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.309> we<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.700> make<00:00:41.850> in

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
other decisions that we have to make in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.569 
other decisions that we have to make in
this<00:00:42.090> process<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.719> lot<00:00:43.110> easier<00:00:43.399> one<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
this process a lot easier one of the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.590 
this process a lot easier one of the
first<00:00:44.850> things<00:00:45.120> we're<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
first things we're going to have to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.150 
first things we're going to have to
consider<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.140> obviously<00:00:46.440> composition

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
consider is obviously composition

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
consider is obviously composition
landscape<00:00:47.730> photography<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.629> about

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
landscape photography it's all about

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
landscape photography it's all about
composition<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:49.980> include<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.850> do

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
composition what do we include what do

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
composition what do we include what do
we<00:00:51.090> exclude<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.020> how<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.680> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
we exclude and how do we do it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.380 
we exclude and how do we do it
if<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.309> move<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.879> happens<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
if we move what happens to the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
if we move what happens to the
perspective<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> relevant

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
perspective and what about the relevant

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
perspective and what about the relevant
scales<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.059> things<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> landscape<00:00:57.840> do<00:00:58.440> we

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
scales of things in a landscape do we

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.529 
scales of things in a landscape do we
want<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:59.250> tree<00:00:59.489> dwarfed<00:01:00.120> against<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
want that little tree dwarfed against a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.090 
want that little tree dwarfed against a
looming<00:01:00.930> mountain<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
looming mountain or will be like the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.240 
looming mountain or will be like the
tree<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.550> tower<00:01:02.789> over<00:01:02.910> some<00:01:03.480> distant<00:01:04.080> Hills<00:01:04.350> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
tree to tower over some distant Hills so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340 
tree to tower over some distant Hills so
thinking<00:01:05.850> about<00:01:05.939> position<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.689> important

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
thinking about position very important

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.750 
thinking about position very important
and<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> influence<00:01:08.250> our<00:01:08.520> lens

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and that's going to influence our lens

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.120 
and that's going to influence our lens
choice<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.869> next<00:01:09.900> thing<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.920> need<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
choice the next thing we really need to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890 
choice the next thing we really need to
think<00:01:11.280> about<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.610> light<00:01:11.880> obviously<00:01:12.180> lights

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
think about is light obviously lights

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
think about is light obviously lights
critical<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.530> photography<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.700> in

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
critical to all photography but in

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
critical to all photography but in
landscape<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.659> really<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.320> part<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.770> what

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
landscape it really is part of what

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.440 
landscape it really is part of what
we're<00:01:17.100> photographing<00:01:17.850> landscape

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
we're photographing landscape

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.609 
we're photographing landscape
photographers<00:01:18.869> aren't<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.200> thinking<00:01:19.500> about

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
photographers aren't just thinking about

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.530 
photographers aren't just thinking about
the<00:01:20.130> scene<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.520> front<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.939> them<00:01:21.150> they're

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the scene in front of them they're

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.390 
the scene in front of them they're
thinking<00:01:21.780> about<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.470> day<00:01:22.680> where<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
thinking about the time of day where the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.219 
thinking about the time of day where the
lights<00:01:23.610> coming<00:01:23.909> from<00:01:24.030> where<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> sun's<00:01:24.960> going

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
lights coming from where the sun's going

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
lights coming from where the sun's going
to<00:01:25.290> be<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.530> five<00:01:25.740> o'clock<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> starts<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
to be at five o'clock as it starts to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
to be at five o'clock as it starts to
dip<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.420> might<00:01:27.630> even<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> compass<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
dip they might even have a compass and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.560 
dip they might even have a compass and
alarm<00:01:29.009> clocks<00:01:29.280> very<00:01:29.490> useful<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> landscape

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
alarm clocks very useful to a landscape

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
alarm clocks very useful to a landscape
photographer<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:31.200> those<00:01:31.350> reasons<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:32.040> good

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
photographer for those reasons a good

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.130 
photographer for those reasons a good
landscape<00:01:33.210> feels<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.869> could<00:01:33.990> almost

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
landscape feels like we could almost

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.020 
landscape feels like we could almost
step<00:01:34.530> into<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.280> being<00:01:35.820> their

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
step into it it's like being their

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.359

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
we can capture good detail is to think

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
we can capture good detail is to think
about<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> types<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> lens<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.000> use<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.630> good

about the types of lens we use how good
is<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> glass<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:44.040> resolving<00:01:44.520> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
is the glass is it really resolving it

is the glass is it really resolving it
it's<00:01:44.820> optimal<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.750> need<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> pick<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.200> lens

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.170 
capture all that detail or the subtlety

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
of light that we're trying to capture

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.960 
of light that we're trying to capture
and<00:02:54.569> very<00:02:54.870> wide<00:02:55.340> there's<00:02:56.340> another<00:02:56.549> type<00:02:56.819> of

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.740 
lens that kind of make a tilt shift lens
so<00:02:59.400> usually<00:02:59.730> when<00:02:59.849> we<00:02:59.939> photograph<00:03:00.389> we<00:03:00.540> think

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
so usually when we photograph we think

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.420 
so usually when we photograph we think
of<00:03:00.840> our<00:03:00.930> focus<00:03:01.290> running<00:03:01.620> off<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.889> front<00:03:02.129> of<00:03:02.280> us

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
with a tilt shift lens we're able to

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.110 
with a tilt shift lens we're able to
alter<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.010> angle<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.609> so<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:05.849> we<00:03:05.969> are

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
alter the angle of that so if we are

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.699 
alter the angle of that so if we are
working<00:03:06.389> with<00:03:06.659> narrow<00:03:06.870> depth<00:03:07.139> of<00:03:07.349> field<00:03:07.530> we

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
working with narrow depth of field we

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.520 
working with narrow depth of field we
can<00:03:07.889> actually<00:03:08.040> create<00:03:08.760> strange<00:03:09.569> illusions<00:03:10.379> of

can actually create strange illusions of
the<00:03:10.590> focus<00:03:11.099> falling<00:03:11.459> into<00:03:11.639> a<00:03:11.669> different<00:03:12.000> plane

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
the focus falling into a different plane

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.149 
the focus falling into a different plane
and<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.569> can<00:03:13.019> be<00:03:13.109> used<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.439> create<00:03:13.590> things

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
and that can be used to create things

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.099 
and that can be used to create things
like<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.370> Toytown<00:03:14.909> effect<00:03:15.329> where<00:03:15.719> things<00:03:15.959> look

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
like a Toytown effect where things look

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.990 
like a Toytown effect where things look

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
function on this is really also very

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.770 
function on this is really also very
useful<00:03:23.549> because<00:03:23.699> when<00:03:24.030> we<00:03:24.180> tilt<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.599> lens

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
useful because when we tilt a lens

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.719 
useful because when we tilt a lens
that's<00:03:25.049> when<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.379> get<00:03:25.560> Distortion<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.579> by

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
that's when we get Distortion but by

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.360 
that's when we get Distortion but by
being<00:03:27.120> able<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.479> shift<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.470> lens<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.220> focal

plane of the lens

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.580 
plane of the lens
it<00:03:30.329> means<00:03:30.689> it's<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> little<00:03:31.109> bit<00:03:31.260> like<00:03:31.409> we're

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
it means it's a little bit like we're

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.199 
it means it's a little bit like we're
shooting<00:03:32.189> from<00:03:32.310> higher<00:03:32.549> up<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.909> we<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.090> keep

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
shooting from higher up and we can keep

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.059 
shooting from higher up and we can keep
the<00:03:33.359> back<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.780> camera<00:03:33.959> flat<00:03:34.379> which<00:03:34.799> keeps

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
the back of the camera flat which keeps

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.069 
the back of the camera flat which keeps
our<00:03:35.220> buildings<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:35.699> objects<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.239> distort<00:03:36.930> it

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
our buildings and objects and distort it

ok<00:03:37.739> enough<00:03:38.129> talking<00:03:38.159> about<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.790> lenses<00:03:39.030> let's

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
ok enough talking about the lenses let's

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.360 
ok enough talking about the lenses let's
see<00:03:39.329> what<00:03:39.449> they<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.599> really<00:03:39.720> do<00:03:40.169> so<00:03:40.530> Jenny

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
see what they can really do so Jenny

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.039 
see what they can really do so Jenny
what<00:03:41.549> have<00:03:41.639> you<00:03:41.699> got<00:03:41.849> on<00:03:41.939> the<00:03:41.970> screen<00:03:42.180> got<00:03:43.019> a

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
what have you got on the screen got a

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.629 
what have you got on the screen got a
few<00:03:43.319> great<00:03:43.650> examples<00:03:44.159> of<00:03:44.220> these<00:03:44.400> lenses

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
few great examples of these lenses

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.179 
few great examples of these lenses
actually<00:03:45.209> as<00:03:45.329> far<00:03:45.389> as<00:03:45.569> landscapes<00:03:46.139> go<00:03:46.349> this<00:03:47.069> is

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
actually as far as landscapes go this is

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.610 
actually as far as landscapes go this is
on<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> 14<00:03:47.819> mil<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.150> fixed<00:03:48.419> lens<00:03:48.629> which<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.349> a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
on the 14 mil the fixed lens which is a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.979 
on the 14 mil the fixed lens which is a
beautiful<00:03:50.099> example<00:03:50.939> here<00:03:51.419> you<00:03:51.599> got<00:03:51.720> all<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
beautiful example here you got all the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.020 
beautiful example here you got all the
differences<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.650> light<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.310> you've<00:03:53.819> got<00:03:53.939> the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
differences in light and you've got the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.270 
differences in light and you've got the
focus<00:03:54.239> going<00:03:54.659> all<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.319> way<00:03:55.379> through<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
focus going all the way through the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.860 
focus going all the way through the
image<00:03:56.579> almost<00:03:57.090> right<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.569> back<00:03:57.689> with

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
image almost right to the back with

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.719 
image almost right to the back with
mountains<00:03:58.229> are<00:03:58.409> sure<00:03:58.919> enough<00:03:59.189> yeah<00:03:59.489> in<00:03:59.639> the

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
mountains are sure enough yeah in the

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.759 
mountains are sure enough yeah in the
sky<00:03:59.939> this<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.209> on<00:04:00.359> the<00:04:00.449> same<00:04:00.659> lens<00:04:00.930> again<00:04:01.229> it

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
sky this is on the same lens again it

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.289 
sky this is on the same lens again it
just<00:04:01.829> shows<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.340> how<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.519> can<00:04:02.729> really<00:04:02.939> bring

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
just shows you how you can really bring

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.839 
just shows you how you can really bring
in<00:04:03.509> your<00:04:03.959> foreground<00:04:04.349> as<00:04:04.680> well<00:04:04.859> inside<00:04:05.579> there

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
in your foreground as well inside there

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.789 
in your foreground as well inside there
and<00:04:06.060> still<00:04:06.509> have<00:04:06.689> that<00:04:06.720> great<00:04:07.019> Vista<00:04:07.409> it's<00:04:07.709> got

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
and still have that great Vista it's got

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.110 
and still have that great Vista it's got
a<00:04:07.829> lovely<00:04:08.009> sweep<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.639> land<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:08.909> draws

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
a lovely sweep of the land that draws

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.159 
a lovely sweep of the land that draws
the<00:04:09.299> eye<00:04:09.329> around<00:04:09.599> it<00:04:09.840> again<00:04:09.989> about

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
the eye around it again about

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.080 
the eye around it again about
composition<00:04:10.799> but<00:04:11.129> also<00:04:11.370> one<00:04:11.639> thing<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:11.909> I

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
composition but also one thing that I

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.280 
composition but also one thing that I
know<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.299> have<00:04:12.449> interesting<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.019> shot<00:04:13.199> is

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
know to have interesting this shot is

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.420 
know to have interesting this shot is
we're<00:04:13.439> often<00:04:13.560> told<00:04:13.739> not<00:04:13.949> to<00:04:13.979> shoot<00:04:14.250> directly

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
we're often told not to shoot directly

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.339 
we're often told not to shoot directly
into<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:14.939> Sun<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:15.569> look<00:04:15.750> there's<00:04:16.139> only<00:04:16.259> a

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
into the Sun but look there's only a

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:17.599 
into the Sun but look there's only a
little<00:04:16.709> kick<00:04:16.919> off<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.220> Sun<00:04:17.370> we're<00:04:17.489> not

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
little kick off the Sun we're not

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.920 
little kick off the Sun we're not
getting<00:04:17.820> all<00:04:17.909> that<00:04:17.970> flare<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.509> glare<00:04:18.750> that

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
getting all that flare and glare that

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.990 
getting all that flare and glare that
can<00:04:19.079> destroy<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.709> contrast<00:04:20.370> in<00:04:20.519> an<00:04:20.609> image<00:04:20.849> and

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
can destroy the contrast in an image and

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.069 
can destroy the contrast in an image and
that's<00:04:21.150> because<00:04:21.449> it's<00:04:21.599> a<00:04:21.690> really<00:04:21.870> good

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
that's because it's a really good

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.500 
that's because it's a really good
quality<00:04:22.320> lens<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:23.729> image<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.150> shot<00:04:24.360> on

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
quality lens so this image is shot on

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.110 
quality lens so this image is shot on
the<00:04:24.750> 24<00:04:25.500> which<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.800> also<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.099> fixed<00:04:26.430> lens

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
the 24 which is also the fixed lens

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.400 
the 24 which is also the fixed lens
it's<00:04:27.210> an<00:04:27.300> interesting<00:04:27.750> perspective<00:04:27.960> isn't<00:04:28.350> it

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
it's an interesting perspective isn't it

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.110 
it's an interesting perspective isn't it
when<00:04:28.500> you're<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:28.889> close<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.400> still<00:04:29.850> filling

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
when you're that close and still filling

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.760 
when you're that close and still filling
the<00:04:30.330> frame<00:04:30.570> like<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.840> there's<00:04:31.560> also<00:04:31.680> a

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
the frame like that there's also a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.140 
the frame like that there's also a
lovely<00:04:31.980> kind<00:04:32.250> of<00:04:32.340> energy<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.820> this<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.120> think

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
lovely kind of energy to this I think

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.480 
lovely kind of energy to this I think
that<00:04:33.360> works<00:04:33.720> because<00:04:34.230> we<00:04:35.010> don't<00:04:35.160> want<00:04:35.310> image

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
that works because we don't want image

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.250 
that works because we don't want image
blur<00:04:35.760> necessarily<00:04:36.479> but<00:04:36.660> we've<00:04:36.780> got<00:04:37.020> all<00:04:37.139> the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
blur necessarily but we've got all the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.570 
blur necessarily but we've got all the
sharp<00:04:37.470> detail<00:04:37.860> of<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.040> silhouettes<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.520> the

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
sharp detail of the silhouettes of the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.860 
sharp detail of the silhouettes of the
characters<00:04:38.940> but<00:04:39.060> we<00:04:39.150> still<00:04:39.270> got<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.419> feeling<00:04:39.810> of

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
characters but we still got a feeling of

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.530 
characters but we still got a feeling of
movement<00:04:40.350> from<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.770> sweep<00:04:41.070> very<00:04:41.940> nice<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.360> like

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
movement from the sweep very nice I like

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.810 
movement from the sweep very nice I like
the<00:04:42.690> little<00:04:42.960> moon<00:04:43.440> detail<00:04:43.949> in<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.130> corner<00:04:44.490> and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
the little moon detail in the corner and

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.730 
the little moon detail in the corner and
even<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.510> low-light<00:04:45.960> again<00:04:46.320> you've<00:04:46.530> got

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
even in the low-light again you've got

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.770 
even in the low-light again you've got
so<00:04:47.280> much<00:04:47.400> movement<00:04:47.699> going<00:04:48.000> on<00:04:48.240> but<00:04:48.389> it's<00:04:48.510> quite

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
so much movement going on but it's quite

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.020 
so much movement going on but it's quite
captured<00:04:49.680> quite<00:04:49.860> well<00:04:50.040> on<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.280> lens<00:04:50.550> quite

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
captured quite well on this lens quite

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.090 
captured quite well on this lens quite
sharp<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.540> then<00:04:52.139> moving<00:04:52.380> on<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.770> tool

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
sharp and then moving on to the tool

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.520 
sharp and then moving on to the tool
shift<00:04:53.520> is<00:04:54.120> I've<00:04:54.240> got<00:04:54.360> two<00:04:54.540> images<00:04:55.020> that<00:04:55.229> really

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
shift is I've got two images that really

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.469 
shift is I've got two images that really
show<00:04:55.710> what<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:56.010> does<00:04:56.220> in<00:04:56.699> an<00:04:56.910> urban<00:04:57.090> landscape

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
show what it does in an urban landscape

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.550 
show what it does in an urban landscape
before<00:04:58.199> or<00:04:58.470> not<00:04:58.560> yeah<00:04:59.010> yeah<00:05:00.169> this<00:05:01.169> is<00:05:01.320> kind<00:05:01.530> of

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
before or not yeah yeah this is kind of

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.110 
before or not yeah yeah this is kind of
your<00:05:01.680> standard<00:05:02.100> shot<00:05:02.310> looking<00:05:02.669> up<00:05:02.850> at<00:05:03.060> a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
your standard shot looking up at a

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.950 
your standard shot looking up at a
building<00:05:03.630> you'd<00:05:04.410> expect<00:05:04.860> your<00:05:05.490> lines<00:05:05.760> to<00:05:06.750> kind

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
building you'd expect your lines to kind

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.020 
building you'd expect your lines to kind
of<00:05:07.020> go<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.260> infinity<00:05:07.860> right<00:05:08.250> so<00:05:08.669> these<00:05:08.820> are<00:05:08.880> the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
of go to infinity right so these are the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.120 
of go to infinity right so these are the
converging<00:05:09.990> verticals<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:10.800> we<00:05:10.889> talked

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
converging verticals that we talked

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.070 
converging verticals that we talked
about<00:05:11.460> yes<00:05:11.760> when<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.090> tilt<00:05:12.270> Earl<00:05:12.510> ends<00:05:12.660> up<00:05:12.870> at

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
about yes when you tilt Earl ends up at

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.540 
about yes when you tilt Earl ends up at
a<00:05:13.139> building<00:05:13.320> here<00:05:13.680> now<00:05:13.860> on<00:05:14.010> your<00:05:14.190> tilt<00:05:14.430> shift

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
a building here now on your tilt shift

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.610 
a building here now on your tilt shift
you<00:05:14.910> have<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.120> option<00:05:15.540> of<00:05:15.660> straightening<00:05:16.500> out

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
you have the option of straightening out

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.260 
you have the option of straightening out
your<00:05:16.650> verticals<00:05:17.190> so<00:05:17.700> this<00:05:17.850> is<00:05:17.940> shot<00:05:18.060> from<00:05:18.150> the

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
your verticals so this is shot from the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.240 
your verticals so this is shot from the
same<00:05:18.450> camera<00:05:18.780> position<00:05:18.810> yeah<00:05:19.650> just<00:05:19.950> using<00:05:20.100> the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
same camera position yeah just using the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.040 
same camera position yeah just using the
lens<00:05:20.460> -<00:05:20.729> correct<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:21.510> I<00:05:21.570> think<00:05:21.750> this<00:05:21.870> is<00:05:21.960> quite

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
lens - correct and I think this is quite

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.230 
lens - correct and I think this is quite
an<00:05:22.260> interesting<00:05:22.440> point<00:05:23.010> because<00:05:23.240> sometimes

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
an interesting point because sometimes

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.540 
an interesting point because sometimes
we<00:05:24.570> kind<00:05:24.930> of<00:05:25.020> expect<00:05:25.380> naturally<00:05:25.860> perspective

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
we kind of expect naturally perspective

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.250 
we kind of expect naturally perspective
to<00:05:26.639> disappear<00:05:27.120> off<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.449> convergently<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.169> if

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
to disappear off and convergently and if

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.960 
to disappear off and convergently and if
we<00:05:28.410> overdo<00:05:29.220> it<00:05:29.250> things<00:05:29.580> can<00:05:29.760> look<00:05:29.850> like

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
we overdo it things can look like

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.340 
we overdo it things can look like
they're<00:05:30.120> going<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.419> other<00:05:30.449> way<00:05:30.630> but<00:05:30.960> with<00:05:31.110> the

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
they're going the other way but with the

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.810 
they're going the other way but with the
tilt<00:05:31.770> shift<00:05:31.800> lens<00:05:32.010> you<00:05:32.220> have<00:05:32.250> very<00:05:32.520> fine

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
tilt shift lens you have very fine

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.790 
tilt shift lens you have very fine
control<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:33.450> we<00:05:33.570> can<00:05:33.600> we<00:05:34.110> can<00:05:34.229> tweak<00:05:34.470> these

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
control so we can we can tweak these

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.620 
control so we can we can tweak these
towers<00:05:35.250> to<00:05:35.400> our<00:05:35.490> hearts<00:05:35.729> content<00:05:36.000> we<00:05:36.450> can

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
towers to our hearts content we can

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.450 
towers to our hearts content we can
redesign<00:05:37.470> Venice<00:05:38.280> right<00:05:40.070> this<00:05:41.070> is<00:05:41.250> with<00:05:41.370> the

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
redesign Venice right this is with the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.100 
redesign Venice right this is with the
800<00:05:41.940> mil<00:05:42.060> which<00:05:42.210> obviously<00:05:42.419> is<00:05:42.599> a<00:05:42.660> lot<00:05:42.900> longer

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
800 mil which obviously is a lot longer

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.020 
800 mil which obviously is a lot longer
than<00:05:43.289> what<00:05:43.680> we've<00:05:43.800> been<00:05:43.830> looking<00:05:44.280> at<00:05:44.310> here's

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
than what we've been looking at here's

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.969 
than what we've been looking at here's
an<00:05:45.240> example<00:05:45.539> of<00:05:45.810> someone<00:05:46.289> standing<00:05:46.740> a<00:05:46.800> long

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
an example of someone standing a long

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.650 
an example of someone standing a long
way<00:05:47.160> away<00:05:47.310> with<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.669> long<00:05:47.880> lens<00:05:48.120> and<00:05:48.330> it's<00:05:48.510> had

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
way away with the long lens and it's had

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.570 
way away with the long lens and it's had
that<00:05:48.840> effect<00:05:49.440> of<00:05:49.590> foreshortening<00:05:50.370> the

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
that effect of foreshortening the

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.100 
that effect of foreshortening the
perspective<00:05:51.150> because<00:05:51.360> when<00:05:51.570> we<00:05:51.690> stand<00:05:51.870> at<00:05:52.050> a

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
perspective because when we stand at a

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.659 
perspective because when we stand at a
great<00:05:52.289> distance<00:05:52.500> perspective<00:05:53.460> in<00:05:53.550> the

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
great distance perspective in the

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.070 
great distance perspective in the
distance<00:05:54.000> is<00:05:54.150> flatter<00:05:54.450> and<00:05:54.750> I<00:05:54.780> think<00:05:54.960> it's

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
distance is flatter and I think it's

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.629 
distance is flatter and I think it's
worked<00:05:55.260> really<00:05:55.470> well<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.889> it<00:05:56.160> renders<00:05:56.610> the

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
worked really well it it renders the

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.370 
worked really well it it renders the
mountain<00:05:57.000> almost<00:05:57.270> like<00:05:57.450> on<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.660> flat<00:05:57.900> surface

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
mountain almost like on a flat surface

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.170 
mountain almost like on a flat surface
like<00:05:58.410> a<00:05:58.590> painting<00:05:59.130> really<00:05:59.610> caught<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.030> light

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
like a painting really caught the light

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.490 
like a painting really caught the light
well<00:06:00.389> but<00:06:00.599> also<00:06:00.750> what<00:06:00.960> I<00:06:01.020> like<00:06:01.169> about<00:06:01.289> is<00:06:01.440> the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
well but also what I like about is the

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.540 
well but also what I like about is the
photographer's<00:06:01.860> had<00:06:01.919> to<00:06:02.039> work<00:06:02.250> for<00:06:02.460> this

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
photographer's had to work for this
