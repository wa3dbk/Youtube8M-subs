 to share with you today it is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.600
 just a little very very 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.040
 healthy 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.950
 as you come from muscle mass 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.900
 and who sees himself from the outside but hey 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.939
 for children the seducer who say 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.460
 they made the next muscu 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.380
 look at whether it's honoring or 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.360
 another program they will have moments 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.610
 after a few seconds and you can 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.810
 get that same result in a few 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.990
 barely minutes 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.830
 in fact it is a body language 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.270
 the way you walk the way 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.390
 worn with others in a place 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.370
 social in a bar in nightclub in 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.580
 a private party where when you are 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.260
 so in the street for example we're going 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.420
 give some impression of you 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.330
 same and this pressure system is 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.780
 influenced by your pace if you are 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.180
 someone athletic if you are 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.130
 some muscles and sportsmen or 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.620
 even if on the contrary we perceive you 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.350
 like someone very skinny or a 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.210
 little bit too much but you can improve the 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.210
 perception people have of you that is 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.340
 that he some illusions he showed that 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.410
 you have more muscle all 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.080
 simply by improving your posture 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.790
 you have found that watching 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.100
 people who are actually athletic 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.130
 people who have muscle but just 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.770
 aesthetic ie musk can 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.870
 see when you observe their approach 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.550
 there is a little trick that is easy to 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.100
 produce at the level of the freedom of the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.560
 movement and muscles that we are going to have 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.810
 gasoline by walking ie the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.820
 volume includes is usually the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.610
 seductive apprentices and it may be 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.950
 your problem too when they get 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.510
 hold their company he is silent from a 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.610
 very closed circle 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.530
 it takes up as little space as possible 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.060
 while if we want to be more comfortable 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.340
 inside of ourselves and 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.060
 secondly communicated after this record 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.340
 of ourselves 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.630
 you just have to learn how to 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.840
 take more space 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.150
 it's in a place for example in a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 place kind of private parties or even 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.239
 in your couch instead of staying 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.480
 like these close up on yourself 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.300
 like thursday with your little wood are 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.640
 so be stuck in a cube created by 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.260
 your body when you sit for 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.140
 leave plenty of room for others 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.850
 take more space because it's 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.850
 easier if you have already installed 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.800
 quietly in your sofa in link 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.630
 arm resting on the back of the sofa 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.640
 to make sure that a girl 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.500
 come and sit here they are 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.680
 already at lezennes counterfeit their physique 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.120
 that stuff like that was going on 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.120
 with her and m 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.340
 because the current passes your arm 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.640
 it's more complicated so that's very 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:51.520
 simple if you do it to you must 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.500
 your chest to raise a little head 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.230
 when I walk down the street you 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.300
 pulled out that you occupy more space 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.360
 sheets the same rendering as if you 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.260
 start realistic that bombs 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.780
 the advantage of raising points 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.500
 before because they give you more tone 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.930
 muscular 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.940
 you will have this effect there in 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.400
 first weeks but having 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.440
 a better posture will give the same 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.489
 feel as if you have won 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.080
 muscles 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.989
 so that was my little advice 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.979
 in quotes Galicia is kilos of 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.919
 muscles in dry timer that's all 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.150
 simply that you can improve 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.360
 the impression we have on you 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.400
 altering your posture taking more than 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.890
 place having legs a little more 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.810
 discarded by finding a little more the 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.300
 chest speaking during all 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.640
 just more space 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.890
 when you express yourself could win 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.919
 it's just there 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.570
 as if you had taken volume so 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.020
 use this advice you'll see the 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.750
 result 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.870
 and if you have comments from 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.170
 questions as usual you like it 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.050
 you are in the comments below 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.580
 and then like that I read every 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.560
 comments 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.620
