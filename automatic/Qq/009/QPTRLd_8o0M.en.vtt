to find out how to make it
sickly<00:00:10.230> as<00:00:10.320> hell

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.230 

okay<00:00:15.440> so<00:00:15.500> first<00:00:15.889> things<00:00:16.129> first<00:00:16.250> when<00:00:17.029> you<00:00:17.090> make

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
okay so first things first when you make

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.910 
okay so first things first when you make
them<00:00:17.420> built<00:00:17.660> on<00:00:17.869> it's<00:00:18.140> really<00:00:18.470> important<00:00:18.890> that

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
them built on it's really important that

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.070 
them built on it's really important that
you<00:00:19.100> get<00:00:19.279> a<00:00:19.310> good<00:00:19.520> quality<00:00:19.580> cut<00:00:20.330> of<00:00:20.420> meat<00:00:20.630> so

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
you get a good quality cut of meat so

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.510 
you get a good quality cut of meat so
you<00:00:21.170> want<00:00:21.320> to<00:00:21.380> get<00:00:21.500> either<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:21.770> top<00:00:22.009> side<00:00:22.279> or

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
you want to get either a top side or

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.790 
you want to get either a top side or
silver<00:00:22.880> side<00:00:23.090> of<00:00:23.270> beef<00:00:23.450> and<00:00:23.660> here<00:00:24.200> I'm<00:00:24.410> using<00:00:24.439> a

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
silver side of beef and here I'm using a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.150 
silver side of beef and here I'm using a
topside

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.940 

and<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.539> next<00:00:29.720> step<00:00:29.990> is<00:00:30.170> to<00:00:30.320> slice<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.770> beef

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
and the next step is to slice the beef

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.160 
and the next step is to slice the beef
into<00:00:31.310> really<00:00:31.550> thin<00:00:31.640> slices<00:00:32.390> now<00:00:32.900> you<00:00:32.960> will

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
into really thin slices now you will

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.780 
into really thin slices now you will
need<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.380> really<00:00:33.770> sharp<00:00:33.800> knife<00:00:34.100> for<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:34.610> in

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
need a really sharp knife for this in

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.460 
need a really sharp knife for this in
order<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:35.090> get<00:00:35.270> it<00:00:35.420> as<00:00:35.510> thin<00:00:35.720> as<00:00:35.840> possible<00:00:36.290> and

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
order to get it as thin as possible and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.990 
order to get it as thin as possible and
it's<00:00:37.010> important<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.400> remember<00:00:37.610> that<00:00:37.790> the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
it's important to remember that the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.610 
it's important to remember that the
thicker<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:38.420> meat<00:00:38.629> when<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:38.930> slice<00:00:39.200> it<00:00:39.470> the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
thicker the meat when you slice it the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.229 
thicker the meat when you slice it the
tougher<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.040> will<00:00:40.129> be<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.400> eat<00:00:40.580> once<00:00:41.090> you've

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
tougher it will be to eat once you've

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.229 
tougher it will be to eat once you've
made<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.540> bill<00:00:41.720> top

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
made the bill top

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.510 
made the bill top
okay<00:00:44.020> so<00:00:44.350> your<00:00:44.500> meat<00:00:44.620> is<00:00:44.770> all<00:00:44.920> sliced<00:00:45.219> into

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
okay so your meat is all sliced into

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.549 
okay so your meat is all sliced into
thin<00:00:45.610> pieces<00:00:46.090> for<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.870> next<00:00:46.899> step<00:00:47.320> is<00:00:47.469> you

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
thin pieces for the next step is you

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.959 
thin pieces for the next step is you
need<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.739> get<00:00:47.920> yourself<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.280> bowl<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:48.790> pour

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
need to get yourself a bowl and pour

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.720 
need to get yourself a bowl and pour
some<00:00:49.120> vinegar<00:00:49.300> it

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.220 

and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.180> each<00:00:54.270> piece<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.720> meat<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.080> need

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and then for each piece of meat you need

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.870 
and then for each piece of meat you need
to<00:00:55.320> dip<00:00:55.470> it<00:00:55.590> into<00:00:55.740> the<00:00:55.920> vinegar<00:00:56.310> making<00:00:56.790> sure

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
to dip it into the vinegar making sure

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.880 
to dip it into the vinegar making sure
it's<00:00:57.030> covered<00:00:57.330> on<00:00:57.450> both<00:00:57.480> sides<00:00:57.990> and<00:00:58.500> then

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's covered on both sides and then

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.590 
it's covered on both sides and then
leave<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.400> vinegar<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.880> drain<00:01:00.090> off<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
leave the vinegar to drain off for a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.760 
leave the vinegar to drain off for a
couple<00:01:00.900> of<00:01:00.930> seconds<00:01:03.110> simply<00:01:04.110> repeat<00:01:04.380> this<00:01:04.530> for

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
couple of seconds simply repeat this for

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.830 
couple of seconds simply repeat this for
each<00:01:04.860> piece<00:01:05.130> of<00:01:05.160> meat<00:01:05.520> then<00:01:06.000> lay<00:01:06.330> them<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.690> on

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
each piece of meat then lay them all on

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.710 
each piece of meat then lay them all on
a<00:01:06.870> plate<00:01:07.170> once<00:01:07.500> they've<00:01:07.740> been<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> vinegar

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
a plate once they've been in the vinegar

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.210 
a plate once they've been in the vinegar
so<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.050> a<00:01:10.080> plate<00:01:10.350> full<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> meat<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
so we have a plate full of meat so the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590 
so we have a plate full of meat so the
next<00:01:11.400> step<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.180> yourself<00:01:12.270> some

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
next step is to get yourself some

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.390 
next step is to get yourself some
seasoning<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.590> arm<00:01:13.770> using<00:01:13.920> barbecue

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
seasoning the arm using barbecue

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.530 
seasoning the arm using barbecue
seasoning<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.300> you're<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.450> an

seasoning here but if you're on an
experiment<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.410> use<00:01:16.590> any<00:01:16.740> other<00:01:16.830> types

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
experiment you can use any other types

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.170 
experiment you can use any other types
as<00:01:17.430> well

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.490 

and<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.300> you<00:01:21.390> need<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.660> do<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.990> sparingly

then flip the meat over and put some
more<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:26.970> other<00:01:27.000> side<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.720> well

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.090 

now<00:01:31.689> it's<00:01:31.869> here<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.530> waiting<00:01:32.890> game

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100

now it's here that the waiting game
begins<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:34.360> we<00:01:34.630> need<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.840> leave<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.140> meet<00:01:35.320> now

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
begins so we need to leave the meet now

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
to get the bill toolmaker out so with

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.099 
to get the bill toolmaker out so with
the<00:01:46.659> meet

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
the meet

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.539 
the meet
hang<00:01:47.259> them<00:01:47.409> onto<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.770> meat<00:01:47.920> hooks<00:01:48.189> and<00:01:48.429> then

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
hang them onto the meat hooks and then

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.359 
hang them onto the meat hooks and then
hang<00:01:48.759> them<00:01:48.909> into<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.390> bill<00:01:49.570> tool<00:01:49.750> maker<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
hang them into the bill tool maker and

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.770 
hang them into the bill tool maker and
when<00:01:51.549> doing<00:01:51.729> this<00:01:51.939> it's<00:01:52.179> important<00:01:52.630> not<00:01:52.719> to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
when doing this it's important not to

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.940 
when doing this it's important not to
put<00:01:53.020> too<00:01:53.049> much<00:01:53.289> in<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.920> overload

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.190 

and<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.060> built-in<00:01:59.360> makeup<00:01:59.630> I'm<00:01:59.689> using<00:01:59.719> here

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
and the built-in makeup I'm using here

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.170 
and the built-in makeup I'm using here
will<00:02:00.500> allow<00:02:00.590> me<00:02:00.829> to<00:02:00.860> hang<00:02:01.100> nine<00:02:01.520> bits<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.969> meat

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
will allow me to hang nine bits of meat

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.510 
will allow me to hang nine bits of meat
up<00:02:02.420> no<00:02:03.079> longer<00:02:03.469> than<00:02:03.590> thirty<00:02:03.799> centimetres

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
up no longer than thirty centimetres

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.490 
up no longer than thirty centimetres
long

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.889 

okay<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:09.460> all<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.850> meat<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.119> ready<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.780> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
okay so all the meat is ready so the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.660 
okay so all the meat is ready so the
next<00:02:11.080> step<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.680> turn<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.070> biltong<00:02:12.400> maker

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
next step is to turn the biltong maker

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.360 
next step is to turn the biltong maker
on<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:14.200> essentially<00:02:14.650> all<00:02:14.740> this<00:02:14.950> is<00:02:15.130> is<00:02:15.340> a

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
on and essentially all this is is a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.010 
on and essentially all this is is a
light<00:02:15.610> bulb<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.120> fan<00:02:16.390> which<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.750> going<00:02:16.930> to

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
light bulb and a fan which is going to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.570 
light bulb and a fan which is going to
circulate<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.530> warm<00:02:17.830> air<00:02:18.010> around<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.400> meat

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
circulate the warm air around the meat

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.690 
circulate the warm air around the meat
whilst<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.240> clearing<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.830> stick<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.400> lid<00:02:21.550> on

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
whilst is clearing so stick the lid on

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.370 
whilst is clearing so stick the lid on
and<00:02:21.850> then<00:02:21.970> turn<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.780> you'll<00:02:23.230> need<00:02:23.320> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
and then turn it on and you'll need to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.470 
and then turn it on and you'll need to
leave<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.830> between<00:02:24.130> two<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.640> three<00:02:24.700> days<00:02:25.120> and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
leave it between two and three days and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.580 
leave it between two and three days and
you<00:02:25.840> might<00:02:26.020> need<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.230> use<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.380> bit<00:02:26.530> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
you might need to use a bit a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.380 
you might need to use a bit a
trial-and-error<00:02:26.950> here<00:02:27.400> until<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.180> meat<00:02:28.360> is

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
trial-and-error here until the meat is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.710 
trial-and-error here until the meat is
cured<00:02:28.870> nicely<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:31.060> after<00:02:31.330> about<00:02:31.480> two<00:02:31.690> days

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
cured nicely and after about two days

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.449 
cured nicely and after about two days
have<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.320> look<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.650> see<00:02:32.680> if<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> meat<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.190> done

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
have a look to see if the meat is done

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.730 
have a look to see if the meat is done
how<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.700> like<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.360> if<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:34.870> take<00:02:35.470> them<00:02:35.650> out

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
how you like it and if so take them out

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.230 
how you like it and if so take them out
