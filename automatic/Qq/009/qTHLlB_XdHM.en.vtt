00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello friends two weeks have passed i 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.450
 carried thermo gel polish from the cat's company 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.150
 very pleased with how you see 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.929
 I carried my manicure to the very 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.130
 the end 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.140
 despite the fact that I did everything and cooked and 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.960
 cleaned and 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.289
 washed but still manicure 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.320
 lasted absolutely nothing to him 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.680
 there was no cleavage gel varnish 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.660
 I was completely satisfied with the cat 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.899
 you see it has been exactly two weeks and 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.120
 It could be and still wear it but I will 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.480
 I already have enough to shoot first 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.270
 well cut nails from cuticle but 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.640
 secondly, I have already prepared for you 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.219
 the next series 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.020
 exciting videos like you see it up 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.809
 still changes color so beautiful 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.229
 shimmers from one color to another 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.390
 the brilliance also remained he did not fade and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.490
 now i will shoot now we 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.799
 let's see how gel polish in general is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.820
 Does it take off easily or 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:22.290
 hard for that i will need 10 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.310
 pieces of foil from 10 pieces like this 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.730
 conventional cotton wool or cotton pad 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.080
 chopped 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:34.800
 pusha with a hatchet a nail file 180 grit for 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.650
 natural nails forelock figs if then u 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.830
 we will have surplus so they can 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.110
 It was quickly removed means for removing 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.360
 gel varnish remover and upon completion of removal 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.800
 cuticle oil 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.210
 let's get started so I take 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.670
 180 nail file grit and zapilivayu top I do 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.960
 this is for later 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.960
 easy and quick to take off 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.069
 so I will do with the rest of your fingers 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.459
 Now when I sawed the top cover 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.090
 I will apply abundantly on a piece of fleece 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.090
 remover 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.860
 I put it on the nail 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.860
 and carefully tangle the nail foil 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.390
 like this and so I did with 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.200
 other fingers 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.710
 I leave for 10-15 minutes 10 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.580
 minutes 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.580
 try to remove 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.260
 but to be honest, not so good 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.660
 ten minutes later i think these need 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.660
 definitely leave for 15 minutes 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.580
 so itâ€™s quite complicated 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.780
 15 minutes have passed 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.709
 let's see how it goes through 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.709
 15 minutes 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:19.320
 removed easier but still wrong 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:23.120
 he just does that is enough 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.120
 such an aggressive gel polish 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.960
 what I want to say is already passed 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.310
 probably while I take off 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.970
 20 minutes but this nail is not easier 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.970
 removed 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.069
 but now when it's probably gone 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.970
 25 minutes gel varnish began to be removed 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.970
 a little easier 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:12.140
 I'll take it all and remove the remnants of the base 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.920
 remnants of the base are very few of them practically 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:25.040
 no, now I'll take the oil for 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.040
 cuticle and apply 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:39.260
 rubbing movements put on cuticles 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.690
 and side bolsters 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.540
 Well, I really liked friends 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.810
 gel gel polish year and thermo gel polish 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:53.130
 but it is removed quite complicated in 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:56.750
 This should take longer to hold in 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:06:00.720
 means and then it will come off easier 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:04.080
 10 minutes is not enough to remove the gel polish to 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.830
 there that is, I advise you to hold 25 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.590
 25 then it is removed much easier then 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.530
 worked gel varnishes code and who had with 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.730

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.360

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.780

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:31.620
