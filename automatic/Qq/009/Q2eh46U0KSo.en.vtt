00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
here and the first thing you'll notice

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.140 
here and the first thing you'll notice
is<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> phone<00:01:19.650> will<00:01:19.799> say<00:01:20.009> t-mobile<00:01:20.580> g1

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
is that the phone will say t-mobile g1

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.510 
is that the phone will say t-mobile g1
of<00:01:21.570> course<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.409> phone<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> t-mobile

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
of course this phone is on the t-mobile

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.279 
of course this phone is on the t-mobile
network<00:01:23.700> answer<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.359> t-mobile<00:01:24.600> randon<00:01:25.109> right

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
network answer the t-mobile randon right

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.739 
network answer the t-mobile randon right
there<00:01:25.499> and<00:01:25.679> this<00:01:26.219> is<00:01:26.280> called<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.789> g1<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.539> it

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:27.749 
there and this is called the g1 so it

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.330 
there and this is called the g1 so it
makes<00:01:28.259> sense<00:01:28.469> that<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.859> phone<00:01:29.039> would<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
makes sense that the phone would have a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.239 
makes sense that the phone would have a
big<00:01:29.579> g1<00:01:29.939> logo<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.380> um<00:01:31.679> I<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.100> two

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
big g1 logo there so um I do have two

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:33.980 
big g1 logo there so um I do have two
other<00:01:32.460> videos<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> phone<00:01:33.299> itself<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.869> is

other videos on the phone itself one is

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
other videos on the phone itself one is
the<00:01:34.140> unboxing<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.859> is<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> advanced

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the unboxing one is the advanced

social security and location and what
Android<00:04:21.570> does<00:04:21.599> is<00:04:21.840> actually<00:04:21.989> require<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.530> to

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
Android does is actually require you to

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.250 
Android does is actually require you to
have<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.979> pattern<00:04:23.520> for<00:04:24.210> an<00:04:24.300> unlock<00:04:24.599> so<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.110> can

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
have a pattern for an unlock so I can

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.810 
have a pattern for an unlock so I can
set<00:04:25.410> on<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.560> lock<00:04:25.710> pattern<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.220> I'll<00:04:26.340> go<00:04:26.460> next

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
set on a lock pattern so I'll go next

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.650 
set on a lock pattern so I'll go next
and<00:04:28.190> example<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.310> showed<00:04:29.520> me<00:04:29.669> what<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.940> do<00:04:30.090> and

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
and example it showed me what to do and

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.659 
and example it showed me what to do and
I<00:04:30.780> can<00:04:30.960> connect<00:04:31.229> at<00:04:31.410> least<00:04:31.440> four<00:04:31.950> dots<00:04:32.190> at<00:04:32.639> the

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
I can connect at least four dots at the

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.700 
I can connect at least four dots at the
minimum<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.690> if<00:04:33.810> I<00:04:33.900> just<00:04:34.110> wanted<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.410> be<00:04:34.530> that

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
minimum so if I just wanted to be that

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.180 
minimum so if I just wanted to be that
or<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.700> can't<00:04:36.000> do<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.240> I'll<00:04:36.539> do<00:04:36.780> that<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.950> says

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
or I can't do that I'll do that it says

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.200

hit<00:04:39.750> continue<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:40.320> got<00:04:40.469> a<00:04:40.500> draw<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.830> again<00:04:41.130> to

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
hit continue so I got a draw it again to

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.070 
hit continue so I got a draw it again to
make<00:04:41.430> sure<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:41.700> remember<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.360> then

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
make sure that I remember it and then

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.230 
make sure that I remember it and then
hit<00:04:43.200> continue<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.800> now<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.580> can<00:04:44.849> require<00:04:45.180> a

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
hit continue and now I can require a

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.010

so<00:04:46.319> if<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:46.530> lock<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:46.949> screen<00:04:47.220> by<00:04:47.340> hitting<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
so if I lock this screen by hitting the

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.909 
so if I lock this screen by hitting the
end<00:04:47.819> call<00:04:48.030> key<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.449> unlock<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:48.960> now<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.620> got<00:04:49.830> to

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
end call key and unlock it now I got to

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.740 
end call key and unlock it now I got to
draw<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.520> pattern<00:04:50.910> in<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.240> actually<00:04:51.630> get

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
draw that pattern in to actually get

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.320 
draw that pattern in to actually get
into<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:52.139> but<00:04:52.889> another<00:04:53.160> cool<00:04:53.370> thing<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.759> maybe

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
into it but another cool thing is maybe

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.610 
into it but another cool thing is maybe
you<00:04:54.479> don't<00:04:54.720> want<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:54.930> show<00:04:55.110> people<00:04:55.139> you're

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
you don't want to show people you're

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.620 
you don't want to show people you're
actually<00:04:55.770> your<00:04:56.490> actual<00:04:56.910> pattern<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:57.419> you<00:04:57.479> can

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
actually your actual pattern so you can

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.360 
actually your actual pattern so you can
hit<00:04:57.960> use<00:04:58.229> visible<00:04:58.440> pattern<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.069> turn<00:04:59.250> that

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
hit use visible pattern and turn that

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.159 
hit use visible pattern and turn that
off<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.910> now<00:05:00.509> when<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.660> lock<00:05:00.900> your<00:05:01.080> screen

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
off and now when you lock your screen

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.260 
off and now when you lock your screen
again<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.680> go<00:05:01.800> back<00:05:01.830> into<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.430> now<00:05:03.030> when<00:05:03.180> you

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
again and go back into it now when you

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.790 
again and go back into it now when you
draw<00:05:03.479> it<00:05:03.539> people<00:05:04.139> won't<00:05:04.349> see<00:05:04.530> what<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.770> is

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
draw it people won't see what it is

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.129 
draw it people won't see what it is
really<00:05:05.729> nice<00:05:05.849> feature<00:05:06.240> but<00:05:06.389> Audrina's<00:05:06.870> great

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139
