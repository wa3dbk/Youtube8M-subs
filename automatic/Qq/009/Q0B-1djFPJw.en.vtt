00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.410 
really isn't too many they're pretty
squishy<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.980> if<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:26.550> playing<00:01:26.760> against<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
squishy so if you're playing against a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.420 
squishy so if you're playing against a
Thresh<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.230> a<00:01:28.290> Blitzcrank<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.280> get

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Thresh or a Blitzcrank and you get

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
Thresh or a Blitzcrank and you get
hooked<00:01:29.780> early<00:01:30.780> game<00:01:31.050> then<00:01:31.260> you're<00:01:31.350> gonna<00:01:31.470> get

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
hooked early game then you're gonna get

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.950 
hooked early game then you're gonna get
blown<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:31.980> pretty<00:01:32.370> quickly<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.750> make

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
blown up pretty quickly so just make

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.230 
blown up pretty quickly so just make
sure<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.710> dying<00:01:35.550> early<00:01:36.030> game

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
sure that you're not dying early game

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510 
sure that you're not dying early game
make<00:01:36.570> sure<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.960> you're<00:01:37.260> at<00:01:37.979> least<00:01:38.040> going

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
make sure that you're at least going

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.430 
make sure that you're at least going
even<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.150> laning<00:01:39.390> phase<00:01:39.690> because<00:01:40.050> if<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.260> can

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
even in laning phase because if you can

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.530 
even in laning phase because if you can
do<00:01:40.620> that<00:01:40.830> then<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.370> scale<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:42.270> into

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
do that then you scale really well into

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.790 
do that then you scale really well into
the<00:01:42.630> late<00:01:42.840> game<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:43.260> you'll<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.560> able<00:01:43.620> to

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
the late game and you'll be able to

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.580 
the late game and you'll be able to
carry<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.190> lot<00:01:44.310> easier<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.229> here's

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
carry a lot easier that way so here's

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.890 
carry a lot easier that way so here's
some<00:01:46.799> gameplay<00:01:47.010> of<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.549> combo<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> know

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
some gameplay of the combo so I know

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.539 
some gameplay of the combo so I know
that<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.290> gameplay<00:01:49.560> isn't<00:01:49.950> soloqueue

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
that this gameplay isn't soloqueue

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.460 
that this gameplay isn't soloqueue
obviously<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.570> that's<00:01:51.690> besides<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> point

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
obviously but that's besides the point

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.590 
obviously but that's besides the point
because<00:01:53.040> what<00:01:53.400> I'm<00:01:53.490> trying<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.790> get<00:01:53.909> across<00:01:54.270> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
because what I'm trying to get across is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.630 
because what I'm trying to get across is
that<00:01:54.870> when<00:01:55.530> playing<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.070> Tristana<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that when playing the Tristana and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.330 
that when playing the Tristana and
zillion<00:01:57.180> combo<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.780> allows<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.560> Tristana<00:01:59.010> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
zillion combo it allows for Tristana to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.180 
zillion combo it allows for Tristana to
go<00:01:59.520> more<00:02:00.090> aggressive<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:00.990> not<00:02:01.560> care<00:02:02.159> so

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
go more aggressive and just not care so

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.370 
go more aggressive and just not care so

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.420 
one flaw to this combo not working and
that<00:03:43.629> is<00:03:43.690> if<00:03:44.049> Tristana<00:03:44.530> goes<00:03:44.739> aggressive<00:03:45.250> and

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
that is if Tristana goes aggressive and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.479 
that is if Tristana goes aggressive and
zilean<00:03:46.000> does<00:03:46.269> not<00:03:46.449> alter<00:03:46.750> so<00:03:47.500> make<00:03:47.709> sure<00:03:47.889> that

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
zilean does not alter so make sure that

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.250 
zilean does not alter so make sure that
you're<00:03:48.639> communicating<00:03:48.970> with<00:03:49.389> your<00:03:49.599> zillions

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
you're communicating with your zillions

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.319 
you're communicating with your zillions
so<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.620> he<00:03:50.769> knows<00:03:51.040> you're<00:03:51.609> going<00:03:51.849> aggressive

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
so that he knows you're going aggressive

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.059 
so that he knows you're going aggressive
and<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.750> he<00:03:52.900> should<00:03:53.079> put<00:03:53.319> your<00:03:53.470> ultimate<00:03:53.919> on

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
and that he should put your ultimate on

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.189 
and that he should put your ultimate on
you<00:03:54.310> but<00:03:54.819> other<00:03:55.030> than<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.269> guys<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:55.870> combo

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
you but other than that guys the combo

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.809 
you but other than that guys the combo
is<00:03:56.230> super<00:03:56.739> strong<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.220> would<00:03:57.400> definitely

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
is super strong I would definitely

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.420 
is super strong I would definitely
recommend<00:03:58.000> playing<00:03:58.569> it<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:58.919> let<00:03:59.919> me<00:04:00.040> know<00:04:00.190> if
