00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:10.469
 hello friends how are you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:12.240
 good today is Thursday of the blog jay and what 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.190
 promised is debt and here I am from 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.289
 back with a theme 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.020
 but everyday life I think everyone 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.840
 we know about this and then nothing else 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.990
 emphasize the topic because it remained 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 last one time to talk about the car more 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.420
 how many people do not love karma, you know 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.850
 that you do it and you pay for it and 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.550
 pets in a pack and when you 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.300
 They criticize when you attack when you 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.710
 do enough things then like that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.710
 it's cool no me alex presents light 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.030
 little brother is helping me to record 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.360
 and he speaks to them 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.060
 Hello 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.380
 in little sisters it's called doctors who 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.820
 he presented them with it they had been 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.330
 He presented but was smaller now 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.550
 it's a lot bigger, we're going to 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.760
 learn or are we going to talk more or less about 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.550
 what happens then well obviously the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.490
 karma is cause and effect if you do but 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.390
 they are going to return the life or that is what counts 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.580
 that you are so good if it helps 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.900
 Even the old lady, because the street is 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 you are going to return to have more 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.750
 all the more good and bad you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.700
 do all you're going to pay here today in 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.140
 day or be good so that you do not 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.580
 We are going to put you bad luck 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.380
 when I think this is going to happen to you 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.390
 tries to be a correct person a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.580
 just person do not go to the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.340
 end of sitting ready to 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.800
 Serious person and should not be like that and not 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.479
 it must be like this and you should not take this 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.399
 because it really is not what you want 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.380
 do but really that aspect 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.369
 get it done with benevolence 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.680
 be good people more than anything there is a 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.790
 great difference between admiring a 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.490
 person and between 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.900
 selfish or envious as you can say 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 let's put your see a person in the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.640
 school that is very outstanding that you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.370
 you say and that person is you get pure 10 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.810
 very smart there are some activities 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.700
 you can learn the good from that person 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.800
 or that that person studies or where 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.480
 study that person helps or that I'm going to 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.950
 I can help but that's all the time 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.080
 well for the aspect of here and surely 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.540
 is taking out you say because you sleep with 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.120
 the teacher or there is pulling teeth 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.180
 because it really does not do anything right but 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.170
 I do not know or let's put their appearance there 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 a very big difference between you 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.470
 inspire you to sell to a person and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.790
 criticize that person towards the selfish what 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.209
 I can tell you that aspect if you go 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.970
 to criticize and while you speak more badly 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.790
 of a person who is reflecting to you 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.290
 same I recommend that if you want to give 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.720
 a good constructive criticism 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.580
 so if you know I did not like it 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.069
 you said is a photographer 5 can you say it 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.439
 this way ok 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.069
 they are advice that I am giving you 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.069
 Really 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.409
 for example when you already see a person 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.689
 that is winning because you think that 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.349
 people are successful or wheats for the 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.510
 world 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.610
 people are successful because because 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.450
 they distribute their blessings they share what 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.359
 have we are going to put in an example they are going to 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.700
 a superficial example and throw west already 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.010
 has its foundations where it deals 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.930
 money to the needy is contributing 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.730
 that's why he's winning certain blessings 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.620
 of the sky because it is already giving part of 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.040
 what you have then we will put if 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.959
 you know something about some ideas 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.090
 that does not know how to share your information 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.159
 share your knowledge otherwise 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.170
 this one you can also do is your 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.579
 experiences is what a person is 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.859
 happening for a moment and being able 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.389
 to spend such is a joy today of your 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.340
 experience that you are in that moment that 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.859
 person who is in need for you 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.500
 you support yourself and you do not know it but from 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.970
 suddenly you come out with your bread theme 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.920
 helping someone and that is going to 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.290
 return to you as part of karma to 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.349
 help you are going to help you 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.349
 20% 100 public do not know 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.410
 everything has its time let's put me 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.170
 I am the people who expect the 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.780
 karma by shutting down certain people who 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.549
 no good me if you are the only person 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.769
 true but good that what I can you 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.590
 to say is that everything comes in its time or 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.490
 is really this turn what you have 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.610
 what to do is wait a lot and wait 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.569
 Your friend is no longer your friend that you 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.389
 he did an evil and this we are going to put 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.039
 He started talking about you badly because now very 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.870
 bad of you behind your back and nothing else is 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.080
 how I want him to pay I want him to pay 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.910
 I want to pay not exactly the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.520
 same way but it's going to pay and you're going to see 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.169
 you at that moment how are you suffering and 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.350
 It can be good and it can be bad to me 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.630
 part I love when they do something to me 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.470
 my thesis today obviously I do not like it is 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.470
 as of time 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.310
 my little sister tells you the barbie dish and 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.800
 I ended up hitting the shelf with 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.770
 that the forehead then is karma you know 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.510
 everything is paid this you do not have bad people 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.770
 that does not deserve that the cake is bad it 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.760
 really you do not have to try 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.100
 wrong other people because because then 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.810
 they kill you you go to a store and they 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.310
 thinks screams at the person who is 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.320
 is attending because he did not do it well 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.720
 although you are going to be in those shoes 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.220
 I had mass working there and you're going to say 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.690
 because this is also enabling me 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.669
 I know better than I can 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:39.860
 leaves behind jealousy envy and 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.199
 Selfishness because sickly jealousy 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.560
 Carlos in a certain amount are very 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:48.009
 selfishness compatibility permits it 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.009
 what's wrong with it 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.900
 here is envy, so the case 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.729
 you have to envy the 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.069
 neighbor because you have a new car if you 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.560
 you can and you have a car that takes you to 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.060
 certain parts or they have to move you 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.860
 you have to be a car was generated 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.810
 has appeared you have more or less 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.460
 and then the best competition that you 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.490
 you have in this world is with yourself 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.919
 try to excel and try yourself 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.770
 get ahead with your things always 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.939
 simply in the truth but is that 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.219
 point I'm getting at is that 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:29.610
 I want you to be a person that you 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:31.680
 be yourself and you who have felt ames 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.180
 it's all for today this gave me 5 very 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.710
 good ideas for example that I recorded 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.169
 consume already told them in about 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.460
 previous videos if I want to do it 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.650
 but really right now I do not have 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.539
 transport I do not have a motorcycle I have a car and 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.639
 I do not have how to get to places to 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.050
 teach them then consume only 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.159
 when I have the opportunity to 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.099
 I'm going to do it 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:52.379
 ok and also the recipe the guacamole or 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:53.819
 how good I am going to make the recipe 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.659
 guacamole nothing more with their homes 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:59.659
 because here in Mexico they are expensive with 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.659
 recipe
