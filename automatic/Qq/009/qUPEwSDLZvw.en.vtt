the<00:03:53.349> diapers<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.859> had<00:03:54.040> them<00:03:54.220> snapped<00:03:54.609> on<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
the diapers I had them snapped on the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.370 
the diapers I had them snapped on the
right<00:03:55.030> rise<00:03:55.329> setting<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:57.900> allowed<00:03:58.900> them<00:03:59.079> to<00:03:59.139> use

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
right rise setting I allowed them to use

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.050 
right rise setting I allowed them to use
velcro<00:03:59.650> closures<00:04:00.310> because<00:04:00.340> they're<00:04:00.819> really

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
velcro closures because they're really

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.110 
velcro closures because they're really
easy<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.840> then<00:04:02.380> once<00:04:02.560> they<00:04:02.739> were<00:04:02.799> use<00:04:03.160> its<00:04:03.849> um

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
easy and then once they were use its um

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.940 
easy and then once they were use its um

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
put it straight in the diaper pail and

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.809 
put it straight in the diaper pail and
then<00:04:08.049> once<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.349> got<00:04:08.380> home<00:04:08.709> from<00:04:08.919> school<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.730> would

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
then once I got home from school I would

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.440 
then once I got home from school I would
get<00:04:10.359> it<00:04:10.450> out<00:04:10.569> and<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:10.959> would

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.430 
care of all the dirty ones I'd spray him

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.890 
out then I never made them do anything
hard<00:04:15.590> step<00:04:15.830> I<00:04:15.950> never<00:04:16.160> made<00:04:16.639> Thomas<00:04:17.090> wash<00:04:17.630> the

hard step I never made Thomas wash the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.420 
hard step I never made Thomas wash the

diapers I did all the washing edit
everything<00:04:19.639> and<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.570> really<00:04:21.169> wanted<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.590> make

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
everything and I really wanted to make

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.280 
everything and I really wanted to make
make<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.400> as<00:04:22.520> easy<00:04:22.730> for<00:04:22.910> him<00:04:23.300> as<00:04:23.570> possible<00:04:24.139> and

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
make it as easy for him as possible and

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.719 
make it as easy for him as possible and
for<00:04:24.669> Thomas's<00:04:25.669> parents<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.250> really

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
for Thomas's parents so that really

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.219 
for Thomas's parents so that really
really<00:04:29.150> got<00:04:29.300> them<00:04:29.450> on<00:04:29.540> board<00:04:29.720> because<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:30.110> just

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
really got them on board because it just

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.020 
really got them on board because it just
it<00:04:30.470> really<00:04:30.650> was<00:04:30.979> no<00:04:31.130> different<00:04:31.550> than<00:04:31.700> using

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
it really was no different than using

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.180 
it really was no different than using
disposable<00:04:32.690> diapers<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.260> then<00:04:33.710> once<00:04:34.010> they

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
disposable diapers and then once they

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.940 
disposable diapers and then once they
got<00:04:34.400> used<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:35.270> using<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.960> velcro<00:04:36.169> ones<00:04:36.560> then<00:04:36.830> I

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
got used to using the velcro ones then I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.610 
got used to using the velcro ones then I
slowly<00:04:37.310> introduce<00:04:38.060> some<00:04:38.270> snap<00:04:38.600> diapers<00:04:39.110> and

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
slowly introduce some snap diapers and

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.219 
slowly introduce some snap diapers and
and<00:04:40.580> then<00:04:40.790> after<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.300> slowly<00:04:41.720> introduce

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
and then after that I slowly introduce

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.000 
and then after that I slowly introduce
some<00:04:42.500> um<00:04:44.080> more<00:04:45.080> diapers<00:04:45.290> that<00:04:45.500> others<00:04:45.860> would

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
some um more diapers that others would

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.050 
some um more diapers that others would
think<00:04:46.040> might<00:04:46.460> be<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.639> little<00:04:46.790> bit<00:04:46.940> more

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
think might be a little bit more

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.430 
think might be a little bit more
difficult<00:04:47.210> but<00:04:47.930> by<00:04:48.050> then<00:04:48.229> they<00:04:48.380> are

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
difficult but by then they are

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.659 
difficult but by then they are
completely<00:04:48.710> comfortable<00:04:49.130> with<00:04:49.400> cloth

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
completely comfortable with cloth

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.280 
completely comfortable with cloth
diapers<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.630> once<00:04:50.780> they're<00:04:50.960> completely

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
diapers and once they're completely

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.750 
diapers and once they're completely
comfortable<00:04:51.530> with<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.979> concept<00:04:52.340> comfortable

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
comfortable with the concept comfortable

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.879 
comfortable with the concept comfortable
with<00:04:53.030> cloth<00:04:53.210> diapers<00:04:53.630> then<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.900> can<00:04:54.169> start

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
with cloth diapers then you can start

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.450 
with cloth diapers then you can start
getting<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.340> harder<00:04:56.300> ones<00:04:56.510> and<00:04:56.750> then<00:04:57.460> they'll

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
getting the harder ones and then they'll

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.730 
getting the harder ones and then they'll
usually<00:04:58.639> come<00:04:58.940> around<00:04:59.260> anyways<00:05:00.260> that's<00:05:00.470> what

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
usually come around anyways that's what

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.070 
usually come around anyways that's what
happened<00:05:01.040> in<00:05:01.070> my<00:05:01.130> situation<00:05:01.780> also<00:05:02.780> another

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080

happened in my situation also another
thing<00:05:03.200> that<00:05:03.620> really<00:05:03.800> helped<00:05:04.160> with<00:05:04.250> Thomas<00:05:04.669> was

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
thing that really helped with Thomas was

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.390
