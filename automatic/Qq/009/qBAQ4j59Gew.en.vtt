00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.000 
throttle the other the entire time but
we<00:02:14.150> also<00:02:14.330> have<00:02:14.599> fixed<00:02:14.870> settings<00:02:15.319> we<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:15.980> a

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
we also have fixed settings we have a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.759 
we also have fixed settings we have a
setting<00:02:16.280> called<00:02:16.519> max<00:02:16.849> range<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.620> is

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
setting called max range and this is

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.280 
setting called max range and this is
just<00:02:18.980> under<00:02:19.220> two<00:02:19.459> knots

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.360 

runtime<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.340> again<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.849> very<00:02:26.209> efficient<00:02:26.810> motor

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
runtime so again a very efficient motor

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.319 
runtime so again a very efficient motor
so<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.849> six<00:02:29.120> hours<00:02:30.610> fixed<00:02:31.610> time<00:02:31.879> is<00:02:32.120> one

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
so this is six hours fixed time is one

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.530 
so this is six hours fixed time is one
hour

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.589 

Oh<00:02:35.629> Bravo<00:02:36.680> 30

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.330 

lastly<00:02:42.599> we're<00:02:42.900> using<00:02:43.140> technologies<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.159> well

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
lastly we're using technologies as well

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.399 
lastly we're using technologies as well
we<00:02:44.579> are<00:02:44.609> using<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:45.180> brushless<00:02:45.480> digital<00:02:46.170> motor

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
we are using a brushless digital motor

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.259 
we are using a brushless digital motor
with<00:02:46.709> rare<00:02:46.950> earth<00:02:47.129> magnets<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.939> sit<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
with rare earth magnets and sit in the

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.229 
with rare earth magnets and sit in the
base<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.659> unit<00:02:49.189> that<00:02:50.189> motor<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.760> pushing<00:02:51.150> a

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
base of the unit that motor is pushing a

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.149 
base of the unit that motor is pushing a
12<00:02:51.569> inch<00:02:51.749> propeller<00:02:52.170> with<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.409> 10<00:02:52.680> inch<00:02:52.709> pitch

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
12 inch propeller with a 10 inch pitch

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.970 
12 inch propeller with a 10 inch pitch
so<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.269> overall<00:02:54.689> efficiency<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.379> this<00:02:55.620> motor

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
so the overall efficiency of this motor

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.640 
so the overall efficiency of this motor
in<00:02:56.250> water<00:02:56.639> is<00:02:57.000> 44%<00:02:57.750> making<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.469> most

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
in water is 44% making it the most

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.209 
in water is 44% making it the most
efficient<00:02:59.159> motor<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.639> world<00:02:59.909> as<00:03:00.030> well
