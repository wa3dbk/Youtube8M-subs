while<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.900> lightweight<00:01:19.740> obviously<00:01:20.460> all

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
while this is lightweight obviously all

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.399 
while this is lightweight obviously all
these<00:01:20.700> items<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.659> uh<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.290> know

for what it's for what it does I find it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.859 
for what it's for what it does I find it
still<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:24.990> quite<00:01:25.229> lightweight<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.909> I'm

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
still to be quite lightweight I I'm

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.270 
still to be quite lightweight I I'm
convinced<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.530> asked<00:01:28.799> actually<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
convinced I asked actually one of the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.679 
convinced I asked actually one of the
guys<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.610> Gerber<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.090> he<00:01:30.180> said<00:01:30.390> he<00:01:30.479> doesn't

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
guys at Gerber and he said he doesn't

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.030 
guys at Gerber and he said he doesn't
know<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.079> I'm<00:01:31.140> convinced<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> like

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
know but I'm convinced this is like

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.950 
know but I'm convinced this is like
something<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.210> fell<00:01:33.479> off<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.930> of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
something like this fell off one of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
something like this fell off one of
their<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.560> metalworking<00:01:35.130> machines<00:01:35.579> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
their you know metalworking machines and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
their you know metalworking machines and
it<00:01:36.659> landed<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> ground<00:01:37.229> they<00:01:37.350> said<00:01:37.500> hey

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it landed on the ground they said hey

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.899 
it landed on the ground they said hey
you<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.130> make<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> product<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you know we can make a product out of

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.210 
you know we can make a product out of
that<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.240> that's<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.500> story<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:40.890> least<00:01:41.040> about

that so that's my story at least about

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.249 
that so that's my story at least about
probably<00:01:41.579> where<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.790> came<00:01:41.939> from<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.450> gerber

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
probably where it came from so gerber

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.319 
probably where it came from so gerber
chard<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> run<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.880> probably<00:01:45.180> around

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
chard going to run you probably around

there just pull this up close you can

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.070 
there just pull this up close you can
see<00:05:12.420> it<00:05:12.900> think<00:05:13.260> let's<00:05:13.770> see<00:05:14.630> hey<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:15.660> can<00:05:15.930> see

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
see it think let's see hey you can see

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.860 
see it think let's see hey you can see
those<00:05:16.230> little<00:05:16.410> hashes<00:05:16.980> there<00:05:17.250> so<00:05:17.820> that<00:05:18.270> is<00:05:18.510> a

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
those little hashes there so that is a

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.250 
those little hashes there so that is a
very<00:05:19.170> small<00:05:19.680> ruler<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:21.720> then<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.140> the<00:05:22.230> other

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
very small ruler and then on the other

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.670 
very small ruler and then on the other
side<00:05:23.450> you<00:05:24.450> can<00:05:24.630> see<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.840> hashes<00:05:25.200> as<00:05:25.290> well<00:05:25.470> so

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
side you can see the hashes as well so

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.380 
side you can see the hashes as well so
that<00:05:25.800> your<00:05:26.660> your<00:05:27.660> metric<00:05:28.050> over<00:05:28.290> there<00:05:28.500> and

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
that your your metric over there and

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.820 
that your your metric over there and
then<00:05:30.390> open<00:05:30.720> it<00:05:30.810> up<00:05:30.870> you've<00:05:31.050> got<00:05:31.200> basically<00:05:31.560> two

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
then open it up you've got basically two

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.040 
then open it up you've got basically two
blades<00:05:32.310> so<00:05:32.700> you've<00:05:33.000> got<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.210> small<00:05:33.450> hacksaw

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
blades so you've got a small hacksaw

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.700 
blades so you've got a small hacksaw
it's<00:05:34.290> serrated<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:36.360> then<00:05:36.900> you<00:05:37.020> have<00:05:37.200> a<00:05:37.230> fold

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
it's serrated and then you have a fold

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.330 
it's serrated and then you have a fold
that<00:05:37.860> away<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:40.110> then<00:05:40.560> you<00:05:40.650> do<00:05:40.800> have<00:05:40.830> basically

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
that away and then you do have basically

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.140 
that away and then you do have basically
you<00:05:41.670> know<00:05:42.420> a<00:05:42.690> razor<00:05:43.430> that's<00:05:44.430> built<00:05:44.760> in<00:05:44.940> there

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
you know a razor that's built in there

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.790 
you know a razor that's built in there
so<00:05:45.450> that's<00:05:45.900> gonna<00:05:46.050> be<00:05:46.170> very<00:05:46.230> sharp<00:05:46.620> you're

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
so that's gonna be very sharp you're

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.780 
so that's gonna be very sharp you're
certainly<00:05:47.010> not<00:05:47.130> going<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.340> be<00:05:47.400> doing<00:05:47.580> any

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
certainly not going to be doing any

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.190 
certainly not going to be doing any
batana<00:05:48.180> or<00:05:48.420> something<00:05:48.660> like<00:05:48.720> that<00:05:48.780> with<00:05:49.050> this

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
batana or something like that with this

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.500 
batana or something like that with this
but<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:50.040> do<00:05:50.400> there<00:05:50.610> have<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:50.970> blade<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.300> know

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510
