well<00:01:52.010> so<00:01:52.729> really<00:01:52.760> the<00:01:53.060> fundamental<00:01:53.570> way<00:01:53.659> that

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
well so really the fundamental way that

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.840 
well so really the fundamental way that
we<00:01:53.870> manage<00:01:54.140> bears<00:01:54.590> for<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.920> most<00:01:55.130> part<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.580> to

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
we manage bears for the most part is to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.090 
we manage bears for the most part is to
keep<00:01:56.060> our<00:01:56.750> food<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.140> our<00:01:57.200> garbage<00:01:57.560> away<00:01:57.740> from

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
keep our food in our garbage away from

keep our food in our garbage away from
black<00:01:58.310> bears<00:01:58.549> by<00:01:59.540> doing<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.049> it<00:02:00.200> helps<00:02:00.440> to

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
black bears by doing so it helps to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.020 
black bears by doing so it helps to
