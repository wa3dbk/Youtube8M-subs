00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.689
 hello guys I'm jj green from the forum of a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.690
 usual and we should make this video for 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.090
 demonstrate how ruth is made in our 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.970
 tablet in the night and although it is also 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.010
 valid for the 'u' 10 z first 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:21.080
 you have to put the file 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.119
 that you can download from the post 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.720
 I will publish it later in the 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:30.529
 description of the video and it's called road to 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.230
 10 z works a lot and dot zip it 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.120
 we have in the memory of the tablet what 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.300
 what we have to do is turn it off 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.340
 complete the option we can mark it not 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.900
 it's independent 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.879
 we turn off what we have to do is 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.320
 turn it on the memory recovery mode 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.510
 than to turn it on in recovery mode 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.829
 we have to press the home button the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.649
 power button simultaneously 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.649
 at the same time so we keep them pressed 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.170
 at the same time you have to wait it turns on very 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.140
 fast you have the android screen and 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.460
 it goes off is because it does not detect at all 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.979
 well the sequence so much what 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.350
 we have to do is drop and go back to 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.990
 press both at the same time it will take a 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.479
 little more but it will start in mode 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.159
 recovery first the usual part and 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.450
 then the recovery screen with the 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.610
 blue letters 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.799
 we were a little bit to see if it turns on 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.799
 this unusual 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.960
 then the kobe is to say that 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.350
 this is the tool of the govern and is 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.350
 for users a little more touch you 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.570
 Adores say we require 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.640
 a degree of responsibility because no 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.400
 everyone should be able to access now 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.110
 that you can get to load something but 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.170
 good if you do it carefully and read 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.420
 before installing anything a little 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.600
 about how the rest of the world has fared 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.659
 you will not have any kind of problem 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.610
 we have the last recovery in case of 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.200
 that you have the official the only thing 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.930
 what to do is to give apli dates from 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.179
 stern to storage 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.810
 and from there it will be the same as from 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.420
 this in our case as we have wm that 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.569
 we have a previous video we give this 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.849
 the zip steve crow domestic and 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.689
 in this case it tells us that it is not 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:30.189
 mounted the sd card so let's go 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:33.400
 to directly from there to choose a zip 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.920
 from the internal memory that is correct 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.150
 since I do not have any sd card and what 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.760
 what we are using is memory 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.760
 internal of the tablet we go down 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.480
 down 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.980
 we give ruth we ask 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.980
 that we are sure we give to yes 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.300
 it will not take anything this was less 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.660
 heavy even that of the recovery and 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.540
 well you have already got us access 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.780
 of superuser for 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.840
 can run these applications that 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.560
 they require special permits let's say the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:24.019
 tablet we reset it and it should 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.019
 start more or less quickly 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.600
 although we have installed something in the 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.370
 good recovery always usually takes a 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.409
 little bit more 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.299
 well in so little packages and so on and 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.299
 let's see if we are broken 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.860
 for it simply will be enough to verify 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.330
 a root application or download us some of 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.330
 the applications that are in google play 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.750
 because they look to see if they really have 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.430
 superuser access 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.050
 it sounds very fantastic is to say 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.660
 superuser but it's actually called 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.600
 well in the world superuser linux is 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.220
 a well-known and widely used word 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.220
 since good as I say 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.700
 the superuser gives option to many things 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.940
 and I do not have any root applications 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.940
 against the vector 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.920
 and we look 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.750
 ruth 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.220
 the obligation we give 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.260
 this is one of many there are a lot of me 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.610
 I 'm going to download this one because the one 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.210
 I know the unloading is 300 houses 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.210
 Until now 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.000
 and it's already installed I've removed that 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.710
 add the widget here but good we have 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.120
 the drop-down we give to the application 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.120
 we light it 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.470
 he asks us what do we agree 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.610
 we give that if this is a small change 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.790
 we give it to ok and we will verify 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.790
 root access 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.050
 having installed 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.460
 the root is installed an application 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.310
 which is called supersur 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.669
 what it tells us here happiness is you 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.759
 device has root access therefore 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.199
 we have rooted our device 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.940
 satisfactorily and this application that 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.740
 they talked to you superzoom 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.050
 here we have given permissions have 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.820
 records like this application is not 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.260
 uses for nothing simply takes care 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.750
 give permissions as you see we are already root 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.300
 we have access to root we can give 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.490
 permission to applications that need 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.250
 access the system we can enter 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:42.060
 us to the system without problem 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:45.390
 so we have already concluded the matter 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.129
 of the video I hope it serves you and that we 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.889
 you read a lot and as I said before 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:53.819
 in the old one in the previous video there 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:56.259
 you will be doors and try to try everything 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:59.759
 Greetings and see you in our 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.759
 next video goodbye
