00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it's not going to go anywhere it's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.430 
it's not going to go anywhere it's
pretty<00:02:04.950> water-resistant<00:02:05.759> now<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> haven't

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
pretty water-resistant now I haven't

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.170 
pretty water-resistant now I haven't
sit<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.920> didn't<00:02:07.130> go<00:02:07.220> swimming<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:07.880> haven't

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
sit out I didn't go swimming I haven't

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.510 
sit out I didn't go swimming I haven't
been<00:02:08.240> crying<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.350> don't<00:02:09.619> really<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.190> one

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
been crying so I don't really know one

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.880 
been crying so I don't really know one
hundred<00:02:10.880> percent<00:02:10.910> if<00:02:11.510> its<00:02:11.810> water<00:02:12.140> its<00:02:12.590> water

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
hundred percent if its water its water

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.190 
hundred percent if its water its water
resistant<00:02:13.640> which<00:02:14.090> means<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:15.050> not

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
resistant which means it's not

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.930 
resistant which means it's not
waterproof<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.280> don't<00:02:16.490> think<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.760> it's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
waterproof so don't think that it's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.400 
waterproof so don't think that it's
going<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.150> stay<00:02:17.300> on<00:02:17.330> while<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.810> go<00:02:17.990> scuba

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
going to stay on while you go scuba

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.970 
going to stay on while you go scuba
diving<00:02:18.440> it's<00:02:19.340> going<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.120> stay<00:02:20.840> on<00:02:20.870> with<00:02:21.530> light

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
diving it's going to stay on with light

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.340 
diving it's going to stay on with light
water<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.820> little<00:02:23.060> bit<00:02:23.300> it's<00:02:23.480> great<00:02:23.690> for<00:02:23.870> oily

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
water a little bit it's great for oily

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.290 
water a little bit it's great for oily
lids<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.070> if<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.400> tend<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.730> get<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.910> little<00:02:26.030> oily

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
lids so if you tend to get a little oily

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.690 
lids so if you tend to get a little oily
in<00:02:26.570> here<00:02:26.870> its<00:02:27.080> water<00:02:27.710> resistant<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.550> it's

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
in here its water resistant so it's

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.370 
in here its water resistant so it's
going<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.880> be<00:02:28.970> able<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.420> have<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.900> longer

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
going to be able to have a longer

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
going to be able to have a longer
staying<00:02:30.800> power<00:02:31.160> in<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:32.270> situation<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:34.280> it

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
staying power in that situation so it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.240 
staying power in that situation so it
has<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.550> really<00:02:34.880> cool<00:02:35.270> packaging<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.860> actually

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
has a really cool packaging it actually

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.470 
has a really cool packaging it actually
looks<00:02:37.430> like<00:02:37.550> something<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:37.940> might<00:02:37.970> see<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.390> at

can<00:02:57.530> also<00:02:57.740> use<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.220> for<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:58.670> temporary

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
can also use it for like temporary

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.690 
can also use it for like temporary
tattoos<00:03:00.170> or<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.470> you're<00:03:00.650> doing<00:03:00.890> body<00:03:01.130> or<00:03:01.370> any

tattoos or if you're doing body or any
sort<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.090> things<00:03:02.300> like<00:03:02.480> that<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:03.290> can<00:03:03.530> use

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
sort of things like that you can use

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.610 
sort of things like that you can use
this<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.240> to<00:03:05.450> create<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.870> outline<00:03:06.350> or

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
this for it to create the outline or

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.170 
this for it to create the outline or
whatever<00:03:06.860> now<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.400> haven't<00:03:07.730> had<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.880> chance<00:03:07.910> to

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
whatever now I haven't had a chance to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.460 
whatever now I haven't had a chance to
do<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.660> just<00:03:08.720> think<00:03:08.930> it'd<00:03:09.140> be<00:03:09.170> really

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
do that but I just think it'd be really

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.170 
do that but I just think it'd be really
creative<00:03:09.800> if<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.430> are<00:03:10.610> trying<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.000> do

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
creative if you are trying to do

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.210 
creative if you are trying to do
something<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.660> little<00:03:11.690> out<00:03:11.989> of<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.260> box<00:03:12.800> maybe

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
something a little out of the box maybe

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.100 
something a little out of the box maybe
you're<00:03:13.370> going<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.580> create<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.090> Lana<00:03:14.480> Del<00:03:14.840> Rey

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
you're going to create the Lana Del Rey

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.750 
you're going to create the Lana Del Rey

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that you're inspired by that maybe you

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.870 
that you're inspired by that maybe you
could<00:03:18.650> create<00:03:18.920> those<00:03:19.220> little<00:03:19.459> teardrops

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880
