strong<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.510> cell<00:02:19.500> which<00:02:20.250> was<00:02:20.490> proved<00:02:20.880> by<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
strong as cell which was proved by the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.470 
strong as cell which was proved by the
fight<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.800> Gohan<00:02:23.400> against<00:02:23.700> Deborah<00:02:24.120> which<00:02:24.300> was

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
fight of Gohan against Deborah which was

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.250 
fight of Gohan against Deborah which was
mentioned<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.080> be

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
mentioned to be

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.649 
mentioned to be
about<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.709> level<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.129> cell<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.090> Johan<00:02:27.390> really

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
about the level of cell so Johan really

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.649 
about the level of cell so Johan really
struggled<00:02:28.110> against<00:02:28.560> dabra<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.760> if<00:02:30.090> he<00:02:30.450> lost

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
struggled against dabra so if he lost

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.100 
struggled against dabra so if he lost
the<00:02:30.780> ability<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.370> go<00:02:32.370> mystic<00:02:32.879> he<00:02:33.629> might<00:02:33.930> as

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
the ability to go mystic he might as

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.280 
the ability to go mystic he might as
well<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.409> about<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.549> strong<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.879> cell<00:02:36.360> which<00:02:37.260> is

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
well be about as strong a cell which is

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.920 
well be about as strong a cell which is
really<00:02:37.799> really<00:02:38.099> uncool<00:02:38.700> because<00:02:39.599> he<00:02:39.750> was

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
really really uncool because he was

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.190 
really really uncool because he was
stronger<00:02:40.560> than<00:02:40.590> boo<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:41.430> he's<00:02:41.670> as<00:02:41.989> strong<00:02:42.989> or

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
stronger than boo now he's as strong or

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.890 
stronger than boo now he's as strong or
wicked<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.739> cell<00:02:44.480> however<00:02:45.480> on<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> other

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
wicked and cell however on the other

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.280 
wicked and cell however on the other
hand<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.470> think<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.549> possible<00:02:48.290> or

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
hand I think that this is possible or

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.190 
hand I think that this is possible or
just<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.769> know<00:02:49.799> possibly<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.519> way<00:02:50.849> of<00:02:51.200> making

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
just you know possibly a way of making

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.490 
just you know possibly a way of making
Gohan<00:02:52.739> relevant<00:02:53.579> again<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.629> by<00:02:54.989> making<00:02:55.170> him

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
Gohan relevant again so by making him

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.009 
Gohan relevant again so by making him
weak<00:02:55.769> they<00:02:56.310> may<00:02:56.579> actually<00:02:56.879> make<00:02:57.390> him<00:02:57.629> stronger

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
weak they may actually make him stronger

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.530 
weak they may actually make him stronger
and<00:02:58.409> I'll<00:02:58.890> explain<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.670> second<00:03:00.060> so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and I'll explain that in a second so

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.559 
and I'll explain that in a second so
although<00:03:01.099> mystic<00:03:02.099> gohan<00:03:02.280> was<00:03:02.670> really<00:03:03.299> badass

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
although mystic gohan was really badass

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.599 
although mystic gohan was really badass
really<00:03:04.139> strong<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.829> know<00:03:04.950> everything

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
really strong and you know everything

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.259 
really strong and you know everything
then<00:03:06.569> there<00:03:07.319> isn't<00:03:07.709> really<00:03:08.010> much<00:03:08.340> filled<00:03:09.030> for

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
then there isn't really much filled for

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.960 
then there isn't really much filled for
him<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.659> become<00:03:09.810> stronger<00:03:10.409> he<00:03:11.340> achieved<00:03:11.730> you

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
him to become stronger he achieved you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.699 
him to become stronger he achieved you
know<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> great<00:03:12.569> level<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.260> he's<00:03:13.409> not<00:03:13.560> really

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
know a great level but he's not really

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.080 
know a great level but he's not really
going<00:03:13.950> super<00:03:14.400> saiyan<00:03:14.579> he's<00:03:14.819> not<00:03:14.970> really

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
going super saiyan he's not really

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.240 
going super saiyan he's not really
transforming<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.530> there<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:16.889> much<00:03:17.129> that

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
transforming so there is not much that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.559 
transforming so there is not much that
he<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.579> do<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:19.200> know<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:20.069> become<00:03:20.220> stronger<00:03:20.670> so

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
he can do you know to become stronger so

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.949 
he can do you know to become stronger so
although<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.470> think<00:03:23.129> that<00:03:23.489> perhaps<00:03:23.959> mystic

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
although I think that perhaps mystic

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.470 
although I think that perhaps mystic
gohan<00:03:25.170> could<00:03:25.799> become<00:03:26.209> somewhat<00:03:27.209> stronger

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
gohan could become somewhat stronger

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.409 
gohan could become somewhat stronger
through<00:03:27.930> intense<00:03:28.590> training<00:03:28.980> then<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.060> don't

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
through intense training then I don't

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.960 
through intense training then I don't
think<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.949> would<00:03:32.069> be<00:03:32.129> possible<00:03:32.400> for<00:03:32.699> him

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
think that it would be possible for him

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.559 
think that it would be possible for him
to<00:03:33.470> become<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.949> know<00:03:34.980> as<00:03:35.280> strong<00:03:35.790> or<00:03:36.120> almost

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
to become you know as strong or almost

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.330 
to become you know as strong or almost
as<00:03:36.840> strong<00:03:37.139> as<00:03:37.349> Super<00:03:37.769> Saiyan<00:03:38.040> God<00:03:38.280> Super

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
as strong as Super Saiyan God Super

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.259 
as strong as Super Saiyan God Super
Saiyan<00:03:38.910> Goku<00:03:39.150> or<00:03:39.359> Vegeta<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:40.739> perhaps<00:03:41.269> through

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
Saiyan Goku or Vegeta so perhaps through

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.629 
Saiyan Goku or Vegeta so perhaps through
making<00:03:43.139> him<00:03:43.319> wait<00:03:43.620> for<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.010> sake<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.250> this

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
making him wait for the sake of this

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.629 
making him wait for the sake of this
movie<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.480> making<00:03:46.319> him<00:03:46.530> going<00:03:46.949> back<00:03:47.370> into

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
movie for making him going back into

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.259 
movie for making him going back into
Super<00:03:48.299> Saiyan<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.780> Super<00:03:49.109> Saiyan<00:03:49.139> 2<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.970> may

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
actually become a stepping stone for him

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.080 
actually become a stepping stone for him

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
strongest in busoga but by the time when

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.520 
strongest in busoga but by the time when

battle of gods took place he was he
seemed<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:12.890> be<00:06:12.980> weaker<00:06:13.610> than<00:06:13.640> both<00:06:14.630> Goku<00:06:15.080> and

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
seemed to be weaker than both Goku and

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.520 
seemed to be weaker than both Goku and
Vegeta<00:06:15.230> and<00:06:15.860> now<00:06:16.490> in<00:06:16.790> revival<00:06:17.300> of<00:06:17.360> f<00:06:17.600> he<00:06:18.290> seems

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
Vegeta and now in revival of f he seems

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.720 
Vegeta and now in revival of f he seems
to<00:06:18.800> be<00:06:18.980> really<00:06:19.240> irrelevant<00:06:20.830> so<00:06:21.830> I<00:06:22.190> have<00:06:22.610> this

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
to be really irrelevant so I have this

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.910 
to be really irrelevant so I have this
bad<00:06:22.940> feeling<00:06:22.970> that<00:06:23.300> he<00:06:23.570> may<00:06:23.900> become<00:06:24.860> a

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
bad feeling that he may become a

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.560 
bad feeling that he may become a
supporting<00:06:25.520> character<00:06:25.730> and<00:06:26.180> that's<00:06:26.420> what<00:06:26.540> I

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
supporting character and that's what I

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.540 
supporting character and that's what I
don't<00:06:26.900> like<00:06:27.110> because<00:06:27.710> they<00:06:27.950> actually<00:06:28.130> hope

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
don't like because they actually hope

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.460 
don't like because they actually hope
that<00:06:28.730> he's<00:06:28.850> gonna<00:06:29.030> get<00:06:29.210> some<00:06:29.420> spotlight<00:06:29.900> you

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
that he's gonna get some spotlight you

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.140 
that he's gonna get some spotlight you
know<00:06:30.620> maybe<00:06:30.830> transform<00:06:31.430> into<00:06:31.580> Super<00:06:31.940> Saiyan

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
know maybe transform into Super Saiyan

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.970 
know maybe transform into Super Saiyan
God<00:06:32.390> they<00:06:33.230> don't<00:06:33.410> think<00:06:33.560> that<00:06:33.650> he's<00:06:33.770> going<00:06:33.920> to

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
become the strongest again but maybe

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.020
