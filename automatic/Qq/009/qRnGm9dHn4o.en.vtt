transferring<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.369> fingerprint<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.899> not

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
transferring a fingerprint and it's not

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
transferring a fingerprint and it's not
clear<00:01:49.170> from<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:50.130> transferred<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.939> from

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
clear from what they transferred it from

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
clear from what they transferred it from
so<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.750> sure<00:01:51.960> we're<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.290> sure<00:01:52.439> yet<00:01:52.590> if

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
so it's not sure we're not sure yet if

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.920 
so it's not sure we're not sure yet if
it<00:01:52.829> was<00:01:52.979> from<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> iphone<00:01:53.759> glass<00:01:54.149> itself<00:01:54.630> or

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
it was from the iphone glass itself or

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.660 
it was from the iphone glass itself or
from<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.320> beer<00:01:55.710> stein<00:01:55.829> or<00:01:56.280> something<00:01:56.549> but

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
from a beer stein or something but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.550 
from a beer stein or something but
somehow<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.570> were<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:58.110> were<00:01:58.170> able<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
somehow they were they were able to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.350 
somehow they were they were able to
transfer<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> fingerprint<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> piece<00:02:00.329> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
transfer the fingerprint to a piece of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.319 
transfer the fingerprint to a piece of
latex<00:02:00.930> okay<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:01.860> put<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> latex<00:02:02.579> over<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
latex okay and then put the latex over a

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.749 
latex okay and then put the latex over a
second<00:02:03.930> persons<00:02:04.320> fingertip<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.520> rub<00:02:05.729> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
second persons fingertip and then rub it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.089 
second persons fingertip and then rub it
against<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> home<00:02:06.899> sensor<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.710> home<00:02:07.920> button

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
did the fingerprint transfer but clearly

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.630 
did the fingerprint transfer but clearly
it<00:02:18.900> does<00:02:19.080> work<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.860> surprising<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.520> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
it does work is this surprising that it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280 
it does work is this surprising that it
happened<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.060> quickly<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
happened so quickly you know the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.620 
happened so quickly you know the
researchers<00:02:22.950> say<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.790> they<00:02:23.970> were<00:02:24.030> surprised

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
researchers say that they were surprised

researchers say that they were surprised
which<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.680> interesting<00:02:25.800> they<00:02:26.340> thought<00:02:26.610> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
which is interesting they thought that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.100 
which is interesting they thought that
it<00:02:26.850> was<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.180> take<00:02:27.330> longer<00:02:27.630> than<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.990> did

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
it was going to take longer than it did

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.420 
it was going to take longer than it did
to<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:29.280> hack<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.670> sensor<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.720> didn't<00:02:31.430> but

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
to to hack the sensor and it didn't but

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.340 
to to hack the sensor and it didn't but
to<00:02:32.550> take<00:02:32.760> away<00:02:32.970> from<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.240> they<00:02:33.600> said<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.110> is

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
to take away from that they said is is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.410 
to take away from that they said is is
that<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:35.010> know<00:02:35.130> there<00:02:35.310> are<00:02:35.340> always<00:02:35.880> going<00:02:36.240> to

that you know there are always going to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.260 
that you know there are always going to
be<00:02:36.450> ways<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.020> hack<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.590> security<00:02:38.340> protocol<00:02:39.060> no

be ways to hack a security protocol no

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
biometrics but that there are also ways

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.030 
biometrics but that there are also ways
that<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.840> can<00:02:46.020> things<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.709> can<00:02:46.800> do<00:02:46.920> to

that you can things that you can do to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.790 
that you can things that you can do to
take<00:02:47.340> precautions<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:48.060> protect<00:02:48.270> yourself

take precautions to protect yourself

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.260 
take precautions to protect yourself
this<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.130> mean<00:02:50.160> something<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.850> they<00:02:51.000> did

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
this is I mean something that they did

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.449 
this is I mean something that they did
we<00:02:52.080> don't<00:02:52.170> know<00:02:52.410> exactly<00:02:52.560> how<00:02:53.040> they<00:02:53.190> got<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
we don't know exactly how they got the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.940 
we don't know exactly how they got the
original<00:02:54.080> fingerprint<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.290> copy<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.739> it

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
original fingerprint to the copy of it

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.540 
original fingerprint to the copy of it
so<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.970> seems<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:57.540> not<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.200> easy<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:59.250> a

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
so it seems like it's not that easy of a

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.190 
so it seems like it's not that easy of a
hack<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.209> seems<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.110> go

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
hack it seems like you have to go

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.420 
hack it seems like you have to go
through<00:03:01.350> some<00:03:01.500> effort<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> picture<00:03:02.340> of

through some effort to get a picture of
somebody's<00:03:02.790> fingerprinting<00:03:03.450> might<00:03:04.290> be

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
somebody's fingerprinting might be

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.830 
somebody's fingerprinting might be
difficult<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.920> seems<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.850> again

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
difficult it seems it can be again

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.570 
difficult it seems it can be again
unfortunate<00:03:07.380> we<00:03:07.470> don't<00:03:07.650> know<00:03:07.770> precisely<00:03:07.800> how

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
unfortunate we don't know precisely how

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
hack I was able to do this but even from

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.870 
hack I was able to do this but even from

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
able to replicate it and then

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.150
