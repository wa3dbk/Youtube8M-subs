probably<00:04:33.310> be<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.460> two<00:04:33.700> part<00:04:34.000> because<00:04:34.180> my<00:04:34.330> camera

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
probably be a two part because my camera

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.220 
probably be a two part because my camera
can<00:04:34.990> only<00:04:35.080> go<00:04:35.290> up<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.560> like<00:04:35.680> five<00:04:36.070> minutes

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
can only go up to like five minutes

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.500 
can only go up to like five minutes
possibly<00:04:38.230> six<00:04:39.480> if<00:04:40.480> you<00:04:40.540> count<00:04:40.690> rounding<00:04:41.470> up<00:04:41.650> so

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
possibly six if you count rounding up so

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.020 
possibly six if you count rounding up so
all<00:04:43.510> right<00:04:45.150> see<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.240> next<00:04:46.420> time<00:04:46.660> bye
