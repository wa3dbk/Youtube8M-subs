00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
we'll go back to 150 which is a shot

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.870 
we'll go back to 150 which is a shot
that<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:25.020> maybe<00:03:25.380> one<00:03:25.950> out<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.220> every<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.670> don't

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
that that maybe one out of every I don't

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.630 
that that maybe one out of every I don't
know<00:03:27.060> fifty<00:03:27.510> million<00:03:27.690> hundred<00:03:28.110> people<00:03:28.380> off

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
again not really too much of an issue

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.100 
again not really too much of an issue
but<00:03:55.670> you're<00:03:55.879> starting<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.209> have<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.629> little<00:03:56.959> bit

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
but you're starting to have a little bit

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.930 
but you're starting to have a little bit
more<00:03:57.290> trouble<00:03:58.250> I'm<00:03:58.340> guessing<00:03:58.640> sight<00:03:58.819> in<00:03:58.909> that

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
more trouble I'm guessing sight in that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.750 
more trouble I'm guessing sight in that
thing<00:03:59.180> yeah<00:03:59.530> I<00:04:00.530> had<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:00.739> actually<00:04:01.250> aim<00:04:01.400> six

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
thing yeah I had to actually aim six

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.270 
thing yeah I had to actually aim six
feet<00:04:02.180> over<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.750> target<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:03.409> we're<00:04:03.739> gonna<00:04:04.010> have

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
feet over the target so we're gonna have

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.000 
feet over the target so we're gonna have
to<00:04:04.310> probably<00:04:04.610> aim<00:04:05.090> probably<00:04:05.720> 14<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.260> 15<00:04:06.379> feet

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
to probably aim probably 14 to 15 feet

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.640 
to probably aim probably 14 to 15 feet
at<00:04:07.489> 200<00:04:08.000> yards<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.480> pull<00:04:08.659> this<00:04:08.810> shot<00:04:09.079> off<00:04:09.230> if<00:04:09.470> I

at 200 yards to pull this shot off if I

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.470 
at 200 yards to pull this shot off if I
can<00:04:09.890> do<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.610> impossible<00:04:11.000> shot<00:04:11.150> screw

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480
