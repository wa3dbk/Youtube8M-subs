00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:07.609
 hello how are you come to your best channel 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:09.170
 of mixed technology the friend you name 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.700
 it's mario and today we're going to be in 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.809
 applications section but today 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.879
 we want to emphasize that it is 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.919
 two versions available for both 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.660
 the version as it is for android as the 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.340
 version for the app store you can 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.960
 use phone devices like 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.880
 you can use it on the ipad or in a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.980
 tablet that's the advantage of being able 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.530
 download this application besides that 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.910
 is already available you can 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.800
 do it through the companies 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.100
 electronic which is the company that 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.320
 designed can have a little bit of space 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.690
 since the application weighs 1.7 gigas 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.760
 between 110 and 6 megabytes once installed 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.560
 because it 's time to download in what 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.270
 It costs a little bit and also allows you to 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.010
 the powers compete with their friends and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.870
 rival pilots all that is the world 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.660
 of real circuits with powerful cars 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.770
 of what is a porsche an audio up 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.020
 a 2 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.270
 those include realistic effects is very 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.700
 very complete besides that it has a 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.190
 huge quantity a catalog of 46 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.410

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.320

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.790
 Real racing game we can download 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.410
 for mobile devices and also for 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.120
 what are tablets and in both 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.620
 versions that's very good then 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.020
 let's see the application in this case 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.600
 in google play you put it for free and 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.280
 in what is in May is also without 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.990
 no problem if you really 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.119
 graphics look very good without the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.280
 application I also like because 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.720
 also since interacting it is very 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.979
 good very fun you're going to spend a 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.840
 very very good time 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.390
 using this application then we are going to 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.410
 start let's load is the interface 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.899
 with which you are going to start 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.399
 work they will find with ayers to 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.289
 to start interacting a little bit 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.690
 if you want to share with the real world 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.490
 for your local site make sure and about 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.320
 all very much the volume that in this case 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.509
 you are going to handle the brake you are going to move 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.080
 what is your device see move the 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.280
 tires 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.280
 there 's the brake 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.030
 touch the screen for general 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.950
 tried now there's the brake very well 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.110
 be setting up the car because the icon 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.500
 from the top to change the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.070
 let's see 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.070
 very good 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.190
 let's see how we are going to see how 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.190
 is the game we interact a little bit 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.770
 really accelerated the car 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.380
 graphics 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.880
 it is really very retained it is very easy 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.490
 to manage 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.920
 I 'm seeing it in this case should 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.530
 to see the ipad but I'm seeing more the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.820
 screen that I am showing you and the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.820
