hey guys so today I'm going to teach you

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.430 
hey guys so today I'm going to teach you
how<00:00:04.730> to<00:00:04.790> frontside<00:00:05.180> boardslide<00:00:05.510> on<00:00:05.960> a<00:00:05.990> bench

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.960 

so<00:00:09.440> make<00:00:09.590> sure<00:00:09.620> before<00:00:09.769> you<00:00:10.220> go<00:00:10.400> into<00:00:10.550> learning

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:10.970 
so make sure before you go into learning

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.670 
so make sure before you go into learning
frontside<00:00:11.150> boardslide<00:00:11.510> you<00:00:11.990> have<00:00:12.140> Ollie's

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
frontside boardslide you have Ollie's

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.439 
frontside boardslide you have Ollie's
backside<00:00:13.430> 180s<00:00:13.790> down<00:00:14.000> a<00:00:18.939> lot<00:00:19.939> of<00:00:20.060> times<00:00:20.240> it's

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
backside 180s down a lot of times it's

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.210 
backside 180s down a lot of times it's
easiest<00:00:20.839> to<00:00:21.019> learn<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.410> trick<00:00:21.619> to<00:00:21.769> fakie

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
easiest to learn the trick to fakie

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.290 
easiest to learn the trick to fakie
first<00:00:22.579> but<00:00:23.419> not<00:00:23.599> on<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.810> Ledge<00:00:24.199> on<00:00:24.589> a<00:00:24.679> rail<00:00:25.609> it<00:00:26.029> is

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
first but not on a Ledge on a rail it is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.749 
first but not on a Ledge on a rail it is
because<00:00:26.659> you<00:00:26.779> just<00:00:26.990> do<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.039> full<00:00:28.249> backside

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
because you just do the full backside

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.579 
because you just do the full backside
180<00:00:29.029> put<00:00:29.570> your<00:00:29.720> front<00:00:29.960> truck<00:00:30.169> on<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:30.409> other

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
180 put your front truck on the other

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.069 
180 put your front truck on the other
side<00:00:30.890> and<00:00:31.189> then<00:00:31.519> go<00:00:31.669> to<00:00:31.730> fakie<00:00:32.119> but<00:00:32.900> on<00:00:32.989> the

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
side and then go to fakie but on the

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.920 
side and then go to fakie but on the
ledge<00:00:33.290> it's<00:00:33.500> actually<00:00:33.829> easier<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:34.250> straight

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
ledge it's actually easier to straight

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.900 
ledge it's actually easier to straight
cuz<00:00:35.930> then<00:00:36.050> you're<00:00:36.140> going<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:36.289> pull<00:00:36.590> off<00:00:36.920> I'll

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
cuz then you're going to pull off I'll

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:48.479 
cuz then you're going to pull off I'll
show<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.270> just<00:00:42.820> hop<00:00:43.820> in<00:00:44.090> slide<00:00:44.899> pull<00:00:45.859> off<00:00:47.199> so

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
show you just hop in slide pull off so

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.740 
show you just hop in slide pull off so
the<00:00:49.489> first<00:00:49.760> thing<00:00:49.969> about<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.359> frontside

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
the first thing about the frontside

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.150 
the first thing about the frontside
boardslide<00:00:50.989> is<00:00:53.410> you<00:00:54.410> want<00:00:54.589> to<00:00:54.710> approach<00:00:54.920> it

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
boardslide is you want to approach it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.270 
boardslide is you want to approach it
not<00:00:55.309> at<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.519> super<00:00:56.059> like<00:00:56.390> drastic<00:00:57.379> angle<00:00:57.829> but

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
not at a super like drastic angle but

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.970 
not at a super like drastic angle but
kind<00:00:58.609> of<00:00:58.789> straight<00:00:59.149> on<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:03.079> you<00:01:03.469> don't<00:01:03.679> want

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
kind of straight on and you don't want

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.250 
kind of straight on and you don't want
your<00:01:04.250> weight<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:05.120> definitely<00:01:05.750> don't<00:01:05.930> want<00:01:06.170> to

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
your weight you definitely don't want to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.130 
your weight you definitely don't want to
be<00:01:06.320> like<00:01:06.680> too<00:01:07.130> far<00:01:07.400> back<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.750> definitely

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
be like too far back and you definitely

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.499 
be like too far back and you definitely
don't<00:01:09.229> want<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.470> be<00:01:09.560> too<00:01:09.770> far<00:01:10.040> forward<00:01:10.509> you

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
don't want to be too far forward you

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.060 
don't want to be too far forward you
have<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.750> have<00:01:11.900> enough<00:01:12.170> speed<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:12.500> your<00:01:12.829> wheels

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
have to have enough speed so your wheels

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.819 
have to have enough speed so your wheels
are<00:01:13.340> sliding<00:01:13.610> on<00:01:13.820> top<00:01:14.170> but<00:01:15.170> not<00:01:15.350> too<00:01:15.619> much

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
are sliding on top but not too much

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.969 
are sliding on top but not too much
where<00:01:16.759> you're<00:01:16.880> going<00:01:17.000> to<00:01:17.060> slide<00:01:17.450> out<00:01:17.979> face

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
where you're going to slide out face

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.050 
where you're going to slide out face
dive<00:01:19.280> into<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.700> cement<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:21.530> your<00:01:22.220> balance<00:01:22.880> is

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
dive into the cement so your balance is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.789 
dive into the cement so your balance is
crucial<00:01:23.479> on<00:01:23.869> this<00:01:24.079> and<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:24.320> would<00:01:24.470> highly

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
crucial on this and I would highly

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.410 
crucial on this and I would highly
recommend<00:01:24.829> having<00:01:25.369> backside<00:01:25.970> boardslides

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
recommend having backside boardslides

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.109 
recommend having backside boardslides
down<00:01:26.630> first<00:01:26.960> because<00:01:27.920> backside<00:01:28.670> boardslide

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
down first because backside boardslide

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.289 
down first because backside boardslide
you're<00:01:29.329> facing<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.560> direction<00:01:30.740> you're<00:01:31.130> going

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
you're facing the direction you're going

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.969 
you're facing the direction you're going
frontside<00:01:32.299> boardslide<00:01:32.479> you're<00:01:32.899> not<00:01:35.979> so

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
frontside boardslide you're not so

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.590 
frontside boardslide you're not so
that's<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.250> good<00:01:37.399> example<00:01:37.759> of<00:01:38.030> not<00:01:38.299> enough

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
that's a good example of not enough

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.170 
that's a good example of not enough
speed<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.469> not<00:01:39.619> enough<00:01:39.890> force<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.610> my<00:01:40.850> front

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
speed and not enough force in my front

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.649 
speed and not enough force in my front
foot<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:42.259> as<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.439> can<00:01:42.619> see<00:01:42.969> my<00:01:43.969> wheel<00:01:44.210> stopped

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
foot so as you can see my wheel stopped

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.469 
foot so as you can see my wheel stopped
and<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.500> stopped<00:01:45.740> sliding<00:01:46.039> about<00:01:46.460> there<00:01:46.759> and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
and I stopped sliding about there and

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.459 
and I stopped sliding about there and
then<00:01:47.600> popped<00:01:47.899> off<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.310> want<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.579> make<00:01:49.700> sure

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
then popped off so you want to make sure

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.779 
then popped off so you want to make sure
that<00:01:51.469> you're<00:01:51.619> balanced<00:01:52.130> but<00:01:52.399> also<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.700> have

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
that you're balanced but also you have

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.850 
that you're balanced but also you have
enough<00:01:53.119> speed<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.420> keep<00:01:53.840> your<00:01:54.049> motion<00:01:54.320> going

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
enough speed to keep your motion going

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.570 
enough speed to keep your motion going
that<00:01:55.310> means<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.670> have<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.880> go<00:01:56.000> fast<00:01:56.299> enough

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
that means you have to go fast enough

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.200 
that means you have to go fast enough
so<00:01:58.090> again<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.550> to<00:02:00.550> run<00:02:00.730> through<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.000> whole

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
so again just to run through the whole

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.670 
so again just to run through the whole
thing<00:02:01.540> you're<00:02:02.050> going<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.260> approach<00:02:02.470> at<00:02:02.650> a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
thing you're going to approach at a

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.310 
thing you're going to approach at a
slight<00:02:03.070> angle<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:04.300> your<00:02:04.480> feet<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.080> just

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
slight angle with your feet and the just

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.760 
slight angle with your feet and the just
regular<00:02:05.830> ollie<00:02:06.070> backside<00:02:06.790> 180<00:02:07.270> position<00:02:07.770> pop

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
regular ollie backside 180 position pop

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.900 
regular ollie backside 180 position pop
up<00:02:09.390> turn<00:02:10.390> your<00:02:10.630> legs<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:12.310> try<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.670> keep<00:02:12.760> your

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
up turn your legs but try and keep your

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.550 
up turn your legs but try and keep your
head<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.270> shoulders<00:02:13.450> straight<00:02:13.990> because<00:02:14.500> you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
head and shoulders straight because you

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.520 
head and shoulders straight because you
want<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.890> be<00:02:14.950> sliding<00:02:15.220> kind<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:16.530> and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
want to be sliding kind of like that and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.070 
want to be sliding kind of like that and
then<00:02:17.710> get<00:02:18.040> your<00:02:18.220> front<00:02:18.520> wheels<00:02:19.120> onto<00:02:19.930> the

it's not like you're going to do a full
backside<00:04:00.960> 180<00:04:01.640> but<00:04:02.640> it's<00:04:02.760> more<00:04:02.910> like<00:04:03.320> you're

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
backside 180 but it's more like you're

backside 180 but it's more like you're
going<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.530> go<00:04:05.990> so<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.020> lot<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.320> times<00:04:07.650> you're

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
going to go so a lot of times you're

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.900 
going to go so a lot of times you're
sliding<00:04:08.100> kind<00:04:08.520> of<00:04:08.640> in<00:04:09.600> this<00:04:10.020> position<00:04:10.910> your

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
sliding kind of in this position your

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.480 
sliding kind of in this position your
upper<00:04:12.240> body<00:04:12.450> turned<00:04:12.780> like<00:04:12.960> that<00:04:13.490> like

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
upper body turned like that like

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.280 
upper body turned like that like

actually upper body like doesn't turn

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.610 
actually upper body like doesn't turn
but<00:04:16.560> your<00:04:16.680> legs<00:04:16.950> do<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:17.520> you're<00:04:17.670> like<00:04:17.850> this

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
but your legs do so you're like this

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.190 
but your legs do so you're like this
slide<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.950> back<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.720> I'll<00:04:21.810> show<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.020> what
