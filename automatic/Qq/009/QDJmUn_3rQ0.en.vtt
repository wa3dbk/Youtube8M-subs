 We feel very beautiful someone explained to me 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.089
 once in a matter of energy what 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.100
 more important is that one be the first 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.630
 that this gift will buy anything 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.400
 a latin disgust of people whatever but 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.900
 that one is the first to be regale 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.700
 we started talking about these braids 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.560
 well we were good the previous article 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.580
 good is the sporting proposal 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.840
 Adriana Arango 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.670
 this proposal is developed in 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.680
 smart fabrics that they provide 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.690
 greater support they have transport of 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.190
 moisture that have web protection and that 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.530
 obviously they are prepared for 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.940
 a high a high physical resistance and 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.310
 that the woman who can feel very 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.230
 comfortable but mainly as in 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.610
 our main pillar our 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.020
 main characteristic in all 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.330
 doors that we design is that you feel 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.460
 very beautiful that both at the time of making 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.770
 sport as a bedtime as 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.540
 have an ideal garment for this that does not 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.040
 be as you said with any job 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.080
 but with something that you can feel 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.590
 very beautiful and is that definitely to 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.320
 1.001 needs to look good to look feminine 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.820
 but also highlight certain aspects 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.370
 in your body sometimes suddenly one 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.980
 He wants to show off a silhouette very well 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.500
 lathed highlight the legs highlight 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.540
 the torso and that what we see in this type 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.220
 of materials that allow it clear that 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.619
 If this type of materials provide a lot 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.149
 support and shape the figure well 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.500
 then for the woman it's going to be a lot 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.390
 more comfortable you will feel much more 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.770
 safe at the time of using them but it is very 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.050
 important that women at the time of 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.850
 choose a garment both sporting and 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.100
 to sleep 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.230
 be known first and know very well that 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.360
 it will be better or that there is no 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 garments in the type in the case of 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.080
 sports for all activities 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.500
 from there for example a garment like 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.360
 is 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.640
 that we can perfectly use it for 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.080
 walking comes with three pieces then 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 in the gym theme, you can 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.830
 remove the jacket and may be left in a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.350
 top but there are our women who from 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.610
 soon they do not have the slender figure 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.950
 as a model state and can use it 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.600
 with a point a shirt a little more 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.070
 long or for example to use them here in 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.260
 Bogota one has to go out with the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.180
 jacket but half doing the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.980
 heating and exercise because 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.410
 we started playing and we took off the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.060
 jacket and we continue alone with the top and 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.190
 the clear pants that yes there are clothes that 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.540
 they are a little tighter that they are for 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.790
 this kind of activities like for the 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.320
 spinning that obviously in this kind of 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.480
 clothes, it is not easy for the pants 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.670
 wide can entangle the mechanisms 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.050
 but in a pair of levis trousers or in terms of 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.430
 the tight ones because this is not going to 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.280
 spend then very good that the woman 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.810
 know what practical activities and how 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.220
 wants to feel so that according to that 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.750
 that we can provide all the advice 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.750
 find an ideal garment for it 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.180
 class 2 to go to bed clear yes 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.290
 It's very important how I told you that 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.939
 the time to go to bed as well 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.859
 we are thinking not only about seeing each other 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.030
 very comfortable I understand you very comfortable that 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.219
 It is obviously what we are looking for 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.019
 that hour but we can also have 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.579
 the garment that makes us feel very beautiful 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.680
 Our garments are designed from 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.389
 materials that are very fresh or 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.250
 light or light as I say 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.049
 they transport moisture because in the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.969
 night is where the skin regenerates 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.590
 and we are like recharging all the 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:52.359
 energies to be able to get up to date 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.579
 next with all the attitude then 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.349
 the fabrics with the developed things 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.120
 his personal clothes for that but 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.400
 also in the silhouettes and in the details 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.599
 like lace and ribbons for us 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.579
 are providing this theme of 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.870
 femininity and this detail theme for 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.939
 that the woman can feel very nice 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.680
 and I love that always the clothes of 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.180
 sleep all the pyramids that have 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.040
 you always come with your part 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.889
 then one can use them with the 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.560
 who calls or can integrate it into his clothes 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.479
 inside and it's also very good to see 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.660
 then to the last model so that 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.750
 let's talk about 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.820
 trends especially this proposal 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.410

 they love it because adriana arango has a 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.390
 very important feature also and 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.910
 is that pajamas are not so pajamas 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.530

 It is an ideal garment, so it is 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.820
