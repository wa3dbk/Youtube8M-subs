I actually just remembered this recipe

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.740 
I actually just remembered this recipe
not<00:02:34.470> not<00:02:34.740> too<00:02:34.920> long<00:02:35.070> ago<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:36.209> made<00:02:36.420> me<00:02:36.450> laugh

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
not not too long ago so it made me laugh

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.360 
not not too long ago so it made me laugh
when<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:37.020> made<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.350> for<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.530> first<00:02:37.590> time<00:02:38.040> again

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
when I made it for the first time again

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.470 
when I made it for the first time again
and<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.790> tasted<00:02:39.570> exactly<00:02:39.690> as<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.320> remembered<00:02:40.770> it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
sometimes you got to get rough with it

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.160 
sometimes you got to get rough with it
so<00:02:55.879> it<00:02:55.939> listens<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.719> know<00:02:58.989> there<00:02:59.989> we
