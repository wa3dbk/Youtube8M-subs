00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
this is something that a lot of
competitors<00:01:54.090> don't<00:01:54.750> understand<00:01:55.229> they're<00:01:55.409> out

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
competitors don't understand they're out

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.590 
competitors don't understand they're out
on<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.799> floor<00:01:56.040> say<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:57.000> three<00:01:57.299> songs

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
on the floor say they get three songs

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.350 
on the floor say they get three songs
that<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.829> dance<00:01:58.979> -<00:01:59.399> okay<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.969> it's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that they get to dance - okay so it's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.670 
that they get to dance - okay so it's
two<00:02:00.540> minutes<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.899> song<00:02:01.049> they're<00:02:01.259> looking<00:02:01.560> at

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
two minutes of song they're looking at

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.530 
two minutes of song they're looking at
six<00:02:01.979> minutes<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.490> dancing<00:02:02.700> out<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> floor
