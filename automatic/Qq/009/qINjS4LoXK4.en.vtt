00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they maybe initially thought was

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.170 
they maybe initially thought was
possible

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
possible

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.060 
possible
I<00:00:55.309> kind<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.340> think<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.640> myself<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.559> like<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
I kind of think of myself as a like a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.599 
I kind of think of myself as a like a
bit<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.520> chef<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.190> you're<00:01:02.399> if

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
bit of a chef and you know if you're if

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.670 
bit of a chef and you know if you're if
you're<00:01:02.640> working<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.239> canned<00:01:03.989> vegetables

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you're working with canned vegetables

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.250 
you're working with canned vegetables
the<00:01:05.430> soup<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> only<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.600> good<00:01:06.869> as

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the soup is only going to be so good as

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.600 
the soup is only going to be so good as
opposed<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> working<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.130> fresh<00:01:08.340> produce

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
opposed to working with fresh produce

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.880 
opposed to working with fresh produce
and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.840> think<00:01:10.080> there's<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> lot<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.680> fresh

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and I think there's a lot of fresh

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
and I think there's a lot of fresh
produce<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.360> they're

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
produce here and so you know they're

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
produce here and so you know they're
kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> an<00:01:12.990> inspiring<00:01:13.409> Bunch<00:01:13.830> toward<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
kind of an inspiring Bunch toward to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:26.510 
kind of an inspiring Bunch toward to
work<00:01:14.880> with

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.910

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
we have kind of a young team and it's
it's<00:01:29.580> kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:29.850> brand-new<00:01:30.299> lineup<00:01:30.840> from<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it's kind of a brand-new lineup from the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.570 
it's kind of a brand-new lineup from the
