 one class 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.150
 matter extremely 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.189
 and everyone else existed 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.489
 the palm trees 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.589
 showed that tv has 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:30.939
 to the file 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.140
 she belonged to a society 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.420
 has 60 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.680
 a little that turns upside down 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.680
 between 13Âºc the young 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.889
 as protagonist has stated that there was no intelligent young 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:50.239
 had not already been bringing 50 days child and adult 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.760
 procedures entered 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.690
 revolutionized miniskirt fashion 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.690
 and the introduction 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.090
 and therefore a division of behavior 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.149
 fashion come to express is not going to take possession 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.320
 but two opinions or you are 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.200
 progressive or you were conservative 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.870
 in the world also divided in that time all this time that I was type 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.360
 you have to be done 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.670
 or a lawsuit will be filed against the singer 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.260
 then from the 60's the marking ap 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
 be representing two opinions 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.890
 with globalization around here 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.590
 Martifer this again 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.260
 fell to the ground and in style came to represent the urban tribes 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.510
 to fashion your 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.050
 has multiplied fragmented that the world was divided into tribes company 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.840
 is no longer 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.920
 one class 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 is no longer two positions 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.770
 multiples that manifest from the 90s 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.230
 from 2 thousand onwards 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.730
 she tells herself she commented even more and today the note 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.810
 we tranquil shows 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.679
 individuality 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.559
 fashion stayed for much longer ago 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:14.879
 it will be much harder 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.069
 interestingly is to attract these individualities or if it rebuilds a little 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.949
 this route 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.140
 Why you want is the way the piece 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.090
 she expresses herself and cds for being a little knows that everything 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:28.989
 of which the editorial opinion 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.169
 lady kate pretension 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.899
 social and economic is this person 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.899
 to cease heaven 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.599
 man was so bad and 2006 this year 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:44.120
 So 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.279
 attached 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.070
 fashion issues 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.129
 about women 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.559
 harris until the 18th century 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.980
 in the 18th century after the industrial revolution 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.370
 and as wars of religion the austerity and the work is what happened to 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.949
 to be 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.380
 I operated the senator 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.350
 why men did not work men of the class only ceal 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.509
 is high not working 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.109
 there are some of these black-clad premises they used 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.410
 the black fist was to show that he 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.269
 it was not a scam 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.489
 between them 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.539
 after the robbery and I do not speak Protestant 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.399
 troops in afghanistan 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:30.719
 This step saw the work and the men came to be evaluated and 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:35.119
 no longer for what exists a little before but for what it produced 1 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.059
 and they then started to use 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.579
 a good position in which it opens 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.639
 which is a practically closed suit in a black suit 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.979
 who knows the thing is serious young concussion with the introduction of the speck that the 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:47.959
 region 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.160
 and now 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.090
 with this opening acrivale assistance of the individuality that he 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:55.609
 would be used to give 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.109
 is dead 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.539
 a way of expressing 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.329
 if in fact I have wanted to leave because it has been done 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.949
 and small value 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.849
 the intel the source in the feminine 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.129
 and recalls a major imminent risk of death 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.879
 the whole world kind 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.109
 altri and 14 in france 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.530
 what draws me to try to avoid it was fashion was men could be 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.660
 made this year 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.610
 very little space 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.979
 ansa the record 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.220
 the only thing he ever used to model as an instrument of distracting power 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.969
 of the power it held then 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.360
 ah 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.439
 God would not suffer a lawsuit was because God does not know us 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:41.580
 among other things it is very interesting that today 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.940
 the name of it is the most popular fact in the world is warming the audience 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.770
 the red room that created controversy was so 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.259
 representing each presentation about the future of the house will allow 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.340
 the gross interest 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.020
 but not everyone copies is different from now until I have already chosen a more 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.020
 difficult because things are not as 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.760
 are evident as to the differences of interpretation that one has in fashion 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.759
 feminine 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.050
 this phenomenon that brands have discovered that once it has scored 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.849
 on the date of the fact of staying that is on Wednesday 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.020
 ethics 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.639
 and despite actual lectures 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.389
 however does not always have government measures and law 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.180
 I preferred to get fame with normal people. 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.300
 and met the people who want to look like the one who is precarious 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
 there must be a lot of people to move and went to california 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:41.629
 in the representation 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.159
 85 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:46.389
 should have a show house 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.560
 o could carry so much frequency 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.360
 I do not know 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.360
 security in the creation and institution 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.840
 a little more free determination that she grows 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:06.669
 of this amount of transition has been tested, I know that the following training 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.659
 and offer 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.339
 It works, but what you want 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.209
 and the feeling that the bank has no information 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:16.719
 information 6 a team 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.409
 You have to give a lot of freedom. 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.419
 is once again a source of information 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.639
 I think over time the reaction 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.240
 Amazing 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.580
 source of exchange is a social rating and the recall any other 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.039
 you have to know 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.400
 What you want to know? 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.469
 Whom do you want to know? 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.939
 You are in order to strengthen 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:43.270
 what is a trend that is certain certain things know a 

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:43.930
 branch 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.220
 which is based on an industry research survey that tried 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.090
 also that my mind gives you a read on the professionals represent a 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.360
 read on girls 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.520
 and therefore you will know which of them I have the most valid opinions or which 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.369
 you go from Socrates information 

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.180
 the petrobras 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.879
 It is not true that I can have buses or 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.889
 the apathy of the attack if someone saw 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.139
 she likes that someone else 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:14.160
 however several competitors 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.820
 superficial team
