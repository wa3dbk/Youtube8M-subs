00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.200
 you came out of this I will not achieve until the 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.170
 rector and good that it feels that in this 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.070
 moment you think 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.070
 super happy the pressure the great person 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.350
 total 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.040
 so many rum is a law of breaking record and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.900
 I what I know what he does because what 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.880
 does after so many years we give the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.950
 opportunity and breaks the network to which 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.960
 you felt at that moment when the ball 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.129
 happened when when you're traveling the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.100
 bases that I already knew was a fact 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.379
 they remain in threes in three in base for 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.210
 put the team league after dominating 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.280
 from a port the cross that I felt alex 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
 Cabrera what happened in his memory 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.540
 when I went through each of the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.949
 pads when when I was walking 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.479
 when there were the three men 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.479
 they separated to run in third 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.630
 and from when I looked for service it was like 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.360
 if as I say that the same God gave me 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.460
 the strength to think and I said now if I 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.140
 they are going to throw the radio and left them with 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.970
 the fate of the boarding when I lead the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.520
 hit there is a moment that did not go out to 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.820
 run at home when I was running 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.020
 it was like 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.050
 units as I say and it seemed like a 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.970
 with the hoist because it became a reality 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.640
 commented that one believes it and does not believe it 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.190
 because it harasses us as they always expected 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.320
 and after so many years so many years 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.380
 they expect these great happiness 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.630
 I think you have to enjoy it as if 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.300
 nor celebrate the milk that are seconds 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.880
 when you saw in the air of the clinic 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.790
 yes because that moment when it is already like 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.160
 61 think and put your head right in 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.660
 concentration to see the ball where it is 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.000
 he never starts dreaming has always been 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.060
 heavy of park and when he hit the ball 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.849
 it was like 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.849
 it was like church at last 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.860
 without giving homer that passed between 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.040
 20 and 21 there was anxiety 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.750
 even when the door slam I think it 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.760
 breaks the perfect record of something round 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.250
 all the pitching and building when I 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.140
 do not lose concentration so in 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.209
 every pitcher that he inherited because it's 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.400
 easier to hit the ball than the ball 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.340
 come out and that's what I started that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.560
 arrive is practice and present to give 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.290
 to the ball where the thing is only álex 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.060
 always in your line will not mention ramón 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.280
 when Intel once it locates yourself 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.540
 once again vic has made a roll already 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.069
 you had the opportunity to talk to him 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.069
 those first words father 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.990
 as the first turn of the first turn 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.630
 that was agreed until like all night 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.640
 and I went to bed and the environment 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.560
 quiet 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.880
 I believe that with this my family and my 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.700
 husband I think work is a hundred 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.160
 fourth half side as if one takes 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.950
 Special in between before you have left 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.050
 much that has to that I promised I launched 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.180
 for me you are you and you are achieving it 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.220
 help because they call me from gogol and play 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.600
 work in one place but it makes me 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.690
 I think he did everything but for the good 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.370
 with the desire that I had and for not 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.110
 withdraw more name you can tell if I 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.450
 I was retiring it's a bit frustrating to 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.400
 he not only ends with a record but 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.980
 with a myth like myth 2 and say it and 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.110
 take it out under a grand slam or sometime 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.940
 when will always 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.090
 finally men with once per 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.090
 in front of 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.500
 in the maximum expression of strength a 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.620
 rosemary that we have as the coronation 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.750
 of your career if you knew that talking 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.689
 I always thought about doing the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.159
 document with 32 votes said that I what 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:14.150
 I'm going to break up because I had the strength and the 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.829
 experience but as I said the first 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.989
 I had them when he told me then I think 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.250
 that things were another song because 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.729
 he said that not that people said that 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.680
 so much round but I think it became 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.940
 I believe that God gave me the happiness of 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.940
 have an amazing 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.039
 when actually 20 but 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.370
 break the rock 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.370
 for me that 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.090
 later with 20 I felt that they were 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.979
 throwing hard they were throwing 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.050
 to see if he could connect the ball 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:54.529
 or that they are dodging you if you knew 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.389
 that is already 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:59.179
 the classification and they are puncturing me 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.769
 super super super difficult 90 and me with the 

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:02.629
 What they did like that they do to everyone because 

00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:03.979
 is more anxious than pitching and if 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.749
 they see that I am throwing all 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.789
 the young people all help to never follow 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.839
 they are going to have to bring but be part of the 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.789
 I think that anxiety is part of the game 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:13.609
 part of the win roscón re shares that 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.109
 history and god lost the bliss of 

00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:17.239
 break with the story of breaking up then 

00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:19.249
 myth as they gave so and the days 

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:20.779
 now more a myth of the cabreras and 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:24.259
 come on, I think the main thing 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:27.669
 now and the other stage classify and 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.669
 help the team take the championship 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:33.349
 he has to be super proud to win 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.299
 the ball the medium that was a pride 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.649
 so that the fanatic fan of 

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:38.539
 the guaira every Sunday he came 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:40.849
 and he would stand in the same place with his 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.609
 family and it's like a super conscience 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.319
 great of it from morro and lagarde 

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:46.759
 I feel super happy I did not hurt the 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.909
 ball I think it's something historical 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:52.219
 for me one thing that I always remember in 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:56.179
 my house the things value and if mommy my 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.689
 person because they left the bat 21 

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:59.559
 endurance 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.559
 I think it is 

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:05.209
 the clearer mind there is no objective 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:08.089
 Now what comes is the triple crown 

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:09.349
 only goal scorer who could win 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:11.179
 that prize 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:14.689
 tell us how you see it now that you've 

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:17.539
 four games penalty for sharks already a 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:21.090
 the doors of this award without the 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:23.850
 books is another super super thing that is 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.230
 nobody expected me to do it but I did not 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.630
 it's like you saying that things are 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.980
 put in a year all the things that I 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.540
 is happening is happening to me like 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.080
 serious even if you saw that he noticed taking care of 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.430
 retire as if as is like god I 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.560
 it's just can not be retired 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.180
 he had to give he has not put anything else and 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.580
 super happy with the season having 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.500
 I hope God wants to give me the happiness of 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.800
 have everything that is the best of a 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.800
 year 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:07:00.960
 that if it came close tied or passed 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.100
 Ivan and although he thought they had more to 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.940
 continue in the lincoln that means 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.940
 that encouraged to follow 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:13.880
 if I was sure I was doing 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.880
 remove is removed with the cover 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:21.050
 and I know what he's going to do and I know how much 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.260
 take some time I can do it 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:28.680
 with skills to continue with 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.150
 routes and that's why it's also scary with 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.290
 the skills and god is putting me 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.290
 skills to follow
