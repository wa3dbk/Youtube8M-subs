00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.620
 welcome all viewers and subscribers 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.720
 channel comix zone 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.400
 I always liked when 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.590
 comics interestingly use the theme 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.300
 time movements therefore this 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.050
 time i will tell you about the limit series 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.050
 publishing houses 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.869
 image comeback by authorship bresson food 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.270
 and michael welsh a with a break of 1 year 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.760
 the image came out 2 limit series closely 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.770
 associated with this phenomenon if red wings 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.510
 I did not like after that 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.340
 as I read it, I thought about 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.720
 to make a petition asking 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.520
 ban hitman 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.040
 use expanding substances 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.170
 consciousness but today is not about him comeback 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.730
 is a great example of how 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.710
 You can write a good story about 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.210
 time travel without being 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.740
 cause the reader to be cognitive 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.460
 dissonance when he tries behind it all 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.560
 keep track 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.990
 the plot is about agents with these and 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.360
 stamps that work for the organization 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.730
 compounds and they are engaged in the fact that 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.130
 comes back in time and saves 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.049
 people for a fee of course 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.579
 how could you guess such a view 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.500
 activity is considered not entirely 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.840
 legal but more precisely illegal 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.280
 using machines to move here 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.230
 equated to terrorism 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.180
 it is therefore no wonder that the organization 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.070
 begins to observe wbr with this 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.170
 actually begins the main problems 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.480
 heroes talk about the plot more I 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.240
 I do not see much point in view of the fact that 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.280
 get to know this person better than all but 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.890
 talk about the pros and cons of this series 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.200
 I think it is worth the unambiguous advantage of the series 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.780
 is that the scene is chosen 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.940
 near future which is practically not 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.650
 different from our time so with 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.390
 this whole stream of information is easier 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.100
 because the reader does not understand 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.500
 throw out a lot of terms 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.120
 and the laws of the newly invented universe 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.250
 but I think some may not 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.409
 like the fact that the story is completely 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.180
 does not fit with the classic rules and 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.100
 ideas about traveling in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.530
 time that is you can forget about 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.060
 that if you crush a butterfly in the past 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.520
 in the future we can expect some 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.049
 serious consequences even salvation 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.390
 human life is not so much here 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.030
 affects the future and does not disturb the balance 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.159
 yes it is certainly a controversial idea but if not 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.200
 find fault with this and just take one 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.239
 the fact that in the universe of this comic is all 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.400
 it works that way 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.200
 reading you will definitely get well worth it 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.270
 note that a great storytelling pace 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.230
 does not get confused among all these 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.150
 displacements 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.459
 and unlike other works on 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.500
 It â€™s pretty similar here. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.069
 follow all this and now a little about 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.349
 cons 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.720
 they are all the same here let them not 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.940
 a lot and the main disadvantage for me was 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.459
 drawing it looks too simple and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.989
 even careless sometimes creates a feeling 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.629
 that all these flaws are not part 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.489
 style of the artist is due only to the fact that 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.349
 he was too lazy to draw it all 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.540
 the picture is definitely not so bad 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.760
 to scare away the reader but here's a little 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.860
 spoil the impression he can but I 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.540
 I think that even if you are very meticulous to 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.579
 picture then try to read this 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.470
 The series are also worth noting that 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.049
 the characters here are not the most 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.910
 outstanding but considering the fact that 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.220
 the creators had no purpose to make them 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.680
 As such, you can close your eyes to this. 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.230
 let's sum up the series is not without 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.810
 disadvantages but against the background of its advantages, they 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.099
 look not so critical so if you 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.620
 ready to accept such a concept 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.690
 move in time and come to terms with 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.790
 pretty average drawing something to go through 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.920
 by this comic can not be accurately and on 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.319
 This is my all subscribe to the channel 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.090
 put likes write in the comments where 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.579
 in your opinion the best were 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.209
 represented moving in time and to 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.209
 new meetings
