second<00:04:37.240> part<00:04:37.479> of<00:04:37.600> this<00:04:37.780> lesson<00:04:38.050> is<00:04:38.350> wiring<00:04:38.710> in

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
second part of this lesson is wiring in

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.560 
second part of this lesson is wiring in
a<00:04:38.860> teacher<00:04:39.100> which<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.520> really<00:04:39.850> important<00:04:40.360> and

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
a teacher which is really important and

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.350 
a teacher which is really important and
thus<00:04:40.780> how<00:04:41.199> to<00:04:41.259> use<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.800> plectrum<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:43.060> get<00:04:43.240> the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
thus how to use the plectrum to get the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.270 
thus how to use the plectrum to get the
most<00:04:43.539> speed<00:04:43.960> out<00:04:44.199> of<00:04:44.289> your<00:04:44.410> playing<00:04:44.620> so

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
most speed out of your playing so

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.189 
most speed out of your playing so
normally<00:04:45.880> when<00:04:46.060> people<00:04:46.449> learn<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.630> play<00:04:46.990> they

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
normally when people learn to play they

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.960 
normally when people learn to play they
start<00:04:47.530> by<00:04:47.680> just<00:04:47.860> plucking<00:04:48.130> downwards<00:04:48.729> but

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
start by just plucking downwards but

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.210 
start by just plucking downwards but
what<00:04:49.389> I'm<00:04:49.479> gonna<00:04:49.599> ask<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.199> do<00:04:50.410> and<00:04:50.860> this<00:04:51.009> is

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
what I'm gonna ask you to do and this is

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.670 
what I'm gonna ask you to do and this is
the<00:04:51.340> key<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.940> speed<00:04:52.300> when<00:04:53.050> combined<00:04:53.560> with

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
the key to speed when combined with

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.230 
the key to speed when combined with
hammers<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.310> pull-offs<00:04:54.669> it'll<00:04:55.000> all<00:04:55.120> become

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
hammers and pull-offs it'll all become

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.439 
hammers and pull-offs it'll all become
clear<00:04:55.449> shortly<00:04:56.139> I<00:04:56.919> want<00:04:57.370> you<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.639> pluck<00:04:58.090> bang

doing is to go all the way through the

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.010 
doing is to go all the way through the
scale<00:05:05.860> plucking<00:05:06.340> down<00:05:06.580> then<00:05:07.120> up<00:05:07.150> on<00:05:07.539> each<00:05:07.690> note

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
scale plucking down then up on each note

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:25.710 
scale plucking down then up on each note
like<00:05:08.380> this

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.480

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
practice that and of course you'll go

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:31.480 
practice that and of course you'll go
all<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.560> way<00:05:30.650> down<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:31.130> all<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:31.280> way<00:05:31.400> back

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
all the way down and all the way back

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.240 
all the way down and all the way back
again<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.240> learn<00:05:32.900> to<00:05:33.139> put<00:05:33.349> down<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.860> up<00:05:33.979> is

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
again and learn to put down and up is

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.670 
again and learn to put down and up is
the<00:05:34.490> key<00:05:34.699> to<00:05:34.970> speed<00:05:35.300> because<00:05:35.990> when<00:05:36.199> you<00:05:36.349> watch

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
the key to speed because when you watch

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.189 
the key to speed because when you watch
me<00:05:36.979> you<00:05:37.250> know<00:05:37.430> play<00:05:37.789> you<00:05:38.690> know<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.840> bit<00:05:39.050> of<00:05:39.080> a

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
me you know play you know a bit of a

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.409 
me you know play you know a bit of a
solo<00:05:39.650> if<00:05:40.069> you<00:05:40.220> watch<00:05:40.400> my<00:05:40.639> right<00:05:40.880> hand<00:05:41.210> and

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
solo if you watch my right hand and

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.420 
solo if you watch my right hand and
you'll<00:05:41.509> see<00:05:41.750> my<00:05:41.930> plectrum<00:05:42.530> it's<00:05:42.919> not<00:05:43.160> just

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
you'll see my plectrum it's not just

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:55.470 
you'll see my plectrum it's not just
going<00:05:43.610> down<00:05:43.880> he's<00:05:44.030> going<00:05:44.210> down<00:05:44.330> hand<00:05:44.960> up

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.360 

okay<00:05:56.480> I<00:05:56.510> think<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:56.960> understand<00:05:57.560> because<00:05:58.040> that

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
okay I think you understand because that

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.220 
okay I think you understand because that
effectively<00:05:59.000> allows<00:05:59.360> you<00:05:59.540> to<00:05:59.630> play<00:05:59.750> twice<00:06:00.020> as

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
effectively allows you to play twice as

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.740 
effectively allows you to play twice as
quickly<00:06:00.500> as<00:06:00.920> if<00:06:01.220> you<00:06:01.430> as<00:06:01.910> opposed<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.510> if<00:06:02.630> you

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
quickly as if you as opposed to if you

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.420 
quickly as if you as opposed to if you
were<00:06:02.870> just<00:06:03.050> plucking<00:06:03.350> down<00:06:03.620> words<00:06:03.860> I<00:06:04.070> hope

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
were just plucking down words I hope

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.490 
were just plucking down words I hope
that<00:06:04.580> makes<00:06:04.760> sense<00:06:05.090> so<00:06:05.690> there<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.110> go<00:06:06.260> that's

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
that makes sense so there you go that's

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.870 
that makes sense so there you go that's
what<00:06:06.680> I<00:06:06.800> want<00:06:07.010> you<00:06:07.070> to<00:06:07.160> practice<00:06:07.340> the<00:06:07.730> day

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
what I want you to practice the day

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.670 
what I want you to practice the day
you've<00:06:08.180> now<00:06:08.360> got<00:06:08.600> the<00:06:08.750> minor<00:06:08.960> scale<00:06:09.230> to

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
you've now got the minor scale to

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.160 
you've now got the minor scale to
practice<00:06:10.160> and<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:11.030> down-up<00:06:11.510> technique<00:06:11.990> with

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
practice and the down-up technique with

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.880 
practice and the down-up technique with
the<00:06:12.260> plectrum

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
the plectrum

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.530 
the plectrum
and<00:06:13.160> once<00:06:13.370> you've<00:06:13.550> got<00:06:13.730> used<00:06:13.970> to<00:06:14.090> plucking

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
and once you've got used to plucking

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.450 
and once you've got used to plucking
down<00:06:14.720> upon<00:06:15.080> each<00:06:15.200> know<00:06:15.470> what<00:06:15.710> you<00:06:15.800> can<00:06:15.980> do<00:06:16.190> is

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
down upon each know what you can do is

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.810 
down upon each know what you can do is
pluck<00:06:16.910> down<00:06:17.690> on<00:06:17.900> one<00:06:18.110> note<00:06:18.350> and<00:06:19.250> then<00:06:19.490> up<00:06:19.610> on

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
pluck down on one note and then up on

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.270 
pluck down on one note and then up on
the<00:06:19.940> next<00:06:20.420> and<00:06:21.200> then<00:06:21.290> down<00:06:21.530> on<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:21.830> next<00:06:22.100> note

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
the next and then down on the next note

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.700 
the next and then down on the next note
and<00:06:23.000> then<00:06:23.150> up<00:06:23.300> on<00:06:23.510> the<00:06:23.630> neck<00:06:23.810> all<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.590> way

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
and then up on the neck all the way

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.230 
and then up on the neck all the way
through<00:06:24.950> the<00:06:25.070> scale<00:06:25.310> so<00:06:25.730> you're<00:06:25.940> plucking

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
through the scale so you're plucking

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.880 
through the scale so you're plucking
each<00:06:26.360> note<00:06:26.660> once<00:06:26.960> but<00:06:27.350> you're<00:06:27.500> doing<00:06:27.740> them

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
each note once but you're doing them

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.250 
each note once but you're doing them
alternately<00:06:28.670> down<00:06:29.030> and<00:06:29.270> up<00:06:29.420> I<00:06:29.630> hope<00:06:30.080> that

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
alternately down and up I hope that

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.440 
alternately down and up I hope that
makes<00:06:30.440> sense<00:06:30.620> I'm<00:06:30.950> sure<00:06:31.160> it<00:06:31.340> does<00:06:31.550> okay<00:06:32.390> so

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
makes sense I'm sure it does okay so

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.660 
makes sense I'm sure it does okay so
that's<00:06:32.990> enough<00:06:33.230> of<00:06:33.380> me<00:06:33.530> talking<00:06:33.770> now<00:06:34.160> I<00:06:34.400> think

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
that's enough of me talking now I think

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.100 
that's enough of me talking now I think
it's<00:06:34.940> time<00:06:35.060> for<00:06:35.240> you<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.390> go<00:06:35.540> and<00:06:35.720> get<00:06:35.840> on<00:06:35.960> with
