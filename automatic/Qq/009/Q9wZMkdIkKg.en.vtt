 I will give them a name forever 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.200
 11 years to realize it 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.160
 filmed across 14 countries 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.820
 with more than 9 hours of testimonials 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.220
 a memorable memory of the greatest horror of modern times 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.460
 the greatest documentary ever made on contemporary history. By far the most brilliant film I've seen on the Holocaust 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.460
 I never imagined such a combination of beauty and horror a masterpiece 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.020
 I did not want to make a simple story, I wanted to build something much stronger than that.
