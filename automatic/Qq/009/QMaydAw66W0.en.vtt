00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
nine territory phone is a good idea

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.860 
nine territory phone is a good idea

on a 50 caliber machine gun so it's

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.440 
on a 50 caliber machine gun so it's
rather<00:03:55.750> important<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.470> keep<00:03:56.650> in<00:03:56.739> mind<00:03:56.800> with<00:03:57.280> it

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
rather important to keep in mind with it

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.900 
rather important to keep in mind with it
but<00:04:00.450> beyond<00:04:00.810> that<00:04:00.990> knows<00:04:01.320> nothing<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.730> it

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
occasionally because again it can knock

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.980 
occasionally because again it can knock
down<00:04:35.160> lighter<00:04:35.550> vehicles<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.060> can<00:04:36.150> also<00:04:36.300> lock

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
down lighter vehicles and can also lock
