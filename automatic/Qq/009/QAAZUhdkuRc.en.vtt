00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 entering the auditorium guarasci for a 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.710
 moment you think time is 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.110
 stopped faces of the cosenza of the past yes 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.059
 mix with those of the protagonists of 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.639
 leagues that memory remembers with 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.070
 more ease and then you also come across 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.020
 those characters that you have heard so much 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.119
 talk and barely recognizes 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 because they have dressed the glorious jersey 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.210
 rossoblÃ¹ when it was not yet born as 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.460
 for example loris de carolis returned to the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.800
 flips a few months ago because its goal 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.989
 marked against the chieti we see in 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.290
 a photo of the time sanctioned the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.329
 victory in 1973 at San Vito on 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.550
 we have done a great job in Abruzzo 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.829
 championship 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.440
 played in tandem with another great 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.579
 calling player who called us 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.360
 unfortunately we lost in two and we did 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.579
 30 goals and I must say he was one of the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.470
 my best leagues I've done in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.140
 all the years I've played 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.180
 jokes are remembered for soccer 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.340
 past years and the anecdotes of those 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.230
 shore seasons at the crates waiting for the 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.870
 grand gala organized by the bfu 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.000
 direct beginnings and the memory also goes to 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.730
 who unfortunately is no longer there today 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.760
 we had a big warehouse worker who 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.610
 it is tomino jazzolino that for me 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.100
 he was a father, not only a father 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.080
 minimum but also of all of all 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.050
 athletes who passed under his 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.750
 hands and then arming by arming lace 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.450
 when I heard that the shivers are coming 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.240
 a colleague so young that he loses 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.729
 life alberto urbano cosenza has dressed 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.580
 different roles but what he remembers as 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.890
 more nostalgia and that of a midfielder 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.700
 but many beautiful and many beautiful la 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.160
 promoting the good moments of the series b 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.590
 I would say fantastic moments the past yes 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.509
 mix with the present and ciccio marino 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.750
 could only be among the protagonists 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.000
 of yesterday and today with the incursion of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.780
 tramezzani while answering to ours 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.990
 questions 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.800
 I lived eleven years as a soccer player 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.910
 many 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.950
 Marian history and many others from 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.950
 manager states beautiful years 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.890
 when we played 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.080
 thrilling show sauces like that 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.390
 that I saw yesterday at the stadium now on 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.069
 this I have no doubt and therefore it is right 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.240
 celebrate these 100 years 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.090
 cosenza 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.860
 hoping that in the future he can still 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.080
 go ahead an anecdote there 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.150
 also tell the presidents who in 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.610
 different years have sat on 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.710
 club's highest armchair when the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.880
 promotion in series b that 's the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.250
 a fundamental reminder that it is truly one 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.040
 party for the whole city 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.780
 more beautiful memory can not be that the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.240
 first championship win when 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.180
 we reported the cosenza in pro league 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.970
 this is an indelible memory 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.340
 especially the public frame 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.980
 game with the bacoli that can be said that 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.830
 I definitely saw yesterday June 26th 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.450
 of the year and the Pescara play-off 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.880
 with the Salerno is a day 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.980
 unforgettable because we see them 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.690
 saved the management naval cost but 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.030
 it was a day of sport and one 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.680
 emotional intensity that still that still 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.200
 now I remember with pleasure if later 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.060
 closing a joke with the mattatore 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.820
 of the evening than with its Belgian 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.830
 cheered the audience the many fans that 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.660
 with their presence they gave a 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.870
 contribution in favor of the association 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.330
 the land of piero the eyes confesses to us 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.550
 who came to cosenza to know the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.550
 his myth as always and oberdan biagioni 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.430
 that I really hope there is because for 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.260
 me was really a little player 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.170
 known but one of the true champions 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.880
 of Italian football and therefore I am 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.970
 especially came to meet him 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.490
 unfortunately biagioni was not in the audience but 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.410
 reached by telephone he wanted 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.410
 greet the fans who acclaimed him 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.200
