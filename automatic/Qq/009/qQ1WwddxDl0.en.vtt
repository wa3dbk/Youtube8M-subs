one<00:03:25.830> gets<00:03:26.070> kind<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.520> dark<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.330> be<00:03:27.480> honest<00:03:27.840> this

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
one gets kind of dark to be honest this

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.390 
one gets kind of dark to be honest this
one<00:03:28.260> gets<00:03:28.500> pretty<00:03:28.830> dark<00:03:29.160> at<00:03:29.459> points<00:03:30.030> um<00:03:31.100> but<00:03:32.100> I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
one gets pretty dark at points um but I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.880 
one gets pretty dark at points um but I
think<00:03:32.700> that's<00:03:33.209> why<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.959> many<00:03:34.110> people<00:03:34.260> like<00:03:34.650> it

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
think that's why so many people like it

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.620 
think that's why so many people like it
because<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.310> does<00:03:35.550> take<00:03:35.850> some<00:03:36.209> more<00:03:36.360> risks<00:03:36.420> on

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
because it does take some more risks on

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.140 
because it does take some more risks on
so<00:03:39.630> hands<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.560> fighting<00:03:41.040> hands<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:41.790> fighting

that<00:05:04.260> apparently<00:05:05.310> he<00:05:06.310> was<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.730> one<00:05:06.940> who

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
that apparently he was the one who

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
and friends um so that means this is

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.060 
and friends um so that means this is
another<00:05:21.810> self-fulfilling<00:05:22.810> prophecy

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
another self-fulfilling prophecy

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.150 
another self-fulfilling prophecy
another<00:05:24.550> self-fulfilling<00:05:25.510> future<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.320> I

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
another self-fulfilling future and I

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.790 
another self-fulfilling future and I
usually<00:05:27.580> hate<00:05:28.120> those<00:05:28.390> I<00:05:28.630> usually<00:05:29.020> can't<00:05:29.290> stand

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
usually hate those I usually can't stand

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.570 
usually hate those I usually can't stand
those<00:05:30.100> in<00:05:30.520> TV<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.240> film<00:05:31.740> but<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:33.070> time<00:05:33.430> it

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
those in TV and film but this time it

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.380 
those in TV and film but this time it
actually<00:05:33.880> works<00:05:34.240> mostly<00:05:35.200> because<00:05:35.470> of<00:05:36.390> the

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
actually works mostly because of the

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.070 
actually works mostly because of the
pacing<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.260> the<00:05:39.220> fact<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.730> we<00:05:40.450> know<00:05:40.660> so

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
pacing and the fact that we know so

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.640 
pacing and the fact that we know so
little<00:05:41.410> about<00:05:41.740> what<00:05:42.340> happened<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.630> him<00:05:44.350> to

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
little about what happened to him to

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.680 
little about what happened to him to
future<00:05:45.160> Danny<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:45.970> when<00:05:46.150> it's<00:05:46.300> finally

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
future Danny that when it's finally

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.710 
future Danny that when it's finally
revealed<00:05:47.230> you<00:05:48.040> honestly<00:05:49.000> can<00:05:49.270> kind<00:05:49.570> of

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
believe that that would happen in this

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.760 
believe that that would happen in this
work<00:05:52.300> in<00:05:52.540> this<00:05:52.570> strange<00:05:53.110> world<00:05:53.350> that<00:05:53.620> they've

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
work in this strange world that they've

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.640 
work in this strange world that they've
created<00:05:54.010> for<00:05:54.460> these<00:05:54.760> characters<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.600> can<00:05:56.320> see

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
created for these characters you can see

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.010
