00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.280
 Hello, I 'm Marcelo, teacher of the unit. 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.170
 joaquim floriano is here in the condominium 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.269
 now to be able to move to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 you a senior member training 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.710
 for those who practice swimming 1 to 1 we go 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.730
 start the training by the high handle on the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.380
 front 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.779
 This exercise works in the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.529
 trapezius lumbar region and also the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.380
 abdominal 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 You'll start by making the logo. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.390
 after the curve of the most open bar 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.250
 possible when you sit you go 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.620
 tilt the trunk a little bit back 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.510
 and will pull bar toward the chest 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 oral there is no need to touch 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.950
 but as close as you can get 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.489
 When you return you will make a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.520
 extension of your elbow this is going 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.930
 come back again with the load bending 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.010
 you will adjust according to your 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.050
 capacity 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.420
 Ideally you do three sets of 15 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.219
 to 20 repetitions 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.260
 now those who want to do the flexion of 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.430
 then the starting position will be 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.210
 with the body at the front in position 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.610
 horizontal leaves the arms parallel to one another. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.680
 slightly away from shoulder width 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.290
 feet well there on the tip of the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.000
 well stabilized column shrink at boot 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.280
 to keep a bar straight does not leave a 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.409
 bar and you make a movement of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 elbow flexion down to a 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.670
 angle of 90 degrees what the government 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 lets go of angulation and returning 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.820
 in its extension 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 when you return do not extend into your 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.180
 elbow always leaves a small 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.310
 reflection on it and there repeats the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.560
 movement and if you can make three 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.810
 series of 15 to 20 repetitions 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.670
 exercise itself, we will perform the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.740
 reverse crucifix a machine that 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.270
 The apparatus works the trapezoid region at 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.520
 posterior tokyo region 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.259
 the first thing you will perform is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.810
 adjust the seat according to height 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.000
 suitable for you stands for reference 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.460
 at the time you put your hand there 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.369
 inside the device 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.200
 Your shoulder and your fist are in the same 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.570
 line about ok 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.399
 when did you go exercise 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.740
 You will start and the following way. 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.680
 doing an abduction of your shoulder in the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.319
 maximum you can get and returning to the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.890
 starting position without leaving a 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.720
 to touch the other 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.740
 Ideally, you should do three sets of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.740
 15 to 20 repetitions 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.720
 now we want to make a shrink 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.810
 shoulder a little foot in each hand you go 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.290
 raising your shoulders makes a 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.750
 rotate back and up again and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
 ideal spin back three 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.790
 series of 15 to 20 repetitions and if this 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.530
 will work shoulder in the medial part of it 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.040
 will work apart from the trapeze too 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.040
 OK 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.350
 I hope you enjoyed the training of 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.300
 upper limb for those who practice 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.800
 swimming if I'm in doubt 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.450
 a teacher of yellow in soil 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.800
 liked the shared video on the networks 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.800
 are more
