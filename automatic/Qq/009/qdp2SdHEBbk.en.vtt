here's<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.460> first<00:01:29.790> glance<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.329> review

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
here's one first glance at the review

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
here's one first glance at the review
section<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> app<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.710> turned<00:01:32.040> into<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
section for the app has turned into a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950 
section for the app has turned into a
free-for-all<00:01:32.850> gun<00:01:33.180> debate<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:33.659> makes

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
free-for-all gun debate which makes

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
free-for-all gun debate which makes
sense<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> huge<00:01:34.979> issue<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:35.549> as

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
sense this is a huge issue right now as

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.370 
sense this is a huge issue right now as
it<00:01:36.030> should<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.360> dollars<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:36.960> side<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it should be dollars of what side of the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.960 
it should be dollars of what side of the
debate<00:01:37.560> you're<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.040> discourse<00:01:38.670> about<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
debate you're on discourse about the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.490 
debate you're on discourse about the
Second<00:01:39.240> Amendment<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.020> good<00:01:40.259> thing

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
Second Amendment is a good thing

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.929 
Second Amendment is a good thing

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
hopefully it promotes people looking

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.340 
hopefully it promotes people looking
into<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.240> data<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.720> themselves<00:01:43.079> and
