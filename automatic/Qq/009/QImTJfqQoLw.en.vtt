synthetic<00:00:33.690> cubism<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.440> there's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
synthetic cubism I think there's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.380 
synthetic cubism I think there's
something<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.980> also<00:00:35.129> very<00:00:35.400> important<00:00:36.059> and

something else I realize now that I see
him<00:03:53.150> up<00:03:53.299> here<00:03:53.449> but<00:03:53.599> if<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:53.930> look<00:03:54.109> at<00:03:54.229> them

out here is the Matisse because the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.729 
out here is the Matisse because the

is still very much in that Western

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.360 
is still very much in that Western

throughout his career as a sculptor and

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.240 
throughout his career as a sculptor and
curiously<00:04:23.960> enough<00:04:24.320> it's<00:04:24.770> something<00:04:25.099> that<00:04:25.219> I

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
curiously enough it's something that I

curiously enough it's something that I

think is most fully realized in

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.250 
think is most fully realized in

interesting<00:04:35.200> that<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.190> just<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.700> time

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
interesting that this is just the time

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.690 
interesting that this is just the time
when<00:04:37.660> sculpture<00:04:38.260> becomes<00:04:38.920> liberated<00:04:39.190> from
