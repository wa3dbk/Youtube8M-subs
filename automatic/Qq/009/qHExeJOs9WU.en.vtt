00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.250
 very good all kids how are you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 today with rockies and once again we are in 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.810
 the battlefield 4 but as you can see we have 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.820
 passed from the lightweight to the shotgun that is 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.180
 what I wanted to use lightly for 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.410
 get me the shotgun 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.320
 welcome to the bat to say 4 to you 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.300
 also but there are many people who are 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.310
 novice in the game obviously me too 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.289
 I am so far never before 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.940
 I tried the film paper and even my 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760
 less than you that I had 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.009
 bought the battlefield 3 will make a few 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.960
 how many months but I tried it 3 or 4 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.539
 I did not really like the people who 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 there was super and but they were not used to 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.710
 or after playing so much both with no 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.649
 I got used to this game mode to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 this weapon this fact that is to this 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.999
 style does not get used to me goes first with 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.010
 the bat phil 4 there are as many novices as 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.319
 I really have a good time 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.760
 there are people who do not know anything 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.219
 just like the first one went well 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 game and that's when you enjoy a game 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.850
 when you enjoy it the most is when 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.159
 you have no idea not when you're a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.929
 complete rookie that I already told you this 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.450
 in another comment I do not have in my 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.560
 comment being a novice is much better 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.299
 that be a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.880
 because you enjoy a lot more than a game 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.619
 do not stress everything is new everything is 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.990
 fun and in this case as you see 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.180
 I took the bust to the 800 sale of this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.329
 game that is brutal is very good to me 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.979
 love doing as many haymarket as 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.630
 the shotguns in the call of duty are not 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.570
 very consistent in their complete of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.830
 this game but I do not know maybe it's 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.720
 that will get me used a little more 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.220
 or maybe it's that what will be 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.289
 aim not to shoot so much from the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.990
 hip use a series of accessories 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.820
 that they make the shotguns 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.799
 better but for now kids what 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.259
 I am more amused by this game of this one 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.140
 battlefield is this this weapon not the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.909
 tool an 830 is brutal is super 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.549
 fun in fact I'm preparing a 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.319
 detail how good I have a few 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.580
 clicks that I guess I'll get out now 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.069
 when I keep playing a little more 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.289
 because it 's something else the game is 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.810
 freezes a lot the play keeps me 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.750
 frozen many times because I do not know 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.479
 is this game requires more to the play of 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.640
 what it can or simply because it is a 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.720
 beta version and it's like that not because I remember 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.700
 the white that everyone also at the beginning 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.019
 here by the way I ran out of ammo and 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.370
 as I am so look we are giving 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.049
 realize that no 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.269
 and I'm trying to shoot shoot 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.150
 shoot and here as many new 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.430
 also trying to have to be here 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.019
 there was a rope mounted but it was 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.120
 saying there are many times that you are 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.610
 is the play nailed and it's a shame not 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.560
 because this game the truth is me 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.180
 liking a lot as I say go 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.370
 running with the shotguns here by 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.370
 true that is the one who knows it I think that 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.739
 launched into space and a parachute comes out 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.239
 but I think you have to press a button 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.040
 so as not to hurt yourself so much 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.959
 lose so much health so if any 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.150
 He knows how to do it, so tell me in the 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.700
 Comment section of course is 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.989
 true kids the little bitch you are 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.910
 seeing that the range is a game 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.040
 complete that I've picked the best 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.299
 moments that I do not know what are the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.909
 standards of the battle to film 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.920
 consider a good departure but as 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.140
 are the big maps are usually 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.459
 big maps what I'm going to do the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.530
 great that you reach the battlefield goes 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.940
 to be cut the parts the best 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.680
 parts so that people and not be 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.109
 boring so there's always a 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.940
 matta matta little something cool or something 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.769
 something fun in the background to see 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.450
 while I talk about what I have to 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.830
 talk about that in this case as it was 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.900
 commenting on the game 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.430
 I liked it very much, I'm just 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.590
 playing this I'm not playing anymore 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.990
 alcohol or something special here 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.280
 by the way effect of the jackson have 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.550
 where the teacher is like I do 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.260
 the call of duty and good 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.510
 those typical moments looks not that 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.610
 makes typical people not like me that 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.570
 does not know how to play the battlefield so 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.370
 good kids I hope you have 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.920
 enjoyed the video tell me if you want 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.380
 see more content of battlefield 4 in 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.630
 the channel as I say I will try when 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.390
 come out the final game that I do not have 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.980
 an idea of when will chicken try 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.170
 to be caught half-heartedly with someone 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.740
 although I have done that is the one that happens to 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.150
 some surprise something like that and 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.310
 I gave it to someone 8 who is 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.200
 anything but the case of kids 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.709
 that are going to have more gameplays of 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.000
 this game and of this one Carlos last of 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.890
 close this battlefield that is me 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.750
 liking quite well so good as I have 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.310
 said I hope you liked the video 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.109
 if you want more than first doing 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.150
 dark knight comments to support the 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.190
 video and know they are afraid to know that 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.760
 thus showing that we see the 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.760
 next video
