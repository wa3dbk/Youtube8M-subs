water<00:00:04.290> quality<00:00:04.590> affects<00:00:05.069> your<00:00:05.310> health

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
water quality affects your health

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.420 
water quality affects your health
dependent<00:00:06.390> upon<00:00:06.479> how<00:00:06.660> many<00:00:07.620> things<00:00:07.980> are<00:00:08.129> mixed

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.430 
dependent upon how many things are mixed

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.850 
dependent upon how many things are mixed
in<00:00:08.520> with<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.700> water<00:00:09.000> water<00:00:09.870> by<00:00:10.139> itself<00:00:10.559> is

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
in with the water water by itself is

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.959 
in with the water water by itself is
always<00:00:11.459> water<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.950> more<00:00:14.190> industrialized

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
always water but the more industrialized

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.040 
always water but the more industrialized
we<00:00:15.360> get<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:16.259> this<00:00:16.410> mono<00:00:16.680> agriculture<00:00:17.400> system

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
we get with this mono agriculture system

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.960 
we get with this mono agriculture system
going<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.200> the<00:00:19.529> more<00:00:19.710> chemicals<00:00:19.950> that<00:00:20.700> you<00:00:20.790> get

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
going on the more chemicals that you get

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.499 
going on the more chemicals that you get
in<00:00:21.119> there<00:00:21.329> so<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> more<00:00:21.899> things<00:00:22.200> end<00:00:22.500> up

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
in there so the more things end up

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.990 
in there so the more things end up
toxify<00:00:24.509> in<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.750> water<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.230> rotting<00:00:26.000> within

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
toxify in the water and rotting within

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120 
toxify in the water and rotting within
the<00:00:27.090> water<00:00:27.270> itself<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.739> you<00:00:28.800> end<00:00:29.009> up<00:00:29.070> with

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the water itself so you end up with

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.930 
the water itself so you end up with
things<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.610> you<00:00:30.059> know<00:00:30.180> heavy<00:00:30.419> metals

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
things like you know heavy metals

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.970 
things like you know heavy metals
toxicity<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.719> know<00:00:33.840> poisoning<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.440> sodium

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
toxicity you know poisoning from sodium

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.760 
toxicity you know poisoning from sodium
fluoride<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.290> obviously<00:00:37.290> things<00:00:37.560> like

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
fluoride and obviously things like

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.530 
fluoride and obviously things like
chlorine<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.580> we're<00:00:38.850> still<00:00:39.060> using<00:00:39.240> in<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
chlorine which we're still using in the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.070 
chlorine which we're still using in the
States<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.170> highly<00:00:41.100> toxic<00:00:41.310> as<00:00:41.670> well<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:43.050> know

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
States is highly toxic as well you know

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.860 
States is highly toxic as well you know
needs<00:00:43.350> tendin<00:00:43.650> toxic<00:00:44.010> cleaners<00:00:44.480> on<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:45.720> of

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
needs tendin toxic cleaners on top of

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.340 
needs tendin toxic cleaners on top of
that<00:00:45.990> too<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:47.160> water<00:00:47.970> is<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:49.110> key<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that too so the water is the key to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.710 
that too so the water is the key to
health<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.700> water<00:00:50.940> needs<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.540> have

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
health but what water needs to have

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.560 
health but what water needs to have
minerals<00:00:52.200> so<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.250> demineralized<00:00:54.060> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
minerals so we're not demineralized and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.380 
minerals so we're not demineralized and
water<00:00:55.500> also<00:00:55.920> needs<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.520> minerals<00:00:57.000> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
water also needs to have the minerals so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.870 
water also needs to have the minerals so
that<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:58.770> people<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.310> get<00:00:59.430> hydrated

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
that that people can get hydrated

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.479 
that that people can get hydrated
because<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.620> depending<00:01:02.010> dependent

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
because you know depending dependent

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.310 
because you know depending dependent
upon<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.700> water<00:01:02.970> quality<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.140> water

upon the water quality if the water

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.030 
upon the water quality if the water
quality<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.949> poor<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.119> ph<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> too<00:01:06.810> low

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
quality is poor and the ph is too low

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.560 
quality is poor and the ph is too low
minerals<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.370> getting<00:01:08.940> leached<00:01:09.180> from<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
minerals are getting leached from the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.660 
minerals are getting leached from the
body<00:01:10.460> people<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.440> dehydrated<00:01:13.670> Ricky

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
body people are just so dehydrated Ricky

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.090 
body people are just so dehydrated Ricky
regardless<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.450> much<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:15.930> drink

and<00:01:30.690> of<00:01:31.140> course<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.740> know<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> good<00:01:32.190> fresh

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
and of course you know the good fresh

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.640 
and of course you know the good fresh
ripe<00:01:33.210> fruits<00:01:33.630> investigators<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.470> really

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
ripe fruits investigators it's really

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800 
ripe fruits investigators it's really
important<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.610> good<00:01:36.240> good<00:01:36.659> quality

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
important to have good good quality

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.590 
important to have good good quality
minerals<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> water<00:01:37.770> typically<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:39.390> best

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
minerals in the water typically the best

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.500 
minerals in the water typically the best
of<00:01:39.780> finer<00:01:39.990> ionic<00:01:40.619> minerals<00:01:41.010> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:42.030> raw<00:01:42.210> food

of finer ionic minerals in the raw food

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.240 
of finer ionic minerals in the raw food
world<00:01:42.890> everybody<00:01:43.890> talks<00:01:44.190> about<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:45.030> enzymes

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
world everybody talks about the enzymes

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
world everybody talks about the enzymes
really<00:01:47.250> being<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
really being the thing that that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.780 
really being the thing that that
activates<00:01:48.900> good<00:01:49.860> health<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.400> having<00:01:50.700> those

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
activates good health and having those

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
activates good health and having those
enzymes<00:01:51.210> well<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> enzymes<00:01:52.710> aren't<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
enzymes well the enzymes aren't going to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.630 
enzymes well the enzymes aren't going to
be<00:01:53.659> switched<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.869> without<00:01:55.590> good<00:01:56.280> quality

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
be switched on without good quality

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.870 
be switched on without good quality
minerals<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.890> idea<00:01:59.159> clarity<00:01:59.520> minerals

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
minerals so I the idea clarity minerals

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780 
minerals so I the idea clarity minerals
work<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:01.020> help<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.979> switch<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.340> those<00:02:02.520> enzymes

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
work to help to switch on those enzymes

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.290 
work to help to switch on those enzymes
to<00:02:04.120> get<00:02:04.240> your<00:02:04.300> body<00:02:04.450> running<00:02:05.160> efficiently

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
to get your body running efficiently

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.840 
to get your body running efficiently
people<00:02:07.300> need<00:02:07.630> about<00:02:08.590> three<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.070> six<00:02:09.100> liters<00:02:09.670> of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
people need about three to six liters of

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.530 
people need about three to six liters of
water<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.119> day<00:02:10.470> depending<00:02:11.470> on<00:02:11.680> active<00:02:12.540> people

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
water a day depending on active people

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.910

that<00:02:13.840> vent<00:02:14.170> need<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.380> lot<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.560> fruits<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
that vent need a lot of fruits and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.970 
that vent need a lot of fruits and
vegetables<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:15.820> still<00:02:16.510> recommend<00:02:16.840> drinking<00:02:17.710> at

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
vegetables I still recommend drinking at

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.380 
vegetables I still recommend drinking at
least<00:02:18.160> three<00:02:18.490> liters<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.880> water<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.300> day

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
least three liters of water a day

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.170 
least three liters of water a day
minimum<00:02:20.320> if<00:02:21.130> people<00:02:21.520> are<00:02:21.640> eating<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.940> lot<00:02:22.060> of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
minimum if people are eating a lot of

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.250 
minimum if people are eating a lot of
fruits<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.540> vegetables<00:02:22.990> in<00:02:23.140> their

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
fruits and vegetables in their

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.200 
fruits and vegetables in their
conventional<00:02:23.890> there's<00:02:24.670> still<00:02:24.970> going<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.150> be

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
conventional there's still going to be

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.240 
conventional there's still going to be
that<00:02:25.420> toxic<00:02:25.960> accumulation<00:02:26.410> from<00:02:27.070> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
that toxic accumulation from the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.250 
that toxic accumulation from the
different<00:02:27.610> pesticides<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.570> herbicides<00:02:28.630> and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
different pesticides and herbicides and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.130 
different pesticides and herbicides and
so<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:29.920> forth<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.550> i'll<00:02:30.670> recommend

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
so on and so forth so i'll recommend

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.170 
so on and so forth so i'll recommend
closer<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> six<00:02:32.740> later<00:02:32.920> range<00:02:33.220> even<00:02:33.820> for

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
closer to the six later range even for

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.520 
closer to the six later range even for
people<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.570> are<00:02:34.660> doing<00:02:34.690> lots<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.140> fruits<00:02:35.350> and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
people that are doing lots of fruits and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.770 
people that are doing lots of fruits and
vegetables<00:02:35.950> so<00:02:36.130> it's<00:02:36.580> really<00:02:36.790> dependent<00:02:37.150> upon

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
vegetables so it's really dependent upon

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.530 
vegetables so it's really dependent upon
how<00:02:37.990> conscious<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> eater<00:02:39.190> one<00:02:39.459> is<00:02:39.670> the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
have a friend that went to a water

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.830 
have a friend that went to a water
bottling<00:03:46.239> facility<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:47.580> Michigan<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.840> what

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
bottling facility in Michigan and what

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.259 
bottling facility in Michigan and what
she<00:03:50.049> found<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.980> plastic<00:03:51.220> molds<00:03:52.060> that

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
she found is that the plastic molds that

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.330 
she found is that the plastic molds that
they<00:03:52.570> pour<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.959> water<00:03:53.110> into<00:03:53.380> are<00:03:53.739> still<00:03:54.040> warm

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
they pour the water into are still warm

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.930 
they pour the water into are still warm
when

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
when

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.030 
when
when<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.300> water<00:03:55.510> goes<00:03:55.720> in<00:03:55.960> there<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.860> there's

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
when the water goes in there so there's

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.390 
when the water goes in there so there's
dissolve<00:03:57.520> plastics<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.210> are<00:03:58.330> in<00:03:58.540> there<00:03:58.810> and

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
dissolve plastics that are in there and

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.480 
dissolve plastics that are in there and
so<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.430> typically<00:04:00.910> don't<00:04:01.690> drink<00:04:02.230> any<00:04:03.010> water<00:04:03.220> out

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
so I typically don't drink any water out

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.040 
so I typically don't drink any water out
of<00:04:03.580> plastic<00:04:04.000> containers<00:04:04.420> once<00:04:04.660> I'm<00:04:04.810> over

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
of plastic containers once I'm over

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.100 
of plastic containers once I'm over
water<00:04:05.770> like<00:04:06.010> dasani<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.670> aquafina<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:08.020> know

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
water like dasani and aquafina you know

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.640 
water like dasani and aquafina you know
they<00:04:08.640> they<00:04:09.640> pretty<00:04:09.970> much<00:04:10.060> just<00:04:10.210> use<00:04:10.720> probably

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
they they pretty much just use probably

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.280 
they they pretty much just use probably

ninety to a hundred percent tap water so

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.870 
ninety to a hundred percent tap water so
water<00:04:14.470> that<00:04:14.740> has<00:04:14.860> toxins<00:04:15.460> in<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:15.820> they're

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
water that has toxins in it and they're

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.580 
water that has toxins in it and they're
sort<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.150> double<00:04:16.480> dipping<00:04:16.780> because<00:04:17.049> on<00:04:17.200> top<00:04:17.230> of

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
sort of double dipping because on top of

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.340 
sort of double dipping because on top of
the<00:04:17.739> toxins<00:04:18.190> those<00:04:19.000> toxins<00:04:19.450> there's<00:04:20.140> also

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
the toxins those toxins there's also

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.500 
the toxins those toxins there's also
going<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.560> be<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:21.190> plastic<00:04:22.000> residual

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
going to be the the plastic residual

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.080 
going to be the the plastic residual
contamination<00:04:23.040> that<00:04:24.040> will<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.850> will<00:04:24.940> go

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
contamination that will that will go

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.990 
contamination that will that will go
into<00:04:25.270> your<00:04:25.450> body<00:04:25.630> as<00:04:26.500> well<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.430> like<00:04:27.730> to<00:04:27.760> keep

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
the the water within me as you know it's

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.780 
the the water within me as you know it's
clean<00:04:31.830> mineralized<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.100> fresh<00:04:33.310> as<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.550> can

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
clean mineralized and fresh as I can

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.650 
clean mineralized and fresh as I can
there's<00:04:34.390> a<00:04:34.450> water<00:04:34.690> scarcity<00:04:35.230> in<00:04:35.410> so<00:04:35.560> far<00:04:35.770> as

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
there's a water scarcity in so far as

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.930 
there's a water scarcity in so far as
the<00:04:37.660> quality<00:04:38.320> of<00:04:38.350> water<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:39.370> amount<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.730> water

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
the quality of water the amount of water

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.900 
the quality of water the amount of water
that<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.540> drinking<00:04:41.080> quality<00:04:41.590> is<00:04:41.910> continually

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
that of drinking quality is continually

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.090 
that of drinking quality is continually
going<00:04:43.030> down<00:04:43.390> I<00:04:43.690> mean<00:04:44.200> more<00:04:44.350> people<00:04:44.650> are<00:04:44.770> dying

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
going down I mean more people are dying

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.190 
going down I mean more people are dying
because<00:04:45.340> they<00:04:45.610> don't<00:04:45.790> have<00:04:45.850> access<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.990> clean

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
because they don't have access to clean

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.600 
because they don't have access to clean
water<00:04:47.260> because<00:04:47.890> it<00:04:48.040> seems<00:04:48.280> like<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.460> me

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
water because it seems like to me

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.250 
water because it seems like to me
there's<00:04:48.880> pretty<00:04:49.180> much<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.600> same<00:04:49.780> amount<00:04:49.990> of

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
there's pretty much the same amount of

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.920 
there's pretty much the same amount of
water<00:04:50.530> that's<00:04:50.650> here<00:04:51.220> it's<00:04:51.880> just<00:04:52.240> things<00:04:52.810> that

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
water that's here it's just things that

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.020 
water that's here it's just things that
are<00:04:53.140> in<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.650> water<00:04:53.890> that<00:04:54.190> reduce<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:54.820> quality

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
are in the water that reduce the quality

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.600 
are in the water that reduce the quality
and<00:04:55.240> make<00:04:55.420> it<00:04:55.540> undrinkable<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.740> as<00:04:56.860> long<00:04:57.040> as<00:04:57.220> we

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
and make it undrinkable so as long as we

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.460 
and make it undrinkable so as long as we
have<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.790> technology<00:04:58.060> like<00:04:58.750> Ida<00:04:58.960> clarity

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
have the technology like Ida clarity

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.400 
have the technology like Ida clarity
does<00:04:59.770> to<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:01.120> remove<00:05:01.450> those<00:05:01.660> things<00:05:02.050> and

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
does to to remove those things and

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.800 
does to to remove those things and
neutralize<00:05:03.280> then<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.180> think<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.600> everybody

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
neutralize then I think that everybody

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.010 
neutralize then I think that everybody
will<00:05:05.110> will<00:05:05.890> be<00:05:05.919> able<00:05:06.100> to<00:05:06.340> have<00:05:06.550> access<00:05:07.510> to

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
will will be able to have access to

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.590 
will will be able to have access to
adequate<00:05:08.260> water
