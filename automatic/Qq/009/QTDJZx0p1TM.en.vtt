00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 and now we are going to demonstrate here the panel 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.750
 of the custom passat with the system 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.139
 translucent acrylic show panel 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.379
 this kit is based on the withdrawal of 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.379
 original plates that are can doors 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.880
 the installation of the LEDs and internal 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.880
 pointers painting 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.079
 basically let's see how it works 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.449
 original panel 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.629
 we have an original panel 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.519
 incredible as it may seem, is connected to 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:44.400
 your lighting 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:48.510
 we noticed that because only 20% 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:53.180
 the light will reach the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.180
 the effect is too weak 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:05.110
 here it was original let's compare the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.110
 acrid kit 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.880
 this athletic kit board 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.100
 As you can see, she has the same 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.659
 feature of the original board 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.789
 in many cases the same spelling 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.909
 only that its great differential is the 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:28.610
 numbers are translucent ie light 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.619
 passes only for the moments having 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:38.539
 maximum use of applied light 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:42.530
 the lightweight installation is ideal. 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:46.630
 that are in a circle that accompanies all 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.630
 the characters on the board 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.470
 even with a red detail goes 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.420
 stay lit 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.380
 this card is based on 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.829
 white if you want to choose the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:12.109
 green blue or white red color 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:14.709
 just change the led to the board 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:17.050
 remains the same 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.570
 here we have 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.410
 the additional was made a symbol brings 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.400
 light to complete the effect is not this 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.860
 there 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.890
 the acrylic kit will be available for 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.890
 all through the students 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.880
 we also have other cars 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:49.360
 we had an example from paulo 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:55.600
 ss we have to chevette fusca the whole line 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.900
 of goal square old cars and many 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.900
 others 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.850
 now we will see the gift bosco model 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.850
 square 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.730
