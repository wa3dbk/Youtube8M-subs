00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:08.469
 a citizen who can bring style 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:12.370
 modern and plenty of room for the family 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:15.790
 and who still capriche with a good dose of 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.740
 power has everything to please not 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.890
 is what citroen promises with a 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:31.210
 four thp flex lounge and forced gomes 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:34.480
 show us the new thp engine 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.970
 flex and 4 lounge is another model that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.950
 can bring a real attraction is 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.440
 even a little more emotion for this 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.329
 segment of the medium sedans here in Brazil 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.399
 but it also has other points 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.920
 interesting as agent conferred on the 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:52.870
 This week's evaluation was not this time. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.329
 we open the year without the traditional 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.660
 corolla and civic in sales leadership 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.969
 in the segment of the medium sedans in Brazil 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.910
 but it is true that we had news in the 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.039
 end of 2014 that has the strength to 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.770
 encourage fans of traditional 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.259
 Japanese models to try out another 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.020
 option is what citroen did with the new 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.899
 c4 lounge equipped with a new engine 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.909
 turbo flex that guarantees among others 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.060
 a dose of emotion for those who take on the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.060
 steering wheel 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.340
 known turbo engine and was no longer 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.610
 weak with 165 horses 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.310
 now generates 173 horsepower with 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.710
 ethanol in the tank and more 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.079
 the system 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.270
 of direct injection for example uses 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.880
 a new high pressure pump up to 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.469
 200 ba and working together with a 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.210
 new ethanol sensor 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.819
 with this according to the mixture 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.530
 identified by the sensor the pump set 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.350
 the ideal injection pressure 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.990
 fuel directly into the cylinders 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.240
 among other benefits this solution 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.270
 allows the starting system to be 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 cold 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.200
 along with the engine to other reinforcement 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.409
 third generation transmission 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.220
 the automatic isi within six six 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.620
 marches 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.959
 to summarize the box is smaller and more 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.840
 and has also received changes 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.239
 interesting now has a new role 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.250
 reduction of traction that decreases 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.500
 vibration at idle when the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.810
 exchange is in the drive position plus a 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 new torque converter and a new 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.840
 elongated transmission ratio by 11% is 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.670
 important that the c4 lounge with tram 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.519
 accelerate now verified much more 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.650
 smart in the resumes 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.959
 because the marches are now also 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.329
 exchanged much faster and 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.790
 strong characteristic of him is that he has 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.489
 enough torque available already at low 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.560
 rotations from the thousand and 400 spins and 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.739
 Citroen reported that it was 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.930
 more economical looks have a reduction 76 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.769
 percent in consumption compared to a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.769
 gasoline powered engine 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.959
 okay that on average the c4 lounge thp 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.670
 remains more committed to the proposal 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.709
 traditional sedans 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.470
 not to mention that it follows very good space 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.650
 internal and plenty of slack for those who sit 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.650
 behind 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.090
 but despite this injection of 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.160
 sportsmanship with turbo flex engine 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.400
 the truth is that the c4 lounge is still 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.170
 value much comfort without forgetting 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.300
 it was a taller car you would say 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.700
 in a higher condition nÃ© 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.980
 still he responds very well has 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.990
 a very successful suspension set 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.270
 firm and passes a lot of security 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.270
 including at higher speeds 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.080
 the important novelty is still the inclusion 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.260
 of electronic stability control 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.540
 of the anti-skid system as 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.300
 series in all versions 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.700
 already the abs brakes count on delivery 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.050
 electronic brake system and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.050
 emergency braking aid 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:27.860
 with the 2015 line c4 is still offered in the 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.680
 version with engine 2.0 flex of 151 horses 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.849
 and now offers two options 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.819
 for whom to choose thp flex engine 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:40.190
 attendance thp is more in mind and even hp 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.750
 exclusive is the top of the line with 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.210
 such as the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.879
 front parking departure without 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.879
 key camera pe-60 beige 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.580
 is the c4 lounge with this thp flex engine 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.560
 won a handsome one from a sale call 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.870
 so it was interesting too 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.000
 because it has good content with a price 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.800
 very competitive when compared to 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.290
 with your direct competitors 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.690
 but now your biggest challenge is still 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.090
 to overcome the Japanese tradition here in 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.340
 Brazil, which continue offering a value of 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.630
 resale and, above all, the cost of 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.630
 of minor maintenance
