00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
the power I've just changed the oil and
done<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.310> weight<00:00:29.490> reduction<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.210> put<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
terms of power much so we can see

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.750 
terms of power much so we can see
they've<00:00:37.290> got<00:00:37.320> some<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:37.680> impressive<00:00:38.219> stats

a good-looking car in terms of its specs

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.170 
a good-looking car in terms of its specs
so<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.739> we're<00:00:55.860> gonna<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.190> now<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.430> take<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
so what we're gonna do now is take it to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.950 
so what we're gonna do now is take it to
the<00:00:57.300> track<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:59.039> like<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> onto

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the track and see what it's like so onto

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
the track and see what it's like so onto
the<00:01:04.140> lamont<00:01:04.680> circuit<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.309> think<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the lamont circuit I think this is the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
the lamont circuit I think this is the
perfect<00:01:06.090> track<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.750> test<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> cars<00:01:07.470> out

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
perfect track to test all the cars out

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580 
perfect track to test all the cars out
and<00:01:08.330> not<00:01:09.330> only<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> very<00:01:10.110> beautiful

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
car on the outside if we take a look on

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.539 
car on the outside if we take a look on
the<00:01:12.780> inside<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.290> well<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.950> now<00:01:14.070> very<00:01:14.369> nice

layout<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.430> just

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
layout I do like that so we're just

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.660 
layout I do like that so we're just
gonna<00:01:20.670> take<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> nice<00:01:21.720> gentle<00:01:22.259> cruise<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.549> the

gonna take a nice gentle cruise to the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.149 
gonna take a nice gentle cruise to the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
straight take it a bit easy to start

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.179 
straight take it a bit easy to start
with<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.900> idea<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.259> these<00:01:28.470> videos<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.040> you

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
with and the idea of these videos is you

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
with and the idea of these videos is you
see<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.909> wall<00:01:30.119> car<00:01:30.450> I'm<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.750> gonna<00:01:30.900> go

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
see that the wall car I'm not gonna go

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.770 
see that the wall car I'm not gonna go
mental<00:01:31.350> tuning<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> power<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.450> cars

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
mental tuning the power up on these cars

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.170 
mental tuning the power up on these cars
all<00:01:34.020> I've<00:01:34.200> done<00:01:34.320> change<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> oil<00:01:35.000> change<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
all I've done change the oil change the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
all I've done change the oil change the
suspension<00:01:36.360> lower<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.890> all

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
suspension lower it a bit and take all

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.260 
suspension lower it a bit and take all
the<00:01:38.189> weight<00:01:38.369> off<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:38.970> essentially

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the weight off so you're essentially

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
the weight off so you're essentially
seeing<00:01:39.600> almost<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.680> standard<00:01:41.159> car<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.970> terms

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
seeing almost the standard car in terms

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.200 
seeing almost the standard car in terms
of<00:01:42.390> power<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.009> then<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> intend<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of power and then what I intend to do is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.990 
of power and then what I intend to do is
take<00:01:45.960> these<00:01:46.259> cars<00:01:46.710> after<00:01:47.340> I've<00:01:47.729> done<00:01:47.909> this

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
take these cars after I've done this

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.719 
take these cars after I've done this
road<00:01:48.299> review<00:01:48.720> tune<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.649> living<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.670> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
road review tune this living out of

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.170 
road review tune this living out of
them

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
them

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.300 
them
and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> top<00:01:52.200> speed<00:01:52.500> test<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.979> them<00:01:53.130> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and then do a top speed test of them so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.770 
and then do a top speed test of them so
you'll<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.850> these<00:01:53.970> cars<00:01:54.180> followed<00:01:54.659> up

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
you'll see all these cars followed up

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.780 
you'll see all these cars followed up
with<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> top<00:01:55.200> speed<00:01:55.229> test<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.640> I'm<00:01:56.700> gonna

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
with a top speed test so what I'm gonna

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.530 
with a top speed test so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:57.000> notice<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.450> stop<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.270> give<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> bit

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
do notice to stop on here give you a bit

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.120 
do notice to stop on here give you a bit
of<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> rev<00:02:00.869> sounds<00:02:01.680> good

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
of a rev sounds good

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.550 
of a rev sounds good
and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:02.850> floor<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> let's<00:02:04.200> see<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.469> this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and then floor it let's see what this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.740 
and then floor it let's see what this
thing<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.920> do

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
thing can do

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.300 
thing can do
five<00:02:06.750> sixty<00:02:07.320> already<00:02:07.590> has<00:02:07.799> about<00:02:08.009> three

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
five sixty already has about three

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.420 
five sixty already has about three
seconds<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.599> hundred<00:02:09.929> M<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:11.069> five

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
seconds it's a hundred M about five

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.699 
seconds it's a hundred M about five
seconds<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.810> Wow<00:02:13.319> look<00:02:13.590> at<00:02:13.650> that

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
seconds in and Wow look at that

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.589 
seconds in and Wow look at that
speedometer<00:02:14.550> okay<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:14.970> winding<00:02:15.360> its<00:02:15.540> way

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
speedometer okay and winding its way

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.660 
speedometer okay and winding its way
around<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.830> long<00:02:16.980> before<00:02:17.099> it's<00:02:17.310> gonna<00:02:17.400> touch

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
around not long before it's gonna touch

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.130 
around not long before it's gonna touch
the<00:02:17.819> end<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.709> fifth<00:02:20.069> gear<00:02:20.930> god<00:02:21.930> this

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the end of that so fifth gear god this

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.630 
the end of that so fifth gear god this
thing<00:02:22.319> has<00:02:22.500> got<00:02:22.680> some<00:02:22.860> power<00:02:23.040> 180<00:02:23.760> into<00:02:24.150> sixth

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
thing has got some power 180 into sixth

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.610 
thing has got some power 180 into sixth
it's<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.879> that<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.200> seventh<00:02:28.200> gear<00:02:28.379> I'm<00:02:28.500> just

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's not that a seventh gear I'm just

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.979 
it's not that a seventh gear I'm just
pressing<00:02:28.860> no<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.640> doesn't<00:02:29.849> have<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> semi<00:02:30.420> but

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
pressing no it doesn't have a semi but

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.990 
pressing no it doesn't have a semi but
does<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.260> say<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.440> think<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:31.890> power<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.790> car

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
does it say I think this power this car

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.300 
does it say I think this power this car
could<00:02:33.150> definitely<00:02:33.680> do<00:02:34.680> with<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.950> seventh

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
could definitely do with the seventh

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.150 
could definitely do with the seventh
gear<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:37.379> reason<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:37.680> using<00:02:37.739> this

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
gear and the reason I'm using this

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.610 
gear and the reason I'm using this
LeMond<00:02:38.640> track<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.150> because<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:40.230> got<00:02:40.410> no<00:02:40.440> she

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
LeMond track is because it's got no she

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.729 
LeMond track is because it's got no she
Cain's<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> very<00:02:41.550> nice<00:02:41.730> long

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
Cain's it's going to very nice long

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.410 
Cain's it's going to very nice long
straight<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.010> we<00:02:44.129> can<00:02:44.310> go<00:02:44.459> good<00:02:44.670> idea<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.000> sort

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
straight so we can go good idea of sort

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.119 
straight so we can go good idea of sort
of<00:02:45.480> voice<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.110> top<00:02:46.440> speed<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.980> performance

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
of voice this top speed and performance

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.030 
of voice this top speed and performance
is<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.849> we<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.989> test<00:02:49.170> braking<00:02:49.650> because<00:02:49.769> at

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
is like we can test braking because at

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.380 
is like we can test braking because at
the<00:02:50.160> end<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.459> straight<00:02:50.819> there's<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> very

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
the end of this straight there's a very

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880 
the end of this straight there's a very
tight<00:02:51.750> corner<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.530> there's<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> lot

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
tight corner so you know there's a lot

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.320 
tight corner so you know there's a lot
of<00:02:52.980> pressure<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.519> brakes<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.060> car

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
of pressure on the brakes of this car

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.210 
of pressure on the brakes of this car
there's<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.019> lot<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.230> high<00:02:55.410> speed<00:02:55.709> corners<00:02:56.190> just

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
there's a lot of high speed corners just

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.770 
there's a lot of high speed corners just
to<00:02:56.489> test<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.730> handling<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:57.360> well

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
to test the handling as well

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.309 
to test the handling as well
I<00:02:57.810> am<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> bit<00:02:59.010> worried<00:02:59.340> about<00:02:59.780> breaking<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:01.200> be

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
I am a bit worried about breaking to be

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.190 
I am a bit worried about breaking to be
honest<00:03:01.590> because<00:03:02.209> even<00:03:03.209> though<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.480> has<00:03:04.019> had

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
honest because even though this has had

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.330 
honest because even though this has had
a<00:03:04.230> lot<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.500> weight<00:03:04.680> we've<00:03:04.830> actually<00:03:04.980> still

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
a lot of weight we've actually still

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.440 
a lot of weight we've actually still
quite<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.550> heavy<00:03:05.790> car<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.300> not<00:03:06.420> a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
quite a heavy car and it's not a

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.210 
quite a heavy car and it's not a
mid-engine<00:03:06.959> rear-wheel<00:03:07.140> drive<00:03:07.349> car<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.069> is

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
mid-engine rear-wheel drive car this is

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.970 
mid-engine rear-wheel drive car this is
a<00:03:08.250> front<00:03:08.610> engine<00:03:08.819> so<00:03:09.300> let's<00:03:09.480> see<00:03:09.890> some<00:03:10.890> of

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
a front engine so let's see some of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.360 
a front engine so let's see some of
those<00:03:11.069> brakes<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.720> Wow<00:03:12.800> I'm<00:03:13.800> very<00:03:14.099> impressed

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
those brakes on Wow I'm very impressed

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.880 
those brakes on Wow I'm very impressed
with<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.610> brakes<00:03:14.879> on<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.150> thing<00:03:15.209> actually

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
with the brakes on this thing actually

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.320 
with the brakes on this thing actually
and<00:03:16.890> then<00:03:17.010> floor<00:03:17.459> again<00:03:17.819> build<00:03:18.090> up<00:03:18.239> that

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
and then floor again build up that

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.330 
and then floor again build up that
massive<00:03:18.810> power<00:03:19.019> I'm<00:03:19.560> very<00:03:19.920> impressed<00:03:20.190> with

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
massive power I'm very impressed with

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.949 
massive power I'm very impressed with
the<00:03:20.489> brakes<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.060> thought<00:03:21.599> you<00:03:21.690> know<00:03:21.810> there's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
the brakes I thought you know there's

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.479 
the brakes I thought you know there's
gonna<00:03:22.080> be<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.230> heavy<00:03:22.409> cause<00:03:22.680> I'm<00:03:22.950> gonna<00:03:23.099> slug

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
gonna be a heavy cause I'm gonna slug

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.960 
gonna be a heavy cause I'm gonna slug
off<00:03:23.670> that<00:03:23.849> speed<00:03:24.150> very<00:03:24.870> well<00:03:25.049> but<00:03:25.459> even<00:03:26.459> when<00:03:26.940> I

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
off that speed very well but even when I
