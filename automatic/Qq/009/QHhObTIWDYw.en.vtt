00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello so veronique joy and rock 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.679
 giguÃ¨re 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.440
 welcome to this passion capsule 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.070
 gardens tv today we discuss the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.240
 lawn 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.949
 rothen talk about the installation yes then 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.369
 Then crowds of crazy talk 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.800
 union king so when we acquire 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.309
 a new residence we are already 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.469
 glad to have a home to oneself but we 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.480
 also has to have a nice lawn around 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.309
 to hit the angels our children 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.730
 can play that we even have 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.860
 could make barbecues etc 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.160
 so we always wonder is what 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.840
 I do what I put a lawn done 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.940
 platelet of all good is what I 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.120
 sow here is the big question 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.250
 as shakespeare would say it's certain 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 that if we put sods we go 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.600
 to be able to use our lawn 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.760
 almost immediately in whore so 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.020
 the kids will not be in the mud we 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.799
 others we will be able to go to the cabanon 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.210
 100 wet saas etc 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.799
 on the other hand if we make a smig for 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.990
 must be more vigilant to have times 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.060
 pay attention 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.970
 whatever that is to have beautiful 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.700
 very important to have a good ground then 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.880
 especially pay attention to the ground kg 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.770
 watch it take your pl dig you 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.540
 go see often so full of life 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.979
 broeck complained about the debris because 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.700
 the contractors do not need too much attention 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.430
 do not put a good floor for you 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.710
 allow to plant your lawn 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.890
 so at that moment then we need to at 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.350
 less cattacin inch of good earth for 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.570
 that our future grass can roots 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.409
 future turf may well have penetrated 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.610
 Earth 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.710
 so once we did that well 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.579
 heard our lawn your thumbs and everything 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.530
 that two or three years later we will see 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.140
 probably compaction because the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.719
 most of the houses in the flower beds are 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.420
 made on the ground ice and in the sand 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.979
 we are ok we have a nice pot of 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.230
 compaction on the other hand we may be 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.569
 no need to compost a little 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.030
 to precisely enrich this sand the water 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.879
 which is very well drained and which dries 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.610
 the lawn so we go we will air 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:30.420
 our lawn to allow him well 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.480
 breathe something else sometimes at 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.200
 spring we have a little advance a 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:41.250
 little corner of the parterre that was drying then 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.959
 we see the grass 1 which will sail where we have 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.120
 a hole precisely that these facts by the 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.769
 years because the turf even on the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.209
 booklet is well equal we have assets 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.610
 so what are we gonna do 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.060
 add some soil or a little bit of 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:59.250
 compost and love ironic explain to you 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.379
 what do we do after then after 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.480
 the topdressing a good practice to 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.150
 to do is deaf this match what is this 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.720
 that the source maj is one comes to extend 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.269
 a few seed seeds on them 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.459
 more than sparse parts of our gas 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.079
 we advise to do it practically 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.280
 every year if we really want a 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:22.139
 dance densify our lawn turf more 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.239
 dense it will be more difficult to 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.459
 bad hours to take hold and by 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.000
 blank open example to do his 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.549
 ravages 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.349
 for your choice of seed well 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.299
 heard on the packaging you have 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.370
 surely noticed that you have not 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.079
 full sun and for ons 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.910
 it's not just a marketing move 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.310
 it's really in the mix 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.349
 there are different proportions of 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.940
 different kinds of grasses which 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.840
 will you make a lawn more 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.489
 resistant 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.090
 for example for the sun bread a 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.079
 different lawn for the better 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.660
 once your lawn is well 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.410
 established the important one to give him 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.750
 the food 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.730
 we eat three times a day then 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.310
 your lawn needs to eat three 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.440
 times a year in the spring to summer and 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.780
 autumn at passion gardens
