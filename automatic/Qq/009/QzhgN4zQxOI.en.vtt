00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.919
 just come to the table at the without 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
 chemistry and sits young together with alex 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.759
 for the whole here a bit 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.880
 a zitterpartie is because he is ultra 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.010
 short as you could say and seems 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.869
 to give something 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.869
 both involved in the hand 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.779
 without here is the scepter in hand 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.439
 now once again gone over it exactly 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.190
 I do not know action now 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:39.320
 every case one based all in one 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:43.150
 curious what's going on at alex yoong is 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.500
 in the market only the values ​​ago 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.800
 besides without chemistry and without chemistry around 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.980
 personally see and as always completely 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.489
 cool impression yes 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.850
 easy and casual he himself must be curious 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.860
 now a go now have the same name 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.860
 only 191 players in this main 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:10.220
 Event is counted I'm real 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.350
 curious what happens here now and whether 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.100
 without chemistry once again running as hot as 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.509
 He else does in recent years 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.470
 super high scooter still the sixth 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.610
 place occupies 50,000 euros buy-in has the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.650
 you have to imagine players 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.150
 20 years old at 20 years old 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.600
 where is the man in ten 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.950
 years 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.180
 I'm also very excited 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.620
 I should not care about it in this scene 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.610
 more of his ten years i give birth without 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.500
 chemistry to google a 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.040
 I want to know something from the young man 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.810
 the decision has become 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.720
 now, of course, longer in this one too 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.290
 phase 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.280
 now it depends on it foht or cool 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.280
 what should the people do 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.439
 follows but keeps the cards okay and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.869
 how it looks looks in there again 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.049
 But you know what you have and do 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.049
 the 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.640
 there it goes in such a way or without chemistry 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.800
 and he is here again and again 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.740
 we eliminate queens as often as possible 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.720
 jacks of ole greens against jacks though 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.410
 if you are without chemistry and still 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.980
 two buben index are then all 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.570
 possible 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.920
 and then it may be that he just 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.450
 times here so 98 95 we have workers 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.880
 both with the hero with the heart 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.580
 that does not change much here that 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.440
 three hearts in the flop com 5 only the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.870
 jec only the check helps or we 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.810
 have a doubler here and without may 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.030
 make a little something 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.310
 By the year 2000, so too is it 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.210
 without chemistry on you lose chips people 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.160
 you saw it 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.920
 It is not always that way without chemistry 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.370
 No, but not always 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.370
 more frequently
