00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to that point but I think it was a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.470

doing there was so much drawing and so
much<00:01:45.090> expression<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.590> lot<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> freedom<00:01:47.070> in

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
much expression and a lot of freedom in

in the future one of the key skills
coming<00:02:08.040> here<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.459> something<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.000> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
coming here and something that you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.319 
coming here and something that you
should<00:02:09.360> love<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.380> do<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.920> practice<00:02:11.760> anyway<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329
