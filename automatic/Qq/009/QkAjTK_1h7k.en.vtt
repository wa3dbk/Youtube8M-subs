00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.530
 hi everyone i am johns and a 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.530
 apparently I ended up in another life 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.400
 on earth we are all used to 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.950
 have three dimensions 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.410
 height and width and depth 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.970
 but here it doesn't work like that while 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.750
 you are there that you have just discovered 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.720
 google glass 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.460
 here already exists a fourth dimension which 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.800
 a normal human mind can't either 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.800
 imagine that I needed to 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.160
 these 4d glasses to call it is called 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.499
 dimension on eurisc bizarre real name 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.390
 the fourth dimension e techni 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.460
 generally referred to an extension 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.890
 of objects further than the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.489
 length to width and to deep 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.510
 which implies the need for an additional 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.030
 coordinated in addition to the space ones 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.170
 this other coordinate and the coordinate 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.510
 dark wells 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.019
 schematically the fourth dimension e 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.560
 representable through this 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.930
 animation this animation if watched 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.990
 with 4d glasses makes you get into a 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.500
 four-dimensional loop of what I am 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 speaking 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.590
 you have this even for 10 hours 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.200
 in ten hours on sky for ten hours 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 all the man's attempts to try 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.180
 to enter the fourth dimension but 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.380
 only thanks to these glasses and help 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.200
 kind of our pc 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.350
 we could reenter the true fourth 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.350
 dimension 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.460
 on earth we are all used to 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.009
 have three dimensions 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.470
 height , width and depth 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.030
 but here it doesn't work like that while 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.810
 you are there that you have just discovered 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.530
 google plus 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.790
 a fourth dimension already exists here 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.720
 because I feel like I already have 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.720
 said he is
