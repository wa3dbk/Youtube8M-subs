the situation basically the doors come
off<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:18.150> everything<00:01:18.450> runs<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
off and then everything runs out in a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.760 
off and then everything runs out in a
bit<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.369> big<00:01:20.490> swarm<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.840> said<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
bit like a big swarm and I said I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.390 
bit like a big swarm and I said I
insisted<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.880> said<00:01:24.180> Douglas<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.220> make

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
insisted I said Douglas you have to make

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
insisted I said Douglas you have to make
sure<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.600> doors<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.140> blown

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
sure that when these doors get blown

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340 
sure that when these doors get blown
apart<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.340> these<00:01:29.909> enemies<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.479> run<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
apart that these enemies just run that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.410 
apart that these enemies just run that
they<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.680> run<00:01:31.890> because<00:01:32.400> anything<00:01:32.909> else<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
they just run because anything else I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
they just run because anything else I
just<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> demographic<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:34.619> have

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
just think the demographic would have

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.880 
just think the demographic would have
dismissed<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.369> hey<00:01:36.259> something<00:01:37.259> classical

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.250 

now<00:01:41.890> this<00:01:42.130> was<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.660> obviously<00:01:43.660> guardians<00:01:44.200> of

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
now this was a obviously guardians of

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.170 
now this was a obviously guardians of
the<00:01:44.350> galaxy<00:01:44.740> very<00:01:45.010> successful<00:01:45.580> right<00:01:45.760> now<00:01:45.790> and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
the galaxy very successful right now and

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.670 
the galaxy very successful right now and
I<00:01:46.210> thought<00:01:46.360> let's<00:01:46.570> have<00:01:46.720> some<00:01:46.930> anachronistic

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
I thought let's have some anachronistic

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.480 
I thought let's have some anachronistic
music<00:01:48.010> in<00:01:48.160> there<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:49.840> couldn't<00:01:50.200> go

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
music in there and what I couldn't go
