00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.350
 open and close a door 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.769
 at the man's wrist and we close the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.839
 door 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.149
 this movement but your techniques will 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.220
 help you actually make the turn 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.520
 as they say 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.220
