 All clean 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 My name is Alex Mercer. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.000
 I am the reason for all this 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 They call me a murderer, a monster, a terrorist. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.000
 I am all these things 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 Three weeks ago someone released a deadly virus at Penn Station 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.500

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 and I will make them pay! 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Walkers! Open fire! 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.500
 Clean area. Move! You with me. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.500

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 It's him! 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.000
