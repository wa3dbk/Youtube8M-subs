00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.170 
hopefully this summer I am getting
coilovers<00:00:36.930> installed<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.820> car<00:00:39.030> will

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
coilovers installed so the car will

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.930 
coilovers installed so the car will
definitely<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.809> lowered<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.440> look<00:00:41.430> better

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
definitely be lowered and look better

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
definitely be lowered and look better
removing<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> plastic<00:00:43.200> tip<00:00:43.559> itself<00:00:44.100> is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
removing the plastic tip itself is

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.500 
removing the plastic tip itself is
actually<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:45.059> easy

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
actually really easy

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.510 
actually really easy
um<00:00:45.719> I'll<00:00:46.260> show<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> guys<00:00:46.770> how<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.340> that

here<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> right<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> already<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
here so right here I already have a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.560 
here so right here I already have a
point<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:50.930> damaged<00:00:52.489> but<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.360> just

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
point that's damaged but you know just

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.650 
point that's damaged but you know just
take<00:00:54.719> any<00:00:54.989> point<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:55.980> wheel<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:57.510> could

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
take any point on your wheel you could

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
take any point on your wheel you could
probably<00:00:57.840> start<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> corner<00:00:59.480> and<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
probably start with the corner and you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.899 
probably start with the corner and you
just<00:01:01.340> pull<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> back<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.519> it<00:01:05.519> actually<00:01:05.700> just

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
just pull it back and it actually just

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.410 
just pull it back and it actually just
peels<00:01:06.360> right<00:01:06.540> off<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> have
