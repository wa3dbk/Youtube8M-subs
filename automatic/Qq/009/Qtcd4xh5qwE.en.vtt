had three you know miss doubledays

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.810 
had three you know miss doubledays
missed<00:01:26.420> all<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.079> it's<00:01:27.979> not<00:01:28.159> so<00:01:28.579> much<00:01:28.640> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
missed all that so it's not so much the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.940 
missed all that so it's not so much the
physical<00:01:29.450> aspect<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.290> really<00:01:30.770> hurts

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
physical aspect that it really hurts

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.590 
physical aspect that it really hurts
more<00:01:31.220> than<00:01:31.250> mental<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:32.240> getting

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
more than mental and just getting

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.569 
more than mental and just getting
getting<00:01:33.200> reps<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:33.680> feeling<00:01:34.189> comfortable<00:01:34.220> at

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
getting reps and feeling comfortable at

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.340 
getting reps and feeling comfortable at
the<00:01:34.640> offense<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.119> I<00:01:35.149> think<00:01:35.270> that's<00:01:35.479> what<00:01:35.720> with

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
the offense so I think that's what with

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.719 
the offense so I think that's what with
those<00:01:36.439> nagging<00:01:36.920> ones<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.310> keep<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.610> out<00:01:37.700> of

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
those nagging ones that keep you out of

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.520 
those nagging ones that keep you out of
practice<00:01:37.939> that's<00:01:38.360> really<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.170> downfall<00:01:39.500> of

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
practice that's really the downfall of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.080 
practice that's really the downfall of
them<00:01:39.740> is<00:01:39.860> just<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.310> don't<00:01:40.460> get<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.700> reps<00:01:40.909> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
them is just you don't get the reps and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.240 
them is just you don't get the reps and
you<00:01:41.420> can't<00:01:41.630> really<00:01:41.840> feel<00:01:42.020> comfortable<00:01:42.250> you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
you can't really feel comfortable you

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.130 
you can't really feel comfortable you

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
really hurt so it's important to be

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.420

went to the sambal against Northwestern

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.679 
went to the sambal against Northwestern
I<00:06:52.699> believe<00:06:52.939> drew<00:06:53.149> Austin<00:06:53.360> threw<00:06:53.509> three

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:53.689 
I believe drew Austin threw three

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.209 
I believe drew Austin threw three
interceptions<00:06:53.809> in<00:06:54.229> the<00:06:54.319> first<00:06:54.499> quarter<00:06:54.740> he

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:55.219 
interceptions in the first quarter he

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:56.350 
interceptions in the first quarter he
had<00:06:55.339> thrown<00:06:55.490> three<00:06:55.759> all<00:06:55.909> year<00:06:55.939> before<00:06:56.209> that

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
had thrown three all year before that

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.689 
had thrown three all year before that
and<00:06:56.619> he<00:06:57.619> just<00:06:57.740> had<00:06:57.829> a<00:06:57.860> smile<00:06:58.069> on<00:06:58.129> his<00:06:58.249> face<00:06:58.339> and

00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:58.699 
and he just had a smile on his face and

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.009 
and he just had a smile on his face and
I<00:06:58.879> knew<00:06:58.909> that<00:06:59.269> they<00:06:59.509> were<00:06:59.569> going<00:06:59.599> to<00:06:59.749> come<00:06:59.869> back

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:00.019 
I knew that they were going to come back

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.689 
I knew that they were going to come back
and<00:07:00.079> I<00:07:00.349> think<00:07:00.559> that's<00:07:00.919> the<00:07:00.979> demeanor<00:07:01.369> that<00:07:01.550> you

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
and I think that's the demeanor that you

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.279 
and I think that's the demeanor that you
have<00:07:01.819> to<00:07:01.939> have<00:07:02.089> as<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.329> quarterback<00:07:02.689> is<00:07:02.930> just<00:07:03.110> to
