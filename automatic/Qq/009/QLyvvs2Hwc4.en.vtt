that<00:05:55.120> answers<00:05:55.180> questions<00:05:56.849> like<00:05:57.849> I<00:05:57.940> said<00:05:58.000> I

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
that answers questions like I said I

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.309 
that answers questions like I said I
know<00:05:58.300> it<00:05:58.479> looked<00:05:58.629> a<00:05:58.750> little<00:05:58.870> funny<00:05:59.080> because<00:05:59.199> I

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
know it looked a little funny because I

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.529 
know it looked a little funny because I
made<00:05:59.530> my<00:05:59.680> own<00:05:59.710> base<00:06:00.069> but<00:06:00.580> I<00:06:00.759> made<00:06:01.090> my<00:06:01.240> own<00:06:01.270> base

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
made my own base but I made my own base

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:02.790 
made my own base but I made my own base
because<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.050> other<00:06:02.169> base<00:06:02.379> would<00:06:02.590> have<00:06:02.620> been

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
because the other base would have been

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.999 
because the other base would have been
far<00:06:03.250> too<00:06:03.460> small<00:06:03.669> so<00:06:04.419> that's<00:06:04.840> that<00:06:05.080> alright<00:06:05.979> I

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
far too small so that's that alright I

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.860 
far too small so that's that alright I
think<00:06:06.129> that<00:06:06.460> about<00:06:06.490> covers<00:06:06.669> it<00:06:07.060> at<00:06:07.330> off<00:06:07.810> the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
think that about covers it at off the

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.180 
think that about covers it at off the
top<00:06:08.199> of<00:06:08.229> my<00:06:08.319> head<00:06:08.440> I<00:06:08.500> can't<00:06:08.770> think<00:06:08.860> of<00:06:08.979> anything

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
