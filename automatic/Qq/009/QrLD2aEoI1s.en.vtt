this<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.139> causes<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.590> projects

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
this is one of the causes of projects

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.919 
this is one of the causes of projects
I've<00:00:11.010> seen<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.849> analysis<00:00:12.210> back<00:00:12.389> at<00:00:12.420> CES

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
I've seen here the analysis back at CES

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.600 
I've seen here the analysis back at CES
I<00:00:13.170> figure<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> first<00:00:14.040> time<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.400> get

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
I figure it's the first time you get

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490 
I figure it's the first time you get
hands<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.839> effective<00:00:16.320> where<00:00:16.410> it

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
hands on with it and effective where it

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.160 
hands on with it and effective where it
is<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.800> think<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.520> like<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> Fitbit<00:00:18.020> like<00:00:19.020> one

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
is is think of like the Fitbit like one

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.870 
is is think of like the Fitbit like one
of<00:00:19.199> those<00:00:19.350> ideas<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.490> more<00:00:20.640> than<00:00:20.820> that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
of those ideas but it is more than that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.939 
of those ideas but it is more than that
you<00:00:21.150> can<00:00:21.240> actually<00:00:21.330> interact<00:00:22.080> with<00:00:22.350> emails

mistake<00:01:19.590> ol<00:01:20.340> idea<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.470> say<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
mistake ol idea and I'm going to say I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.170 
mistake ol idea and I'm going to say I
like<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> whole<00:01:23.189> Sony<00:01:23.520> design<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
like the whole Sony design out the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.789 
like the whole Sony design out the
elements<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:25.290> probably<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.619> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
elements with it can probably see that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.359 
elements with it can probably see that
there<00:01:26.119> again<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.330> looks<00:01:27.600> pretty<00:01:27.930> cool

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
there again it just looks pretty cool

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.380 
there again it just looks pretty cool
