these sweaters are put together and then

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.610 
these sweaters are put together and then
what<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.399> tweak<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.940> fit<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.989> how

what you need to tweak to fit you so how

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.619 
what you need to tweak to fit you so how
does<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.770> begin<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.910> first<00:00:39.120> chapter<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
does it begin so the first chapter is

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
does it begin so the first chapter is
about<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> drop<00:00:40.469> shoulder<00:00:40.710> construction

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
about the drop shoulder construction

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
about the drop shoulder construction
which<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.510> sweater<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.899> I'm<00:00:43.020> wearing

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
which is the sweater that I'm wearing

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.060 
which is the sweater that I'm wearing
and<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:45.239> key<00:00:45.930> element<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> drop<00:00:46.829> shoulder

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and the key element of a drop shoulder

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.250 
and the key element of a drop shoulder
is<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> armhole<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:48.600> shaped<00:00:48.960> it's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is that the armhole is not shaped it's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.959 
is that the armhole is not shaped it's
straight<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.829> top<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.129> bottom<00:00:50.309> let's<00:00:50.820> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
straight from top to bottom let's just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.970 
straight from top to bottom let's just
make<00:00:51.090> sure<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.210> everybody<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.860> it's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
make sure that everybody can see so it's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.500 
make sure that everybody can see so it's
literally<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.399> straight<00:00:53.760> line<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
literally a straight line just kind of a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
literally a straight line just kind of a
square<00:00:54.750> that's<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.949> shoulder<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
square that's right so the shoulder is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.220 
square that's right so the shoulder is
fairly<00:00:56.640> wide<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:57.719> why<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:57.989> called<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
fairly wide and that's why it's called a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
fairly wide and that's why it's called a
drop<00:00:58.469> shoulder<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.340> falls<00:00:59.579> over<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
drop shoulder because it falls over the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.700 
drop shoulder because it falls over the
line<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:00.629> drops<00:01:01.079> down<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.559> what's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
line it actually drops down on what's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.700 
line it actually drops down on what's
right<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.510> what<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:03.870> what<00:01:04.140> kind<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.500> yarn

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
right so what is then what kind of yarn

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.020 
right so what is then what kind of yarn
knitting<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.640> looks<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
knitting is for this it looks like it

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.399 
knitting is for this it looks like it
has<00:01:06.119> pretty<00:01:06.299> good<00:01:06.360> drape<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.080> sweater

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
has pretty good drape for this sweater

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.200 
has pretty good drape for this sweater
it<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> worsted<00:01:08.220> weight<00:01:08.369> wool<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.000> thing

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it was a worsted weight wool this thing

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.230 
it was a worsted weight wool this thing
I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.580> fairly<00:01:11.820> warm

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I think it's here so it's a fairly warm

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200 
I think it's here so it's a fairly warm
sweater<00:01:13.010> but<00:01:14.010> quick<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> knit<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.760> size<00:01:14.970> eight

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
sweater but quick to knit on size eight

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.050 
sweater but quick to knit on size eight
needles<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.530> fairly<00:01:16.830> drapey<00:01:17.250> gauge<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
needles and a fairly drapey gauge and I

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.730 
needles and a fairly drapey gauge and I
think<00:01:18.330> tell<00:01:18.840> us<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> sweater<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.619> your

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
think tell us about the sweater to your

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.859 
think tell us about the sweater to your
left<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.729> also<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.420> drop<00:01:21.659> shoulder

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
left so this is also a drop shoulder

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.859 
left so this is also a drop shoulder
sweater<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.830> much<00:01:23.070> more<00:01:23.250> fitted<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.659> has<00:01:24.750> an

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
sweater it's much more fitted it has an

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.370 
sweater it's much more fitted it has an
a-line<00:01:25.229> shape<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.310> accommodate<00:01:26.820> hips<00:01:27.380> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
a-line shape in to accommodate hips and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
a-line shape in to accommodate hips and
it's<00:01:28.680> worked<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.040> an<00:01:29.159> all-over<00:01:29.340> fair<00:01:29.880> isle

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it's worked in an all-over fair isle

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.420 
it's worked in an all-over fair isle
pattern<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> shoulder<00:01:31.350> does<00:01:31.680> still<00:01:32.130> have

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
pattern but the shoulder does still have

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.940 
pattern but the shoulder does still have
that<00:01:32.820> kind<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.240> square<00:01:33.659> silhouette<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.770> that's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
that kind of square silhouette so that's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.560 
that kind of square silhouette so that's
right<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.700> still<00:01:35.909> has<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> fairly<00:01:36.450> wide

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
right so that it still has a fairly wide

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.160 
right so that it still has a fairly wide
shoulder<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> fairly<00:01:38.159> large<00:01:38.610> upper<00:01:39.060> sleeve

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
shoulder and a fairly large upper sleeve

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.530 
shoulder and a fairly large upper sleeve
as<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.530> result<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> little<00:01:42.390> bit

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
as a result of that this is a little bit

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.570 
as a result of that this is a little bit
of<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.750> thinner<00:01:43.049> fabric<00:01:43.740> though<00:01:44.009> tell<00:01:44.310> us<00:01:44.430> about

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
of a thinner fabric though tell us about

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.030 
of a thinner fabric though tell us about
the<00:01:44.790> yarn<00:01:45.270> choice<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.979> is

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the yarn choice for this one and this is

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
the yarn choice for this one and this is
worked<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.460> sport<00:01:47.790> weight<00:01:47.939> wool<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
worked in a sport weight wool so that it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
worked in a sport weight wool so that it
is<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.860> finer<00:01:50.130> gauge<00:01:50.430> than<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.420> garment<00:01:51.930> but

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
is a finer gauge than this garment but

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.139 
is a finer gauge than this garment but
it's<00:01:52.320> working<00:01:52.619> stranded<00:01:53.070> fair<00:01:53.310> isle<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it's working stranded fair isle so you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.539 
it's working stranded fair isle so you
still<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> pretty<00:01:55.320> substantial<00:01:55.590> fabric

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
still get a pretty substantial fabric

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
still get a pretty substantial fabric
because<00:01:56.970> your<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.509> floats<00:01:57.840> are<00:01:58.049> doubling

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
because your your floats are doubling

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.950 
because your your floats are doubling
with<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:58.890> right<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.450> look<00:02:00.780> for

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
with that that's right so and I look for

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
with that that's right so and I look for
yarns<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> great<00:02:01.890> color<00:02:02.159> range<00:02:02.430> when

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
yarns with a great color range when

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.120 
yarns with a great color range when
you're<00:02:02.820> doing<00:02:03.140> well<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.890> great

please so walk us through the next of
the<00:02:09.330> rest<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> book<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.370> next<00:02:11.580> chapter

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the rest of the book so the next chapter

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.660 
the rest of the book so the next chapter
goes<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.420> set<00:02:12.600> in<00:02:12.720> sleeves<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> set

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
goes in to set in sleeves and in the set

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.340 
goes in to set in sleeves and in the set
in<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.269> opposite<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.930> drop<00:02:16.140> shoulder

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
in is the opposite of a drop shoulder

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.180 
in is the opposite of a drop shoulder
you<00:02:16.739> can<00:02:16.890> see<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> armhole<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.299> shaped

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
you can see that the armhole is shaped

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.610 
you can see that the armhole is shaped
and<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.340> creates<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.870> angled<00:02:22.350> line

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
and it creates this this angled line

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 
and it creates this this angled line
here<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.239> shoulder<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.630> much

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
here so that the shoulder is much

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.080 
here so that the shoulder is much
narrower<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.500> fits<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:26.040> sort<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.970> much<00:02:27.060> more

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
narrower and fits you sort of much more

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.199 
narrower and fits you sort of much more
refined<00:02:27.569> way<00:02:27.750> right<00:02:28.580> but<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.030> will

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
refined way right but this one that will

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.600 
refined way right but this one that will
require<00:02:30.480> seams<00:02:30.930> right<00:02:31.260> does<00:02:31.950> require<00:02:32.190> scenes

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
require seams right does require scenes

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.440 
require seams right does require scenes
yes<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.840> one<00:02:34.019> doesn't<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:35.130> one

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
yes so but this one doesn't this one

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.330 
yes so but this one doesn't this one
does<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.780> sides<00:02:37.049> because<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:38.010> also

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
does on the sides because it's also

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.830 
does on the sides because it's also
worked<00:02:38.549> in<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.790> singles<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.750> always

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
first round has a really large

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.729 
first round has a really large
circumference<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.019> then<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.200> narrow<00:03:40.530> as

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.009 
you're working right yeah this is great
and<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> think<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.510> should<00:03:42.629> point<00:03:42.750> out<00:03:42.900> to

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
and I think that we should point out to

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.360 
and I think that we should point out to
everybody<00:03:43.200> these<00:03:43.590> are<00:03:43.739> like<00:03:43.889> template

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
everybody these are like template

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.089 
everybody these are like template

a very basic sweater in the construction

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.599 
a very basic sweater in the construction
style<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.590> can<00:03:49.829> see<00:03:50.010> what<00:03:50.129> it<00:03:50.220> looks<00:03:50.430> like
