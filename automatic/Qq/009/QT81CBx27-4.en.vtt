00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
two monitors I have on the left is the

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:17.180 
two monitors I have on the left is the
Asus<00:00:11.900> 23.6<00:00:12.900> inch<00:00:13.309> LED<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.389> VN<00:00:15.900> -<00:00:16.379> 47<00:00:17.039> H

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
Asus 23.6 inch LED it's the VN - 47 H

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.189 
Asus 23.6 inch LED it's the VN - 47 H
model<00:00:18.650> I<00:00:20.960> picked<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.050> up<00:00:22.260> at<00:00:22.410> Fry's<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:23.070> 189

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
model I picked this up at Fry's for 189

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.140 
model I picked this up at Fry's for 189
and<00:00:25.199> then<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> right<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> have<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and then on the right here I have the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.840 
and then on the right here I have the
Dell<00:00:27.840> s<00:00:28.910> 24<00:00:29.910> 40<00:00:30.330> l<00:00:30.949> also<00:00:32.120> led<00:00:33.120> 1080<00:00:33.630> P<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:35.640> one

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
Dell s 24 40 l also led 1080 P this one

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.920 
Dell s 24 40 l also led 1080 P this one
is<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> 24<00:00:36.540> inch<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.739> 23<00:00:38.399> inch<00:00:38.930> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
is a 24 inch that one is a 23 inch so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.160 
is a 24 inch that one is a 23 inch so
right<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> bat<00:00:41.300> major<00:00:42.300> differences<00:00:42.930> here

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
right off the bat major differences here

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.740 
right off the bat major differences here
is<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.530> course<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.399> Dells<00:00:44.640> got<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> glass

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
is of course the Dells got the glass

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.080 
is of course the Dells got the glass
finish<00:00:47.480> reminds<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> lot<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.280> like<00:00:50.280> an<00:00:50.700> apple

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
finish reminds me a lot of like an apple

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.959 
finish reminds me a lot of like an apple
desktop<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> that's<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.760> nice

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
desktop so that's that's a really nice

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.590 
desktop so that's that's a really nice
feature

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
feature

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
feature
the<00:00:55.530> Asus<00:00:56.360> is<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> matte<00:00:58.079> finish<00:00:58.670> major

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the Asus is more of a matte finish major

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.330 
the Asus is more of a matte finish major
difference<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.989> border<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:02.100> very

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
difference on here is the border is very

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.870 
difference on here is the border is very
thin<00:01:03.140> compared<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
thin compared to what you see on the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.830 
thin compared to what you see on the
Dell<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.600> you've<00:01:06.750> got<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.080> thick<00:01:07.799> black

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
Dell so you've got this thick black

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.010 
Dell so you've got this thick black
border<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.220> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.520> Asus<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> smaller

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
border and on the Asus you get a smaller

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.520 
border and on the Asus you get a smaller
one<00:01:14.119> lengthwise<00:01:15.119> they're<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> same

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
one lengthwise they're actually the same

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.450 
one lengthwise they're actually the same
length<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.170> tell<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
length but you can tell here the the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.830 
length but you can tell here the the
Dell<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.860> taller<00:01:23.479> compared<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
Dell is a bit taller compared when you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.219 
Dell is a bit taller compared when you
put<00:01:25.259> them<00:01:25.350> side-by-side<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> aside<00:01:28.049> from<00:01:28.110> that

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
put them side-by-side so aside from that

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.590 
put them side-by-side so aside from that
they<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.310> distinct<00:01:32.850> different<00:01:33.420> feels

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
they have very distinct different feels

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.830 
they have very distinct different feels
again<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.500> Adele<00:01:35.369> has<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> Glosser<00:01:36.509> feel

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
again that Adele has got a Glosser feel

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.749 
again that Adele has got a Glosser feel
to<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.460> ACS<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:40.100> more<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> matte<00:01:41.400> finish

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to it the ACS is more of a matte finish

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.350 
to it the ACS is more of a matte finish
so<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.920> DAO<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> real<00:01:45.180> high

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so on the the DAO there's a real high

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.660 
so on the the DAO there's a real high
reflection<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.290> see<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:46.829> much<00:01:46.979> day

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
reflection you can see pretty much day

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.139 
reflection you can see pretty much day
or<00:01:47.850> night<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.460> bit<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.729> light<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
or night just a little bit of light and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.359 
or night just a little bit of light and
you'll<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> reflection<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:53.100> clearly

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you'll get a reflection so I can clearly

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.020 
you'll get a reflection so I can clearly
see<00:01:53.549> my<00:01:53.729> TV<00:01:54.619> in<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.740> living<00:01:56.009> room<00:01:56.159> from<00:01:56.579> where

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
see my TV in a living room from where

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.160 
see my TV in a living room from where
we're<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.070> Asus<00:01:59.640> there's<00:01:59.969> no

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
we're at and then on the Asus there's no

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.280 
we're at and then on the Asus there's no
there's<00:02:01.170> no<00:02:01.350> reflection<00:02:01.740> surface<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.549> all<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
there's no reflection surface at all so

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.780 
there's no reflection surface at all so
this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> great<00:02:04.799> monitor<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.549> you're

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
this is a great monitor if you're

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.789 
this is a great monitor if you're
playing<00:02:06.210> video<00:02:06.329> games<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.960> daytime<00:02:07.500> or

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
playing video games in the daytime or

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.279 
playing video games in the daytime or
you're<00:02:07.950> by<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> window<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.840> don't<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
you're by a window you don't have to

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.240 
you're by a window you don't have to
worry<00:02:10.440> about<00:02:10.590> getting

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
worry about getting

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.680 
worry about getting
a reflective<00:02:12.200> surface<00:02:13.400> images<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.600> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
a reflective surface images but on the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.000 
a reflective surface images but on the
Dow<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.930> might<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.440> consider<00:02:16.740> where

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
Dow you might want to consider where

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.190 
Dow you might want to consider where
you're<00:02:17.160> going<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.400> position<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:17.940> because

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you're going to position that because

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.630 
you're going to position that because
any<00:02:19.200> light<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.560> hits<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.520> be

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
any light that hits it is going to be

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.580 
any light that hits it is going to be
you<00:02:21.210> know<00:02:21.330> adding<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:21.960> reflection<00:02:24.590> aside

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
you know adding to that reflection aside

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.570 
you know adding to that reflection aside
from<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:27.000> del<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.980> adjust<00:02:29.310> these

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
from that the del you can adjust these

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.110 
from that the del you can adjust these
settings<00:02:29.850> with<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.300> touch<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:31.459> this<00:02:32.459> actual

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
settings with the touch on this actual

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.040

glass<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> screen<00:02:34.340> which<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.520> really<00:02:35.640> cool

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
glass on the screen which is really cool

clawed<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.320> really<00:03:34.709> don't<00:03:34.860> know<00:03:34.920> how<00:03:35.010> to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
clawed I really don't know how to

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.500 
clawed I really don't know how to
explain<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.519> just<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.730> much<00:03:35.880> more<00:03:35.910> glossary

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
explain it's just a much more glossary

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.400 
explain it's just a much more glossary
feel<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.920> on<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.370> left<00:03:38.580> is<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:40.290> know

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
feel to it and on the left is you know

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.860 
feel to it and on the left is you know
no<00:03:40.620> no<00:03:40.980> gloss<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.880> looks<00:03:42.150> great<00:03:42.510> on<00:03:42.570> there

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
no no gloss but it looks great on there

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:51.449 
no no gloss but it looks great on there
too<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.470> that's

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
too so that's

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.190 
too so that's
that's<00:03:52.150> pretty<00:03:52.390> much<00:03:52.510> if<00:03:52.719> you<00:03:52.930> know

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
that's pretty much if you know

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.920 
that's pretty much if you know
graphically<00:03:54.209> they're<00:03:55.209> both<00:03:55.390> very<00:03:55.599> appealing

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
graphically they're both very appealing

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.720 
graphically they're both very appealing
and<00:03:56.439> it<00:03:56.650> just<00:03:56.829> depends<00:03:57.159> on<00:03:57.280> your<00:03:57.340> preference

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730
