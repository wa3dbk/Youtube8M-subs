00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
on the first hand because everybody's in

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and you know here's a perfect scenario

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.810 
and you know here's a perfect scenario
with<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.560> can't<00:01:28.799> fold<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
with that you really can't fold the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.289 
with that you really can't fold the
first<00:01:30.060> hand<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.900> sometimes<00:01:31.549> it's<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
first hand so sometimes it's you know a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.819 
first hand so sometimes it's you know a
little<00:01:33.600> tough<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.200> everyone<00:01:34.560> really

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
little tough now that everyone really

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.960 
little tough now that everyone really
knows<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.009> strategy<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.360> are<00:01:36.509> with

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
knows that strategy so here we are with

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.069 
knows that strategy so here we are with
six<00:01:38.970> players<00:01:39.270> seeing<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.900> flop<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:41.869> miss<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
six players seeing the flop and miss the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.190 
six players seeing the flop and miss the
flop<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.619> we<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:47.030> an<00:01:48.030> opportunity<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.869> go

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
flop but we do have an opportunity to go

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.800 
flop but we do have an opportunity to go
runner<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> flush<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
runner on it for a flush and it's the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.530 
runner on it for a flush and it's the
nut<00:01:51.960> flush<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:53.430> may<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.299> stay

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
nut flush so we may have to stay

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.370 
nut flush so we may have to stay
depending<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.200> much<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> bad<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:57.380> it's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
depending on how much is bad here it's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.740 
depending on how much is bad here it's
less<00:01:58.649> than<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.640> third<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.299> our<00:02:00.450> stack

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
less than you know a third of our stack

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.740 
less than you know a third of our stack
and<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> stay<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.090> case<00:02:03.329> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and we have to stay and in this case it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.880 
and we have to stay and in this case it
is<00:02:03.780> so<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:06.290> with<00:02:07.290> all<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.469> money<00:02:07.770> out

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
is so you know with all that money out

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.410 
is so you know with all that money out
there<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.640> have<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.970> stay

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
there we really have to stay

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
there we really have to stay
it's<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> put<00:02:09.929> us<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.220> tough<00:02:11.400> position

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
it's going to put us in a tough position

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.089 
it's going to put us in a tough position
but<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.240> calculated<00:02:12.569> risk<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.380> it's

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
but it's a calculated risk and it's

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.830 
but it's a calculated risk and it's
tough<00:02:14.280> because<00:02:14.489> we're<00:02:15.120> both<00:02:15.300> in<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.599> first

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
tough because we're both in the first

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.380 
tough because we're both in the first
hand<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.349> we<00:02:16.790> don't<00:02:17.790> really<00:02:17.849> know<00:02:18.060> which<00:02:18.209> one

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
hand so we don't really know which one

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.680 
hand so we don't really know which one
of<00:02:18.420> us<00:02:18.540> not<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.930> rewarded<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:19.709> we<00:02:19.800> go<00:02:20.690> got

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
of us not get rewarded so here we go got

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.309 
of us not get rewarded so here we go got
the<00:02:22.819> next<00:02:23.819> diamond<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> turn<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:25.140> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
he's all-in and since I had the flush

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.430 
he's all-in and since I had the flush
draw<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:29.100> have<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.730> call<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.319> are
