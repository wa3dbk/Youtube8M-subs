00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
to get great milk texture I get asked a

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.269 
to get great milk texture I get asked a
lot<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.289> questions<00:00:25.619> too<00:00:25.800> about<00:00:26.010> the

lot of questions too about the
differences<00:00:26.699> between<00:00:26.760> skim<00:00:27.480> full<00:00:28.140> cream<00:00:28.500> soy

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
differences between skim full cream soy

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.999 
differences between skim full cream soy
full<00:00:30.449> cream<00:00:30.689> milk<00:00:30.720> will<00:00:31.050> always<00:00:31.500> texture<00:00:31.890> the

integrated<00:00:34.410> silky<00:00:34.800> result<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.340> great

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
integrated silky result with great

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.000 
integrated silky result with great
microphone<00:00:36.200> skim<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> little<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.770> tricky

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
microphone skim is a little more tricky

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
microphone skim is a little more tricky
you<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> work<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.270> quite<00:00:39.450> quickly

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
you have to work with it quite quickly

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.049 
you have to work with it quite quickly
because<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.890> separate<00:00:41.430> very<00:00:41.790> quickly

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
because it can separate very quickly

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.389 
because it can separate very quickly
between<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:43.170> head<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> milk<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
between the head of the milk and the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.889 
between the head of the milk and the
body<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> milk<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> key<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.719> work

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
body of the milk so the key is to work

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
body of the milk so the key is to work
quickly<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.860> you're<00:00:47.010> using<00:00:47.250> soy<00:00:47.700> just

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
quickly if you're using soy just

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
quickly if you're using soy just
experiment<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> brands<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> soy

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
experiment with the brands of soy

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.319 
experiment with the brands of soy
because<00:00:50.430> you'll<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:50.700> very<00:00:51.090> different

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
because you'll get very different

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
because you'll get very different
results<00:00:51.780> across<00:00:52.020> brands<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.250> find<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
results across brands so just find the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490 
results across brands so just find the
one<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.969> works<00:00:54.090> best<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.379> I'm<00:00:55.469> just

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
one that works best for you so I'm just

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
one that works best for you so I'm just

going to tip our milk straight into our

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.650 
going to tip our milk straight into our
pitcher<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.789> size<00:01:00.059> coffee<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> I'm

making here I filled our pitcher up just
to<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.359> bottom<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> V<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.409> always<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
to the bottom of the V that's always a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.250 
to the bottom of the V that's always a
pretty<00:01:05.250> good<00:01:05.460> place<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.729> start<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.540> next

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
pretty good place to start the next

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.630 
pretty good place to start the next
thing<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.500> need<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.130> need<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.340> purge

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
thing we need to do is we need to purge

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789 
thing we need to do is we need to purge
a<00:01:08.909> steam<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:10.140> water<00:01:10.439> will<00:01:10.710> have

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
a steam one because water will have

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
a steam one because water will have
condensed<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.090> steam<00:01:12.330> one's<00:01:12.600> cooled<00:01:12.960> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
condensed as the steam one's cooled so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.719 
condensed as the steam one's cooled so
we<00:01:13.320> want<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> expel<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.010> condensed<00:01:14.610> water

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
we want to expel that condensed water

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
we want to expel that condensed water
before<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.420> started<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.680> don't

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
before we get started because we don't

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.950 
before we get started because we don't
want<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.159> condensed<00:01:17.729> water<00:01:17.880> ending<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:18.869> in

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
want that condensed water ending up in

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.850 
want that condensed water ending up in
our<00:01:19.110> textured<00:01:19.560> milk<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> that's<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> purge<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
our textured milk so that's a purge the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
our textured milk so that's a purge the
next<00:01:23.100> thing<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.939> when<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> put

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the vortex of milk spinning put it

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
the vortex of milk spinning put it
straight<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.450> open<00:01:39.450> our<00:01:39.570> steam<00:01:39.840> wand<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.610> I'm

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
just going to pull back the jug to lever
this<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.570> tip<00:01:45.869> closer<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> surface<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this the tip closer to the surface of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
this the tip closer to the surface of
the<00:01:47.579> milk<00:01:47.759> you'll<00:01:48.570> hear<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.140> just

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the milk you'll hear that it's just

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
the milk you'll hear that it's just
hissing<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> top<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> milk<00:01:50.610> what

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
hissing on the top of the milk what

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.510 
hissing on the top of the milk what
that's<00:01:51.390> doing<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.140> creating<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> vortex

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that's doing is that's creating a vortex

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.639 
that's doing is that's creating a vortex
so<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.060> milk<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> spinning<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> circle<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
so the milk is spinning in a circle and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.060 
so the milk is spinning in a circle and
at<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> same<00:01:56.850> time<00:01:57.210> air<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.140> being<00:01:58.409> introduced

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
at the same time air is being introduced

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.069 
at the same time air is being introduced
in<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> milk<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.780> volumizing<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
in the milk and volumizing and

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
in the milk and volumizing and
introducing<00:02:01.680> those<00:02:01.829> tiny<00:02:02.189> microphone

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
introducing those tiny microphone

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.749 
introducing those tiny microphone
bubbles<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.829> also<00:02:04.829> heating<00:02:05.250> our<00:02:05.369> milk<00:02:05.610> as

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
bubbles and also heating our milk as

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.730 
bubbles and also heating our milk as
well<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.600> keep<00:02:06.869> my<00:02:07.020> hand<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.500> side<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
well so I keep my hand on the side of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.619 
well so I keep my hand on the side of
the<00:02:07.920> jokes<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.580> judge<00:02:08.759> temperature<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the jokes I can judge temperature and

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.360 
the jokes I can judge temperature and
when<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> jugs<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.739> almost<00:02:10.920> at<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.190> right

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
when the jugs are almost at the right

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.280 
when the jugs are almost at the right
temperature<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.120> just

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
temperature I just

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.559 
temperature I just
stood<00:02:13.469> up<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.189> the<00:02:14.310> steam<00:02:14.579> one<00:02:14.790> goes<00:02:15.030> under<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
stood up so the steam one goes under the

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.020 
stood up so the steam one goes under the
surface<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.079> milk<00:02:16.319> at<00:02:17.280> temperature<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
surface of the milk at temperature I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.780 
surface of the milk at temperature I
immediately<00:02:18.269> shut<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> off<00:02:19.159> lift<00:02:20.159> up<00:02:20.340> our<00:02:20.519> jug

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
immediately shut it off lift up our jug

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.780 
immediately shut it off lift up our jug
pull<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.599> jug<00:02:21.810> down<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.829> then<00:02:23.400> I'll<00:02:23.519> wipe<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
pull the jug down and then I'll wipe the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.360 
pull the jug down and then I'll wipe the
steam<00:02:24.180> tip<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.629> damp<00:02:24.900> cloth<00:02:25.069> push<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.219> back

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
steam tip with a damp cloth push it back

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.580 
steam tip with a damp cloth push it back
into<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.700> drip<00:02:26.909> trace<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.450> purge<00:02:28.049> any<00:02:28.349> milk

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
into the drip trace and purge any milk

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.099 
into the drip trace and purge any milk
that'll<00:02:29.400> stop<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.269> tip<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> steam

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
that'll stop the the tip in the steam

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.500 
that'll stop the the tip in the steam
one<00:02:31.319> becoming<00:02:31.680> blocked<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:33.239> milk

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
one becoming blocked with with milk

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.720 
one becoming blocked with with milk
solids<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.019> I've<00:02:34.109> just<00:02:34.319> textured<00:02:34.799> now<00:02:35.579> I'm

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
solids that I've just textured now I'm

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.399 
solids that I've just textured now I'm
what<00:02:35.879> I'm<00:02:36.030> going<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.269> do<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.689> tap<00:02:37.140> down

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
what I'm going to do is just tap down

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.330 
what I'm going to do is just tap down
gently<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:38.250> collapse<00:02:38.609> any<00:02:38.819> large<00:02:39.060> bubbles

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
gently to collapse any large bubbles

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.830 
gently to collapse any large bubbles
swirl<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> jug<00:02:41.730> quite<00:02:42.030> vigorously<00:02:42.629> to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
swirl a jug quite vigorously to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.580 
swirl a jug quite vigorously to
integrate<00:02:43.290> our<00:02:43.319> foam<00:02:44.900> grab<00:02:45.900> our<00:02:46.079> espresso

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
integrate our foam grab our espresso

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.830 
integrate our foam grab our espresso
shot<00:02:46.859> and<00:02:47.099> now<00:02:48.030> I'm<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.269> going<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.450> bring<00:02:48.689> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
shot and now I'm just going to bring the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.670 
shot and now I'm just going to bring the
two<00:02:49.049> together<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:51.200> integrating<00:02:52.200> our<00:02:52.349> espresso

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
two together so integrating our espresso

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.339 
two together so integrating our espresso
and<00:02:53.069> our<00:02:53.189> milk<00:02:53.400> together<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:54.090> then<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:55.139> tip

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
and our milk together and then just tip

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.089 
and our milk together and then just tip
quite<00:02:55.620> closely

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.160 

and<00:03:01.400> then<00:03:01.760> we<00:03:01.849> have<00:03:02.030> perfectly<00:03:02.540> textured<00:03:03.019> milk

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
and then we have perfectly textured milk

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.080 
and then we have perfectly textured milk
really<00:03:03.739> really<00:03:04.010> simple<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:04.640> follow<00:03:04.700> those

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
really really simple just follow those

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.719 
really really simple just follow those
few<00:03:05.420> key<00:03:05.689> things
