00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.070
 it was a first one because we met 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.170
 three years or so because we started to 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.170
 go to the same class and be saved 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.770
 it comes out a lot in the see if you have science 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.230
 but thanks to the university 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.710
 we met at the university the first 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.710
 day we arrived 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.969
 yes 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.270
 these girls 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.500
 for the national b 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.520
 I think it was a little like all 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.780
 here what we started without class and 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.080
 after 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.810
 or how we are all from outside and little to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.430
 little was created a friendship that I 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.430
 I think life could forget 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.690
 I something that I will not forget 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.340
 and so a step forward in life 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.890
 stage of my life to go leave a 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.990
 village of 600 inhabitants and get me 1 700 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.270
 regrets having come here then 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.420
 you meet people and you see things that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.710
 same here worth a stage one 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 very important stage of our life 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.230
 maybe he has taken advantage of the time 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:50.630
 No, nothing 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.630
 for good or bad brand 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.310
 one more year 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.040
 simply the best in which there 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.030
 many things that we wanted to do unique 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.039
 I would change 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.080
 I do not know if there will be that either 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.280
 we'll see 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.280
 Good Morning 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.900
 they are special people people who did not think 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.900
 that I would never find 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.700
 me to my people 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.430
 my family is here and my family is 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.560
 I took me a good experience again 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.440
 life experience recognize 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.920
 discover people who mark a before 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.600
 and one after in helping the people more 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.880
 that nothing a great family 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.210
 has been formed little by little but that has 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.520
 made great bigger with time as 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.520
 great that are those of your present 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.550
 Well, that, especially apart from 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.780
 career let's go 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.780
 many many friendships 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.409
 family memories something unrepeatable my 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.409
 family is freedom 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.580
 independence love me ready 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.080
 before what is not 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.360
 that are encouraged as a team 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.989
 take advantage 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.440
 It is very interesting 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.670
 especially 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.540
 what happens very quickly that is tired 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.490
 because it's a very nice race if you 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.070
 like to go 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:06.660
 let's learn a lot of theater 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.660
 we would take advantage of things 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.210
 take advantage of 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.790
 there is always a smile and always always 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.770
 because it's better to say I did it and not 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.770
 regret not having done it
