00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hello everyone and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 are you these master jai pets that 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.190
 they are called sic if you are and buy 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.130
 only these two because they were the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.109
 what I liked most and some others 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.340
 are more droplets cost a little more 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.289
 expensive are you little packets are simple this 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 they cost seven dollars each and I think 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.130
 that those who have a little bit more 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.230
 accessories cost more 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.859
 I think they cost around 13 dollars 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.920
 I'm not really sure he's buying this 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.050
 the mascotita of crack and borja and is called 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.500
 exchangeable is a pair of your bat 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.690
 I also bought the ducky from Robert Casey 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.079
 and it's called capten plan and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.820
 these pets you can write them a 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.550
 little secret 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 and hide it and supposedly help you 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.710
 hide your secrets and I buy them 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.260
 to use them to hide some 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.989
 secret or something like that but because I 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.700
 they really liked the figurines and I think 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.520
 that it would be fun to have the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.680
 figurines in my room as decoration 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.470
 next to my master jai dolls 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.320
 good you have to open them up well let's 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.619
 start with the suit mascotita a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.619
 place 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.620
 how nice 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:32.710
 here is a what you would call a pen 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.710
 to write and more apart 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.060
 here is the bat 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.170
 from aviles 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.520
 and you are 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.520
 very pretty 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.750
 and I think somehow water 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.650
 this is a lamp is a rain bike 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.650
 and is 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.270
 feather writes and will not write not 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.450
 will see what he writes at least that 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.570
 use the bat or the toy and 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.110
 you put the light on and that's what will come out 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.300
 you wrote in your good paper here they are 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.610
 the papers come 6 pieces of paper for 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.440
 that you write with a good message in the 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.900
 I'm going to use the pen to 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.990
 write a message now I will occupy 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.070
 the bat and I'm going to press the 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.610
 so we can see the message and not 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.610
 I put it like that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.740
 if you can see it a little truth 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.740
 yes hey 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.980
 okay 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.980
 Well, now we have to open the duckling 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:59.370
 ok then after I already wrote your 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.370
 you will save it in this duckling 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.280
 so that nobody finds your message 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.580
 and I think here here has more pieces of paper 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.590
 of those who came with 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.690
 this with the aircraft brand with the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.960
 bat and no more the wings 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.540
 and the paper comes out I imagine you can 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.930
 shorten here have limits so that the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.930
 cuts 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.940
 and you take a piece of paper from these good ones ok 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.290
 what you do is take the piece of paper what 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.210
 put here back of your backpack so you 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.010
 make sure that it is already well grasped 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.010
 then you make him walk 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.060
 and you 're going 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.520
 you are putting it and then it opens its 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.910
 pancita and there is hidden the 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.910
 message 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:09.790
 and that's how these figurines help 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.790
 save your messages and here is the other 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.520
 are many things are very curious to 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.280
 I liked them good as a collector 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.470
 from master jai I think it was very good 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.770
 that stained has made these figurines 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.140
 of monster high mosquitoes because 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.270
 if you just started this collection to 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.030
 the dolls of monster high this 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.950
 then you do not have the pets that 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.050
 originally they came out with the dolls 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.170
 when the dolls barely came out 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.510
 monster high then this is a whole 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.290
 opportunity to start collecting 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.480
 also the pets and those pets 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.910
 they are much larger than 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.030
 originals that came out with the dolls 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.669
 master jai the regular ones are like 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.490
 this size and these are much more 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.580
 large and have other accessories that 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.160
 they make them funnier and more curious 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.210
