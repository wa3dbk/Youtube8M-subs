00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
the foods that she may have been putting

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.049 
the foods that she may have been putting
in<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.320> juice<00:00:57.530> or<00:00:57.829> eating<00:00:58.280> in<00:00:58.370> general<00:00:58.699> so

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
in the juice or eating in general so

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.430 
in the juice or eating in general so
maybe<00:00:59.239> like<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.480> food<00:00:59.719> sensitivities

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
maybe like a food sensitivities

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.759 
maybe like a food sensitivities
everything<00:01:01.239> so<00:01:02.239> she<00:01:02.929> stopped<00:01:03.170> juicy<00:01:03.559> went

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
everything so she stopped juicy went

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.350 
everything so she stopped juicy went
back<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.070> vicious<00:01:04.370> cycle<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.699> that<00:01:04.909> eating

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
back to a vicious cycle of that eating

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.970 
back to a vicious cycle of that eating
and<00:01:05.980> is<00:01:06.980> overweight<00:01:08.440> doesn't<00:01:09.440> work<00:01:09.800> out

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
and is overweight doesn't work out

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.470 
and is overweight doesn't work out
because<00:01:10.190> of<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.520> side<00:01:10.730> effects<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.120> bad<00:01:11.240> food

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
because of the side effects of bad food

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.330 
because of the side effects of bad food
so<00:01:11.660> do<00:01:11.870> you<00:01:11.930> think<00:01:11.960> bad<00:01:12.200> foods<00:01:12.560> does<00:01:12.950> not<00:01:13.130> feel

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
so do you think bad foods does not feel

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.580 
so do you think bad foods does not feel
good<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:13.820> as<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.570> result<00:01:14.780> is<00:01:15.050> not<00:01:15.200> working<00:01:15.530> out

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
good and as a result is not working out

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.500 
good and as a result is not working out
so<00:01:15.650> it's<00:01:15.860> kind<00:01:16.010> of<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.130> vicious<00:01:16.430> cycle<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.330> she

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
so it's kind of a vicious cycle so she

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.510 
so it's kind of a vicious cycle so she
understands<00:01:18.050> that<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.440> may<00:01:18.680> get<00:01:18.860> deeper

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
understands that this may get deeper

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.150 
understands that this may get deeper
rooted<00:01:19.820> issue<00:01:20.560> emotional<00:01:21.560> eating<00:01:21.680> whatnots

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160

rooted issue emotional eating whatnots
she<00:01:22.430> wants<00:01:22.610> know<00:01:22.700> how<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.880> break<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.180> cycle<00:01:24.760> so

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
she wants know how to break the cycle so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.890 
she wants know how to break the cycle so
she<00:01:25.970> wants<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.240> know<00:01:26.300> what<00:01:26.480> is<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.690> first

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
she wants to know what is the first

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.040 
she wants to know what is the first
thing<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.170> would<00:01:27.260> tell<00:01:27.680> someone<00:01:28.100> like<00:01:28.280> me<00:01:29.050> to

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
thing you would tell someone like me to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.160 
thing you would tell someone like me to
you<00:01:30.800> know<00:01:30.920> get<00:01:31.490> back<00:01:31.700> on<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.570> bandwagon<00:01:32.840> if

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
you know get back on the bandwagon if

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.280

you will what would either plan and so
forth<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:38.240> first<00:01:38.570> off<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.500> know<00:01:39.590> as

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
forth so the first off is you know as

forth so the first off is you know as
she<00:01:39.890> mentions<00:01:40.340> it<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.940> question<00:01:41.300> is

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
she mentions it and the question is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.540 
she mentions it and the question is
looking<00:01:42.290> at<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.500> potential<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.310> food

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
looking at the potential of food

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.550 
looking at the potential of food
sensitivities<00:01:44.180> it's<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.020> little<00:01:45.080> bit<00:01:45.290> tougher

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
sensitivities it's a little bit tougher

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.630 
sensitivities it's a little bit tougher
to<00:01:45.650> do<00:01:45.800> you<00:01:46.010> know<00:01:46.100> because<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.340> lot<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.550> people

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.370 
have to watch but the reason I do is
basically<00:06:45.910> because<00:06:46.420> we've<00:06:47.050> put<00:06:47.260> these

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
you overcome these problems so if this

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.170
