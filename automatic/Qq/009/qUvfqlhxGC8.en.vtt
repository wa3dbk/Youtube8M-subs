laid out it gets kind of annoying

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.999 
laid out it gets kind of annoying
because<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.820> always<00:02:03.000> accidentally<00:02:03.899> hit<00:02:04.079> G<00:02:04.740> 2

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
because you always accidentally hit G 2

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.330 
because you always accidentally hit G 2
instead<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.700> escape<00:02:06.290> but<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.920> takes<00:02:08.160> about

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
instead of escape but that takes about

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
instead of escape but that takes about
five<00:02:08.849> minutes<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.420> then<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.959> good<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.319> go

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
five minutes and then you are good to go

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.250 
five minutes and then you are good to go
and<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.069> will<00:02:11.160> float<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.610> boat<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:12.209> fine

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and that will float your boat just fine

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.649 
and that will float your boat just fine
so<00:02:13.640> everything<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.909> great<00:02:15.360> about<00:02:15.480> this

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
so everything is great about this

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.899 
so everything is great about this
