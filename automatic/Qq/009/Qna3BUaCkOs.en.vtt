00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.830
 then the kids to Spain ' 

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.959
 nutritionist this is to talk a 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.740
 little bit precisely on this topic 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:11.540
 after we ate so happy that 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.190
 we do or how we have to prepare 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.540
 for these days with students to 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.559
 accompany us with the duties to 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.289
 you on this special night 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.060
 when I'm most important about the idea 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.430
 you have to have a day that is 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.349
 what days like special days you have to 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.939
 eat what they have prepared there 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.920
 to enjoy those pleasures of eating 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.960
 but the normal days in our life 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.490
 common you have to control the calories and 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.140
 you have to eat as nutritious as possible 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.820
 to have a healthy life and avoid that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.860
 that we said of the calories of the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.750
 fat not for example today's dinner 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.570
 with how many hours of exercise we are going 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.790
 to go down is one thing that they are 500 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.770
 calories 600 calories those that burn 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.300
 in a workout and at a dinner like 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.340
 Can be four thousand and five market 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.170
 really when you put the drinks and 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.430
 etcetera but we do not have to worry about 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.110
 that night because this is a very night 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.940
 special what you need to be aware 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.500
 of the normal days of the days that 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.630
 we do our activities 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.550
 normal and here I have some examples 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.080
 of calories and caloric foods that are 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.190
 very healthy in all the people goes with the 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.340
 feint of what 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.900
 they really need to take care of themselves or measure themselves 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.850
 but it is very important to measure yourself even in 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.280
 healthy things like for example there I bring 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.230
 the grape oil the gm oil are 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.640
 very healthy oils there are people there 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.050
 I'm sure I'm taking the grape oil or 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.000
 some oil that are healthy 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.270
 really but the joke is that every 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 tablespoon of oil has 130 calories 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.260
 then with 4 teaspoons that one 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.390
 does so they go away immediately almost 500 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.340
 calories that is one hour of exercise and 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.020
 well, I see many things that 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.640
 normally in consumption for example I 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.000
 they love the almonds I love the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.950
 Nine is the avocado is an oil of 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.170
 jaén just like ahmed and when I would say 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.930
 because that's very little that's a 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.360
 little bit but it's one ounce a green ounce 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.010
 like 200 calories then this is the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.510
 joke that one can be bouncing 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.150
 almonds you say good I have something 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.490
 very healthy you eat several fists and now 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.580
 has 600 calories of pure almonds in 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.290
 a snack then 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.360
 and you just filled the snack 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.890
 lack trousers plus you have to have 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.630
 beware of this kind of theories of 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.190
 huaca of our latin people loves it 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.800
 the mouth terry I love the lawyer 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.840
 also in the mind but the joke is me 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.150
 I eat like it's an avocado completely 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.190
 all day in portions as of a 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.720
 avocado third if we open a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.670
 avocado is for the whole family this 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.560
 we share and in this way you are not 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.110
 eating avocados for food that 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.970
 be 500 67 escarole click here you 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.630
 I would be afraid for example the cookies 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.010
 I would not say I do not leave them there, kept in 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.410
 this case these are some cookies 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.790
 balances are nutritious and delicious that 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.920
 that's my motto the idea is to try 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.720
 eat healthy but nothing else eat healthy but 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.850
 with the rich because you have to enjoy the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.920
 life and these are very healthy but if 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.560
 we return to the same each each cookie 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.100
 It has 200 calories that is very rich 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.420
 not like three cookies are 600 calories 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.310
 as it is a cookie half biscuit is 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 Fabulous is something very good if you eat 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.500
 an ounce of nuts just does not work 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.160
 but to see the mountain as favorite 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.990
 what they have is an excessive amount 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.640
 of omega 3 that we almost can not 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.200
 consume a lot more than 3 because it 's in 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.900
 those sardine coins in things that we 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.360
 they eat very often then with 23 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.040
 teaspoons of chia a day are going to have 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.110
 all the omegas that they need and that's what 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.060
 will fill with energy because apart 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.010
 has a lot of carbohydrate and fiber 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.959
 he will give you good things for him 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.390
 hair for the skin to lose fat 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.519
 to avoid cholesterol to go down to 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.290
 regulate the pressure so it is a weight 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.610
 super foods help for many things 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.989
 and they benefit health enormously 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.780
 since times good is awesome and 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.489
 I am in the middle of the chia from 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.600
 a year ago I see how the price has 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.700
 increased because people are 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.200
 discovering how fantastic it is and 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.640
 more and more people are consuming the 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.170
 chivas which I recommend to all 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.280
 two or three tablespoons of chía yo 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.280
 eating world 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.110
 they found it in their graves in the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.760
 food of the gods terrific where 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.530
 we find you in this balance that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.240
 he wants to be stopped asking questions me 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.100
