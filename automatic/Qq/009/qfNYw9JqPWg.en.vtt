here<00:01:06.750> at<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> edge<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.580> need<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> let

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
here at the edge so if you need to let

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.289 
here at the edge so if you need to let
some<00:01:09.510> time<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.990> wipe<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.320> hands

so we folded it all in to the soap and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.320 
so we folded it all in to the soap and
then<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.659> start<00:01:15.960> rolling<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:17.000> once<00:01:18.000> it's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
then we just start rolling and once it's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.490 
then we just start rolling and once it's
at<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.990> figure<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.979> take<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> hot<00:01:20.549> water<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
at a good figure you take a hot water I

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.990 
at a good figure you take a hot water I
hold<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.770> cuz<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.820> hot

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
hold it like this cuz it's really hot

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
hold it like this cuz it's really hot
water<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.409> pour<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:31.009> keep

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
water and just pour it on and keep

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.609 
water and just pour it on and keep
rolling

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
rolling

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.499 
rolling
and<00:01:33.740> if<00:01:33.859> you<00:01:33.979> need<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.189> turn<00:01:34.789> over<00:01:35.000> water<00:01:35.359> a

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
and if you need to turn over water a

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.840 
and if you need to turn over water a
little<00:01:35.810> bit<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.670> just<00:01:37.700> rinse<00:01:38.119> this<00:01:38.450> out<00:01:39.850> but

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
little bit and just rinse this out but

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.240 
little bit and just rinse this out but
do<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.179> a<00:01:41.210> light<00:01:41.570> bit<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:42.920> not<00:01:43.069> so<00:01:43.399> harsh

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
do it a light bit so it's not so harsh

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.230 
do it a light bit so it's not so harsh
can<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.369> just<00:01:46.549> keep<00:01:47.240> rolling<00:01:48.549> and<00:01:49.549> if<00:01:50.000> you

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
can you just keep rolling and if you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.120 
can you just keep rolling and if you
feel<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.689> need<00:01:50.719> to<00:01:50.899> do<00:01:51.200> another<00:01:51.530> hot<00:01:51.799> water

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
feel the need to do another hot water

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.279 
feel the need to do another hot water
you<00:01:52.759> can<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.030> trick<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.479> just<00:01:59.899> switching

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
you can so the trick is just switching

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.169 
you can so the trick is just switching
back<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.500> forth<00:02:00.799> from<00:02:01.069> hot<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:01.609> cold<00:02:01.640> water

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
back and forth from hot to cold water

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.729 
back and forth from hot to cold water
and<00:02:03.079> every<00:02:03.979> time<00:02:04.189> you<00:02:04.369> start<00:02:04.640> rolling<00:02:04.819> to<00:02:05.739> more

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
and every time you start rolling to more

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:12.860 
and every time you start rolling to more
pressure

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.199 

so<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.900> keep<00:02:14.200> rolling<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.860> beat<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.670> wrap<00:02:15.879> your

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
so I keep rolling and beat you wrap your

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.020 
so I keep rolling and beat you wrap your
hands<00:02:16.480> might<00:02:16.720> get<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> little<00:02:17.080> soapy<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.879> you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
hands might get a little soapy so you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.860 
hands might get a little soapy so you
keep<00:02:22.330> rolling<00:02:24.900> wash<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.110> out<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:27.750> now<00:02:28.750> I'm

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
keep rolling wash it out and now I'm

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.540 
keep rolling wash it out and now I'm
going<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.110> move<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.530> another<00:02:29.739> hot<00:02:30.040> water<00:02:30.310> or

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
going to move on to another hot water or

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.240 
going to move on to another hot water or
so<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.420> nice<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.900> balanced<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.069> just

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
so it's nice and balanced and you just

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.520 
so it's nice and balanced and you just
keep<00:02:36.459> doing<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.209> doing<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.660> until<00:02:38.380> you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
keep doing that and doing that until you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.740 
keep doing that and doing that until you
feel<00:02:38.769> it's<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.069> right<00:02:39.250> size<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.580> right<00:02:40.560> place

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
feel it's the right size and right place

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.520 
feel it's the right size and right place
and<00:02:43.750> once<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.920> on<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:46.269> way<00:02:46.530> you

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and once you have it on the way you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.900 
and once you have it on the way you
would<00:02:47.709> like<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:50.260> wash<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:50.980> out<00:02:51.310> wash

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
would like it you just wash it out wash

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.839 
would like it you just wash it out wash
