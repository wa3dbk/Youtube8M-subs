00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
it's one of the better ones one of the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.839 
it's one of the better ones one of the
better<00:00:27.630> early<00:00:27.960> ones<00:00:28.189> but<00:00:29.189> i'ma<00:00:29.369> still<00:00:29.699> got

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
better early ones but i'ma still got

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.460 
better early ones but i'ma still got
that<00:00:29.970> same<00:00:30.269> flaw<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> Resident

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
that same flaw that all the Resident

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.000 
that same flaw that all the Resident
Evil<00:00:31.710> games<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.669> 12<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
Evil games have like 12 like this one I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.119 
Evil games have like 12 like this one I
think<00:00:35.309> I'm<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:36.329> flaw<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.890> instead<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> like

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
think I'm that flaw is instead of like

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.920 
think I'm that flaw is instead of like
following<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.670> character<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.390> goes

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
following your character and goes

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.889 
following your character and goes
between<00:00:40.079> these<00:00:40.379> like<00:00:40.559> weird<00:00:41.540> semi<00:00:42.540> fixed

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
between these like weird semi fixed

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.830 
between these like weird semi fixed
angles<00:00:43.350> were<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:45.030> will<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> camera

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
angles were like it will the camera

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.000 
angles were like it will the camera
won't<00:00:46.050> move<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
won't move but then when you get to a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
won't move but then when you get to a
certain<00:00:47.070> point<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.789> angle<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.690> facing

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
certain point the angle that it's facing

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.010 
certain point the angle that it's facing
was<00:00:49.170> change<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.760> makes<00:00:51.000> playing<00:00:51.629> kind

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
was change and that makes playing kind

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.510 
was change and that makes playing kind
of<00:00:52.140> hard<00:00:52.350> especially<00:00:52.710> when<00:00:53.160> there<00:00:53.280> are<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.399> lot

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
of hard especially when there are a lot

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
of hard especially when there are a lot
of<00:00:53.550> zombies<00:00:53.760> around<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.530> makes<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
of zombies around you and it makes it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.729 
of zombies around you and it makes it
really<00:00:55.890> difficult<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.489> kill<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:57.530> but<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
really difficult to kill them but I'm a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.650

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
few you get used to it eventually and if

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599
