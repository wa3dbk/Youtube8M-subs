00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.440
 Hello, I'm lucky 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.300
 touch iphone 6 plus and how 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.970
 I was able to test 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.920
 device in a few hours and 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.800
 ready to share with you my 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.149
 impressions review iphone 6 plus grandson 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.149
 almost went 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.290
 the first thing you notice is 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.510
 new awesome design in my hands 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.970
 hit silver models confess 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.220
 honestly color space gray i like where 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.010
 more but even this option managed me 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.260
 impress all the same apple never ceases 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.560
 make really beautiful products 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.390
 iphone 6 plus is very thin very light 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.940
 although the characteristics are not quite 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.100
 so but given the size of the device, he 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.790
 absolutely not felt in the hand like something 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.370
 heavy 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.770
 version plus is nice to hold in your hands but 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.790
 not as comfortable as her little brother 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.560
 iphone 6 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.080
 if in the second case the device with 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.330
 screen 4 7 inches can twist twirl 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.160
 in hands without fear of dropping the smartphone then 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.770
 one awkward movement when you 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.350
 use the iphone 6 plus with one hand and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.140
 smartphone under flies to the ground with enough 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.670
 great speed at first keep this 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.830
 a huge device in the hands of very 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.770
 unusually especially after tiny 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.350
 iphone 4 cm or small iphone 5 but 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.080
 after an hour of work with iphone 6 plus 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.420
 discomfort subsides of course to reach 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.670
 the top corner of the screen in one hand will be 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.799
 problematic exactly like print 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.260
 what is not the message after all the fear 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.150
 drop your smartphone takes its however 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.250
 function helps many situations 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.910
 caused by double tapu on the button 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.980
 home 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.140
 interface instantly collapse on 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.959
 half of the screen and is displayed 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.940
 only the upper part 1 tab on need 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.970
 Icons and applications opens in 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.010
 the usual format is very handy thing 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.620
 the display of the new iphone is simply amazing 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.769
 color rendering is very high picture 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.070
 sharply and clearly I diagonal display background 6 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.739
 plus 5 5 inches and this is a comparison with iphone 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.920
 5s just heaven and earth look 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.140
 various videos surfing the internet 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.930
 play games on such a big screen on 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.549
 Such a huge screen is a pleasure 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.709
 after that look at the screen less 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.560
 four inches is simply impossible 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.540
 the image seems very small in 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.269
 iphone 6 plus new more powerful 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.610
 cpu however i can't say that 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.000
 the device is much faster than that 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.790
 same 5s overall aus-8 works smoothly and 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.250
 fast but sometimes glitches happen 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.760
 same interface for example look at 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.760
 this 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.400
 It certainly says that I have not yet 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.490
 optimized for new 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.500
 devices miss apple definitely more 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.390
 Moreover, not optimized remain 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.610
 many applications and games 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.920
 so for example in the tweet bot observed 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.200
 pretty jerky scrolling and you are real 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.930
 racing 3 we and so far see 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.210
 iphone 6 plus slideshow appeared 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.370
 landscape mode using stuff 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.500
 undoubtedly convenient especially with such 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.050
 large screen all standard 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.860
 apps now by the way too 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.830
 adapted for use 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.380
 inverted mode we also took pictures 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.090
 iphone 6 plus recorded several slow 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.090
 motion video like here 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.709
 The camera of the new iphone is certainly good but 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.830
 special differences compared to 5s i don't 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.900
 I noticed, however, and this is understandable matrix 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.120
 the cameras did not change only put 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.070
 optics slightly lighter to optical 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.440
 stabilizer screwed by the way 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.660
 front camera also became lighter 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.930
 the f-number is now there too 2 and 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.520
 2 this means that with a lack of light 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.710
 frontalka shoots much better than before 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.140
 moreover, we tested the sensor 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.760
 tachadi no complaints he caused 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.800
 everything works like a clock 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.990
 by the way unlock so much 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.450
 built using the sensor is much easier 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 what to enter the password therefore takachidi 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.780
 unambiguous can be used to 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.420
 Unfortunately, the time of the smartphone 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.880
 We did not have time to fully evaluate but 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.120
 Shooting review is about one and a half 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.380
 hours of iphone with maximum brightness 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.900
 lasted on the last twenty 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.690
 Percentage result is very good at 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.460
 in this we played games printed messages 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.550
 watched video from youtube 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.550
 and all that iphone 6 remembered 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.710
 plus a big thin and very light 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.900
 fast and bright is the impression 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.460
 stays after a few hours 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.950
 smartphone use 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.900
 if you have long been looking for a new 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.870
 device from apple and a large diagonal 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.310
 iphone 6 plus doesn't cause fear 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.740
 would be a great option 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.110
