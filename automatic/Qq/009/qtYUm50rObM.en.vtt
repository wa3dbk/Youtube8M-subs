behind-the-scenes video of a ravine now

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.750 
behind-the-scenes video of a ravine now
I'm<00:00:07.230> gonna<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.680> think<00:00:08.069> I<00:00:08.099> might<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> series<00:00:08.730> of

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
I'm gonna I think I might do a series of

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.850 
I'm gonna I think I might do a series of
these<00:00:09.000> actually<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.599> like<00:00:09.929> I'll<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.740> go

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
these actually so like I'll just go

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.200 
these actually so like I'll just go
through<00:00:10.889> all<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.250> files<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.880> use<00:00:12.030> for

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
through all the files that I use for

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.730 
through all the files that I use for
ravine<00:00:12.480> there's<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.170> seven<00:00:13.530> or<00:00:13.620> eight<00:00:13.679> I

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
ravine there's about seven or eight I

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.829 
ravine there's about seven or eight I
think<00:00:13.830> I'll<00:00:14.700> just<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.089> split<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.480> up<00:00:15.599> into

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
think I'll just like split it up into

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.519 
think I'll just like split it up into
three<00:00:16.020> or<00:00:16.320> four<00:00:16.470> tutorial<00:00:17.010> parts<00:00:18.050> so<00:00:19.050> today

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
three or four tutorial parts so today

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.640 
three or four tutorial parts so today
I'm<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.130> cover<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.689> intro<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
I'm just going to cover the intro and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
I'm just going to cover the intro and
the<00:00:23.250> water<00:00:23.460> scene<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:25.070> first<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.550> think

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the water scene so first of all I think

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.250 
the water scene so first of all I think
I<00:00:27.000> sort<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> covered<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.050> previous

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
I sort of covered this in a previous

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650 
I sort of covered this in a previous
tutorial<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> talked<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.820> Zoe

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
tutorial when I talked about the Zoe

tutorial when I talked about the Zoe
camera<00:00:31.199> effects<00:00:31.650> which<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.149> weird

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
camera effects which is this weird

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.270 
camera effects which is this weird
camera<00:00:34.079> motion<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:36.360> yes<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.410> where

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
camera motion but yes so this was where

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.530 
camera motion but yes so this was where
he<00:00:38.309> started<00:00:38.730> out<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.390> where<00:00:39.480> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
he started out really this is where I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
he started out really this is where I
messed<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> compositing<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.950> sort<00:00:41.489> of

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
messed with the compositing and sort of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.520 
messed with the compositing and sort of
fixed<00:00:42.210> all<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> textures<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.350> did

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
fixed all the textures and did

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.200 
fixed all the textures and did
everything<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> need<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.850> start

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
everything that you need to do to start

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.529 
everything that you need to do to start
off<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.420> minecraft<00:00:45.780> animation<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:48.920> first<00:00:50.539> okay

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
off a minecraft animation so first okay

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.580 
off a minecraft animation so first okay
so<00:00:51.770> if<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> notice<00:00:53.930> once<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.050> play<00:00:55.230> through

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
so if you notice once I play through

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.279 
so if you notice once I play through
you've<00:00:56.129> got<00:00:56.370> these<00:00:56.610> two<00:00:57.600> titles<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.230> appear

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you've got these two titles that appear

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.979 
you've got these two titles that appear
first<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.090> bill<00:01:00.300> modifier

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
first one it's just a bill modifier

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
first one it's just a bill modifier
you<00:01:01.289> might<00:01:01.440> even<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> random<00:01:02.219> seed<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you might even got a random seed on it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
you might even got a random seed on it
just<00:01:02.940> sort<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.180> swipes<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.110> quick

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
just sort of swipes and really quick

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.859 
just sort of swipes and really quick
okay<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> first<00:01:05.339> ten<00:01:05.580> ten<00:01:06.420> frames<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
okay the first ten ten frames or so and

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.420 
okay the first ten ten frames or so and
second<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.200> again<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> build

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
second one is again just to build

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.170 
second one is again just to build
modifier<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:13.760> again<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.000> sort<00:01:15.150> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
modifier and again it just sort of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820 
modifier and again it just sort of
dissolves<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.720> moves<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:16.740> this

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
dissolves in moves because it's got this

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.700 
dissolves in moves because it's got this
random<00:01:17.040> seed<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.930> change<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> value

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
random seed on you just change the value

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.859 
random seed on you just change the value
of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> seed<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.640> make<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
of the seed here just make it a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.469 
of the seed here just make it a
different<00:01:23.630> fade<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.780> selection<00:01:25.110> or<00:01:25.350> whatever

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
different fade in selection or whatever

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
different fade in selection or whatever
so<00:01:27.479> nothing<00:01:27.900> really<00:01:28.020> too<00:01:28.229> complex<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
so nothing really too complex for the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
so nothing really too complex for the
intro<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> made<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.479> blender<00:01:30.900> then<00:01:31.409> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
intro I made it all in blender then I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.289 
intro I made it all in blender then I
did<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> few<00:01:31.950> effects<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.520> premiere<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
did a few effects in premiere like the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.850 
did a few effects in premiere like the
sort<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> weird<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> store<00:01:35.900> also<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.650> quite

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
sort of weird to store also it's quite

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.800 
sort of weird to store also it's quite
hard<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.600> little

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
hard to see but there is like little

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.179 
hard to see but there is like little
details<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.409> particles<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.070> come

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
details like these particles that come

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.149 
details like these particles that come
out<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> trees<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.950> here

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
out the trees as you can see here

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
out the trees as you can see here
there's<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> emitter<00:01:45.409> basically<00:01:46.409> I

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
there's this is the emitter basically I

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.499 
there's this is the emitter basically I
just<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.100> did<00:01:47.250> these<00:01:47.369> these<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> sort<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
just I just did these these to sort of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.819 
just I just did these these to sort of
make<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> scene<00:01:48.930> look<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.140> bit<00:01:49.290> more<00:01:49.439> realistic

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
make the scene look a bit more realistic

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.889 
make the scene look a bit more realistic
bit<00:01:50.579> war<00:01:50.790> sort<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.420> alive<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> yeah<00:01:53.310> that's

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
bit war sort of alive so yeah that's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.330 
bit war sort of alive so yeah that's
that's<00:01:54.899> something<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.649> so

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that's something that is so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.740 
that's something that is so
one<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.609> those<00:01:56.700> little<00:01:56.909> add-ons<00:01:57.359> that<00:01:57.479> really

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
one of those little add-ons that really

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.139 
one of those little add-ons that really
helps<00:01:58.049> improve<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.439> animations<00:01:59.039> and<00:02:00.030> then

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
helps improve your animations and then

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.719 
helps improve your animations and then
I've<00:02:00.270> got<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.890> call<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.369> his<00:02:02.460> force

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
I've got this I would call it his force

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.760 
I've got this I would call it his force
field<00:02:02.820> thing<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.479> which<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.259> pushing

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
field thing here which is just pushing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
field thing here which is just pushing
the<00:02:05.069> particles<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> right<00:02:06.450> what's<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the particles to the right what's the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.990 
the particles to the right what's the
kind<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:06.990> acting<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> wind<00:02:07.910> sort<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
kind of acting as a wind sort of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.559 
kind of acting as a wind sort of
generator<00:02:11.569> well<00:02:12.569> okay<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:13.470> I've<00:02:13.980> got<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.569> Sun

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
generator well okay so I've got this Sun

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.420 
generator well okay so I've got this Sun
lamp<00:02:15.780> here<00:02:16.019> might<00:02:16.920> as<00:02:16.950> well<00:02:17.069> just<00:02:17.190> go<00:02:17.340> ahead

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
lamp here might as well just go ahead

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.539 
lamp here might as well just go ahead
and<00:02:17.610> show<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.879> settings<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.299> this<00:02:18.530> just

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
and show you the settings for this just

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.750 
and show you the settings for this just
ray<00:02:20.549> shadow<00:02:20.849> obviously<00:02:21.510> with<00:02:22.230> higher<00:02:23.160> energy

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
ray shadow obviously with higher energy

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.710 
ray shadow obviously with higher energy
and<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.239> nice<00:02:24.420> blue<00:02:24.720> color<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:26.819> sort<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.360> I

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and a nice blue color it just sort of I

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.030 
and a nice blue color it just sort of I
mean<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.319> doesn't<00:02:28.470> really<00:02:28.709> bring<00:02:28.890> out

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
mean it doesn't really bring out

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.240 
mean it doesn't really bring out
anything<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:31.170> know<00:02:31.290> prominent<00:02:31.769> but<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
anything to you know prominent but it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.920 
anything to you know prominent but it
sort<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.610> makes<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.970> scene<00:02:33.209> look<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:33.720> more

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
sort of makes the scene look a bit more

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.970 
sort of makes the scene look a bit more
cold<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.519> bleak<00:02:36.560> even<00:02:37.560> though<00:02:37.650> uh<00:02:37.680> sort<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
cold and bleak even though uh sort of

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.110 
cold and bleak even though uh sort of
the<00:02:38.370> compositing<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.090> does<00:02:39.239> help<00:02:40.579> and<00:02:41.579> then

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
the compositing it does help and then

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.490 
the compositing it does help and then
you've<00:02:42.269> got<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.450> world<00:02:42.690> settings<00:02:43.049> here<00:02:43.260> so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
you've got the world settings here so

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.569 
you've got the world settings here so
this<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.920> same<00:02:44.190> throughout<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
this is the same throughout the

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.350 
this is the same throughout the
animation<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:46.140> I've<00:02:46.290> been<00:02:46.440> occlusion<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.360> 27

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
animation so I've been occlusion on 27

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.410 
animation so I've been occlusion on 27
set<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.720> add<00:02:48.930> environment<00:02:49.920> 19.5<00:02:50.879> set<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.269> white

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
set to add environment 19.5 set to white

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.319 
set to add environment 19.5 set to white
and<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.959> end<00:02:52.110> sample<00:02:52.620> amount<00:02:52.890> was<00:02:53.010> 15<00:02:53.459> I

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
and the end sample amount was 15 I

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.780 
and the end sample amount was 15 I
probably<00:02:55.110> need<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.530> bit<00:02:55.680> more<00:02:55.829> but<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:56.280> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
probably need it a bit more but just you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.009 
probably need it a bit more but just you
know<00:02:56.849> take<00:02:57.120> too<00:02:57.269> long<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.450> read<00:02:57.690> through<00:02:57.900> this

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
know take too long to read through this

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.229 
know take too long to read through this
at<00:02:58.290> 20<00:02:58.829> because<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.340> know<00:02:59.459> ravines<00:02:59.910> really

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
at 20 because you know ravines really

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.569 
at 20 because you know ravines really
dark<00:03:00.829> balancing<00:03:01.829> out<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.069> lighting<00:03:02.280> and

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
dark balancing out the lighting and

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.979 
dark balancing out the lighting and
stuff<00:03:02.790> would<00:03:03.209> have<00:03:03.329> just<00:03:03.480> been<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.720> lot<00:03:03.840> more

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
stuff would have just been a lot more

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.020 
stuff would have just been a lot more
tedious<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.650> 50<00:03:05.069> was<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> good<00:03:05.549> amount<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:05.880> you

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
tedious so 50 was a good amount for you

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.820 
tedious so 50 was a good amount for you
think

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
think

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.090 
think
and<00:03:08.830> then<00:03:09.069> if<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.250> go<00:03:09.400> ahead<00:03:09.520> and<00:03:10.860> render<00:03:11.860> this

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
and then if I go ahead and render this

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.000 
and then if I go ahead and render this
really<00:03:12.340> quick<00:03:12.550> sorry<00:03:12.790> about<00:03:13.000> that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
really quick sorry about that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.980 
really quick sorry about that
you'll<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:15.190> see<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:16.150> well<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.510> red<00:03:16.660> result

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
you'll just see it well the red result

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.940 
you'll just see it well the red result
and<00:03:17.110> I'll<00:03:17.200> go<00:03:17.350> ahead<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.650> show<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
and I'll go ahead and show you the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.190 
and I'll go ahead and show you the
compositing<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:18.880> I'll<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:19.900> give<00:03:20.050> you<00:03:20.140> a

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
compositing so I'll just give you a

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.140 
compositing so I'll just give you a
quick<00:03:20.380> run<00:03:21.069> through<00:03:21.100> of<00:03:21.340> what's<00:03:21.790> going<00:03:22.030> on

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
quick run through of what's going on

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.180 
quick run through of what's going on
here

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
here

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.059 
here
so<00:03:24.630> when<00:03:25.630> it's<00:03:25.870> rendered<00:03:26.140> because<00:03:26.800> it's<00:03:26.920> got<00:03:27.040> a

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
so when it's rendered because it's got a

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.510 
so when it's rendered because it's got a
renter<00:03:27.370> at<00:03:27.459> for<00:03:27.700> 720p<00:03:28.709> with<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.950> 15<00:03:30.280> samples

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
renter at for 720p with the 15 samples

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.949 
renter at for 720p with the 15 samples
and<00:03:30.850> everything<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.330> it's<00:03:31.480> taken<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.840> bit

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
and everything so it's taken a bit

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.100 
and everything so it's taken a bit
longer<00:03:32.170> than<00:03:32.290> normal

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
longer than normal

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.740 
longer than normal
okay<00:03:35.110> so<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.760> know<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:37.120> zoom<00:03:37.300> out<00:03:37.390> here<00:03:37.450> by

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
okay so you know just zoom out here by

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.650 
okay so you know just zoom out here by
clicking<00:03:37.810> V<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.790> compositing<00:03:40.360> so

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
clicking V this is the compositing so

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.970 
clicking V this is the compositing so
you<00:03:40.720> can<00:03:40.989> see<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.170> nice<00:03:41.260> black<00:03:41.530> border<00:03:41.920> around

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
you can see a nice black border around

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.280 
you can see a nice black border around
the<00:03:42.190> edge<00:03:42.780> sort<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> bit<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.080> color

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
the edge sort of a bit of color

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.380 
the edge sort of a bit of color
correction<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.950> make<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.430> trees<00:03:45.760> look<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.180> bit

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
correction to make the trees look a bit

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.860 
correction to make the trees look a bit
more<00:03:46.570> sort<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.440> dark<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.550> stand<00:03:49.150> out<00:03:49.269> more<00:03:49.480> and

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
more sort of dark and stand out more and

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.949 
more sort of dark and stand out more and
then<00:03:50.680> obviously<00:03:51.610> sort<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.269> slight<00:03:52.569> color

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
then obviously sort of a slight color

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.020 
then obviously sort of a slight color
balance<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.620> you've<00:03:53.830> got<00:03:53.980> like<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.160> purple<00:03:54.880> of

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
balance so you've got like a purple of

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.500 
balance so you've got like a purple of
sky

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
sky

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.280 
sky
purple<00:03:56.319> or<00:03:56.650> more<00:03:56.920> purple<00:03:57.280> sky<00:03:57.489> even<00:03:58.080> which<00:03:59.080> I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
purple or more purple sky even which I

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.070 
purple or more purple sky even which I
don't<00:03:59.590> know<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.860> just<00:03:59.890> makes<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:01.450> seem<00:04:01.660> more

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
don't know it just makes it seem more

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.600 
don't know it just makes it seem more
bit<00:04:02.940> more<00:04:03.940> bleak<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.720> like<00:04:05.489> atmospheric<00:04:06.489> I

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
bit more bleak and like atmospheric I

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.920 
bit more bleak and like atmospheric I
guess<00:04:06.819> which<00:04:07.000> is<00:04:07.030> what<00:04:07.330> was<00:04:07.450> going<00:04:07.630> for<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:07.900> the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
guess which is what was going for in the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.220 
guess which is what was going for in the
animation<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.910> was<00:04:10.060> helps<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.600> then

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
animation so that was helps and then

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.520 
animation so that was helps and then
I've<00:04:11.530> got<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.730> roses<00:04:13.030> or<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.390> vignette<00:04:13.870> then

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
I've got the roses or the vignette then

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.670 
I've got the roses or the vignette then
I've<00:04:14.620> got<00:04:14.769> this<00:04:14.890> blur<00:04:15.359> here<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.680> lens

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
I've got this blur here a lens

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.370 
I've got this blur here a lens
distortion<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:19.120> what<00:04:19.419> I<00:04:19.450> did<00:04:19.660> for<00:04:19.810> this<00:04:19.989> was

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
distortion and what I did for this was

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.230 
distortion and what I did for this was
am<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:20.829> just<00:04:20.859> go<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.370> keyframe<00:04:21.729> with<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.060> lens

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
am I just go to a keyframe with the lens

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
am I just go to a keyframe with the lens
distortion<00:04:22.750> enabled<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:24.070> animated<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.090> so<00:04:25.870> that

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
distortion enabled I animated it so that

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.110 
distortion enabled I animated it so that
for<00:04:27.010> a<00:04:27.130> few<00:04:27.580> frames<00:04:27.850> throughout<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.539> timeline

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
for a few frames throughout the timeline

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.310 
for a few frames throughout the timeline
this<00:04:31.120> will<00:04:31.330> happen<00:04:31.660> which<00:04:31.780> basically<00:04:32.169> just

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
this will happen which basically just

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.570 
this will happen which basically just
makes<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.560> look<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.770> bit<00:04:32.800> more<00:04:32.950> glitchy<00:04:33.340> and

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
makes it look a bit more glitchy and

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.090 
makes it look a bit more glitchy and
sort<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.260> don't<00:04:35.260> know<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.680> just<00:04:35.740> makes<00:04:36.010> it

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
sort of I don't know it just makes it

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.969 
sort of I don't know it just makes it
look<00:04:36.220> kind<00:04:36.430> of<00:04:36.490> cool<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.880> creepy<00:04:37.120> so<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:38.229> made

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
look kind of cool and creepy so I made

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.680 
look kind of cool and creepy so I made
this<00:04:39.070> tutorial<00:04:39.220> on<00:04:39.580> how<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.760> animate<00:04:40.060> notes<00:04:40.390> so

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
this tutorial on how to animate notes so

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.000 
this tutorial on how to animate notes so
if<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.810> don't<00:04:40.960> know<00:04:41.020> how<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.140> do<00:04:41.350> that<00:04:41.530> might

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
if you don't know how to do that might

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.390 
if you don't know how to do that might
as<00:04:42.070> well<00:04:42.130> go<00:04:42.310> check<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.610> out<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:44.070> think<00:04:45.070> that's

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
as well go check that out I think that's

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.340 
as well go check that out I think that's
basically<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:46.270> yeah<00:04:46.600> this<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.080> color

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
basically it so yeah this is the color

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.070 
basically it so yeah this is the color
correction<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:48.160> just<00:04:49.150> some<00:04:49.390> slight<00:04:49.630> glare

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
correction and just some slight glare

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.900 
correction and just some slight glare
fuckload<00:04:50.950> just

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
fuckload just

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.350 
fuckload just
more<00:04:53.510> atmospheric<00:04:53.960> again<00:04:55.000> nothing<00:04:56.000> really<00:04:56.120> to

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
more atmospheric again nothing really to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.070 
more atmospheric again nothing really to
it<00:04:56.450> is<00:04:56.600> quite<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.840> simple<00:04:57.080> scene<00:04:58.720> well<00:04:59.720> so<00:04:59.930> there

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
it is quite a simple scene well so there

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.620 
it is quite a simple scene well so there
to<00:05:00.200> show<00:05:00.410> you<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.860> mean<00:05:01.700> if<00:05:01.970> you<00:05:02.060> want<00:05:02.210> you<00:05:02.510> can

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.350 
you in these tutorials because it's all
about<00:05:05.990> sort<00:05:06.290> of<00:05:06.320> revealing<00:05:06.740> how<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.460> made<00:05:08.150> the

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
about sort of revealing how I made the

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.930 
about sort of revealing how I made the
animation<00:05:08.720> that's<00:05:09.170> it<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.580> yeah<00:05:10.760> you<00:05:10.820> just

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
animation that's it so yeah you just

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.940 
animation that's it so yeah you just
want<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.270> comment<00:05:11.450> or<00:05:11.660> whatever<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.620> I'll

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
take you through what I did you know

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.340 
take you through what I did you know
next<00:05:15.170> like<00:05:16.600> tutorial<00:05:17.600> in<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.780> future<00:05:18.110> at<00:05:18.200> some

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
next like tutorial in the future at some

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.840 
next like tutorial in the future at some
point<00:05:19.420> anyway<00:05:20.420> that's<00:05:20.600> that<00:05:20.810> file<00:05:21.400> then<00:05:22.400> I've

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
point anyway that's that file then I've

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.530 
point anyway that's that file then I've
got<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.870> first<00:05:24.370> actual<00:05:25.370> file<00:05:26.180> of<00:05:26.420> the

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
got the first actual file of the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.310 
got the first actual file of the
animation<00:05:27.050> so<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.440> water<00:05:28.300> now<00:05:29.300> this<00:05:29.600> is<00:05:30.020> what

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
animation so the water now this is what

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.440 
animation so the water now this is what
we<00:05:30.650> absolutely<00:05:30.830> ages<00:05:31.730> to<00:05:31.850> figure<00:05:32.120> out<00:05:32.240> I've

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
we absolutely ages to figure out I've

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.810 
we absolutely ages to figure out I've
been<00:05:32.630> trying<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:32.990> be<00:05:33.500> messing<00:05:33.740> with<00:05:33.890> material

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
been trying to be messing with material

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.580 
been trying to be messing with material
and<00:05:34.940> texture<00:05:35.210> settings<00:05:35.600> for<00:05:35.780> absolutely<00:05:36.500> ages

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
and texture settings for absolutely ages

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.000 
and texture settings for absolutely ages
now<00:05:37.100> and<00:05:37.660> I<00:05:38.660> sort<00:05:39.080> of<00:05:39.200> I<00:05:39.350> think<00:05:39.530> I<00:05:39.620> figured<00:05:39.800> out

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
now and I sort of I think I figured out

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.810 
now and I sort of I think I figured out
a<00:05:40.070> good<00:05:40.630> good<00:05:41.630> balance<00:05:42.050> between<00:05:42.580> material<00:05:43.580> and

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
a good good balance between material and

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.760 
a good good balance between material and
texture<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.510> sort<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:44.900> different

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
texture and sort of different

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.850 
texture and sort of different
simulations<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.730> modifiers<00:05:47.410> so<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.620> water<00:05:48.770> I

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
simulations and modifiers so the water I

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.610 
simulations and modifiers so the water I
actually<00:05:49.180> did<00:05:50.180> what<00:05:50.960> I<00:05:50.990> did<00:05:51.200> for<00:05:51.260> the<00:05:51.410> water

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
actually did what I did for the water

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.340 
actually did what I did for the water
even<00:05:51.890> worsse<00:05:52.340> I<00:05:52.610> added<00:05:52.790> a<00:05:52.880> wave<00:05:53.060> modifier<00:05:53.600> with

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
even worsse I added a wave modifier with

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.460 
even worsse I added a wave modifier with
very<00:05:54.890> subtle<00:05:55.250> settings<00:05:55.640> on<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.360> speed<00:05:56.720> height

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
very subtle settings on so speed height

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
and a very low amount just as you can

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.020 
and a very low amount just as you can
see<00:06:00.110> ripples<00:06:00.500> slightly<00:06:01.210> like<00:06:02.210> that

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
see ripples slightly like that

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.860 
see ripples slightly like that
i<00:06:04.060> did<00:06:04.840> i<00:06:05.110> animated<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:06.070> texture<00:06:06.670> of<00:06:06.880> the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
i did i animated the texture of the

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.130 
i did i animated the texture of the
water<00:06:08.670> so<00:06:09.670> here<00:06:10.330> if<00:06:10.510> you<00:06:10.570> just<00:06:10.780> scroll<00:06:10.960> down

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
water so here if you just scroll down

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.620 
water so here if you just scroll down
the<00:06:11.290> timeline<00:06:11.740> you<00:06:11.890> can<00:06:11.920> see<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.520> that<00:06:12.850> y&amp;z

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
the timeline you can see that that y&amp;z

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.420 
the timeline you can see that that y&amp;z
coordinates<00:06:13.810> are<00:06:14.290> animated<00:06:14.800> which<00:06:14.980> makes<00:06:15.280> it

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
coordinates are animated which makes it

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.900 
coordinates are animated which makes it
look<00:06:15.550> like<00:06:15.790> natural<00:06:16.660> water<00:06:17.110> is<00:06:17.530> moving<00:06:17.920> in<00:06:18.820> the

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
look like natural water is moving in the

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.680 
look like natural water is moving in the
material<00:06:20.370> so<00:06:21.370> that's<00:06:22.060> it<00:06:22.270> really<00:06:22.480> you<00:06:22.540> can

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
material so that's it really you can

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.240 
material so that's it really you can
take<00:06:22.840> a<00:06:22.870> look<00:06:22.990> with<00:06:23.110> other<00:06:23.620> settings<00:06:24.070> if<00:06:24.220> you

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
take a look with other settings if you

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.190 
take a look with other settings if you
want<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.640> coordinates<00:06:25.060> from<00:06:25.120> generated<00:06:25.870> and

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
want the coordinates from generated and

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.050 
want the coordinates from generated and
the<00:06:26.410> size<00:06:26.620> was<00:06:26.860> quite<00:06:27.040> low<00:06:27.280> in<00:06:27.400> the<00:06:27.490> depth<00:06:27.730> was

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
the size was quite low in the depth was

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.260 
the size was quite low in the depth was
a<00:06:28.120> relatively<00:06:28.540> high<00:06:29.880> method<00:06:30.880> of<00:06:31.000> bump<00:06:31.150> mapping

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
a relatively high method of bump mapping

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.260 
a relatively high method of bump mapping
was<00:06:31.750> original<00:06:32.620> and<00:06:32.770> I<00:06:33.070> did<00:06:33.220> have<00:06:33.460> a<00:06:33.760> bump<00:06:34.090> map

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
was original and I did have a bump map

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.090 
was original and I did have a bump map
percent<00:06:34.630> to<00:06:34.720> 1<00:06:35.200> which<00:06:35.410> was<00:06:35.560> the<00:06:35.620> default

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
percent to 1 which was the default

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.300 
percent to 1 which was the default
amount<00:06:37.560> and<00:06:38.560> then<00:06:38.680> obviously<00:06:38.860> the<00:06:39.130> water

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
amount and then obviously the water

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.080 
amount and then obviously the water

Fresnel<00:06:44.950> and<00:06:45.190> I<00:06:45.730> warm<00:06:46.480> up<00:06:46.600> so<00:06:46.930> this<00:06:47.560> is

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
Fresnel and I warm up so this is

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.530 
Fresnel and I warm up so this is
basically<00:06:48.220> if<00:06:48.400> you<00:06:48.460> don't<00:06:48.640> know<00:06:48.790> this<00:06:48.970> is<00:06:49.150> the

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
basically if you don't know this is the

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.900 
basically if you don't know this is the
amount<00:06:49.930> you<00:06:50.020> want<00:06:50.110> to<00:06:50.230> set<00:06:50.590> water<00:06:50.860> to<00:06:51.250> someone

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
amount you want to set water to someone

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.690 
amount you want to set water to someone
like<00:06:52.060> 1.3<00:06:52.780> or<00:06:52.810> 1.4<00:06:53.650> that's<00:06:54.130> ideal<00:06:54.640> really<00:06:56.700> so

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
like 1.3 or 1.4 that's ideal really so

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.250 
like 1.3 or 1.4 that's ideal really so
that's<00:06:57.880> it<00:06:58.090> really<00:06:58.240> the<00:06:58.390> compositing<00:06:59.020> was

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
that's it really the compositing was

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.840 
that's it really the compositing was
pretty<00:06:59.560> much<00:06:59.710> the<00:06:59.919> same<00:06:59.950> throughout<00:07:00.460> which<00:07:00.700> is

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
pretty much the same throughout which is

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.970 
pretty much the same throughout which is
some<00:07:01.110> slight<00:07:02.110> changes<00:07:02.140> in<00:07:02.680> the<00:07:02.770> color

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
some slight changes in the color

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.830 
some slight changes in the color
correction<00:07:03.780> but<00:07:04.780> this<00:07:05.400> compositing<00:07:06.400> tree<00:07:06.840> was

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
correction but this compositing tree was

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.120 
correction but this compositing tree was
the<00:07:08.050> same<00:07:08.290> throughout<00:07:08.560> the<00:07:08.710> rest<00:07:08.919> of<00:07:09.070> the

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
the same throughout the rest of the

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.770 
the same throughout the rest of the
animation<00:07:09.580> now<00:07:09.610> so<00:07:10.140> had<00:07:11.140> the<00:07:11.260> exact<00:07:11.620> same

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 
animation now so had the exact same

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.659 
animation now so had the exact same
effects<00:07:13.780> on<00:07:14.020> color<00:07:14.740> balance<00:07:15.100> and<00:07:15.130> whatever<00:07:15.310> is

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
effects on color balance and whatever is

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:18.330 
effects on color balance and whatever is
all<00:07:15.880> identical<00:07:16.770> it's<00:07:17.770> just<00:07:17.950> to<00:07:18.040> keep<00:07:18.160> it

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
all identical it's just to keep it

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.830 
all identical it's just to keep it
consistent<00:07:18.520> throughout<00:07:19.090> the<00:07:19.240> animation<00:07:19.720> to

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 
consistent throughout the animation to

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.440 
consistent throughout the animation to
make<00:07:19.990> it<00:07:20.169> look<00:07:20.380> like<00:07:21.250> it's<00:07:21.669> matching<00:07:21.970> scenes

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
make it look like it's matching scenes

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.440 
make it look like it's matching scenes
and<00:07:22.720> serve<00:07:22.900> just<00:07:23.169> separate<00:07:23.530> files<00:07:24.270> and<00:07:25.270> then

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
and serve just separate files and then

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
and serve just separate files and then
obviously<00:07:25.600> when<00:07:25.990> you<00:07:26.080> bring<00:07:26.260> it<00:07:26.380> into

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.470 
obviously when you bring it into

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.570 
obviously when you bring it into
Premiere<00:07:26.860> Pro<00:07:26.919> it'll<00:07:27.760> look<00:07:27.940> the<00:07:28.479> same<00:07:28.690> so

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 
Premiere Pro it'll look the same so

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.480 
Premiere Pro it'll look the same so
that's<00:07:30.580> really<00:07:30.940> it<00:07:31.270> I<00:07:31.360> mean<00:07:31.540> if<00:07:32.050> you<00:07:32.560> as<00:07:33.100> I<00:07:33.280> said

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
that's really it I mean if you as I said

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.060 
that's really it I mean if you as I said
if<00:07:33.610> you<00:07:33.640> want<00:07:33.910> to<00:07:34.380> know<00:07:35.380> anything<00:07:35.620> else<00:07:35.919> about

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
if you want to know anything else about

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.010 
if you want to know anything else about
the<00:07:36.250> scene<00:07:36.490> like<00:07:36.729> I<00:07:37.060> don't<00:07:37.540> know<00:07:37.810> whatever

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
the scene like I don't know whatever

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.110 
the scene like I don't know whatever
some<00:07:38.590> of<00:07:38.680> the<00:07:38.740> other<00:07:38.890> lights<00:07:39.460> or<00:07:39.820> how<00:07:40.090> i

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 
some of the other lights or how i

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.739 
some of the other lights or how i
balanced<00:07:40.720> all<00:07:40.810> the<00:07:40.960> lighting<00:07:41.169> in<00:07:41.440> the<00:07:41.500> ravine

00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:42.749 
balanced all the lighting in the ravine

00:07:42.749 --> 00:07:44.779 
balanced all the lighting in the ravine
or<00:07:42.869> even<00:07:43.649> how<00:07:43.739> I<00:07:43.769> did<00:07:43.979> the<00:07:44.069> animation<00:07:44.549> then<00:07:44.669> you

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:44.789 
or even how I did the animation then you

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:46.279 
or even how I did the animation then you
can<00:07:44.909> go<00:07:45.059> ahead<00:07:45.149> and<00:07:45.449> comment<00:07:45.719> on<00:07:45.869> the<00:07:45.989> video
