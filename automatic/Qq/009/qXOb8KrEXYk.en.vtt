00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
it's perfect for bent over oh that's

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.699 
it's perfect for bent over oh that's
just<00:02:20.280> little<00:02:20.670> change<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.329> a<00:02:21.390> wrist<00:02:22.260> position

this case pronate as much really kind of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.630 
this case pronate as much really kind of
takes<00:02:29.040> some<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.189> the<00:02:29.310> pressure<00:02:29.340> off

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
takes some of the pressure off

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.850 
takes some of the pressure off
especially<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.450> me<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.200> for<00:02:31.379> those<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.739> have

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
especially for me so for those you have

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.039

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
bar then if you just use it for this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.470
