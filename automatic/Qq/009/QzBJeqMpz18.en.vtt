 Hi I'm loading Neo Gerd s points her has her from Liebenburg 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.710
 A camera mount for the apple-iphone which kindly 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.199
 received from the guys from Schnittpunkt de 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.359
 Now back the culprit was seen what it looked like 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.599
 and now it's all over 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.919
 there are already some who only make videos with their iPhone 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.590
 because the iPhone has 3g as well as a very good camera 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.630
 only this mount they sing - a tad better 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.230
 because here we have a 7 30 millimeter wide-angle lens 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.470
 the removal of one more song 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.020
 and what is important 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.020
 this case for the iPhone 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.760
 that's how it looks 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 in normal lens 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 it is very ergonomic to keep that in mind 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.580
 Here we have a holder for a Lady Lay Stefanie 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.990
 So synonymous in the evening of videos 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.950
 Munte Hamilton four times a thread mistake a tripod 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
 that normal 7 30 millimeters 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.680
 the whole one has a macro function 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.680
 for ever remove the lens from 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.530
 and with this Mako lens I know how to get really close to the object 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.590
 with such topic the first steps 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.640
 that was 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.290
 Here we put the iPhone here in this 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.290
 Silicone CASED 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.430
 this then serves as brackets 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.409
 so that he is well in the book Go in there is not failing 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.680
 So press here a bit 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 here is the bomb-solid crowd 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.510
 and we're ready to start 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.510
 you can keep 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.449
 and the camera is in the right place 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.959
 For a good sound, a microphone is included 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.839
 We can then quite normal 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.149
 Plug in your iPhone at the top 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.519
 here make recess of the ferry 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.279
 and if you then make videos automatically this microphone is used 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.599
 instead of that offered 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.599
 and already have better quality in all recordings 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:44.489
 that was an Xing Henson video attachment to the Audi Boo Boo camera line for that 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.079
 Apple iPhone runIT definitely mean youtube-channel you will see it 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:52.629
 because there is still a video with the cube in action
