00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.440
 graphic settings attention 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.150
 featured on video differ from 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.099
 maximum 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.860
 hello hello comrades it 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.170
 perfect well and you watch the final 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.289
 episode of a virtually unique project 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.000
 history of today's countries 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.270
 the nail of the program looks more like 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.269
 dong 3 parts and here you will probably ask 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.750
 I have a question why crusader 2 was honored 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.580
 full episodes and legends is not well 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 as it were, and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.200
 and a full episode look at his 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.329
 duration is like an addon to 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 The first part of the green European 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.610
 Meadows bore us in Arabic on 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.399
 the desert 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.430
 so crusader 2 does in general too 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.980
 the second time number 2 in the title 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.559
 not just worth the first thing I wanted 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.510
 would mark this small and elegant cue 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 resource panels that are completely 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.129
 tune up nice to see this 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 information immediately and do not meddle do not look 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.059
 where do i have this warehouse too 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.520
 the barn with the weapon 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.350
 even the control panel of popularity 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.010
 ceased to be occupying bandura 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.920
 half screen 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.380
 the principle of work of popularity here is the same 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.020
 as in the third part on the other hand 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 what else to expect from the addon 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.759
 only the influence of sticks and gingerbread disappeared 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.710
 because such and re- sawn not 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.500
 changed and the principle of the program 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.530
 affordable housing apartment in the center steeper 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.530
 more expensive and now holds eight people in 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.079
 suburbs grow hut on two masters 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.420
 but slightly other numbers are no longer in 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.540
 the game h steve according to all these 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.390
 here are the statues of the peers of all this gone and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.509
 on the one hand it is good in the third 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.759
 parts she was just to be with 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.689
 another disappearance of honor led to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.030
 moral decline 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.130
 on the Russian voice acting event 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.200
 commenter invited dude with such 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.040
 sweet voice that I have goosebumps 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.320
 skin run 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.740
 the farm needs to be built in the meadows sir ser we 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.370
 We found a cache with the resources we ser 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.220
 found a cache of food to go out 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.110
 stronghold crusader 2 and when this thing 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.510
 my vassal calls me 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.420
 then I seriously begin to worry about 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.430
 your anal virginity damn where 1 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.680
 stronghold where people admired me 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.740
 after a short absence returned 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.650
 camp mercenaries are recognized by old units a 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.360
 new ones aren't recognizable now these guys 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.540
 know how to turn on jagernaut 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.700
 and there are heavily armed riders they 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.680
 so fast so heavy so 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.520
 armed that they broke wood before 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.790
 kick off if not reclined 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.190
 more units more tactics range 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.920
 European regular divisions were also 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.500
 expanded appeared incomprehensible guys under 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.110
 the name of the huntsman from afar was 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.959
 seems like archers come close to not 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.630
 those with a sword fight there is a commander with an aura 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.160
 on the attack in the camp of the siege weapons 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.920
 no change detected 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.780
 Except that he was very much lost 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.870
 in attack speed but got 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.940
 the opportunity to fold and roll and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.500
 catapult though can not boast 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.480
 but very fast 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.850
 lower the defenses and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.560
 remove them with archers and interested in 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.540
 the store can be so clean wall 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.200
 the multiplayer is back for and 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.570
 cares 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.060
 moreover, according to the game developers 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.400
 That's what the company does it 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.650
 they say purely for training on it and 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.250
 hints that a section containing 6 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.530
 short companies so called 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.230
 training companies engage we there 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.900
 we will all defend to collect resources 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.690
 attack the castle but for those who are few 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.390
 there is a test mode essentially the same 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.090
 the very way of the crusader about multiplayer 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.230
 tell in general nothing before 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.630
 us the third part 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.250
 with an atmosphere of entourage and fighting enthusiasm 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.370
 1 Cruise Odessa 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.290
 well that's all guys over 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.450
 almost unique project story 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.440
 series stronghold on here such not 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.590
 fun note 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.720
 but maybe not over, I don’t know 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.390
 what year can you see it on 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.610
 backyard year 2020 and I already did a review on 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.560
 stronghold 6 in which Russian savages 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.959
 treacherously attacked the Teutonic knights 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.570
 on the Kulikov field under the leadership 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.300
 Catherine 3 formidable and then began 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.700
 burn the fascists in the hut chat me 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.710
 suffered though given the current 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.020
 political environment and general 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.630
 spat on the history rather 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.110
 all the way it will be well and if we all 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.380
 back in 2015 then the actual news 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.370
 will be the victory of age of empires in 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:47.320
 voting for the next story of the series 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.410
 remember love wait well in general and that’s all 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.410
 meeting
