00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
steering that way because the way I have

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.910 
steering that way because the way I have
the<00:01:25.850> pitman<00:01:26.850> arm<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.780> power<00:01:28.140> steering<00:01:28.560> box

the pitman arm on the power steering box

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.460 
the pitman arm on the power steering box
is<00:01:29.780> just<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.439> find<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.750> say<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
is just the way you find it on the say a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.469 
is just the way you find it on the say a

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.380 
if it was a bel air using a cross steer
system<00:01:44.200> he'd<00:01:45.189> probably<00:01:45.430> be<00:01:45.850> going<00:01:46.060> back<00:01:46.360> to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
system he'd probably be going back to

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:59.550 
system he'd probably be going back to
this<00:01:47.579> rear<00:01:48.990> steering<00:01:49.990> arm<00:01:50.259> back<00:01:50.439> here<00:01:58.350> my<00:01:59.350> dad

far<00:03:29.560> as<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:30.389> hydraulic<00:03:31.389> cam<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.840> concerned<00:03:34.319> I've

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
far as a hydraulic cam is concerned I've

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.920 
far as a hydraulic cam is concerned I've
heard<00:03:35.620> them<00:03:35.769> on<00:03:36.069> other<00:03:36.459> cars<00:03:36.849> on<00:03:37.090> YouTube<00:03:37.599> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
heard them on other cars on YouTube and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.559 
heard them on other cars on YouTube and
it<00:03:38.739> seems<00:03:39.099> pretty<00:03:39.220> radical<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.120> can't<00:03:40.389> wait

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
it seems pretty radical and I can't wait

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.589 
it seems pretty radical and I can't wait
to<00:03:40.720> get<00:03:40.840> this<00:03:40.989> thing<00:03:41.049> fired<00:03:41.500> up<00:03:42.329> this<00:03:43.329> is<00:03:43.510> the

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
to get this thing fired up this is the

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.809 
to get this thing fired up this is the
tire<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:43.959> rim<00:03:44.079> combination<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.040> wanted

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
tire and rim combination that I wanted

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.869 
tire and rim combination that I wanted
to<00:03:45.910> use<00:03:47.190> unfortunately<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.220> won't<00:03:48.459> be<00:03:48.579> able<00:03:48.670> to

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
to use unfortunately I won't be able to

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.149 
to use unfortunately I won't be able to
use<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.329> rear<00:03:49.540> tires<00:03:50.110> because<00:03:50.709> they're<00:03:50.950> just

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
use the rear tires because they're just

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.400 
use the rear tires because they're just
too<00:03:51.400> tall

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
too tall

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.590 
too tall
which<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.250> going<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.490> create<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.970> clearance

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
which is going to create a clearance

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.010 
which is going to create a clearance
issue<00:03:55.860> with<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.130> wheel<00:03:57.550> wells<00:03:57.850> as<00:03:58.300> you<00:03:58.840> can

issue with the wheel wells as you can

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.890 
issue with the wheel wells as you can
see<00:03:59.290> with<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.430> other<00:04:00.460> tire<00:04:01.000> combination<00:04:01.360> that

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
see with the other tire combination that

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.230 
see with the other tire combination that
was<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.260> here<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.680> started<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.250> rub<00:04:03.490> right<00:04:04.060> on

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
was on here it started to rub right on

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.000 
was on here it started to rub right on
their<00:04:04.540> eye<00:04:05.850> you're<00:04:06.850> saying<00:04:07.210> well<00:04:07.770> looks<00:04:08.770> like

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
their eye you're saying well looks like

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.200 
their eye you're saying well looks like
there's<00:04:09.250> enough<00:04:09.520> clearance<00:04:09.670> but<00:04:10.030> there

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
there's enough clearance but there

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.170 
there's enough clearance but there
really<00:04:10.360> isn't<00:04:10.890> those<00:04:11.890> rims<00:04:12.430> aren't<00:04:12.730> mounted

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
really isn't those rims aren't mounted

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.560 
really isn't those rims aren't mounted
on<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.480> axle<00:04:13.990> so<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.760> looks<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.270> there's<00:04:16.480> a

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
on the axle so it looks like there's a

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.260 
on the axle so it looks like there's a
lot<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.930> clearance<00:04:17.590> but<00:04:17.890> when<00:04:18.640> you<00:04:18.790> do<00:04:18.970> mount

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
lot of clearance but when you do mount

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.180 
lot of clearance but when you do mount
them<00:04:19.540> there's<00:04:19.780> only<00:04:19.959> about<00:04:20.290> an<00:04:20.739> inch<00:04:21.040> of

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
them there's only about an inch of

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:29.870 
them there's only about an inch of
clearance<00:04:21.690> there<00:04:27.450> there's<00:04:28.450> a<00:04:28.540> lot<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.870> issues

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
clearance there there's a lot of issues

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.610 
clearance there there's a lot of issues
probably<00:04:30.880> saying<00:04:31.240> why<00:04:31.480> don't<00:04:31.540> you<00:04:31.810> change<00:04:32.380> the

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
probably saying why don't you change the

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.110 
probably saying why don't you change the
axles<00:04:33.100> unfortunately<00:04:33.990> the<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.580> leaf<00:04:36.580> springs

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
axles unfortunately the the leaf springs

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.530 
axles unfortunately the the leaf springs
go<00:04:37.480> over<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.020> top<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.530> frame<00:04:38.800> in<00:04:38.980> the<00:04:39.100> back

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
go over the top of the frame in the back

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:47.670 
go over the top of the frame in the back
which<00:04:40.590> poses<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.800> real<00:04:42.010> problem<00:04:43.020> for<00:04:46.680> reversing

up underneath the rockers make sure I

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.170 
up underneath the rockers make sure I
put<00:06:06.690> some<00:06:06.960> heat<00:06:07.200> shield<00:06:07.530> on<00:06:07.740> there<00:06:07.950> so<00:06:08.190> it

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
put some heat shield on there so it

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.170 
put some heat shield on there so it
