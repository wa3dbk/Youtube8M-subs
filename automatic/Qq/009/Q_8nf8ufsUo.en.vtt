00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
classes and when we started this demo

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.960 
classes and when we started this demo
we've<00:03:27.940> Gloria<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:28.900> had<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.260> beautiful

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
classes we looking at because on our

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.699 
classes we looking at because on our
playthrough<00:03:34.389> video<00:03:34.780> we<00:03:34.930> did<00:03:35.079> have<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.230> youtuber

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
that question the first thing is we've

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.750 
that question the first thing is we've
got<00:03:43.180> around<00:03:43.750> another<00:03:44.349> are<00:03:44.530> we<00:03:44.650> 11<00:03:45.250> different

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
got around another are we 11 different

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.909 
got around another are we 11 different
move<00:03:46.030> sets<00:03:46.329> which<00:03:46.540> means<00:03:46.780> types<00:03:47.319> of<00:03:47.590> weapons

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
of that has of course a lot of

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.849 
of that has of course a lot of
iterations<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.450> we<00:03:52.989> have<00:03:53.139> around<00:03:53.500> 100

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
iterations but we have around 100

focused on me anyways the that's one

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.740 
focused on me anyways the that's one
thing<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.550> what<00:04:01.700> you've<00:04:01.820> seen<00:04:02.030> today<00:04:02.210> that<00:04:02.330> the

warrior<00:04:03.080> class<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.560> this<00:04:03.620> demo<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.040> we<00:04:04.160> were

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
warrior class and this demo that we were

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.020 
warrior class and this demo that we were
showing<00:04:04.510> starts<00:04:05.510> with<00:04:05.810> one<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.680> heaviest

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
showing starts with one of the heaviest

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.730 
showing starts with one of the heaviest
weapons<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.270> can<00:04:08.660> actually<00:04:08.780> use<00:04:09.110> both<00:04:09.440> by

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
weapons it can actually use both by

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.040 
weapons it can actually use both by
warrior<00:04:10.460> and<00:04:10.670> cleric<00:04:11.210> kind<00:04:11.540> of<00:04:11.750> player

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
warrior and cleric kind of player

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.860 
warrior and cleric kind of player
because<00:04:12.830> some<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.150> was<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.330> pole<00:04:14.600> sword

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
because some of the it was a pole sword

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.180 
because some of the it was a pole sword
that's<00:04:15.080> how<00:04:15.170> we<00:04:15.230> call<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.500> it's<00:04:15.710> a<00:04:15.740> real<00:04:16.010> long

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
that's how we call it it's a real long

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.900 
that's how we call it it's a real long
handle<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.239> big<00:04:17.480> sword<00:04:17.780> like<00:04:17.989> blade<00:04:18.350> and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
handle and a big sword like blade and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.280 
handle and a big sword like blade and
and<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.090> can<00:04:20.269> only<00:04:20.390> be<00:04:20.510> wielded<00:04:20.720> with<00:04:21.110> two

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
and it can only be wielded with two

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.280 
and it can only be wielded with two
hands<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:21.769> it's<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.580> think<00:04:23.060> there<00:04:23.270> are<00:04:23.300> two

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
hands so it's I think there are two

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.830 
hands so it's I think there are two
types<00:04:24.890> of<00:04:25.190> weapons<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:25.760> can't<00:04:26.210> be<00:04:26.330> used<00:04:26.690> in

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
types of weapons that can't be used in

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.290 
types of weapons that can't be used in
one<00:04:27.020> hand<00:04:27.290> that's<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.310> pole<00:04:28.580> certain<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.090> think

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
one hand that's the pole certain I think

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.650 
one hand that's the pole certain I think
it's<00:04:29.420> a<00:04:29.450> great<00:04:29.540> hammer<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.730> mmm<00:04:31.730> I<00:04:32.240> think<00:04:32.510> I

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
it's a great hammer and mmm I think I

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.000 
it's a great hammer and mmm I think I
played<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:33.020> great<00:04:33.200> hand<00:04:33.410> before<00:04:33.620> yeah

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
played the great hand before yeah

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.220 
played the great hand before yeah
definitely<00:04:34.970> yeah<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.540> played<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.960> one<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.140> was

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
definitely yeah I played that one it was

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.900 
definitely yeah I played that one it was
really<00:04:36.260> good<00:04:36.680> actually

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
really good actually

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.390 
really good actually
the<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.720> most<00:04:39.320> interesting<00:04:39.860> thing<00:04:40.070> about<00:04:40.100> the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
the the most interesting thing about the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.720 
the the most interesting thing about the
great<00:04:40.610> hammer<00:04:40.850> in<00:04:41.060> my<00:04:41.090> opinion<00:04:41.600> is<00:04:41.750> that<00:04:41.810> you

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
great hammer in my opinion is that you

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.690 
great hammer in my opinion is that you
you<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:44.090> really<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:45.230> can't<00:04:45.440> jump<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:45.950> it<00:04:46.100> we

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
you it really you can't jump with it we

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.250 
you it really you can't jump with it we
technically<00:04:47.090> have<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.360> jump<00:04:47.630> attack<00:04:47.900> in<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.080> game

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
technically have a jump attack in a game

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.750 
technically have a jump attack in a game
but<00:04:48.620> with<00:04:48.800> great<00:04:49.040> hammer<00:04:49.250> it's<00:04:49.490> more<00:04:49.640> like

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
but with great hammer it's more like

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.090 
but with great hammer it's more like
dragging<00:04:50.390> it<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:50.810> hitting<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:51.590> over<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.920> head

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
dragging it and hitting it over the head

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.920 
dragging it and hitting it over the head
it<00:04:52.340> feels<00:04:52.640> very<00:04:52.760> well<00:04:53.030> we<00:04:53.210> try<00:04:53.420> to<00:04:53.450> give<00:04:53.720> you

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
magic it's sort of independent so if you

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.050 
magic it's sort of independent so if you
say<00:05:57.710> you<00:05:57.770> have<00:05:59.169> 1500<00:06:00.169> XP<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.860> you<00:06:01.700> can<00:06:01.910> either
