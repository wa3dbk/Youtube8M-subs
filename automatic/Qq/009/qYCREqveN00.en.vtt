00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
Kraft paper actually a little bit

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.350 
Kraft paper actually a little bit
heavier<00:01:12.829> they're<00:01:13.549> actually<00:01:13.969> quite<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.180> bit

heavier they're actually quite a bit

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.200 
heavier they're actually quite a bit
heavier<00:01:14.689> than<00:01:14.750> cardstock<00:01:15.409> it's<00:01:15.619> more<00:01:15.860> like

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
heavier than cardstock it's more like

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.670 
heavier than cardstock it's more like
like<00:01:17.210> cereal<00:01:18.110> box<00:01:18.320> cardboard<00:01:18.820> like<00:01:19.820> tag<00:01:20.119> bore

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680
