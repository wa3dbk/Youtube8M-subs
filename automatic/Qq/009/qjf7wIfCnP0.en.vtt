00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 hi everyone today i'm going 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.230
 you make a short video very fast 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.660
 just to explain to you how 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.210
 to tame this thing 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.559
 this strange machine that when we do not have 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.950
 the habit looks like an instrument of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.630
 torture 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.889
 I feel a little skeptical a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.210
 eyelash curler will you tell me but 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.560
 do not we push delirium a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.640
 little bit away there to regroup and if he 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.990
 is much needed 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.520
 then of course it's not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.840
 necessary makeup is not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 necessary even since we talk about it 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.869
 well I think the fact is 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 eyelash curler makes a big difference 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.890
 in makeup and in the appearance 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.359
 general speaking eyes 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.560
 now their body and the one that me 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.309
 I use with which I will make you 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.260
 the demonstration 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.290
 it's home shaw and will die when 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 you choose your recompose he the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.250
 the better it is to be able to 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.579
 actually test it to see if the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.140
 curvature of the stuff i 'm showing you sorry 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.789
 I hope we'll see 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.440
 see that there is a curvature here and in 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.110
 do that it's going to come up against 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.280
 against your eye so what makes a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.949
 good eyelash curler 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.840
 good is the quality of the material the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.510
 rubber quality that is there 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.010
 but also the fact that he 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.090
 appropriate and appropriate to the form of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.439
 your I feel that you may be 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.700
 ask me the question and I tell myself 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.080
 poses it too is that it's 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.820
 really necessary you spend kind 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.000
 35 euros in a regret it's hot 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.600
 will die when we can have one at 8 10 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.130
 euros in supermarket and good for me 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.070
 so far I want to tell you that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.689
 yes why because I find that he has 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.799
 a great life 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.869
 when we go to search morat and we 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.360
 buy that they basically say it takes 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.420
 change the case warm that then all 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.490
 every 3 months or every 4 months 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 in all like that and then you have to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.050
 redeem a new a new 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.410
 eyelash curler kind every year or all 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.790
 the two years to which I replied that 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.480
 no but would not try to sell us a 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.700
 flat rate 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.050
 if we fight each year or what the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 times wolf what do you think I'm going 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.650
 come back spent 2.35 euros each time 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.240
 every year and not all but you have me 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.310
 well look so did not listen 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.780
 necessarily all the advice we want 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.250
 what we give you that are tips 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.260
 that make you buy stuff but 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.240
 on the other hand know that this rubber there 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.960
 in fact over time with the use 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.780
 it is damaged 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.000
 by pressing like that the bar 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.550
 of metal comes to press the cake 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.290
 hot and will dig a little a slice 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.110
 is an art of rubber and as for 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.390
 slicing and digging after a while 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.820
 you'll do like that with your eyelashes 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.140
 and it's going to go it was worth it 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.209
 twist and suddenly it's okay that's going to make a 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.700
 result this supermarket and it can even 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.840
 spoil your eyelashes careful attention to 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.830
 well my part too because I want 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.880
 to say is that if you want well 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.410
 return to combat he says 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.690
 you have to have something 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.480
 which is still in good condition and where I 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.739
 wanted to come by telling me that one 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.690
 to run aground will die for me worth the 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.709
 blow is that I have not followed their 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.110
 advice I did not change the 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.730
 rubbers by the time he had told me 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.500
 precisely and buy them there are more 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.799
 a year and rubber is still 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.120
 super super good there is no 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.560
 slice who dig inside it 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.630
 there is just a small trace but it works 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.950
 still no short gala after talking 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.209
 material for extremely long time 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.950
 I will now do everything to you 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.959
 simply the demonstration how 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.299
 do we do to find ourselves by then eh 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.269
 well i have my board i would like boards 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.250
 never mirror you take your curl 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.230
 the eyelashes in your hands so pushes it 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.430
 here and there I like to put the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.570
 major so I know it sounds 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.130
 completely stupid but I find that 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.049
 importance that when we use the 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.610
 major here on the index that allows for 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.170
 keep everything in place and that 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.610
 went in all directions we have a lot 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.230
 less likely to pinch an oath 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.390
 and now live demonstration 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.970
 live how do we keep things 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.470
 well opened and we just ask the part 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.030
 upper eyelash curler on the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.000
 upper eyelid and after you 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.640
 close gently and so you 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.079
 catch your eyelashes inside the stuff 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.350
 for now I do not support it happening 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.180
 nothing 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.670
 so if you proceed like that it is to 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.190
 say that 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.330
 you put your party first 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.099
 superior remedies against 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.550
 your eyelid and after you close 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.440
 there you go not you think the skin the 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.730
 skin of the eyelid actually if we try 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.200
 to catch the eyelashes like that all of 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.390
 after a stroke that's where we risk 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.580
 to do but really if we pose like that 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.200
 and after we close a little everything is fine 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.370
 and when you close you there 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.440
 do not go too hard you feel 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.120
 do not grab your skin and everything is going 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.260
 Well, I'm talking to you like that 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.819
 that I'm in a horror movie 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.200
 short once you have with good 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.269
 capture your eyelashes as close as possible 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.330
 the lash line there you go 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.500
 gently press 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:20.859
 you give you pats 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.210
 of 1 2 3 and the best is to do it 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.710
 in several stages like that you can 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.419
 see what you're doing and you 're getting 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.030
 do not do too much the start so there 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.950
 I gave three 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.190
 level of the eyelash root and you 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.840
 see that gentlemen have already gone back 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.210
 compared to that side but we will not 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.400
 stop there 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.900
 what we can do for good well 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.850
 back up the lines is a trick 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.350
 also it is that you take your eyelashes 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.270
 so in the way that I have you 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.150
 explained before you tighten a little bit 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.470
 and then you go back like that 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.900
 so it's scary but it does not hurt 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.100
 at all not worry about returning a 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.350
 little bit like that what goes even more 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.120
 even more reassembled back up the 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.340
 centuries to get a curve that is 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.010
 more realistic than that what we do is 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.479
 that after having done what that 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.370
 I just showed you obviously 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.570
 there I do it in many stages so that 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.220
 takes time but in truth it takes 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.039
 five this time so once you have 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.419
 do that you release it the pressure 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.970
 you go a little further in 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:23.020
 Russia in the middle as an example you 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.430
 give back up three little strokes and 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.289
 you can do it if you have them 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.510
 signs particularly a third to 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.979
 tip in order to create a really 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.120
 like that and you do not have just 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.590
 like that 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.240
 eyelashes if you see what I want 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.430
 to say I use the flexibility of my 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.630
 joints to show you first 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.720
 step we ended up with the styles 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.850
 like that and second step wpt have 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.650
 remedy in order to have a line of eyelashes 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.820
 good for but like that so I'm going 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.230
 stay like this for you 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.020
 make the difference hop I showed it 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:57.370
 two sides I do not know if we will see 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.680
 box we see yours it's as simple as 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.870
 that's friends now so you know 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.520
 tame a possible remedy 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.720
 train you do not go like there 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.130
 do not go like a nag and you 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.750
 will see that everything will be fine and 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.820
 now small epilogue of three 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.230
 little things to think about 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.760
 after curving lessins the 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.920
 first thing it's really silly but 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.510
 in fact sometimes we do not think about it 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.830
 necessarily 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.710
 it's taking that thing and then the 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.000
 clean then clean it not because 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.230
 we are hygienic psychopaths 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.320
 etc. we estimate that we will have cancer 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.430
 of the eye if we never clean 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.410
 their curves oscillate between two 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.180
 uses no it's not that but everything 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.130
 just here it turns out I'm 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.560
 not even very much makeup justin a 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.660
 little shadow like his discreet but by 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.880
 example if you have a line of liner 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.460
 or a tuxedo or whatever 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.750
 pencil savas printed here necessarily 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.730
 because you pressed against your 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.680
 eyelid and then it's definitely going to 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.330
 put forward folders like this and this 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.680
 that will just happen is that 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.900
 next time you will use and 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.660
 that you will not have the same makeup 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.090
 on the eyes you will have made a pretty 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.380
 little discreet thing already and you want 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.670
 like that for now I also know 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.340
 it's a regret if she would do that to you 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.290
 and then you print the remains of 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.770
 your makeup the night before what is 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.420
 fashion so take a little cotton 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.970
 of micellar water and then hop it cleans 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.590
 like that he's ready to be reused 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.020
 without doing any tasks 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.980
 I hope this video has been complete 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.870
 you were useful 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.140
 do not hesitate to ask me questions 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.970
 do not hesitate to share your tips 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.120
 ideas in info bar especially 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.560
 for to group them hostile since 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.580
 you may ask me 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.800
 which ones are which are not 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.510
 I honestly will not risk myself 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.130
 to answer you I only know one 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.520
 who will fail and die as I find 

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.240
 super very well suited and that of 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.069
 monoprix 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.960
 had bought and that was not TV but 

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:44.349
 here besides that I can not do anything 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.419
 to say other 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:48.130
 in any case shared between you downstairs 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:49.900
 that's why I really hope that 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.099

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.960
