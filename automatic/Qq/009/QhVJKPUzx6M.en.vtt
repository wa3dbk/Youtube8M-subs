00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
keyboards now remember I said before

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.610 
keyboards now remember I said before
they<00:00:45.519> have<00:00:45.640> five<00:00:46.089> lighted<00:00:46.870> areas<00:00:47.290> they<00:00:47.440> call

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
they have five lighted areas they call

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.100 
they have five lighted areas they call
their<00:00:47.800> active<00:00:48.250> zone<00:00:48.579> illumination<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.600> you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
their active zone illumination and you

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.020 
their active zone illumination and you
can<00:00:50.260> see<00:00:50.440> here<00:00:50.589> they<00:00:50.680> have<00:00:50.710> one<00:00:51.219> two<00:00:51.730> three

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
can see here they have one two three

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.630 
can see here they have one two three
four<00:00:52.690> five<00:00:53.110> areas<00:00:53.620> I<00:00:53.769> mean<00:00:53.920> for<00:00:54.220> me<00:00:54.309> I<00:00:54.339> would

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
four five areas I mean for me I would

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.160 
four five areas I mean for me I would
consider<00:00:54.879> this<00:00:55.089> all<00:00:55.239> one<00:00:55.420> area<00:00:55.690> but<00:00:55.899> I'm

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
consider this all one area but I'm

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.509 
consider this all one area but I'm
thinking<00:00:56.470> they're<00:00:56.620> considering<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.250> the

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
thinking they're considering that the

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.180 
thinking they're considering that the
fifth<00:00:57.790> area<00:00:58.479> SteelSeries<00:00:59.320> engine<00:00:59.860> that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
fifth area SteelSeries engine that

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.710 
fifth area SteelSeries engine that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
allows you to program all your macros

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.759 
allows you to program all your macros
and<00:01:01.899> all<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.140> stuff<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.500> they<00:01:02.589> actually

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
and all that stuff and they actually

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.100 
and all that stuff and they actually
have<00:01:03.100> raised<00:01:03.460> macro<00:01:04.059> keys<00:01:04.269> which<00:01:04.720> will<00:01:04.930> show

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
have raised macro keys which will show

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.330 
have raised macro keys which will show
you<00:01:05.170> when<00:01:05.320> we<00:01:05.379> jump<00:01:05.619> into<00:01:05.799> it<00:01:05.890> which<00:01:06.100> allowed

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
you when we jump into it which allowed

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.310 
you when we jump into it which allowed
you<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.520> jump<00:01:06.759> back<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.149> WASD<00:01:07.690> Keys<00:01:08.110> very

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
you to jump back to the WASD Keys very

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.290 
you to jump back to the WASD Keys very
fast<00:01:09.190> maybe<00:01:09.399> in<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.610> dark<00:01:09.850> room<00:01:10.030> or<00:01:10.149> something

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
fast maybe in a dark room or something

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.359 
fast maybe in a dark room or something
that<00:01:10.509> might<00:01:10.690> help<00:01:10.929> quite<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> bit<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:12.100> can<00:01:12.280> do

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
that might help quite a bit you can do

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.550 
that might help quite a bit you can do
over<00:01:12.640> one-trillion<00:01:13.539> possible<00:01:14.320> color

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
over one-trillion possible color

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.080 
over one-trillion possible color
variations<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.399> their<00:01:15.520> active<00:01:15.880> zone

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
variations and their active zone

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.480 
variations and their active zone
illumination<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.289> mean<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:17.979> guys<00:01:18.130> can<00:01:18.340> see

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
illumination so I mean you guys can see

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.910 
illumination so I mean you guys can see
right<00:01:18.670> here<00:01:18.700> they<00:01:19.210> show<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.600> one<00:01:20.259> two<00:01:20.530> three

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
right here they show it one two three

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.830 
right here they show it one two three
four<00:01:21.220> five<00:01:21.580> areas<00:01:22.000> ah<00:01:22.179> so<00:01:22.420> that's<00:01:22.600> how<00:01:22.750> they're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
four five areas ah so that's how they're

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.779 
four five areas ah so that's how they're
splitting<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.320> up<00:01:23.409> so<00:01:24.070> that's<00:01:24.340> 1<00:01:24.670> 2<00:01:25.440> 3<00:01:26.520> 4<00:01:27.520> and

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
splitting it up so that's 1 2 3 4 and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.660 
splitting it up so that's 1 2 3 4 and
then<00:01:27.850> 5<00:01:28.539> so<00:01:29.530> that<00:01:29.740> makes<00:01:29.950> sense<00:01:30.159> then<00:01:30.340> we'll

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
then 5 so that makes sense then we'll

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.520 
then 5 so that makes sense then we'll
flip<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:30.970> around<00:01:31.090> just<00:01:31.990> show<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.259> guys<00:01:32.380> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
flip it around just show you guys the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.410 
flip it around just show you guys the
back<00:01:32.679> of<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.860> box<00:01:33.069> they<00:01:33.850> just<00:01:34.060> show<00:01:34.210> more

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
back of the box they just show more

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.450 
back of the box they just show more
stuff<00:01:34.659> about<00:01:34.899> this<00:01:35.170> I'm<00:01:35.860> gonna<00:01:35.979> go<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.310> pull

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
stuff about this I'm gonna go and pull

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.680 
stuff about this I'm gonna go and pull
it<00:01:36.520> out<00:01:36.580> of<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.759> box<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.090> actually<00:01:37.210> go<00:01:37.509> over

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690

the<00:04:01.909> keyboard<00:04:02.259> very<00:04:03.259> simple<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.799> try<00:04:04.129> to<00:04:04.189> spin

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549

it around you guys can see it two USB
2.0<00:04:08.120> ports<00:04:11.500> so<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.530> mean<00:04:12.949> that's<00:04:13.310> pretty<00:04:13.579> much

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
2.0 ports so I mean that's pretty much

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.390 
2.0 ports so I mean that's pretty much
it<00:04:14.150> now<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.900> thing<00:04:15.290> is<00:04:15.319> though<00:04:15.650> if<00:04:15.919> you're<00:04:16.370> a

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
it now the thing is though if you're a

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.819 
it now the thing is though if you're a
hardcore<00:04:16.880> gamer<00:04:17.329> and<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:18.199> want<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.470> have<00:04:18.560> a

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
hardcore gamer and you want to have a

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.949 
hardcore gamer and you want to have a
bunch<00:04:19.099> of<00:04:19.220> different<00:04:19.370> macro<00:04:19.849> programs<00:04:20.389> each

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
bunch of different macro programs each

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.990 
bunch of different macro programs each
one<00:04:21.289> of<00:04:21.409> these<00:04:21.500> things<00:04:21.889> has<00:04:22.159> four<00:04:22.460> layers<00:04:22.759> so

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
one of these things has four layers so

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.670 
one of these things has four layers so
for<00:04:23.210> each<00:04:23.360> game<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.870> can<00:04:24.050> actually<00:04:24.440> make<00:04:24.650> it

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
for each game you can actually make it

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.950 
for each game you can actually make it
custom<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.460> playable<00:04:25.849> so<00:04:26.270> for<00:04:26.479> every<00:04:26.780> game
