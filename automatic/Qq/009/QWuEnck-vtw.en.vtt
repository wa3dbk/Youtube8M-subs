00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.909
 so homemade brushless 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.909
 engine 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.040
 rewound asynchronous motor on 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.040
 anchor mounted permanent magnets 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:27.320
 controller battery 40 44 volts lithium 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:37.399
 polymer what 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:37.399
 turn on thunder pen 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.270
 turnovers were 3,990 you can say 4000 yes 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:30.490
 Now let's see what I get 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.490
 one that measure it 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:02.049
 like traction moment so very 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.049
 not bad 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 brother try to give the smallest move 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.600
 so here it turns out the handle is tight 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.470
 Anna Romanova 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.500
 like so 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.440
 the motor must still be a thermocouple 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.459
 build in and check out all 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.810
 I will heat up the aluminum case 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:03:00.150
 warm up here as if there are windows for 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:05.810
 purge blind through here put 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:08.150
 impeller that the working end of the shaft here it is 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.500
 . 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:18.480
 thousands tooth star sits on 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.849
 the cone and then the driver nut is similar 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.849
 on cat so
