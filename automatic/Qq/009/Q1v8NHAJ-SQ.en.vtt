and<00:02:48.299> then<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.599> you<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:48.810> what<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.110> was<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
and then but you know what it was just

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.380 
and then but you know what it was just
my<00:02:49.530> attitude<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.670> way<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.209> know<00:02:51.360> I

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
my attitude and the way that you know I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.699 
my attitude and the way that you know I
was<00:02:51.690> brought<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.200> know<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.319> didn't<00:02:52.620> like

was brought up you know I didn't like
losing<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.330> I<00:02:54.330> think<00:02:54.569> that's<00:02:54.840> why<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> lot<00:02:55.410> of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
losing and I think that's why a lot of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.720 
losing and I think that's why a lot of
people<00:02:55.620> appreciate<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> way<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.430> played
