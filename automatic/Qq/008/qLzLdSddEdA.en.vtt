00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
stuff and it takes quite a bit of time

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.450 
stuff and it takes quite a bit of time
of<00:01:54.869> editing<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.470> little<00:01:55.770> clips<00:01:56.040> because<00:01:56.219> then

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
of editing out little clips because then

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
of editing out little clips because then
you'll<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.790> an<00:01:56.939> hour<00:01:57.180> recording<00:01:58.020> session

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you'll have an hour recording session

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.859 
you'll have an hour recording session
and<00:01:58.680> then<00:01:59.189> from<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.610> hour<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.270> only<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
and then from that hour you only get a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.740 
and then from that hour you only get a
few<00:02:01.259> minutes<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.979> clips<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> look

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
few minutes of clips so you have to look

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.240 
few minutes of clips so you have to look
through<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:03.990> whole<00:02:04.320> thing<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:04.950> clips

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
through that whole thing and get clips

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.770 
through that whole thing and get clips
and<00:02:05.490> stuff<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.939> takes<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.450> while<00:02:06.659> and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and stuff it takes a while and

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.180 
and stuff it takes a while and
unfortunately<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:10.530> what<00:02:10.830> I'm<00:02:10.950> known<00:02:11.160> for

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
unfortunately that's what I'm known for

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.150 
unfortunately that's what I'm known for
and<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:11.790> what<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.060> do<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.599> mean<00:02:12.810> not

and that's what I do I mean not

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.520 
and that's what I do I mean not
unfortunately<00:02:14.030> but<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.450> takes<00:02:14.690> time<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.200> I

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
unfortunately but it takes time and I

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.410 
unfortunately but it takes time and I
