00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
 Ford Mozart in the happen and makes acquaintance with the BF 109 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.439
 he was reported he wanted to attack me and was very aggressive in doing so 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:18.890
 I tried to sit behind him and Bourque suddenly sugar steeply 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 above 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.629
 the Messerschmitt rises circling upwards to shake off the masts 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.190
 Notes attaches itself to her heels 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.780
 completely unexpected, the German pilot gas takes way 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.780
 and the machine starts to spin 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.360
 Lord let single raced down I thought this was number five 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.620
 The machine at this altitude once again too impossible from the rails 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.310
 but he made it and I live ammo could only see it 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 but the incredible maneuver only stays for Easter 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.760
 Close one of the 4 51 in front of the door and hit him what drove him directly 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.570
 Dirk Barnert Gaal 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.210
 I'll be at Red Bull their drivers 11 I just had to go hard left 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.140
 could pull the nose to align 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.579
 fire my last shots and hit the cockpit 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.899
 I was so close 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.899
 I could see the pilot and the impacts 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:18.209
 now there were no more goals in sight the fight was over two goals 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.399
 the remaining German planes are retreating 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:31.959
 Sandi effortless 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.329
 he moves and all other pilots return to base Epsilon 29 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.329
 back 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:46.159
 he just asked me once saw a fire on the airfield I could 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.189
 can not believe that we had suffered so little damage in all cases 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.169
 during the attack, only one IP 67 was shot down 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.899
 and not a single p 51 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.129
 on the German side 24 machines were lost 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.129
 four downed pilots survived and were captured 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:19.849
 the one-sided losses over right always 29 showed the failure of the 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.849
 entire operation base plate 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.680
 Over 17 flight fields had the German air force and 30 per cent of their 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.680
 used machines lost 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.569
 a dizzying clock is giving away 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:45.899
 Rodenstock Bodenplatte was a big loss for the Germans instead of for 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:50.639
 They also shot down some of our planes, but the Allies were able to 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.649
 the Germans do not afford that 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:57.149
 they were in the end they had no fuel and no experienced pilots 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.989
 more 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.989
 no question 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.709
 The Luftwaffe could not recover from this blow 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:18.549
 the events of 17 9 29 were at the heart of this crucial one 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.099
 defeat 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.689
 she invented a battle that can not be repeated 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:29.179
 Profile machines in use and then no human losses easy 

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:30.520
 incredible 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.340
 that conveys 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.710
 correct would be 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.490
 to the mechanics the canteen staff who supplied us and who 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.169
 otherwise the military police Wolf took care of us 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.330
 Unfortunately, she was all able to directly over this dogfight with her own eyes 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.360
 follow the base report 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.110
 before the precipitation 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.199
 on the ground should have consequences 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.219
 Holes over then and all the fuss would be new 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.219
 Lorig should 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.119
 Translator 29, the American money commanded the returns 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.509
 the heroic deeds of the flyers became legends 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.819
 and accelerated the downfall of the German Air Force
