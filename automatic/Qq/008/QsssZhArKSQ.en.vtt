steps used to be able to just hit this

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.160 
steps used to be able to just hit this
pad<00:00:34.310> and<00:00:34.700> there<00:00:35.300> was<00:00:35.390> a<00:00:35.420> microphone<00:00:35.660> inside

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
pad and there was a microphone inside

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.590 
pad and there was a microphone inside
that<00:00:36.440> would<00:00:36.530> trigger<00:00:36.770> as<00:00:37.100> well<00:00:37.460> but<00:00:37.850> as<00:00:38.120> with

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
that would trigger as well but as with

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.690 
that would trigger as well but as with
most<00:00:38.930> of<00:00:39.110> these<00:00:39.200> things<00:00:39.260> at<00:00:39.560> this<00:00:39.680> age<00:00:39.950> the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
most of these things at this age the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.250 
most of these things at this age the
internal<00:00:41.120> mic<00:00:41.270> does<00:00:41.510> not<00:00:41.660> work<00:00:41.840> anymore<00:00:42.140> so

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
internal mic does not work anymore so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.410 
internal mic does not work anymore so
you<00:00:42.470> need<00:00:42.649> an<00:00:42.739> external<00:00:43.040> trigger<00:00:43.310> or<00:00:43.610> you<00:00:44.300> can

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
you need an external trigger or you can

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.330 
you need an external trigger or you can
hook<00:00:44.540> it<00:00:44.660> up<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:44.780> pretty<00:00:45.530> much<00:00:45.620> any<00:00:45.860> external

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
hook it up to pretty much any external

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.430 
hook it up to pretty much any external
audio<00:00:46.579> source<00:00:46.640> will<00:00:47.000> trigger<00:00:47.149> it<00:00:47.360> if<00:00:48.260> we

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
audio source will trigger it if we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.920 
audio source will trigger it if we
switch<00:00:48.680> it<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:48.860> repeat<00:00:52.600> it'll<00:00:53.600> just<00:00:53.780> start

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
switch it to repeat it'll just start

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.369 
switch it to repeat it'll just start
stepping<00:00:54.410> through<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.280> notes

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
stepping through the the notes

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.329 
stepping through the the notes
speed<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.559> fold<00:01:01.309> all<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.340> way<00:01:02.670> up

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
speed it up fold all the way up

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.670 
speed it up fold all the way up
sort<00:01:05.059> of<00:01:05.149> get<00:01:05.539> us<00:01:05.719> there

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.610 

the<00:01:10.680> decay<00:01:10.980> now<00:01:11.160> just<00:01:11.430> sort<00:01:11.550> of<00:01:12.440> takes<00:01:13.440> the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
the decay now just sort of takes the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.760 
the decay now just sort of takes the
notes<00:01:13.800> down<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:18.380> in<00:01:19.380> turn<00:01:19.620> out<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
notes down a little bit in turn out a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:32.750 
notes down a little bit in turn out a
little<00:01:19.950> bit<00:01:30.830> it's<00:01:31.830> fun<00:01:32.040> box<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> play<00:01:32.580> with

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
little bit it's fun box to play with

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.810 
little bit it's fun box to play with
only<00:01:33.510> because<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:35.840> makes<00:01:36.840> music<00:01:37.800> very<00:01:38.490> quickly

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
only because it makes music very quickly

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.020 
only because it makes music very quickly
but<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.690> no<00:01:39.869> luck<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> thing<00:01:40.760> this<00:01:41.760> is<00:01:41.910> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
but I have no luck the thing this is the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.210 
but I have no luck the thing this is the
earlier<00:01:42.330> model<00:01:42.690> released<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.170> maybe<00:01:43.440> 82<00:01:44.010> or<00:01:44.190> 83

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
earlier model released in maybe 82 or 83

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.609 
earlier model released in maybe 82 or 83
I'm<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.000> exactly<00:01:45.450> sure<00:01:48.229> followed<00:01:49.229> up<00:01:49.380> by<00:01:49.410> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
I'm not exactly sure followed up by the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.070 
I'm not exactly sure followed up by the
more<00:01:50.520> filled<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.330> version<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.840> drunk

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
more filled out version of the drunk

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.000 
more filled out version of the drunk
which<00:01:52.260> also<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> second<00:01:54.680> these<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
which also in a second these are the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.790 
which also in a second these are the
later<00:01:56.220> model<00:01:56.580> sequencer<00:01:57.060> drums<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:58.590> just

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
later model sequencer drums it just

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.040 
later model sequencer drums it just
expanded<00:01:59.130> upon<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.760> bit<00:02:00.000> they<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.450> but

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
expanded upon a little bit they have but

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.510 
expanded upon a little bit they have but
most<00:02:01.140> importantly<00:02:01.560> they<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.740> clock<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
most importantly they have clock in and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.790 
most importantly they have clock in and
clock<00:02:02.580> out<00:02:02.880> jacks<00:02:03.690> so<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> can<00:02:04.050> hook<00:02:04.200> multiple

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
clock out jacks so you can hook multiple

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.219 
clock out jacks so you can hook multiple
ones<00:02:04.950> together<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.600> timing<00:02:06.900> will<00:02:07.020> sync

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
ones together and the timing will sync

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.780 
ones together and the timing will sync
up<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.410> whatever<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> master<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
up to whatever is the master in this

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.590 
up to whatever is the master in this
case<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:10.489> so<00:02:11.489> each<00:02:12.030> set<00:02:12.269> this<00:02:12.390> one's

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
case this one is so each set this one's

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.240 
case this one is so each set this one's
kind<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.810> running<00:02:13.110> sort<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.500> base<00:02:13.860> this

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
kind of running sort of a base this

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.979 
kind of running sort of a base this
one's<00:02:14.459> sort<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.760> running<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.120> higher<00:02:15.570> up<00:02:15.750> lead

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
one's sort of running a higher up lead

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.309 
one's sort of running a higher up lead
so<00:02:16.800> I'm<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.160> turn<00:02:17.250> on

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:04:55.100 

so<00:02:22.799> remove<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.189> secure<00:02:23.430> each<00:02:23.519> other

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.780 

as<00:04:56.110> well<00:04:56.350> these<00:04:56.560> later<00:04:57.220> models<00:04:57.580> have<00:04:57.760> a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
as well these later models have a

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.310 
as well these later models have a
control<00:04:58.150> voltage<00:04:58.270> output<00:04:58.840> so<00:04:58.960> they<00:04:59.050> can<00:04:59.200> be

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
control voltage output so they can be

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.290 
control voltage output so they can be
used<00:04:59.530> as<00:04:59.680> envelope<00:05:00.220> generators<00:05:00.790> on<00:05:01.000> other

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
used as envelope generators on other

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.960 
used as envelope generators on other
since<00:05:01.830> these<00:05:02.830> were<00:05:03.040> made<00:05:03.340> in<00:05:03.520> 1984<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.570> believe

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
since these were made in 1984 I believe

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.090 
since these were made in 1984 I believe
as<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.180> mentioned<00:05:07.540> earlier<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.560> internal<00:05:08.920> mics

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
as I mentioned earlier the internal mics

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.650 
as I mentioned earlier the internal mics

anymore<00:05:10.960> which<00:05:11.920> is<00:05:12.070> kind<00:05:12.250> of<00:05:12.280> unfortunate

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
anymore which is kind of unfortunate

same thing is the other one they could

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.560
