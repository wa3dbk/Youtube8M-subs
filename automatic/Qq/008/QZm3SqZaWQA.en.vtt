00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.720 
this is a review of the e12 mini SD
version<00:00:12.259> as<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.349> can<00:00:13.500> see<00:00:13.730> it's

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
version as you can see it's

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.760 
version as you can see it's
spring-loaded<00:00:15.529> and<00:00:17.810> it's<00:00:18.810> also<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.350> size<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
spring-loaded and it's also the size of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.939 
spring-loaded and it's also the size of
a<00:00:19.800> normal<00:00:19.920> GBA<00:00:20.460> card<00:00:21.050> so<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.080> means<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.800> will

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
a normal GBA card so that means it will

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.609 
a normal GBA card so that means it will
stick<00:00:23.189> out<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.460> DS<00:00:23.609> lite<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.869> much<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
stick out of a DS lite this much as you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.900 
stick out of a DS lite this much as you
can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:26.150> it's<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.449> slot<00:00:27.660> too<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.289> needs<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
can see it's a slot too so it needs a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.990 
can see it's a slot too so it needs a
pass<00:00:29.910> card<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.830> most<00:00:31.830> past<00:00:32.070> past<00:00:32.489> means<00:00:32.759> don't

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
pass card and most past past means don't

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.540 
pass card and most past past means don't
work<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:34.110> past<00:00:34.290> card<00:00:34.620> 3<00:00:34.860> does<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.130> work<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
work the past card 3 does not work and

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.700 
work the past card 3 does not work and
the<00:00:35.640> super<00:00:35.910> key<00:00:36.030> does<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.270> work<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> found

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the super key does not work but I found

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.530
