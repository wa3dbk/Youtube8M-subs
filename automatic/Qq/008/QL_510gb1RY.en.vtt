00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:38.880 

yeah<00:01:27.969> it's<00:01:28.179> cool<00:01:28.420> okay<00:01:32.310> let's<00:01:33.310> write<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
yeah it's cool okay let's write the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.639 
yeah it's cool okay let's write the
tantras<00:01:39.399> blocks<00:01:39.759> are<00:01:40.060> going<00:01:40.509> down<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.140> we

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
tantras blocks are going down and we

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.850 
tantras blocks are going down and we
need<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:42.039> build<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.520> tower

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
need to build a tower

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.469 
need to build a tower
we<00:01:44.860> can<00:01:45.069> rotate<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.819> blocks<00:01:46.090> by

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
we can rotate the blocks by

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.559 
we can rotate the blocks by
double-tapping<00:01:47.110> them<00:01:47.739> or<00:01:48.009> using<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.329> side

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
double-tapping them or using the side

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.010 
double-tapping them or using the side
control<00:01:50.140> buttons<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:52.209> same<00:01:52.450> thing<00:01:52.750> with

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
control buttons the same thing with

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.600 
control buttons the same thing with
moving<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.130> objects<00:01:55.319> we<00:01:56.319> can<00:01:56.530> do<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:57.159> with

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
moving the objects we can do that with

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.319 
moving the objects we can do that with
buttons<00:01:58.420> or<00:01:58.750> just<00:01:59.500> draw<00:01:59.799> them<00:02:00.039> with<00:02:00.610> your

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
buttons or just draw them with your

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:24.680 
buttons or just draw them with your
fingers

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.150 

just<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:29.960> draw<00:02:30.960> them<00:02:31.230> using<00:02:31.980> my

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
just like this I draw them using my

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.230 
just like this I draw them using my
fingers

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.800 

we<00:02:40.660> can<00:02:40.810> also<00:02:40.990> make<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:42.120> objects<00:02:43.120> fall<00:02:43.480> down

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
we can also make the objects fall down

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.580 
we can also make the objects fall down
but<00:02:44.770> be<00:02:44.980> careful<00:02:45.780> they<00:02:46.780> may<00:02:46.959> strike<00:02:47.350> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
but be careful they may strike the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.850 
but be careful they may strike the
neighboring<00:02:48.100> figures<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:49.230> your<00:02:50.230> tower<00:02:50.530> it

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
neighboring figures and your tower it

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.760 
neighboring figures and your tower it
may<00:02:51.010> fall<00:02:51.370> down

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.770 

the<00:02:56.770> game<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.280> physics<00:02:57.970> based<00:02:58.239> saw<00:02:58.720> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
the game is physics based saw the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
the game is physics based saw the
structure<00:02:59.590> should<00:03:00.400> be<00:03:00.459> stable<00:03:00.880> enough<00:03:01.360> so

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
structure should be stable enough so

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.880 
structure should be stable enough so
that<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:03.040> could<00:03:03.310> build<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.569> tower<00:03:04.840> high<00:03:05.590> enough

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
that you could build a tower high enough

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.880 
that you could build a tower high enough
to<00:03:06.160> win<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:10.030> original<00:03:10.630> idea<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.590> game

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.210 
five minutes limit and constant speed
and<00:04:34.800> garbage<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:37.120> need<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.449> clean<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.840> screen

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.809 

let's<00:04:47.110> try<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.500> traditional<00:04:48.340> mode<00:04:50.400> so<00:04:51.400> here

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
let's try the traditional mode so here

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.420 
let's try the traditional mode so here
we<00:04:51.970> can<00:04:52.150> see<00:04:52.449> a<00:04:52.479> structure<00:04:53.289> resembling<00:04:54.159> you

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
we can see a structure resembling you

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.540 
we can see a structure resembling you
well<00:04:55.620> named<00:04:56.620> torus<00:04:58.409> we<00:04:59.409> turn<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.919> round<00:05:00.159> and

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
well named torus we turn it round and

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:11.189 
well named torus we turn it round and
round<00:05:00.880> like<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:04.979> and<00:05:08.970> we<00:05:09.970> can<00:05:10.000> place<00:05:10.810> the

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
round like this and we can place the

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.890 
round like this and we can place the
blocks<00:05:11.699> on<00:05:12.699> it<00:05:14.849> you<00:05:15.849> can<00:05:16.060> do<00:05:16.240> it<00:05:16.360> using<00:05:16.569> the

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
blocks on it you can do it using the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:36.749 
blocks on it you can do it using the
side<00:05:17.169> buttons<00:05:17.650> or<00:05:18.120> using<00:05:19.120> your<00:05:19.300> fingers

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:42.010 

so<00:05:37.759> it<00:05:38.210> happens<00:05:38.659> just<00:05:39.050> like<00:05:40.569> in<00:05:41.569> the<00:05:41.780> previous

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
so it happens just like in the previous

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:51.189 
so it happens just like in the previous
game<00:05:42.560> jewel<00:05:43.159> tour<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:49.340> can<00:05:49.580> also<00:05:50.199> make

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
game jewel tour and you can also make

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:57.790 
game jewel tour and you can also make
the<00:05:51.590> blocks<00:05:52.340> fall<00:05:53.000> faster<00:05:55.599> so<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:57.020> objective

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
the blocks fall faster so the objective

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.969 
the blocks fall faster so the objective
is<00:05:58.009> to<00:05:58.430> clear<00:05:58.939> the<00:05:59.120> lines<00:06:02.169> to<00:06:03.169> eliminate
