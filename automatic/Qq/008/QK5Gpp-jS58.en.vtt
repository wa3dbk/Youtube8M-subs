00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.900 
it's really an honor for them to be
chosen<00:02:08.360> for<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.780> journal<00:02:08.990> we<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:10.070> probably

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
chosen for the journal we have probably

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.740 
chosen for the journal we have probably
a<00:02:11.810> few<00:02:12.320> hundred<00:02:12.350> students<00:02:13.040> who<00:02:13.280> apply<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.480> have

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
a few hundred students who apply to have

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.480 
a few hundred students who apply to have
their<00:02:15.020> work<00:02:15.470> considered<00:02:15.980> for<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.190> journal

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
their work considered for the journal

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.550 
their work considered for the journal
every<00:02:16.730> year<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.630> we<00:02:17.750> end<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.110> taking

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
every year and then we end up taking

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.820 
every year and then we end up taking
between<00:02:19.340> eight<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.550> ten<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:20.450> certainly

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
between eight and ten so it's certainly

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.590 
between eight and ten so it's certainly
something<00:02:21.830> special<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.940> be<00:02:22.970> chosen<00:02:23.270> for<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
something special to be chosen for the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.810 
something special to be chosen for the
journal
