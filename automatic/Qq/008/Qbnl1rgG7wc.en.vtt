00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
no no what are your thoughts here yeah

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.979 
no no what are your thoughts here yeah
it's<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:44.969> passing<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> good<00:00:45.539> moment

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it's is not passing the good moment

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.290 
it's is not passing the good moment
they<00:00:46.140> didn't<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.250> good<00:00:47.399> work<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.030> after

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
they didn't a very good work but after

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.369 
they didn't a very good work but after
that<00:00:48.450> after<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> change<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.670> course<00:00:51.260> they<00:00:52.260> are

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
that after the change of course they are

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.720 
that after the change of course they are
not<00:00:53.210> getting<00:00:54.210> any<00:00:54.480> wing<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
not getting any wing and now they have a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.670 
not getting any wing and now they have a
good<00:00:56.969> opponent<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> return<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> win<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.649> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
good opponent to return to the win so I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.069 
good opponent to return to the win so I
think<00:00:59.039> they're<00:00:59.160> gonna<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.809> certainly<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
think they're gonna be but certainly the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.450 
think they're gonna be but certainly the
price<00:01:01.969> is<00:01:02.969> too<00:01:03.239> short<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.890> think<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
price is too short here so I think that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.490 
price is too short here so I think that
they<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.939> focus<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.450> lot<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.630> wind<00:01:07.170> again

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
they have to focus a lot on wind again

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.670 
they have to focus a lot on wind again
so<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:09.210> they're<00:01:10.110> gonna<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.439> very

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
so I think they they're gonna be very

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.580 
so I think they they're gonna be very
conservative<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.479> send<00:01:12.810> also<00:01:13.140> Carlos

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
conservative on and send also Carlos

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.640 
conservative on and send also Carlos
islands<00:01:14.040> Athens<00:01:14.610> don't<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.390> many<00:01:16.200> weapons

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
islands Athens don't have many weapons

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.460 
islands Athens don't have many weapons
on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> backs<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.170> gonna

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
on the backs so I think they they gonna

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.899 
on the backs so I think they they gonna
win<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.890> match<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.430> right

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
Championship is is a bit easy at the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
Championship is is a bit easy at the
moment<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:57.990> third<00:01:58.290> place<00:01:58.530> going<00:01:59.250> through

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
moment with third place going through

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.910 
moment with third place going through
they<00:02:00.119> already<00:02:00.329> lost<00:02:00.689> too<00:02:00.960> many<00:02:01.140> games<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.710> they

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
they already lost too many games so they

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.899 
they already lost too many games so they
have<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.310> win<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.670> game

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
have to win the game

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.380 
have to win the game
but<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.640> win<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.210> one

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
but I think that they can win just one

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
but I think that they can win just one
half<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.990> more<00:02:07.229> than<00:02:07.380> enough<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.829> them<00:02:07.979> all

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
half it's more than enough to them all

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:08.719 
half it's more than enough to them all
right

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729

enough value to play it I think that

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.059 
enough value to play it I think that
it's<00:02:31.520> low<00:02:31.730> because<00:02:32.000> like<00:02:32.569> I<00:02:32.930> was<00:02:33.680> saying<00:02:34.010> to

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
it's low because like I was saying to

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.390 
it's low because like I was saying to

Pharaoh's Iceland is a team that they

Pharaoh's Iceland is a team that they
play<00:02:37.610> only<00:02:37.760> for<00:02:37.910> proud<00:02:38.300> they<00:02:38.510> know<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.840> they

don't<00:02:39.230> have<00:02:39.470> any<00:02:39.680> chance<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.130> go<00:02:40.340> through<00:02:40.370> they

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
don't have any chance to go through they

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.449 
don't have any chance to go through they
never<00:02:41.690> go<00:02:41.959> through<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.100> European

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.110 
never go through to the to the European
Championship<00:02:43.910> so<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.890> hard<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.700> play

things<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.700> think<00:02:49.760> is<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.300> too<00:02:50.510> low<00:02:50.660> in<00:02:50.870> my

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
things I think is is too low in my

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
well then Bernardo what are the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.360

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
predictions that you have for us today

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.470 
predictions that you have for us today
from<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.060> outset<00:02:56.360> calm<00:02:56.800> well<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:59.000> prediction

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
from the outset calm well the prediction

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.309 
from the outset calm well the prediction
here<00:02:59.690> in<00:03:00.200> my<00:03:00.440> opinion<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:00.980> if<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:02.810> need<00:03:03.170> to

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
here in my opinion is that if we need to

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.440 
here in my opinion is that if we need to
win<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.620> game<00:03:03.769> but<00:03:04.160> they<00:03:04.340> are<00:03:04.760> they<00:03:05.300> are<00:03:05.420> not

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
win the game but they are they are not

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.860 
win the game but they are they are not
also<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:06.280> scoring<00:03:07.280> team<00:03:07.489> so<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:08.000> think<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:08.690> we

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
also a scoring team so I think that we

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.680 
also a scoring team so I think that we
we<00:03:09.170> can<00:03:09.350> play<00:03:09.590> here<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.400> under<00:03:10.640> 2.5<00:03:11.390> goals

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
we can play here the under 2.5 goals

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.759 
we can play here the under 2.5 goals
around<00:03:13.000> 246<00:03:14.000> which<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.660> an<00:03:14.780> amazing<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.380> our

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
around 246 which is an amazing of our

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.160 
around 246 which is an amazing of our
being<00:03:16.130> a<00:03:16.519> bit<00:03:16.700> more<00:03:16.880> cautious<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.600> played<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
being a bit more cautious and played the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.380 
being a bit more cautious and played the
under<00:03:18.680> 3.0<00:03:19.670> goals<00:03:20.049> around<00:03:21.430> 1.84<00:03:22.489> in<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:23.120> case

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
under 3.0 goals around 1.84 in this case

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.259 
under 3.0 goals around 1.84 in this case
if<00:03:23.810> there<00:03:24.140> is<00:03:24.260> three<00:03:24.530> goals<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.579> game<00:03:25.790> our

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
if there is three goals the game our

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.810 
if there is three goals the game our
stake<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.870> why<00:03:27.019> instead<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.680> lasting<00:03:28.100> on<00:03:28.459> three

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
stake is why instead of lasting on three

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.000 
stake is why instead of lasting on three
under<00:03:29.030> two<00:03:29.180> point<00:03:29.360> fractals<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.890> think<00:03:30.890> there's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
under two point fractals I think there's

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.740 
under two point fractals I think there's
our<00:03:31.100> excellence<00:03:31.489> hips<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.970> don't<00:03:32.390> think<00:03:32.660> we're

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
our excellence hips I don't think we're

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.569 
our excellence hips I don't think we're
going<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.019> see<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.200> goal<00:03:33.410> from<00:03:33.590> afar<00:03:34.040> o<00:03:34.070> islands
