00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.890 
ground or maybe the parachute doesn't
work<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.820> crashes<00:03:45.060> horrific<00:03:45.570> ly<00:03:45.690> into<00:03:45.870> a

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
work and it crashes horrific ly into a

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.300 
work and it crashes horrific ly into a
bunch<00:03:46.080> of<00:03:46.170> pieces<00:03:46.350> which<00:03:46.800> would<00:03:46.920> be<00:03:47.010> cool<00:03:47.160> as

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
bunch of pieces which would be cool as

00:03:47.310 --> 00:04:09.660 
bunch of pieces which would be cool as
well<00:03:47.490> so<00:03:48.240> let's<00:03:48.420> do<00:03:48.540> this

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.860 

all<00:04:10.670> right<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.150> here<00:04:11.330> we<00:04:11.420> are<00:04:11.450> postmortem

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
all right so here we are postmortem

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.720 
all right so here we are postmortem
and<00:04:14.870> as<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.680> see<00:04:15.860> our<00:04:16.070> parachute<00:04:16.489> didn't

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
and as you can see our parachute didn't

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.580 
and as you can see our parachute didn't
open<00:04:16.820> as<00:04:17.150> we<00:04:17.900> had<00:04:17.989> planned<00:04:18.109> in<00:04:18.320> one<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.530> our

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
open as we had planned in one of our

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.099 
open as we had planned in one of our
possible<00:04:18.980> options<00:04:19.690> we<00:04:20.690> brought<00:04:20.870> up<00:04:20.989> our

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
possible options we brought up our

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.230 
possible options we brought up our
screenshot<00:04:21.620> here<00:04:21.829> of<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.790> data<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.060> we

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.810 
recorded of the car standing still you
can<00:04:26.990> see<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.139> large<00:04:27.380> spike<00:04:27.740> but<00:04:28.430> when<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.669> car

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
can see a large spike but when the car

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.820 
can see a large spike but when the car
was<00:04:28.910> pushed<00:04:29.150> off<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.480> roof<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.780> then<00:04:30.440> here<00:04:30.740> is

parachute would have opened this is a
perfect<00:05:02.960> example<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.500> why<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:03.650> should

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
perfect example of why you should

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.740 
perfect example of why you should
prototype<00:05:04.520> all<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:04.760> your<00:05:04.910> projects<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.570> find

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
prototype all of your projects to find

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.050 
prototype all of your projects to find
bugs<00:05:05.960> like<00:05:06.169> this<00:05:06.410> we<00:05:07.220> sure<00:05:07.400> did<00:05:07.580> have<00:05:07.669> a<00:05:07.729> lot<00:05:07.940> of

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
bugs like this we sure did have a lot of

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.670 
bugs like this we sure did have a lot of
fun<00:05:08.240> prototyping<00:05:08.720> though<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:12.050> I<00:05:12.380> hope<00:05:12.530> all<00:05:12.650> of

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
fun prototyping though and I hope all of

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.080 
fun prototyping though and I hope all of
your<00:05:12.830> prototypes<00:05:13.250> are<00:05:13.400> just<00:05:13.550> as<00:05:13.669> much<00:05:13.789> fun

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
your prototypes are just as much fun

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.870 
your prototypes are just as much fun
thanks<00:05:14.630> for<00:05:14.780> watching
