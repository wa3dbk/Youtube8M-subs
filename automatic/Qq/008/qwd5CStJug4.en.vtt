00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.720 
fantastic so I'm gonna try the archer
this<00:00:19.470> time<00:00:20.000> Ashley<00:00:21.000> had<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.330> left<00:00:22.460> Ashley<00:00:23.460> had

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
this time Ashley had one left Ashley had

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.109

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
I think we gotta win with these I think

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.170 
I think we gotta win with these I think
we're<00:05:36.410> going<00:05:36.590> by<00:05:36.919> my<00:05:37.130> time<00:05:37.370> coming<00:05:37.640> under<00:05:37.940> that

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
we're going by my time coming under that

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.060 
we're going by my time coming under that
okay<00:05:38.750> so<00:05:38.810> let's<00:05:39.140> try<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.440> go<00:05:39.620> towards<00:05:39.919> the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
okay so let's try to go towards the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.370 
okay so let's try to go towards the
center<00:05:40.340> which<00:05:40.490> is<00:05:40.520> this<00:05:40.820> way<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:41.330> maybe<00:05:42.050> if<00:05:42.229> we

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
center which is this way and maybe if we

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.310 
center which is this way and maybe if we
just<00:05:42.410> shift<00:05:42.919> like<00:05:43.760> close<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.419> center<00:05:44.750> but

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320
