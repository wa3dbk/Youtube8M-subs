for me and I've obviously pissed picked
what<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:49.130> think<00:04:49.400> is<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.670> better<00:04:49.850> of<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.150> two

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
what I think is the better of the two

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.150 
what I think is the better of the two
what's<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:50.960> free<00:04:51.140> kick<00:04:51.380> I'm<00:04:52.040> not

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
what's this for a free kick I'm not

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.480 
what's this for a free kick I'm not
gonna<00:04:52.280> say<00:04:52.430> anything<00:04:52.550> just<00:04:52.670> o<00:04:54.490> keeper

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
gonna say anything just o keeper

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.460 
gonna say anything just o keeper
probably<00:04:55.850> should<00:04:56.000> have<00:04:56.060> done<00:04:56.120> better<00:04:56.450> but<00:04:57.050> you

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
probably should have done better but you

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.510 
probably should have done better but you
know<00:04:57.500> look<00:04:57.920> at<00:04:57.980> the<00:04:58.040> picture<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.340> picture

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
know look at the picture and picture

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.810 
know look at the picture and picture
it's<00:04:58.850> just<00:04:59.440> right<00:05:00.440> at<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:01.010> keeper<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.580> it's

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
it's just right at the keeper and it's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.330 
it's just right at the keeper and it's
just<00:05:02.060> bending<00:05:02.570> dipping<00:05:03.170> curving<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:03.950> the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
just bending dipping curving and the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.400 
just bending dipping curving and the
keeper<00:05:04.670> has<00:05:04.820> absolutely<00:05:05.630> no<00:05:05.900> chance<00:05:06.140> although

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
keeper has absolutely no chance although

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.110 
keeper has absolutely no chance although
I<00:05:06.500> do<00:05:06.650> think<00:05:06.800> he<00:05:07.190> should<00:05:07.430> be<00:05:07.550> saving<00:05:07.790> it<00:05:08.030> from

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
I do think he should be saving it from

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.220 
I do think he should be saving it from
there<00:05:08.330> just<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.690> little<00:05:08.720> bit<00:05:08.960> out<00:05:09.020> of<00:05:09.050> position

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
there just a little bit out of position

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.890 
there just a little bit out of position
he's<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.620> bit<00:05:09.800> too<00:05:09.980> far<00:05:10.250> forward<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.820> he<00:05:11.720> gets

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
he's a bit too far forward and he gets

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.960 
he's a bit too far forward and he gets
caught<00:05:12.140> out<00:05:12.170> once<00:05:12.590> again<00:05:12.740> Balotelli<00:05:13.460> comes<00:05:13.820> in

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
pretty much all the time apart from

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.070 
pretty much all the time apart from
maybe<00:06:53.070> ten<00:06:53.520> percent<00:06:53.910> where<00:06:54.210> he<00:06:54.330> was<00:06:54.450> wounded<00:06:54.780> a

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
maybe ten percent where he was wounded a

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.390 
maybe ten percent where he was wounded a
little<00:06:55.380> bit<00:06:55.500> but<00:06:55.620> only<00:06:55.860> a<00:06:55.890> little<00:06:56.010> bit<00:06:56.250> down

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
little bit but only a little bit down

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.720 
little bit but only a little bit down
the<00:06:56.550> pitch<00:06:56.760> what<00:06:57.630> are<00:06:57.720> the<00:06:57.810> cons<00:06:58.310> to<00:06:59.310> cons<00:06:59.550> for

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
the pitch what are the cons to cons for

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.760 
the pitch what are the cons to cons for
me<00:06:59.850> and<00:07:00.000> that<00:07:00.060> is<00:07:00.270> all<00:07:00.450> first<00:07:00.870> one<00:07:01.110> is<00:07:01.320> clunky

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:28.920
