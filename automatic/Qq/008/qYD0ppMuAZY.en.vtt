00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.770 

and<00:01:50.130> there<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.520> end<00:01:51.789> up<00:01:51.969> with<00:01:52.149> something<00:01:52.420> that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
and there you end up with something that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.969 
and there you end up with something that
I<00:01:52.810> think<00:01:52.960> looks<00:01:53.500> very<00:01:53.799> much<00:01:54.070> like<00:01:55.799> almost<00:01:56.799> like

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
I think looks very much like almost like

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.539 
I think looks very much like almost like
Sumi<00:01:57.579> ink<00:01:57.729> painting<00:01:58.560> now<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.920> course<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.490> could

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
Sumi ink painting now of course I could

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.309 
Sumi ink painting now of course I could
have<00:02:00.969> put<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.240> sky<00:02:01.659> in<00:02:01.960> first<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.140> don't

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
have put a sky in first but you don't

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.889 
have put a sky in first but you don't
have<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.860> with<00:02:06.100> wax<00:02:06.399> you<00:02:06.939> could<00:02:07.240> leave<00:02:07.539> it<00:02:07.569> this

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
have to with wax you could leave it this

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.229 
have to with wax you could leave it this
way<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.410> add<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.220> sky<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> different

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
way and add a sky in with a different

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.390 
way and add a sky in with a different
medium<00:02:10.660> for<00:02:11.260> instance<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:12.040> could<00:02:12.190> use

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
medium for instance you could use

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.910 
medium for instance you could use
watercolor<00:02:13.090> washes<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.690> could<00:02:13.870> use<00:02:14.110> you

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
watercolor washes you could use you

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.850 
watercolor washes you could use you
could<00:02:14.950> stain<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.730> with<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.750> rubber<00:02:17.440> stamp

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
could stain it with the rubber stamp

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.070 
could stain it with the rubber stamp
dyes<00:02:18.299> there's<00:02:19.299> just<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.569> lot<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.810> different

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
dyes there's just a lot of different

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.809 
dyes there's just a lot of different
things<00:02:20.349> you<00:02:20.410> could<00:02:20.560> do<00:02:20.769> with<00:02:20.799> this<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:21.610> this

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
things you could do with this but this

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.699 
things you could do with this but this
technique<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.540> great<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.079> know<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.560> you

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
technique is great to know that you

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.710 
technique is great to know that you
could<00:02:23.860> take<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.370> for<00:02:24.670> instance<00:02:24.790> make<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> big

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
could take a for instance make a big

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.229 
could take a for instance make a big
rock<00:02:26.049> in<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.709> front<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.160> your<00:02:27.310> painting<00:02:27.880> with

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
rock in the front of your painting with

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.059 
rock in the front of your painting with
this<00:02:28.420> technique<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:28.959> get<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.470> rock<00:02:29.769> that<00:02:30.010> you

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
this technique and get a rock that you

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.910 
this technique and get a rock that you
can't<00:02:30.549> get<00:02:30.849> looked<00:02:31.269> like<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.260> any<00:02:32.530> other<00:02:32.620> way

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
can't get looked like in any other way

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.460 
can't get looked like in any other way
except<00:02:33.610> with<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> Kleenex<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.079> this<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.440> a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
except with the Kleenex so this is a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.989 
except with the Kleenex so this is a
really<00:02:35.920> great<00:02:36.099> one<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.510> play<00:02:37.720> with
