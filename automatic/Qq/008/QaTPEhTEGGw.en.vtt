 by gigi to have more armor 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.030

 so this game is going to go to the side 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.230

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.239

 Be careful with punch, I do not have punch 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.500
 I have a canary pin and I say that some 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.810
 day this gentleman will run out of arrows 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.240
 then I can come and do this 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.730

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.680
 then or the little bananas that were 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.720

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.100
 consists of sowing panic in skybox 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.600
 and once without more if they are crazy like 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.850
 always panic for that 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.340

 Germans is to fly until later the 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.300
 challenge was to spread the panic more and the challenge 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.709
 was to plant the comments so 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.059
 I had pants and I did not have any 

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:45.219
 I'm really used to always 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:47.019
 iron but here as I do not have anything then 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.669
 a little weirder the truth and good 

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:50.139
 when this game ends, you will not know 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.059
 of the video because as always at the end 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.889
 It comes the funniest part clips 

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:55.509

 well of armor but of course the thing is 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.249
 in on the sword in this case that is a 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.300
 because it is a room that removes nothing 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.979
 or thrown that what does not take away 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.019
