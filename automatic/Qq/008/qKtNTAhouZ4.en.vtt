cats<00:02:49.040> now<00:02:50.040> fortunately<00:02:50.580> we<00:02:51.540> do<00:02:51.660> have<00:02:51.780> a

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
cats now fortunately we do have a

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.800 
cats now fortunately we do have a
creative<00:02:52.140> group<00:02:52.650> at<00:02:52.880> Apple<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.480> can<00:02:54.600> think

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
creative group at Apple and we can think

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.440 
creative group at Apple and we can think
out<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.050> box<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:56.790> thought<00:02:56.970> maybe

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
out of the box and so we thought maybe

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.090 
out of the box and so we thought maybe
we<00:02:57.690> could<00:02:57.720> take<00:02:58.020> this<00:02:58.200> lion<00:02:58.530> thing<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.040> a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
we could take this lion thing in a

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.910 
we could take this lion thing in a
different<00:02:59.130> direction<00:02:59.960> so<00:03:00.960> I'm<00:03:01.080> proud<00:03:01.860> to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
different direction so I'm proud to
