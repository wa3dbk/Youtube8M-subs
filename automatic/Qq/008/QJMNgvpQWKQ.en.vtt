00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.160
 even before the flowering you should get the 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.420
 position times to look at what shoots 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.840
 actually be cut out 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.290
 have to 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.320
 this one is going up and up here 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.380
 is still the piece from the section of 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.340
 from the last cut right here to the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:38.530
 the cut must be misjudged 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.630
 the piece far away and this stand 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.010
 we can find such shoots 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.250
 Increased in position 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.109
 there is another one here too i need 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.750
 I decide how the tree should go 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.800
 inward or outward what a 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.719
 form he should get 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.920
 this position should be a round shape 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.570
 received later 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.519
 after flowering when the shoots 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.829
 I'll shoot the inside up 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.140
 lying gears cut off in these 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.519
 trunk are very many ramification too 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.310
 Here I will have to decide 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:10.330
 which of these should always go 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.550
 if such a v is created on one 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:19.080
 at least one soft side 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.080
 it blooms in full splendor 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 a single flower 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.970
 the position the position will be after the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.340
 flowering cut 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.850
 why after flowering you can do that 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.100
 are these specimens in the upper region 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.670
 not as many flowers as in the lower one 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.190
 Area 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.130
 that's because they last 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.530
 been cut too late in the year 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.150
 is she still going out then because 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.680
 Ultimately , you can preside over that 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.290
 Crop all year round 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.030
 but if you have a hefty money in the 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.490
 you want to have spring now 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.390
 determine what shapes the fujitsu 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.369
 should have 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.970
 I will speak today of some cross 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.350
 expelled from this positive deport 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.650
 For this purpose, I sharp myself once 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.660
 my little pruning shears nice and sharp 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.020
 Now I cut some transversal shoots 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.020
 Out 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.129
 You can say clearly what I know 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.629
 let stand the tree should after 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.950
 go outside and so on later 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.379
 wonderful dispute 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:50.780
 here are some devils forks 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:56.430
 created too much 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.560
 here you can clearly see such a 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.909
 devil cable 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.010
 I have to decide now 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.189
 which side the fujitsu should grow 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.900
 and then I'll remove the other as well 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:12.209
 here where diverse branch very close 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.599
 I will always look at each other 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:21.450
 which side I would like to remove here 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:24.599
 tell me to give it to the outside and 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.269
 so i take the smaller branching 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.659
 in the middle of the fujitsu are whole 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.540
 many ramifications this I have now 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.879
 strong from the driving time of the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.310
 position starts now in this 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.859
 area are a gear above and we 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.590
 again, that can be many 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.069
 ramification on both sides 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.489
 have developed 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.870
 if I want to say to a branch that 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.680
 at this point do not continue 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.239
 should grow 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.239
 I cut this above the last 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.239
 green 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:08.610
 I repeat that in the places and 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.520
 bring the chairmanship here in form 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.520
 smaller green shoots double 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:23.160
 grow I remove left times 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:24.990
 right with it 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.720
 wehrheim ultimately not too heavy 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.420
 will be and the fujitsu from the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.090
 desired shape brings when cutting 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.500
 the transversal drive takes care of that 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.250
 the harlem behind 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:43.620
 can keep alone and not easy 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.090
 boring in the area dangles that 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.980
 is a whole lot of straw 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.110
 come down in this form should the 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.260
 flower position next year 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.480
 you tell her that she's around at least 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.180
 just as much as you drive her 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.550
 that's taken after flowering 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.880
 logically as well since only the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.580
 had high shoots and the roots work 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.890
 still the old is that 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:20.880
 yes responsible for the shoot everything 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:24.660
 now in the future so that the 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.110
 it will keep its round shape 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.220
 I have to go there in the summer if that 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.870
 sun in the zenith is powerful 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.510
 Definitely make two three times a year 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:41.330
 but exactly in this form as we do 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:47.400
 now she will see and in this size 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:54.810
 next year and in one 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:59.030
 real nice money from nature for 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.030
 the nature new order
