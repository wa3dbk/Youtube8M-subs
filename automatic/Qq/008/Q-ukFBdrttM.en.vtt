00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.280
 Too hot as it is currently great 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.050

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.619

 We have raised these beautiful words with you 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.710
 the flower and matching conspiracy 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.509
 tied to it the first steps to it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.250
 But you could also exchange with one 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.289
 Construction machine depending on what kind 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.509

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.090
 gäden folksfest already rather festive 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.880

 festive on the other party 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.179
 Often with the building you guess what 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.319
 is simply insensitive but if 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.350
 you want to show a little something that 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.690
 something obviously been great already 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.289
 It's also very new 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.390
 Come in are really nice part 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.539
 a bit more noble with such an old one 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.580
 silk becoming waxy 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.550
 it is now ready, it is also 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.289
 an old technology that likes to tinsel 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.899
 few special highlights trend is there 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.819
 eg this research here is fixed 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.560
 and here he does that too 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.599
 Of course, the goal is immense if that's what it is 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.940
 Great thing is up and then we have 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.800
 the disturbance that these hackers do 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.590
 that is something completely hidden 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.390
 traditional this hook the blouse 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.069
 the transparent that then not so 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.650
 Traditionally, this is still the case 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.630
 transparent fabrics lace fabrics in 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.700
 the blouse in any case there really is 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.780
 not quite popular with aprons anymore 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.569
 so strong because it really stops 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.590
 sensitive it just well informed 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.330
 it goes into the locker room 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.520
 that is very exclusive dirndl 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.580
 a bit monster traditionally kept 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.230
 through the fabric and the apron 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.610
 a very nice industry 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.800
 you really do not need it 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.900
 other jewelry more beautiful 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.900
 because only the outfit is complete 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.290
 we have parents airy summer dirndl 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.370
 made of a light cotton fabric 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.590
 it is up to fashion food 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.659
 which is a huge theme for the folk festival 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.040
 from the beautiful chain of small with 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:11.560
 rhinestones you are exhausting 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.450
 I know but it was worth it 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.849
 for what I have decided that 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.739
