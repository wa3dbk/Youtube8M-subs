00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
compact so you can just stick that right

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.250 
compact so you can just stick that right
in<00:01:13.870> here<00:01:14.230> if<00:01:14.350> you're<00:01:14.560> on<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.130> go<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:17.110> stick

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
in here if you're on the go I just stick

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.960 
in here if you're on the go I just stick
that<00:01:17.290> in<00:01:17.440> there<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.920> it's<00:01:18.040> pretty<00:01:18.610> securely

that in there and it's pretty securely

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.170 
that in there and it's pretty securely
in<00:01:19.240> there<00:01:19.390> too<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:20.200> then<00:01:20.920> this<00:01:21.340> mouse<00:01:21.520> uses

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
in there too and then this mouse uses

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.470 
in there too and then this mouse uses
one<00:01:22.660> double<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.230> battery<00:01:23.620> here<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.060> little

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
one double a battery here is the little

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.210 
one double a battery here is the little
laser<00:01:25.660> pointer<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.320> we<00:01:26.590> have<00:01:26.740> an<00:01:26.890> on/off

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
laser pointer and we have an on/off

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.070 
laser pointer and we have an on/off
switch<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.180> don't<00:01:28.390> really<00:01:28.510> need<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.810> use

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
switch that you don't really need to use

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.100 
switch that you don't really need to use
since<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:30.670> device<00:01:30.910> pretty<00:01:31.360> much<00:01:31.540> turns

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
since this device pretty much turns

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.310 
since this device pretty much turns
itself<00:01:32.440> off<00:01:32.650> after<00:01:32.980> a<00:01:33.160> certain<00:01:33.460> amount<00:01:33.640> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
itself off after a certain amount of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.360 
itself off after a certain amount of
inactivity<00:01:36.300> so<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.560> previous<00:01:38.980> Mouse<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.340> have

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
inactivity so the previous Mouse I have

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.690 
inactivity so the previous Mouse I have
is<00:01:40.440> considerably<00:01:41.440> bigger<00:01:41.770> than<00:01:42.040> this<00:01:42.160> and<00:01:42.550> it

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
is considerably bigger than this and it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.560 
is considerably bigger than this and it
was<00:01:42.820> wired<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:44.500> one<00:01:44.710> is<00:01:44.830> definitely<00:01:44.950> smaller

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
was wired this one is definitely smaller

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.540 
was wired this one is definitely smaller
it<00:01:46.570> weighs<00:01:46.900> more<00:01:47.230> which<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.830> personally<00:01:48.070> like

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
it weighs more which I personally like

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.860 
it weighs more which I personally like
because<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:48.940> like<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.240> have<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.420> little<00:01:49.570> bit<00:01:49.780> of

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
because I like to have a little bit of

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.600 
because I like to have a little bit of
weight<00:01:50.050> when<00:01:50.350> moving<00:01:50.650> around<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.580> don't

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
weight when moving around so I don't

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.050 
weight when moving around so I don't
move<00:01:51.850> around<00:01:52.060> too<00:01:52.300> much<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.160> in<00:01:54.160> general<00:01:54.670> this

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
move around too much so in general this

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.820 
move around too much so in general this
is<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.240> really<00:01:55.540> good<00:01:55.660> Mouse<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:56.140> definitely<00:01:56.680> like

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
is a really good Mouse I definitely like

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.430 
is a really good Mouse I definitely like
it<00:01:57.150> it<00:01:58.150> did<00:01:58.390> take<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.630> little<00:01:58.900> bit<00:01:59.020> while<00:01:59.170> a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
it it did take a little bit while a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.260 
it it did take a little bit while a
little<00:01:59.770> while<00:01:59.890> to<00:02:00.070> get<00:02:00.190> used<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.490> since<00:02:01.000> it<00:02:01.120> was

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
little while to get used to since it was

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
little while to get used to since it was
smaller<00:02:02.050> but<00:02:02.550> wasn't<00:02:03.550> too<00:02:03.850> big<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.180> deal<00:02:04.390> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
smaller but wasn't too big of a deal so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.770 
smaller but wasn't too big of a deal so
that's<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.640> mouse<00:02:06.790> now<00:02:07.300> I'm<00:02:07.390> going<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.600> move

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
that's the mouse now I'm going to move

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.410 
that's the mouse now I'm going to move
on<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.229> keyboard<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.819> on<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.119> Left<00:02:10.300> we

feel nice but you sort of have to push
them<00:03:45.080> down<00:03:45.250> considerably<00:03:46.250> harder<00:03:46.610> than

on<00:03:52.250> these<00:03:52.430> keys<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:54.350> don't<00:03:54.500> definitely<00:03:55.209> like

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
on these keys you don't definitely like

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.449 
on these keys you don't definitely like
it<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.420> lot<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.840> they're<00:03:57.800> definitely<00:03:58.220> softer

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
it a lot and they're definitely softer

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.040 
it a lot and they're definitely softer
than<00:03:58.790> when<00:03:58.910> I<00:03:58.940> first<00:03:59.150> got<00:03:59.390> this<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.690> couple

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
than when I first got this a couple

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.560 
than when I first got this a couple
weeks<00:04:00.230> ago<00:04:00.350> so<00:04:00.800> they<00:04:01.580> do<00:04:01.640> eventually<00:04:01.850> break<00:04:02.360> in

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
weeks ago so they do eventually break in

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.640 
weeks ago so they do eventually break in
which<00:04:02.930> is<00:04:03.080> nice<00:04:04.540> now<00:04:05.540> on<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.019> actual<00:04:06.200> keys

for the keyboard they're pretty small
you<00:04:09.500> have<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.739> learn<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.430> adjust<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:11.300> these<00:04:11.540> new

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
you have to learn to adjust to these new

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.220 
you have to learn to adjust to these new
things

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
things

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.220 
things
the<00:04:13.220> keys<00:04:13.400> are<00:04:13.580> pretty<00:04:13.850> small<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.660> shift<00:04:14.989> key

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
the keys are pretty small the shift key

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.990 
the keys are pretty small the shift key
on<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.560> right<00:04:15.739> is<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.430> only<00:04:16.609> one<00:04:16.850> I've<00:04:16.970> ever

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
on the right is the only one I've ever

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.810 
on the right is the only one I've ever
really<00:04:17.390> used<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:17.959> any<00:04:18.229> keyboard<00:04:18.820> it's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
really used on any keyboard it's

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.400 
really used on any keyboard it's
definitely<00:04:20.330> smaller<00:04:20.660> than<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.080> one<00:04:21.200> on<00:04:21.229> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
definitely smaller than the one on the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.090 
definitely smaller than the one on the
left<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:23.630> that<00:04:23.900> can<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.830> can<00:04:24.890> become

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
left so that can be that can become

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.740 
left so that can be that can become
frustrating<00:04:25.580> sometimes<00:04:28.390> here<00:04:29.390> we<00:04:29.510> have<00:04:29.630> the

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:51.679 
we have a function key which does

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:54.399 
we have a function key which does
various<00:04:52.099> things<00:04:52.339> in<00:04:52.729> combination<00:04:53.419> with<00:04:53.599> other

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
various things in combination with other

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.569 
various things in combination with other
keys<00:04:54.679> but<00:04:55.519> you<00:04:56.439> have<00:04:57.439> it<00:04:57.649> in<00:04:57.829> between<00:04:58.279> your

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:04.249 
you think that when they would put the

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.669 
you think that when they would put the
function<00:05:04.489> key<00:05:04.879> to<00:05:05.149> the<00:05:05.269> left<00:05:05.509> that<00:05:06.349> would<00:05:06.499> just

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:06.679 
function key to the left that would just

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:08.679 
function key to the left that would just
sort<00:05:07.129> of<00:05:07.219> be<00:05:07.279> the<00:05:07.489> normal<00:05:07.819> way<00:05:08.089> of<00:05:08.119> doing<00:05:08.269> this

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
sort of be the normal way of doing this

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.999 
sort of be the normal way of doing this
but<00:05:09.499> you<00:05:10.539> do<00:05:11.539> learn<00:05:11.749> to<00:05:11.809> you<00:05:12.559> do<00:05:12.679> just

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
but you do learn to you do just

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.529 
but you do learn to you do just
yourselves<00:05:13.429> to<00:05:13.519> these<00:05:13.610> new<00:05:13.819> things<00:05:14.029> and<00:05:14.419> it

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
yourselves to these new things and it

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.449 
yourselves to these new things and it
ended<00:05:14.749> up<00:05:14.869> being<00:05:14.929> really<00:05:15.679> nice<00:05:15.829> I<00:05:16.129> could<00:05:16.309> type

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:16.459 
ended up being really nice I could type

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:19.779 
ended up being really nice I could type
really<00:05:16.669> fast<00:05:17.439> it<00:05:18.439> sounds<00:05:18.919> ok<00:05:19.339> when<00:05:19.699> you're

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.999 
really fast it sounds ok when you're
typing<00:05:20.239> it's<00:05:20.449> not<00:05:20.599> that<00:05:20.839> loud<00:05:21.079> like<00:05:21.679> some

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009
