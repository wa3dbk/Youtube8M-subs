00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
to the light standard which became a

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.140 
to the light standard which became a
standard<00:03:01.329> in<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.200> 50s<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.150> established

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
standard in in the 50s and established

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.180 
standard in in the 50s and established
this<00:03:04.329> standard<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.930> brought<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.680> same<00:03:05.890> look

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
this standard and brought the same look

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.589 
this standard and brought the same look
into<00:03:06.519> these<00:03:06.670> lenses<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.299> they<00:03:07.480> are<00:03:07.540> very

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
into these lenses so they are very

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.199 
into these lenses so they are very
classic<00:03:08.319> they<00:03:08.470> are<00:03:08.560> very<00:03:08.799> compact<00:03:09.340> like<00:03:10.030> some

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
classic they are very compact like some

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.020 
classic they are very compact like some
old<00:03:10.360> lenses<00:03:10.810> were<00:03:11.049> very<00:03:11.829> lightweight<00:03:12.129> those

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
old lenses were very lightweight those

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.140 
old lenses were very lightweight those
are<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.269> advantages<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.319> very<00:03:15.250> small<00:03:15.610> compact

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
are the advantages so very small compact

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.750 
are the advantages so very small compact

start<00:03:34.989> new<00:03:35.850> plus<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:37.030> course<00:03:37.060> if<00:03:37.359> it's<00:03:37.510> all<00:03:37.660> in

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
start new plus of course if it's all in

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.809 
start new plus of course if it's all in
mount<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.200> like<00:03:38.350> we<00:03:38.500> said<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.829> works<00:03:39.400> with<00:03:39.549> film

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
mount so like we said it works with film

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.569 
mount so like we said it works with film
or<00:03:40.030> digital<00:03:40.380> exactly<00:03:41.380> it's<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.590> regular<00:03:42.010> amount

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
or digital exactly it's a regular amount

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.970 
or digital exactly it's a regular amount
so<00:03:42.880> it<00:03:43.150> fits<00:03:43.420> on<00:03:43.569> any<00:03:43.720> camera<00:03:44.109> which<00:03:44.470> has<00:03:44.680> an<00:03:44.829> M

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
so it fits on any camera which has an M

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.849 
so it fits on any camera which has an M
mount<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:46.079> therefore<00:03:47.079> you<00:03:47.260> know<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.470> can<00:03:47.739> go

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
mount and therefore you know you can go

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.729 
mount and therefore you know you can go
back<00:03:48.069> into<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:49.180> 50s<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:50.139> know<00:03:50.260> use<00:03:50.530> any

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
back into the 50s and you know use any
