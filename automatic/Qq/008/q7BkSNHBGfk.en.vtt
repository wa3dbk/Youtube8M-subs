00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
makes your book different what I teach

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.560 
makes your book different what I teach
people<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.500> realistic<00:00:47.340> approach<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:48.239> not

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
people is a realistic approach to not

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
people is a realistic approach to not
only<00:00:48.750> losing<00:00:49.289> weight<00:00:49.500> keeping<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.579> weight

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
only losing weight keeping that weight

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.420 
only losing weight keeping that weight
off<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.030> staying<00:00:51.809> healthy<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.160> say

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
off and staying healthy and I say

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
off and staying healthy and I say
realistic<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.930> diets

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
realistic because a lot of the diets

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.779 
realistic because a lot of the diets
that<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.680> are<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.370> realistic

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that are out there are not realistic

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.869 
that are out there are not realistic
long-term<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.890> you've<00:00:59.190> probably<00:00:59.340> seen

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
long-term so as you've probably seen

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
long-term so as you've probably seen
before<00:01:00.239> people<00:01:00.780> lose<00:01:00.960> weight<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.680> they

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
before people lose weight but then they

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070 
before people lose weight but then they
can't<00:01:02.160> stick<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.910> whatever<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.930> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
can't stick to whatever it is that that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.899 
can't stick to whatever it is that that
particular<00:01:04.260> diet<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.159> teaching<00:01:05.580> them<00:01:05.729> or

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
particular diet was teaching them or

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.789 
particular diet was teaching them or
telling<00:01:06.240> them<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.420> eat<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.619> gained

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
telling them to eat and then they gained

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
telling them to eat and then they gained
the<00:01:07.950> weight<00:01:07.979> right<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:09.180> ends<00:01:09.450> up

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the weight right back and it ends up

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
the weight right back and it ends up
being<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.960> yo-yo<00:01:10.229> cycle<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.610> get

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
being a yo-yo cycle and they get

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.210 
being a yo-yo cycle and they get
frustrated<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:13.320> give<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.130> the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
only lost the weight but for the first

solution<00:03:41.079> really<00:03:41.920> is<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.160> solution<00:03:42.820> because<00:03:43.180> I

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
solution really is a solution because I

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.880 
solution really is a solution because I
know<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.450> say<00:03:43.720> it's<00:03:43.900> different<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:44.500> why<00:03:44.680> not

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
know you say it's different but why not

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.710 
know you say it's different but why not
just<00:03:45.070> go<00:03:45.220> with<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.459> mainstream<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.690> know

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
just go with the mainstream you know

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.479 
just go with the mainstream you know
Danielle<00:03:47.200> unfortunately<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.980> mainstream

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
Danielle unfortunately the mainstream

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.890 
Danielle unfortunately the mainstream
it's<00:03:48.820> not<00:03:49.090> working<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.720> we<00:03:50.260> see<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.769> in<00:03:51.070> our

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
it's not working and we see that in our

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.270 
it's not working and we see that in our
communities<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:52.930> our<00:03:53.230> population<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:54.190> know

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
communities and our population you know

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.789 
communities and our population you know
our<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.730> obesity<00:03:55.030> epidemic<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:56.260> just<00:03:56.590> getting

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
our the obesity epidemic is just getting

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.850 
our the obesity epidemic is just getting
worse<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.250> worse<00:03:57.820> so<00:03:58.570> if<00:03:58.959> we<00:03:59.019> continue<00:03:59.709> to

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
worse and worse so if we continue to

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.650 
worse and worse so if we continue to
follow<00:04:00.070> what's<00:04:00.459> mainstream<00:04:01.030> it's<00:04:01.360> it's

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
follow what's mainstream it's it's

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.170 
follow what's mainstream it's it's
clearly<00:04:02.019> not<00:04:02.170> working<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:03.310> when<00:04:03.640> people<00:04:03.820> say

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
clearly not working so when people say

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.670 
clearly not working so when people say
to<00:04:04.239> me<00:04:04.360> your<00:04:04.720> approach<00:04:04.959> is<00:04:05.140> different<00:04:05.170> and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
to me your approach is different and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.870 
to me your approach is different and
your<00:04:05.829> approach<00:04:06.220> maybe<00:04:06.519> a<00:04:06.670> little

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
your approach maybe a little

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.270 
your approach maybe a little
unconventional<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:08.049> say<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.290> them<00:04:08.380> we<00:04:08.980> need<00:04:09.160> to

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
unconventional I say to them we need to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.979 
unconventional I say to them we need to
try<00:04:09.489> something<00:04:09.760> different<00:04:10.090> because<00:04:10.420> what

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
try something different because what

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.970 
try something different because what
people<00:04:11.319> are<00:04:11.440> doing<00:04:11.560> now<00:04:11.830> is<00:04:12.099> is<00:04:12.310> not<00:04:12.610> working

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
people are doing now is is not working

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.949 
people are doing now is is not working
so<00:04:14.069> give<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.489> shot<00:04:14.670> try<00:04:15.239> something<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.870> you

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
so give it a shot try something that you

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.569 
so give it a shot try something that you
haven't<00:04:16.169> tried<00:04:16.470> before<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:17.040> very<00:04:17.250> quickly<00:04:17.459> I

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
haven't tried before and very quickly I

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.590 
haven't tried before and very quickly I
wanted<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.880> ask<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.150> about<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:18.419> because

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
wanted to ask you about this because

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.300 
wanted to ask you about this because
dieting<00:04:19.079> as<00:04:19.169> we<00:04:19.290> all<00:04:19.440> know<00:04:19.560> can<00:04:19.739> be<00:04:19.859> very

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
dieting as we all know can be very

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.219 
dieting as we all know can be very
stressful<00:04:21.180> because<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:21.780> don't<00:04:21.900> want<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.079> so

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
stressful because you don't want to so

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.689 
stressful because you don't want to so
it<00:04:22.290> would<00:04:22.380> be<00:04:22.440> weighing<00:04:22.889> your<00:04:23.130> food<00:04:23.370> and

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
it would be weighing your food and

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.430 
it would be weighing your food and

counting every little thing how does

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.260 
counting every little thing how does
your<00:04:25.560> plan<00:04:25.800> take<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.160> stress<00:04:26.610> out<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:26.970> it
