is<00:05:05.320> that<00:05:05.860> this<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.460> only<00:05:06.640> phone<00:05:07.120> right<00:05:07.330> now

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
is that this is the only phone right now

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.260 
is that this is the only phone right now
that<00:05:07.840> can<00:05:07.990> shoot<00:05:08.170> above<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.890> 1080p<00:05:09.490> quality<00:05:09.880> so

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
that can shoot above a 1080p quality so

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.350 
that can shoot above a 1080p quality so
you<00:05:10.300> can<00:05:10.540> shoot<00:05:10.750> at<00:05:10.960> cue<00:05:11.500> HD<00:05:12.010> quality<00:05:12.400> with<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
you can shoot at cue HD quality with the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.710 
you can shoot at cue HD quality with the
front-facing<00:05:13.660> camera<00:05:14.290> which<00:05:14.470> is<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.620> nice<00:05:14.950> plus

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
front-facing camera which is a nice plus

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.180 
front-facing camera which is a nice plus
the<00:05:16.720> shutter<00:05:16.990> is<00:05:17.080> extremely<00:05:17.620> fast<00:05:17.830> so<00:05:18.040> you

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
the shutter is extremely fast so you

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.340 
the shutter is extremely fast so you
should<00:05:18.430> not<00:05:18.580> miss<00:05:18.790> a<00:05:18.940> moment<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:19.990> doesn't

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
should not miss a moment and it doesn't

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.950 
should not miss a moment and it doesn't
produce<00:05:20.500> some<00:05:20.890> really<00:05:21.280> clean<00:05:21.670> images<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.450> it

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
produce some really clean images and it

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.810 
produce some really clean images and it
does<00:05:23.170> overexpose<00:05:23.770> just<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.130> little<00:05:24.340> bit<00:05:24.520> but<00:05:24.760> I

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
does overexpose just a little bit but I

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.190 
does overexpose just a little bit but I
find<00:05:25.120> it<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.330> be<00:05:25.360> some<00:05:25.720> of<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:26.020> most

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
find it to be some of the most

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.230 
find it to be some of the most
consistent<00:05:26.830> shots<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.550> what's<00:05:27.730> awesome<00:05:27.880> is

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
consistent shots and what's awesome is

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.000 
consistent shots and what's awesome is
once<00:05:28.480> again<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.990> is<00:05:29.020> wide-angle<00:05:29.800> so<00:05:29.920> you're

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
once again it is wide-angle so you're

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.260 
once again it is wide-angle so you're
going<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.190> be<00:05:30.280> able<00:05:30.340> to<00:05:30.430> catch<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.700> lot<00:05:30.970> in<00:05:31.180> the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
going to be able to catch a lot in the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.610 
going to be able to catch a lot in the
background<00:05:31.780> and<00:05:32.200> you're<00:05:32.320> going<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.470> be<00:05:32.560> able

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
background and you're going to be able

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.320 
background and you're going to be able
to<00:05:32.770> catch<00:05:32.980> those<00:05:33.250> group<00:05:33.550> selfies<00:05:33.970> that<00:05:34.150> you

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
to catch those group selfies that you

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.660 
to catch those group selfies that you
want<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:35.140> image<00:05:35.410> quality<00:05:35.650> is<00:05:36.040> excellent

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
want and the image quality is excellent

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.330 
want and the image quality is excellent
so<00:05:36.970> for<00:05:37.270> those<00:05:37.360> reasons<00:05:37.480> the<00:05:38.260> s6<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.070> its

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
so for those reasons the s6 and its

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.680 
so for those reasons the s6 and its
variants<00:05:39.760> are<00:05:39.940> one<00:05:40.240> of<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.450> best

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
variants are one of the best

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.420 
variants are one of the best

right<00:05:42.610> now<00:05:44.130> last<00:05:45.130> but<00:05:45.370> not<00:05:45.490> least<00:05:45.790> I'm<00:05:46.030> going

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
right now last but not least I'm going

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.670 
right now last but not least I'm going
to<00:05:46.240> talk<00:05:46.360> about<00:05:46.480> the<00:05:46.690> iPhone<00:05:47.080> 6<00:05:47.440> and<00:05:47.620> the

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
to talk about the iPhone 6 and the

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.010 
to talk about the iPhone 6 and the
iPhone<00:05:47.950> 6<00:05:48.340> plus<00:05:48.670> now<00:05:49.330> these<00:05:49.450> are<00:05:49.600> probably<00:05:49.870> the

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
iPhone 6 plus now these are probably the

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.110 
iPhone 6 plus now these are probably the
most<00:05:50.230> popular<00:05:50.620> front<00:05:51.130> facing<00:05:51.460> cameras<00:05:51.850> just

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
most popular front facing cameras just

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.810 
most popular front facing cameras just
do<00:05:52.300> sheer<00:05:52.690> popularity<00:05:53.650> but<00:05:54.250> what<00:05:54.490> people

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
do sheer popularity but what people

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.280 
do sheer popularity but what people
probably<00:05:55.120> don't<00:05:55.270> know<00:05:55.510> is<00:05:55.720> that<00:05:55.870> it's<00:05:56.050> got<00:05:56.170> the

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
probably don't know is that it's got the

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.380 
probably don't know is that it's got the
lowest<00:05:56.470> megapixels<00:05:57.340> out<00:05:57.490> of<00:05:57.700> all<00:05:57.970> of<00:05:58.210> these

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
lowest megapixels out of all of these

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.180 
lowest megapixels out of all of these
cameras<00:05:58.840> here<00:05:59.050> and<00:05:59.230> the<00:05:59.830> low-light

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
cameras here and the low-light

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.100 
cameras here and the low-light
performance<00:06:00.220> is<00:06:00.940> not<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.420> greatest<00:06:01.810> out<00:06:01.960> of

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
performance is not the greatest out of

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.410 
performance is not the greatest out of
all<00:06:02.230> of<00:06:02.350> them<00:06:02.560> but<00:06:02.890> it<00:06:03.190> does<00:06:03.640> make<00:06:03.970> consistent

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
all of them but it does make consistent

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.420 
all of them but it does make consistent
images<00:06:05.170> and<00:06:05.350> that's<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.890> reason<00:06:06.220> why<00:06:06.400> I

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
images and that's the reason why I

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.780 
images and that's the reason why I
included<00:06:06.880> this<00:06:07.120> phone<00:06:07.390> here<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:09.310> software<00:06:09.700> is

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
included this phone here the software is

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.310 
included this phone here the software is
extremely<00:06:10.270> simple<00:06:10.510> all<00:06:10.780> you<00:06:10.870> need<00:06:10.900> to<00:06:11.080> do<00:06:11.200> is

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
extremely simple all you need to do is

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.900 
extremely simple all you need to do is
hit<00:06:11.500> that<00:06:11.530> button<00:06:12.100> on<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.460> upper<00:06:12.490> right

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
hit that button on the upper right

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.640 
hit that button on the upper right
corner<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.300> flip<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.900> camera<00:06:14.140> and<00:06:14.470> then<00:06:14.560> you

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
corner to flip the camera and then you

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.710 
corner to flip the camera and then you
have<00:06:14.800> some<00:06:15.010> live<00:06:15.220> action<00:06:15.250> filters<00:06:16.000> here<00:06:16.300> which

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
have some live action filters here which

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.050 
have some live action filters here which
you<00:06:16.870> can<00:06:17.020> switch<00:06:17.290> to<00:06:17.320> on<00:06:17.770> the<00:06:17.890> fly<00:06:18.160> and<00:06:18.760> you<00:06:18.880> do

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
you can switch to on the fly and you do

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.270 
you can switch to on the fly and you do
have<00:06:19.300> a<00:06:19.600> timer<00:06:19.990> right<00:06:20.350> there<00:06:20.620> on<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.860> top<00:06:21.070> as

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
have a timer right there on the top as

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.280 
have a timer right there on the top as
well<00:06:21.550> so<00:06:21.880> if<00:06:21.970> you<00:06:22.090> want<00:06:22.270> to<00:06:22.330> have<00:06:22.600> a<00:06:22.630> timer<00:06:22.960> you

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:23.290 
well so if you want to have a timer you

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.860 
well so if you want to have a timer you
can<00:06:23.560> but<00:06:24.220> that's<00:06:24.700> pretty<00:06:25.060> much<00:06:25.180> it<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:25.720> that's

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
can but that's pretty much it and that's

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.660 
can but that's pretty much it and that's
sometimes<00:06:26.260> why<00:06:26.770> people<00:06:27.100> love<00:06:27.250> the<00:06:27.340> iPhone

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:27.670 
sometimes why people love the iPhone

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.220 
sometimes why people love the iPhone
because<00:06:28.060> it's<00:06:28.270> just<00:06:28.420> really<00:06:28.720> simplistic

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
because it's just really simplistic

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.800 
because it's just really simplistic
software<00:06:29.860> but<00:06:30.520> I<00:06:30.550> do<00:06:30.760> like<00:06:31.180> the<00:06:31.390> way<00:06:31.540> that<00:06:31.720> the

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
software but I do like the way that the

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.110 
software but I do like the way that the
skin<00:06:32.110> tones<00:06:32.380> look<00:06:32.650> I<00:06:32.890> do<00:06:33.190> like<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.640> imaging

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
skin tones look I do like the imaging

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.790 
skin tones look I do like the imaging
that<00:06:34.270> comes<00:06:34.540> off<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:34.930> front-facing<00:06:35.200> camera

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
that comes off the front-facing camera

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.380 
that comes off the front-facing camera
like<00:06:35.950> I<00:06:36.040> said<00:06:36.220> it's<00:06:36.340> not<00:06:36.490> the<00:06:36.729> highest<00:06:37.090> quality

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
like I said it's not the highest quality

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.559 
like I said it's not the highest quality
in<00:06:38.080> terms<00:06:38.260> of<00:06:38.560> megapixel<00:06:39.220> but<00:06:39.790> the<00:06:40.030> process

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
in terms of megapixel but the process

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.290

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
is very nice on the iPhone front-facing

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.779 
is very nice on the iPhone front-facing

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
camera the video is also pretty good

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.579 
camera the video is also pretty good
that<00:06:46.119> comes<00:06:46.360> off<00:06:46.539> their<00:06:46.719> front-facing<00:06:47.110> camera

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:47.589

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.889

as<00:06:47.649> well<00:06:47.860> and<00:06:48.219> some<00:06:48.699> people<00:06:48.969> may<00:06:49.119> disagree<00:06:49.449> but

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:49.899 
as well and some people may disagree but

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:51.510 
as well and some people may disagree but
I<00:06:50.169> think<00:06:50.439> this<00:06:50.559> is<00:06:50.740> still<00:06:50.830> one<00:06:51.159> of<00:06:51.189> the<00:06:51.369> most

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
I think this is still one of the most

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.189 
I think this is still one of the most
consistent<00:06:51.909> front-facing<00:06:52.479> cameras<00:06:53.020> that's

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
consistent front-facing cameras that's

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.639
