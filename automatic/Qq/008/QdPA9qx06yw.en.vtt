00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.209
 technology has changed many things 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.420
 Distances no longer matter 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:12.389
 languages no longer matter to humans 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.440
 no luck matters anymore 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.870
 they never change 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.870
 hernan casciari what matters 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.310
 someone remembers the seven seas 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.130
 so called radio shortwave 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.080
 in my childhood of the seventies I had 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.670
 an antenna higher than myself and it 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.760
 they could listen to the radio broadcasts 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.320
 from other countries some nights 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.780
 necessarily starry I remember 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.840
 absorbed listening for the first time in my 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.420
 life voices in other languages ​​over the years 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.910
 70 adults did not use the seven seas 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.949
 to play but to know the truth the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.290
 manipulation of reality was currency 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.479
 current throughout my childhood the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.790
 government told adults that 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.409
 we were a free country and without dead 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.930
 he said we were winning a war 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.300
 in the south he told them a lot of things that 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.159
 they were not true it did not happen like that and that the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.409
 press can lie for one side or for 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.990
 the other one in my childhood was lying for a 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.420
 only lane but in some houses there was 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.030
 seven seas with which you could 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.979
 hear foreign radios and know the distant 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.990
 truth about ourselves 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.030
 today it is technically impossible for a 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.520
 country with technological development can 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.740
 suffer a dictatorship based on 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.350
 manipulation of reality as happened in 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.130
 Latin America during my childhood 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.680
 internet is a 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.990
 gigantic seven seas last Thursday 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.899
 for example in the 21st century the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.090
 Turkish government turned off twitter to 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.829
 President Ardo Gan is approached by 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.140
 elections and the Turkish twitterers what 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.270
 they were tearing up with scandals of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.000
 corruption the solution that occurred to him 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.079
 to erdogan was that turn off twitter around 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.630
 the country 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.850
 still today city ​​piaf twitter url 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.210
 From Turkey a page of 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.710
 404 error may sound funny like the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.240
 peasant joke that closes the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.429
 gate so that the wind does not enter 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.770
 but they did it really closed 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.080
 twitter and the strategy was returned to them 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.360
 against because the seven seas now is 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.060
 global and the secret solidarity of 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.180
 world generated in minutes new bridges 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.489
 where erdogan had blocked the way 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.069
 and those bridges were sent by mail 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.530
 all over Turkey with recipes to jump 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.420
 the twitter lock by sms that is not 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.239
 cut him explained the twitterers 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.920
 German to the Turks change the dns of 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.079
 your computers with this little program 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.569
 as if they were sailing from the 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.090
 they were told by others and in less 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.340
 24 hours Turkish tuiteros 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.680
 to tweet and erdogan and his ministers 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.620
 they discovered that despite closing the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.720
 gate the wind blew him the same or 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.910
 it blew even harder and they 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.190
 flew the wig that had happened 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.530
 after the number one statement of 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.230
 videla in a connected world like that of 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.049
 today what would have happened if in each ghetto 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.790
 Polish would have existed a cybercafe if 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.129
 in each basement it could have been 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.220
 resist with a laptop connected to 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.170
 rest of the world nobody knows but I 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.170
 like to ask me these questions right today 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.299
 that on March 24 in Argentina I like 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.519
 know that our children do not know 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.860
 they surprise with the foreign voices of 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.500
 the seven seas do not even have to tune in 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.739
 the only starry nights and 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.379
 hidden today and any day we can 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.660
 laugh at us from our twitter account 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.120
 of the stupidities that our 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.090
 politicians on twitter we can make fun of 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.220
 of our imperfect democracy and up 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.739
 we can shout from the rooftops that 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.040
 there is no freedom of expression hopefully today 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.720
 behind sarcasm and irony and 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.060
 of the tension 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.690
 fight without quarter for what we think 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.690
 we just wish today to realize 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.420
 tweet that we are privileged 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.420
