 the consumption realizing a dream and I 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.450
 I was partying, cooking so much emotion, it 's a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.220
 a tie since this party is not 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.050
 complete 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.240
 Unfortunately, I'm missing a person. 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.540
 I love my father so much during college. 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.119
 taught us how to ameliorate suffering 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.060
 It was very quiet but for ourselves 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.350
 we are faced with how difficult it is to understand 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.130
 things 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 Why people will say goodbye 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:44.780
 How difficult is it to get used to the absence 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:49.250
 that at the beginning people seem like the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.250
 my legs lacked sound 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:59.120
 every arm he received imagined his 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.440
 had lost the right arm of the family 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.440
 it's a good beginning fado 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:13.160
 Questions if they find answers 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:17.220
 I talked to God, I thought that the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.550
 the mixed feelings were mixed 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.920
 emptiness is endless but the support of 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.990
 family, the family union was 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.410
 fundamental 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.630
 the time comes to relieve some of the pain 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.230
 but it was a moment of joy as of 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:39.340

 another way is true but 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.209
 in a very special way that makes me 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.879

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:03.220
 infractions is much more than my father today 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:07.450
