00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.370
 Yes Thank you for watching the video I introduced in the previous video 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:13.340
 I tried to connect this to a tomix Thomas. 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.670
 It doesn't feel like it's okay, there is no particular problem with the sense of scale 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.760
 I feel like I saw it from above obliquely 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.060
 And this clay head fits well with the wagon 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.760
 No Hey good 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.140
 [musics] 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.530
 Well then , I would like to run around with this familiar table layout every time 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.530
 I will 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:45.780
 Since the truck shake firmly neck comes with bow track compact a 183 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.399
 This can go through and this cardboard tunnel I made earlier 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:55.820
 This is OK if the crane fits properly 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.820
 The crane may get caught in the tunnel porter 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:10.680
 Yes, it's back, so here's where parts of it spin around 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.680
 The gray part will be bent like this when you get back to the straight rail 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.469

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.440
 [musics] 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.030
 It is fun to run and play, but it looks like this 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.170
 You can also reproduce the scene in Thomas's play 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.500
 [musics] 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.790
 I tried to run a foreign language- sized crane car just by entering 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:44.539
 See you in the video again Thank you very much 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.539
 [musics] 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.080
 Good lug base day 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.080
 me 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.220
 [musics] 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.610
 he 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.610
 nocare 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.860
 [applause]
