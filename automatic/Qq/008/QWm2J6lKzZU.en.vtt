with the medium pomade just because I

slicker<00:00:46.469> comb<00:00:47.010> through<00:00:48.289> it<00:00:49.289> also<00:00:49.469> has<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.829> do

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
slicker comb through it also has to do

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.799 
slicker comb through it also has to do
with<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> fact<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:50.610> hair<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.969> now<00:00:51.510> pretty

with the fact that my hair is now pretty
long<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> longest<00:00:54.140> that's<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
long I think the longest that's not the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.380 
long I think the longest that's not the
longest<00:00:55.590> trim<00:00:55.920> longest<00:00:56.430> goes<00:00:56.610> down<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.239> like

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
longest trim longest goes down to like

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
longest trim longest goes down to like
past<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.840> nose<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.960> curly<00:01:01.260> hair

I'll<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:07.560> over<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.920> again<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.459> Denman

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
I'll go over it again with the Denman

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.480 
I'll go over it again with the Denman
just<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> hold<00:02:09.209> things<00:02:09.330> down

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.330 

okay<00:02:16.240> next<00:02:17.110> step<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.710> go<00:02:17.950> back<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.130> your

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
okay next step is to go back to your

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.700 
okay next step is to go back to your
wide<00:02:18.490> tooth<00:02:18.520> comb<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.330> what<00:02:20.260> you're<00:02:20.380> gonna<00:02:20.470> do

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
wide tooth comb and what you're gonna do

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.670 
wide tooth comb and what you're gonna do
is<00:02:20.860> bring<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.310> front<00:02:22.020> follow<00:02:23.020> I'm<00:02:23.380> gonna

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
is bring the front follow I'm gonna

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.350 
is bring the front follow I'm gonna
follow<00:02:23.890> my<00:02:24.010> wave<00:02:24.280> cuz<00:02:24.490> my<00:02:24.640> contour<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.210> gonna

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
follow my wave cuz my contour is gonna

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.410 
follow my wave cuz my contour is gonna
go<00:02:25.600> from<00:02:25.870> left<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.530> right<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.060> me<00:02:28.210> like

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
go from left to right so it's me like

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.800 
go from left to right so it's me like
that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
that

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.660 
that
but<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.230> swooping<00:02:29.470> motion<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.130> it's<00:02:30.310> good<00:02:30.580> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
but the swooping motion and it's good to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:40.610 
but the swooping motion and it's good to
go<00:02:31.000> front<00:02:31.720> front<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.650> then<00:02:32.770> into<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> side

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.460 

okay<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.879> you<00:02:41.940> see<00:02:42.209> now<00:02:42.390> now<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.260> right

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
okay so you see now now on the right

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.660 
okay so you see now now on the right
side<00:02:43.739> we<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.099> kind<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.400> stooping<00:02:44.700> down

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
side we have a kind of stooping down

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.640 
side we have a kind of stooping down
because<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.849> way<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.510> way<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.379> wave

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
because the way of the way that the wave

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.650 
because the way of the way that the wave
on<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.190> top<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.640> my<00:02:50.700> head<00:02:50.849> would<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.300> usually

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
on the top of my head would it usually

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.960 
on the top of my head would it usually
goes<00:02:54.349> it<00:02:55.349> follows<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.890> direction<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.640> want

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
goes it follows that direction so I want

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.539 
goes it follows that direction so I want
kind<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.810> want<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.049> hair<00:02:58.319> here<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.190> follow

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
kind of want the hair here to follow

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.430 
kind of want the hair here to follow
that<00:02:59.849> because<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:00.780> not<00:03:00.959> there<00:03:01.230> will<00:03:01.319> be<00:03:01.349> a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that because if not there will be a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.770 
that because if not there will be a
split<00:03:01.739> some<00:03:01.980> right<00:03:02.129> here<00:03:02.160> in<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.640> middle<00:03:02.879> so

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
split some right here in the middle so

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.600 
split some right here in the middle so
what<00:03:03.870> I'm<00:03:03.930> gonna<00:03:04.019> do<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.500> take<00:03:05.220> my<00:03:05.400> comb

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
what I'm gonna do is take my comb

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.020 
what I'm gonna do is take my comb
starting<00:03:06.000> from<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.180> side<00:03:07.370> push<00:03:08.370> back<00:03:08.670> and

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
starting from the side push back and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.660 
starting from the side push back and
then<00:03:09.480> kind<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.349> like<00:03:10.530> scoop<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.160> towards<00:03:11.549> the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
then kind of like scoop it towards the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.550 
then kind of like scoop it towards the
back<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.970> my<00:03:12.060> head<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.630> doesn't<00:03:13.170> really<00:03:13.290> make

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
back of my head it doesn't really make

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.690 
back of my head it doesn't really make
much<00:03:13.739> sense<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.190> I'm<00:03:14.310> gonna<00:03:14.430> try<00:03:14.640> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
much sense but I'm gonna try and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.809 
much sense but I'm gonna try and
demonstrate<00:03:14.849> for<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.510> guys

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.420 

so<00:03:21.360> now<00:03:21.599> you<00:03:21.659> have<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.780> basic<00:03:25.560> shape<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
so now you have the basic shape of the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.500 
so now you have the basic shape of the
contour<00:03:27.420> actually<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:29.489> one<00:03:30.209> thing<00:03:30.420> I

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
contour actually so one thing I

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.030 
contour actually so one thing I
neglected<00:03:30.569> to<00:03:31.170> mention<00:03:31.200> at<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.650> start<00:03:31.920> is

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
neglected to mention at the start is

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.039 
neglected to mention at the start is
that<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.609> style<00:03:32.969> it<00:03:33.299> doesn't<00:03:33.659> matter<00:03:33.780> if

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
that the style it doesn't matter if

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.530 
that the style it doesn't matter if
you've<00:03:34.319> got<00:03:34.560> an<00:03:34.739> undercut<00:03:35.189> like<00:03:35.340> me<00:03:35.519> or<00:03:36.150> if<00:03:36.510> you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
you've got an undercut like me or if you

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.910 
you've got an undercut like me or if you
have<00:03:37.400> fenders<00:03:38.400> which<00:03:38.640> are<00:03:38.760> full<00:03:38.939> sides<00:03:39.920> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
have fenders which are full sides the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.740 
have fenders which are full sides the
only<00:03:41.250> difference<00:03:41.609> is<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.760> if<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:42.569> had

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
only difference is that if you had

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.750 
only difference is that if you had
longer<00:03:42.989> hair<00:03:43.319> on<00:03:43.409> the<00:03:43.500> sides<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.400> where

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
longer hair on the sides this is where

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.000 
longer hair on the sides this is where
like<00:03:45.000> literally<00:03:45.569> this<00:03:45.780> line<00:03:46.079> that's<00:03:46.859> where

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
like literally this line that's where

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.280 
like literally this line that's where
you<00:03:47.129> would<00:03:47.220> make<00:03:47.430> your<00:03:47.579> part<00:03:47.849> and<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:49.049> hairs

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
you would make your part and the hairs

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.259 
you would make your part and the hairs
on<00:03:49.409> this<00:03:49.560> side<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:49.859> slip<00:03:50.219> back<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:51.120> with

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
on this side you just slip back is with

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.449 
on this side you just slip back is with
this<00:03:51.420> side<00:03:51.629> sleep<00:03:51.959> back<00:03:52.170> not<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.159> this<00:03:53.250> year

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
this side sleep back not in this year

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.429 
this side sleep back not in this year
I'm<00:03:53.549> sure<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.819> guys<00:03:53.970> know<00:03:54.000> how<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.269> do<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.769> so

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
I'm sure you guys know how to do that so

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.289 
I'm sure you guys know how to do that so
yeah<00:03:58.439> that's<00:03:58.650> actually<00:03:58.889> pretty<00:03:59.430> much<00:03:59.700> it<00:04:00.000> I

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
yeah that's actually pretty much it I

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.580 
yeah that's actually pretty much it I
will<00:04:02.269> spin<00:04:03.269> around<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.659> guess<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.139> you<00:04:04.200> guys<00:04:04.379> can

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
will spin around I guess so you guys can

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.949 
will spin around I guess so you guys can
see<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.829> whole<00:04:05.040> 360<00:04:05.909> view<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.629> I'll<00:04:06.840> show<00:04:06.930> you

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:18.240 
see the whole 360 view and I'll show you
the<00:04:07.109> top<00:04:07.260> of<00:04:07.439> it

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.940 

and<00:04:19.250> now<00:04:19.579> for<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.940> top
