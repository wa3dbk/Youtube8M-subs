00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
three weeks ago and now or in like a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.960 
three weeks ago and now or in like a
week<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.710> two<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> future<00:00:29.460> into<00:00:29.640> three

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
week or two in the future into three

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.160 
week or two in the future into three
videos<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.929> way<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:33.170> you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
videos so that way you get more and you

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
videos so that way you get more and you
know<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.350> saw<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.489> don't<00:00:35.640> want<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
know you saw because I don't want to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.580 
know you saw because I don't want to
bundle<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.750> into<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.110> video<00:00:37.260> because

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
bundle it all into one video because

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.080 
bundle it all into one video because
it'd<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> 20<00:00:38.250> minute<00:00:38.460> video<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.969> it's

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
it'd be like a 20 minute video and it's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
it'd be like a 20 minute video and it's
just<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.600> horrible<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.559> watch<00:00:40.829> so

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
just going to be horrible to watch so

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
just going to be horrible to watch so
I'd<00:00:41.820> rather<00:00:41.969> bun<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.360> into<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.719> three<00:00:42.899> or

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
I'd rather bun that into like three or

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.510 
I'd rather bun that into like three or
four<00:00:43.079> minute<00:00:43.440> videos<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.010> then<00:00:44.100> make<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
four minute videos and then make it

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.920 
four minute videos and then make it
easier<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> watch<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> give<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.570> variation

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
easier to watch and give you a variation

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.529 
easier to watch and give you a variation
of<00:00:46.170> content<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.620> something<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> might<00:00:47.190> enjoy

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
stuff I've been Miss basically just

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.900 
stuff I've been Miss basically just
making<00:02:08.039> progress<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:09.229> skills<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.910> quest

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
making progress in skills and quest

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.000 
making progress in skills and quest
related<00:02:12.480> stuff<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.080> want<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
related stuff I want to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.140 
related stuff I want to
get<00:02:14.099> higher<00:02:14.370> than<00:02:14.760> dragon<00:02:15.510> gloves<00:02:16.400> which<00:02:17.400> as

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
get higher than dragon gloves which as

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.649 
get higher than dragon gloves which as
of<00:02:18.720> current<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.470> bit<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.829> pain<00:02:20.269> but<00:02:21.269> I

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
of current is a bit of a pain but I

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.479 
of current is a bit of a pain but I
guess<00:02:22.079> we'll<00:02:22.230> get<00:02:22.409> there<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.920> hopefully

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
guess we'll get there and hopefully

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.170 
guess we'll get there and hopefully
barrels<00:02:24.030> later<00:02:24.329> on<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:26.250> did<00:02:26.640> some<00:02:26.670> band<00:02:27.030> or

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
barrels later on and I did some band or

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.690 
barrels later on and I did some band or
so<00:02:27.329> laws<00:02:27.540> as<00:02:27.689> well<00:02:27.720> which<00:02:28.110> were<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:29.250> right<00:02:29.670> I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
so laws as well which were all right I

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.190 
so laws as well which were all right I
guess<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.269> kind<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.569> difficult<00:02:30.750> because

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
guess it's kind of difficult because

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.860 
guess it's kind of difficult because
with<00:02:31.920> my<00:02:32.069> 70<00:02:32.430> defense<00:02:32.790> i<00:02:32.909> have<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.239> half<00:02:33.569> kill

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
with my 70 defense i have to half kill

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.000 
with my 70 defense i have to half kill
them<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.379> then<00:02:35.220> basically<00:02:35.790> go<00:02:36.239> back<00:02:36.269> and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
them and then basically go back and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.720 
them and then basically go back and
finish<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.310> kill<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.799> you<00:02:40.799> know<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
finish the kill so you know it's it's a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.580 
finish the kill so you know it's it's a
bit<00:02:41.879> of<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> pain<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.569> respect<00:02:42.959> but<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.500> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
bit of a pain in that respect but if I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.220 
bit of a pain in that respect but if I
get<00:02:43.769> lucky<00:02:43.950> then<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.519> like<00:02:44.670> every<00:02:45.060> 20<00:02:45.359> mil<00:02:45.599> if

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
get lucky then it's like every 20 mil if

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.949 
get lucky then it's like every 20 mil if
not<00:02:46.500> then<00:02:46.859> you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.150> did<00:02:48.299> die<00:02:48.480> one<00:02:48.720> so
