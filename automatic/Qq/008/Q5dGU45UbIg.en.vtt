00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:09.360
 We're back and letting go a little. 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.230
 and the camera more understand that the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.020
 We left town right and does not catch on 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.050
 track that now highway anhanguera 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.369
 and as we go about taking a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.099
 little more speed and better consumption 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:30.000
 of tobacco you understand that together 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.440
 have improved with traffic today 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.040
 here a little higher and higher 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040
 to improve thus 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.020
 in a little while you will have more or less 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.000
 average 20 years 20 and 30 kilometers 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.340
 not more or less mean 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.160
 The car like this of course weighs more than 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.030
 1,700 kilos and you know it 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.680
 who offers comfort in your home is the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.230
 its occupants very good and even have to 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.989
 to have a very progressive foot 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.770
 progressive acceleration counts on the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.770
 highly reliable technology 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.490
 you can rest easy, you can forgive a pardon 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.080
 that it will maintain the speed 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.520
 balanced without you knowing 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.520
 especially in descents 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.939
 count more now 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.939
 breaks the ages by 24 hours 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.450
 It's for you that I'm making this video. 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.250
 here because at first before buying 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.360
 I did not find much of this car 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.959
 so it is homemade but was person of 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.030
 dealers trying to sell the card 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:28.170
 It was something that you 're really seeing. 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.170
 live and color 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.200
 contagie does not exceed a maximum of 3,000 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:43.170
 120 per hour 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.700
 It will reach this is a car has 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.700
 170 horsepower 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.129
 even because this track here are several and 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.430
 several radars 100 kilometers per hour 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:16.109
 then you'll be able to demand a lot from the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.419
 Car not need too right 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.959
 I want to say it, it's not wanted, I want to run. 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:25.520
 go to the race track 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.520
 the wife organized here 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.229
 That's right there 10 km is what I 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.760
 I think she's going to keep that average 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.720
 It will also make a miracle that it is not a 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:42.940
 it is not a dvd it is not a good happy it is 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:47.880
 but it is an engine of 2.4 170 horses 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.880
 it's worth the car it's worth it
