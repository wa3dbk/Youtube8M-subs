00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
ESCO there's not much new here the Xbox

ESCO there's not much new here the Xbox
360<00:01:08.189> II<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.670> slightly<00:01:09.420> smaller<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.200> we're

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
360 II it's slightly smaller but we're

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
360 II it's slightly smaller but we're
talking<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.799> difference<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.280> millimeters<00:01:11.850> here

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
talking a difference of millimeters here

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.929 
talking a difference of millimeters here
so<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.960> gonna<00:01:13.140> bring<00:01:13.380> any<00:01:13.650> sizable<00:01:14.460> more

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so it's not gonna bring any sizable more

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.190 
so it's not gonna bring any sizable more
space<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:16.020> TV<00:01:16.350> area<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.220> home<00:01:17.580> also<00:01:18.420> the

space to your TV area at home also the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
space to your TV area at home also the
smaller<00:01:19.590> size<00:01:19.920> means<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.640> Microsoft<00:01:21.090> seems

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
smaller size means that Microsoft seems

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
smaller size means that Microsoft seems
to<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.689> cut<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.170> corners<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to have cut some corners here in the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.740 
to have cut some corners here in the
sense<00:01:23.460> they've<00:01:23.759> removed<00:01:24.060> some<00:01:24.390> ports

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
sense they've removed some ports

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.649 
sense they've removed some ports
including<00:01:25.590> v<00:01:25.920> USB<00:01:26.549> port<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.299> now<00:01:27.420> only

port now that's okay

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719 
port now that's okay
and<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.900> doesn't<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.409> matter<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.799> much<00:01:35.009> but

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and it doesn't really matter so much but

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
and it doesn't really matter so much but

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
360 II is building on that
and<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.520> still<00:02:14.850> has<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.300> best<00:02:15.480> game

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and so it still has the best game

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.540 
and so it still has the best game
library<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.380> console<00:02:16.860> itself<00:02:17.280> is

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
library but the console itself is

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.800 
library but the console itself is
nothing<00:02:18.030> special

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
nothing special

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.140 
nothing special
it<00:02:19.110> doesn't<00:02:19.350> really<00:02:19.500> offer<00:02:19.650> anything<00:02:20.070> too<00:02:20.580> new

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
it doesn't really offer anything too new

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.810 
it doesn't really offer anything too new
from<00:02:21.630> its<00:02:21.870> previous<00:02:22.170> model<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
from its previous model and with the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.330 
from its previous model and with the
Xbox<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:24.480> coming<00:02:24.960> out<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.470> November<00:02:26.070> there

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
Xbox one coming out this November there

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.340 
Xbox one coming out this November there
really<00:02:26.550> doesn't<00:02:26.880> seem<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:27.450> much<00:02:27.660> reason<00:02:27.990> to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
really doesn't seem to be much reason to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.730 
really doesn't seem to be much reason to
get<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.940> console<00:02:29.940> now<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.990> would<00:02:31.470> personally

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
get this console now I would personally

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.100 
get this console now I would personally
recommend<00:02:32.130> waiting<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.330> Xbox<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
recommend waiting for the Xbox one and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.890 
recommend waiting for the Xbox one and
ps4<00:02:34.580> but<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:35.670> you're<00:02:35.790> absolutely<00:02:36.450> determined

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
ps4 but if you're absolutely determined

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.100 
ps4 but if you're absolutely determined
to<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> Xbox<00:02:38.040> 360<00:02:38.730> now<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.330> would<00:02:39.960> actually

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
to get the Xbox 360 now I would actually

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.890 
to get the Xbox 360 now I would actually
recommend<00:02:40.410> going<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.130> older<00:02:41.550> Xbox<00:02:42.180> 360s

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
recommend going with the older Xbox 360s

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.630 
recommend going with the older Xbox 360s
which<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.860> can<00:02:44.010> get<00:02:44.160> for<00:02:44.430> slightly

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
which you can get for slightly

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.910 
which you can get for slightly
discounted<00:02:45.330> prices<00:02:45.750> now<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.290> its<00:02:46.440> successor

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
discounted prices now that its successor

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.800 
discounted prices now that its successor
has<00:02:47.100> come<00:02:47.370> out<00:02:47.550> but<00:02:48.150> let<00:02:48.300> me<00:02:48.390> know<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.570> you

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
has come out but let me know what you

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.650 
has come out but let me know what you
think<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.410> Xbox<00:02:49.890> 360<00:02:50.550> II<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.270> comments

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
