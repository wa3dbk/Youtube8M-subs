00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
I grew up in Hollywood my dad was in the

ceramicist and a painter more recently I
thought<00:00:30.330> how<00:00:30.480> odd<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.590> he<00:00:31.800> he<00:00:32.250> would

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
thought how odd it is that he he would

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
thought how odd it is that he he would
take<00:00:32.970> me<00:00:33.150> onto<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> sets<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.140> stuff<00:00:34.379> a<00:00:34.500> lot<00:00:34.650> I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
take me onto the sets and stuff a lot I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.320 
take me onto the sets and stuff a lot I
mean<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.129> he<00:00:35.220> did<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> set<00:00:35.820> he<00:00:35.970> wanted<00:00:36.210> me<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
mean when he did a set he wanted me to

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.590 
mean when he did a set he wanted me to
see<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.200> spent<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> lot<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> time<00:00:38.449> kind<00:00:39.449> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
see it so I spent a lot of time kind of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.299 
see it so I spent a lot of time kind of
running<00:00:40.320> around<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.590> back<00:00:40.739> lots<00:00:41.010> and

watching filming and stuff and a lot of
that's<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:45.000> present<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.080> the<00:00:46.199> work<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.530> do

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that's very present and in the work I do

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
that's very present and in the work I do
now<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.370> film<00:00:47.580> industry<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.960> kind<00:00:49.170> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
now the film industry was the kind of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.640 
now the film industry was the kind of
normal<00:00:49.620> world<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:51.089> me<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.330> a<00:00:51.360> child<00:00:51.720> I<00:00:52.110> think

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
normal world for me as a child I think

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.649 
normal world for me as a child I think
that<00:00:52.769> kind<00:00:53.040> of<00:00:53.100> surreal<00:00:53.989> thing<00:00:54.989> has<00:00:55.680> been<00:00:56.129> very

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
that kind of surreal thing has been very

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.079 
that kind of surreal thing has been very
important<00:00:57.659> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.080> way<00:00:58.229> that<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.970> about

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
important in the way that I think about

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.850 
important in the way that I think about
art<00:01:02.390> then<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.540> went<00:01:03.720> to<00:01:03.780> London<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> early

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
art then I went to London in the early

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.480 
art then I went to London in the early
60s<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.810> sort<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> fetched<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.130> shores

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
60s and sort of fetched up on the shores

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850 
60s and sort of fetched up on the shores
of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.030> pop<00:01:09.330> art<00:01:09.540> movement<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:10.740> was

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
of the pop art movement there there was

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.680 
of the pop art movement there there was
this<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.790> lap<00:01:12.030> over<00:01:12.390> into<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
this you know kind of lap over into a

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.740 
this you know kind of lap over into a
different<00:01:13.049> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.650> energy<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:15.330> creative

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
different kind of energy the creative

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
different kind of energy the creative
energy<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.549> art<00:01:17.909> because

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
energy it was not more about art because

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.910 
energy it was not more about art because
I<00:01:18.390> mean<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> whole<00:01:19.290> energy<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I mean I think that the whole energy and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.090 
I mean I think that the whole energy and
in<00:01:20.640> London<00:01:21.510> was<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.900> pieced<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.770> different

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
in London was very pieced in different

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
in London was very pieced in different
directions<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.790> mean<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.510> know<00:01:24.630> Vidal

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
directions I mean it was you know Vidal

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.399 
directions I mean it was you know Vidal
Sassoon<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.890> Ossie<00:01:26.759> Clark<00:01:26.789> as<00:01:27.539> fashion<00:01:28.109> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
Sassoon and Ossie Clark as fashion and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.160 
Sassoon and Ossie Clark as fashion and
and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.609> things<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.030> Pinter<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.810> Becket

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and then things like Pinter and Becket

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
and then things like Pinter and Becket
and<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.009> theatrical<00:01:32.609> thing<00:01:32.789> which<00:01:32.939> I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and the the theatrical thing which I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.539 
and the the theatrical thing which I
think<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.929> was<00:01:34.109> it<00:01:34.289> of<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.799> starting<00:01:35.369> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
think it was it of as starting that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.779 
think it was it of as starting that
whole<00:01:35.789> kind<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.240> energy<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.109> London<00:01:37.369> in<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
whole kind of energy in in London in the

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.230 
whole kind of energy in in London in the
60s<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.509> theatre<00:01:39.990> kind<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.880> provoked<00:01:41.880> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
60s it's a theatre kind of provoked so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
60s it's a theatre kind of provoked so
much<00:01:42.509> British<00:01:43.229> culture<00:01:43.710> was<00:01:43.890> actually

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
much British culture was actually

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
much British culture was actually
drawing<00:01:44.609> on<00:01:44.939> American<00:01:45.450> culture<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:46.499> its

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
drawing on American culture for its

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.010 
drawing on American culture for its
imagery<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.759> there<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> bit<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> crossover

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
imagery so there was a bit of crossover

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.080 
imagery so there was a bit of crossover
there<00:01:49.289> but<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:49.770> me<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.189> was<00:01:50.429> doing
