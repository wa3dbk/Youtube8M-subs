 after five minutes it is still me 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:49.979
 that's just too hot for eight minutes 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:02:09.300
 or so and then that's nice 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:09.300
 then you can warm teach the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.489
 Something is already done 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.769

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:53.640

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:55.080
 potato porridge with I'm only in 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.870
 essentially it looks just like 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:18.810
 7 minutes ago probably just stop 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:19.730

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.049
 his 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.049
 to eat from within 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.129
 and here I have listened too little and 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.129
 was yes 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.550
 I think that's pretty delicious somehow 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.190
 better than the noodle stuff is a question 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.180
 what do you find better 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.180
 potato pudding or pasta grad 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.290

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.940
 okay the google means peter i believe 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.870

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:49.780
