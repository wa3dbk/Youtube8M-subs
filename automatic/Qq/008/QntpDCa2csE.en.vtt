00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:09.155
 My name is Angela Mauricio. I work with Dr. Mauricio. I am a registered nurse he has. 

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:14.128
 Today we are at the Center for Dermatology Dr. Tess in La Jolla, California. 

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.313
 We have been using Venus for more than a year. 

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:22.710
 We were first in Southern California practicing therapy. Our patients loved it. 

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:28.793
 It took more than our practice to basically and after a full year we made it. 

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:35.018
 We started with one machine. We got the second machine and now our third. 

00:00:35.487 --> 00:00:37.832
 So we practice back and forth 

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:43.820
 We treat face, neck, chest, and we do body treatments. Our patients loved it. 

00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:48.860
 It is comfortable, it's fast, easy, and provides relaxation. 

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:53.778
 Many of the treatments that we do, you know, can sometimes be scary. 

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.892
 Can be scary, there can be stops. 

00:00:57.312 --> 00:01:01.836
 But this treatment is comfortable and they leave the office already looking better. 

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:07.421
 They have a nice pink glow on the skin, but they can go on like their normal day, 

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:13.383
 Which is very important for many of these busy women who come to these kinds of practices. 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.133
 One patient in particular, we had to do full carbon before her 5 years maybe. 

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:29.217
 I had done six "Venus" treatments on them and the difference was remarkable 

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.834
 If it is something he has done great things corresponding with the work of dermatologist. 

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:40.623
 We did carbon, and everyone did this treatment, "Venus Fries". Work does not crash. 

00:01:40.953 --> 00:01:43.793
 I'm sure she was thinking: "Oh you know, this will not do much for me." 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.848
 But the results are incredible 

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:53.278
 Before and after the images are being used so far by the company. They're fine. 

00:01:53.603 --> 00:01:57.991
 So the patient is pleased, and all our patients are very happy with this treatment. 

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:08.391
 From the point of view of a doctor, I have been in the industry for about eight years now 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.186
 I have seen a lot of changes from trends, from a downtime to non-disruption of work 

00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:18.587
 This treatment is special because I think it has it all. There is no downtime. 

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:23.377
 You are going to get results and there is a lot of patient comfort and patient satisfaction. 

00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:26.668
 But the only thing I like is the grip itself. 

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:34.360
 Look at how this light. Very light and very easy to use. I can do this treatment to go back. 

00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:40.745
 I remember there was a time where I was doing this treatment eight hours a day. 

00:02:41.243 --> 00:02:45.783
 So it is such a great treatment, and patients are really impressed as far as you really can 

00:02:46.202 --> 00:02:52.055
 Show them how agile you can really be with this. The patient can feel every step you make. 

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:58.751
 Every pressure point you are up is purposefully trying to raise your cheeks, 

00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:05.802
 I like your attempt to carve the jaw line, but this is very easy to use, 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.330
 Easy to get results and very little fatigue for the practitioner.
