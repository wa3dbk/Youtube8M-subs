look within and have that opportunity to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.020 
look within and have that opportunity to
decompress<00:03:31.630> from<00:03:32.170> your<00:03:32.410> daily<00:03:32.680> life<00:03:33.030> that's

decompress from your daily life that's
exactly<00:03:34.210> what<00:03:34.480> we<00:03:34.600> did<00:03:34.630> we<00:03:35.220> trudged<00:03:36.220> through

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
exactly what we did we trudged through

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.020 
exactly what we did we trudged through
really<00:03:36.970> deep<00:03:37.150> sand<00:03:37.480> for<00:03:37.990> hours<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.820> really

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
really deep sand for hours and it really

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.920 
really deep sand for hours and it really
tested<00:03:40.480> our<00:03:40.600> abilities<00:03:41.020> and<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:43.600> was<00:03:43.720> really

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
tested our abilities and it was really

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.900 
tested our abilities and it was really
quite<00:03:44.140> amazing<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:44.950> really<00:03:45.190> what<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.400> can<00:03:45.640> do

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
quite amazing but really what you can do

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.610 
quite amazing but really what you can do
is<00:03:46.240> really<00:03:46.540> what<00:03:46.750> came<00:03:46.930> out<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.230> trip<00:03:47.470> I

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
is really what came out of this trip I

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.960 
is really what came out of this trip I
think

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.820 

I<00:03:51.030> think<00:03:51.720> when<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.900> go<00:03:52.050> out<00:03:52.170> on<00:03:52.200> your<00:03:52.290> own<00:03:52.380> and

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
I think when you go out on your own and

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.900 
I think when you go out on your own and
you<00:03:53.070> have<00:03:53.900> get<00:03:54.900> over<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.290> fear<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:56.040> what

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
you have get over that fear of what

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.760 
you have get over that fear of what
might<00:03:56.940> be<00:03:57.090> around<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.020> start<00:03:58.410> thinking

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
might be around you and start thinking

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.970 
might be around you and start thinking
about<00:03:58.860> what<00:03:59.100> really<00:04:00.290> matters<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.680> guess

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
about what really matters to you I guess

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.980 
about what really matters to you I guess
where<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.730> your<00:04:02.880> brain<00:04:03.060> taking<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.600> with<00:04:03.840> it

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
where is your brain taking you with it

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.270 
where is your brain taking you with it
what<00:04:04.290> are<00:04:04.380> your<00:04:04.500> thoughts<00:04:04.710> going<00:04:05.130> through

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
what are your thoughts going through

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.860 
what are your thoughts going through
your<00:04:05.340> mind<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.150> know<00:04:06.210> you<00:04:06.330> don't<00:04:06.540> really<00:04:06.570> have

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
your mind you know you don't really have

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.720 
your mind you know you don't really have
time<00:04:07.140> usually<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.680> take<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.860> pause<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.430> a<00:04:08.490> break

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
time usually to take a pause and a break

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.760 
time usually to take a pause and a break
in<00:04:08.910> your<00:04:09.060> life<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.690> think<00:04:10.170> about<00:04:10.230> what<00:04:10.590> is

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
in your life and and think about what is

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:20.990 
in your life and and think about what is
important<00:04:18.530> 2.5<00:04:19.530> gallons<00:04:20.010> per<00:04:20.280> person<00:04:20.730> per<00:04:20.970> day

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
important 2.5 gallons per person per day

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.750 
important 2.5 gallons per person per day
is<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.410> safe<00:04:22.740> bet<00:04:22.980> if<00:04:23.250> you're<00:04:23.430> gonna<00:04:23.520> wash

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
is is a safe bet if you're gonna wash

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.790 
is is a safe bet if you're gonna wash
your<00:04:23.940> hands<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.600> cook<00:04:25.260> with<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:25.620> and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
your hands and cook with it and

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.530 
your hands and cook with it and
everything<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.340> know<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.490> was<00:04:26.730> like<00:04:26.820> 2.5

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
everything you know I was like 2.5

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.880 
everything you know I was like 2.5
gallons<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.170> so<00:04:28.260> then<00:04:28.410> we<00:04:28.530> were<00:04:28.590> doing<00:04:28.830> the

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
gallons and so then we were doing the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.160 
gallons and so then we were doing the
math<00:04:29.070> we're<00:04:29.310> like<00:04:29.400> 15<00:04:29.550> gallons<00:04:30.360> for<00:04:30.960> three

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
math we're like 15 gallons for three

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.500 
math we're like 15 gallons for three
people<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:32.250> course<00:04:32.490> my<00:04:33.210> two<00:04:33.270> other

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
people and of course my two other

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.510 
people and of course my two other
adventure<00:04:34.410> crewmates<00:04:34.860> were<00:04:35.100> just<00:04:35.310> like<00:04:35.490> no
