what<00:03:37.600> i<00:03:37.630> doing<00:03:38.140> i'm<00:03:38.350> using<00:03:38.620> my<00:03:38.830> fingers<00:03:39.310> to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
what i doing i'm using my fingers to

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.310 
what i doing i'm using my fingers to
apply<00:03:39.880> everything<00:03:40.210> because<00:03:40.990> i<00:03:41.080> don't<00:03:41.230> really

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
apply everything because i don't really

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.830 
apply everything because i don't really
like<00:03:41.560> brushes<00:03:42.070> too<00:03:42.310> much<00:03:42.520> i<00:03:42.790> don't<00:03:43.570> think<00:03:43.720> they

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
like brushes too much i don't think they

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.420 
like brushes too much i don't think they
get<00:03:44.710> everywhere<00:03:45.610> evenly<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:47.170> i'm<00:03:48.070> using<00:03:48.310> my

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
get everywhere evenly so i'm using my

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.120 
get everywhere evenly so i'm using my
fingers<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:49.380> distribute<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.500> outside<00:03:50.950> edges

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
fingers to distribute the outside edges

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.250 
fingers to distribute the outside edges
first<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.820> then<00:03:51.970> i'm<00:03:52.090> using<00:03:52.240> my<00:03:52.450> fingers<00:03:52.990> tool

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
first and then i'm using my fingers tool

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.650 
first and then i'm using my fingers tool
actually<00:03:53.770> part<00:03:54.370> my<00:03:54.550> hair<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:55.090> then<00:03:55.300> get<00:03:55.540> the

actually part my hair and then get the

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.650 
actually part my hair and then get the
inside<00:03:56.550> so<00:03:57.550> once<00:03:57.730> i<00:03:57.850> do<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:58.030> i<00:03:58.210> go<00:03:58.450> five

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
inside so once i do that i go five
