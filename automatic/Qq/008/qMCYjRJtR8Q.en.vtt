vegetation<00:00:37.110> I'm<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.770> like<00:00:37.950> how<00:00:38.129> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
vegetation I'm really like how that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.160 
vegetation I'm really like how that
looks<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.969> looks<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.540> better<00:00:39.690> than<00:00:39.989> just

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
looks I'm looks a lot better than just

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.590 
looks I'm looks a lot better than just
the<00:00:40.350> plain<00:00:40.920> dark<00:00:41.160> tan<00:00:41.460> look<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.480> i'll

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the plain dark tan look so i'll

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.389 
the plain dark tan look so i'll
definitely<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.020> adding<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.559> all<00:00:43.890> around<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
definitely be adding that all around the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.090 
definitely be adding that all around the
swamp<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.950> some<00:00:46.950> biggest<00:00:48.379> addition<00:00:49.379> was<00:00:49.890> i

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
swamp but some biggest addition was i

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
swamp but some biggest addition was i
added<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:51.030> helicopter<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:52.260> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> at

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
added the the helicopter it's kind of at

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
added the the helicopter it's kind of at
an<00:00:52.739> angle<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.550> gives<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.539> nice

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
an angle which I like gives it a nice

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.819 
an angle which I like gives it a nice
little<00:00:56.000> little<00:00:57.000> look<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.140> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.770> see

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
little little look you can kind of see

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
little little look you can kind of see
how<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> did<00:00:59.280> that<00:01:00.230> under<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> used<00:01:02.960> hinge

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
how I did that under here I used hinge

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.270 
how I did that under here I used hinge
clips<00:01:04.790> pretty<00:01:05.790> typical<00:01:06.830> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.010> want<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
clips pretty typical if you want to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.960 
clips pretty typical if you want to
slide<00:01:08.700> something<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.299> um<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
slide something like that um and then I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.859 
slide something like that um and then I
added<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:12.510> um<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.540> move<00:01:15.689> this

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
added a little um so I can move this

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.980 
added a little um so I can move this
mock<00:01:17.750> without<00:01:18.750> breaking<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> um<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.869> this<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
mock without breaking it um and this is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
mock without breaking it um and this is
pretty<00:01:22.259> sturdy<00:01:22.710> Munich<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> wiggles<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
pretty sturdy Munich it wiggles and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.130 
pretty sturdy Munich it wiggles and
that's<00:01:25.020> uh<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.680> fine<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.060> added<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that's uh that's fine but I added a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.530 
that's uh that's fine but I added a
small<00:01:28.710> pathway<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.390> might<00:01:32.540> make

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
small pathway here I think I might make

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.569 
small pathway here I think I might make
it<00:01:33.720> style<00:01:34.680> instead<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:36.740> instead<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> just

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it style instead of instead of just

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
it style instead of instead of just
bricks<00:01:38.939> oh<00:01:39.150> oh<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.930> mean<00:01:40.170> instead<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.590> just

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
bricks oh oh I mean instead of just

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.770 
bricks oh oh I mean instead of just
studs<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.579> i<00:01:41.610> might<00:01:41.850> add<00:01:41.970> some<00:01:42.150> tile<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.570> but

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
studs so i might add some tile there but

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.249 
studs so i might add some tile there but
you<00:01:42.840> got<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.130> olive<00:01:44.130> green<00:01:44.810> then<00:01:45.810> i<00:01:45.899> move<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you got the olive green then i move the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.319 
you got the olive green then i move the
tree<00:01:46.729> but<00:01:47.960> basically<00:01:48.960> ooh<00:01:50.000> biggest<00:01:51.000> thing<00:01:51.180> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
tree but basically ooh biggest thing is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.139 
tree but basically ooh biggest thing is
i<00:01:51.450> added<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.810> helicopter<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.030> extension<00:01:54.030> and
