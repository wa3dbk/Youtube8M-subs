00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
look better it really encompasses all of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.809 
look better it really encompasses all of
those<00:01:21.020> essential<00:01:21.799> elements<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.459> of<00:01:22.580> course

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
those essential elements and of course

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.669 
those essential elements and of course
nutrition<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.420> huge<00:01:23.659> that's<00:01:23.869> 70%<00:01:24.530> of<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
nutrition is huge that's 70% of the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.889 
nutrition is huge that's 70% of the
equation<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.640> with<00:01:25.850> those<00:01:26.030> 10<00:01:26.360> elements<00:01:26.630> you

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
equation and with those 10 elements you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.359 
equation and with those 10 elements you
also<00:01:27.140> adjust<00:01:27.440> things<00:01:27.560> like<00:01:27.709> stress<00:01:28.069> in

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
also adjust things like stress in

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.430 
also adjust things like stress in
psychology<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.299> really<00:01:29.630> put<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.959> into<00:01:30.409> a

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
psychology so you really put it into a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.740 
psychology so you really put it into a
context<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.250> not<00:01:31.670> isolate<00:01:32.179> fitness<00:01:32.600> or

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
context and not isolate fitness or

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.850 
context and not isolate fitness or
nutrition<00:01:32.780> that's<00:01:33.319> correct

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
nutrition that's correct

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.770 
nutrition that's correct
yeah<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.280> solution<00:01:34.759> is<00:01:34.880> not<00:01:35.090> one-dimensional

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
yeah the solution is not one-dimensional

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.669 
yeah the solution is not one-dimensional
and<00:01:35.869> that's<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.110> biggest<00:01:36.289> mistake<00:01:36.649> people

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
and that's the biggest mistake people

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.289 
and that's the biggest mistake people
make<00:01:37.039> they<00:01:37.190> think<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.640> all<00:01:37.729> happens<00:01:38.090> here

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
make they think that it all happens here

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.699 
make they think that it all happens here
it<00:01:38.450> all<00:01:38.539> happens<00:01:38.840> at<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.049> dinner<00:01:39.229> table<00:01:39.409> and

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
it all happens at the dinner table and

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:41.469 
it all happens at the dinner table and
it's<00:01:40.009> not<00:01:40.220> that's<00:01:40.459> just<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.789> beginning<00:01:40.880> yeah

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
it's not that's just the beginning yeah

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.359 
it's not that's just the beginning yeah
so<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.229> body<00:01:42.439> mist<00:01:42.679> device<00:01:43.069> it's

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
so this is a body mist device it's

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.309 
so this is a body mist device it's
absolutely<00:01:44.030> invaluable<00:01:44.299> for<00:01:44.750> me<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.020> provides

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
absolutely invaluable for me it provides

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.139 
absolutely invaluable for me it provides
all<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.709> information<00:01:46.160> I<00:01:46.250> need<00:01:46.429> and<00:01:46.640> obviously

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
all the information I need and obviously

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.729 
all the information I need and obviously
it<00:01:47.239> keeps<00:01:47.390> me<00:01:47.509> very<00:01:47.599> accountable<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.679> I

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:48.739 
it keeps me very accountable so that I

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.680 
it keeps me very accountable so that I
can<00:01:48.950> prove<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.399> success<00:01:49.580> of<00:01:50.000> our<00:01:50.360> clients

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
can prove the success of our clients

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.880 
can prove the success of our clients
because<00:01:50.929> losing<00:01:51.229> weight<00:01:51.349> doesn't<00:01:51.619> tell<00:01:51.860> us

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
because losing weight doesn't tell us

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.070 
because losing weight doesn't tell us
anything<00:01:52.069> it's<00:01:52.429> losing<00:01:52.700> excess<00:01:53.000> fat<00:01:53.420> and/or

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
anything it's losing excess fat and/or

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.660 
anything it's losing excess fat and/or
gaining<00:01:54.440> muscle<00:01:54.739> that's<00:01:55.129> how<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.369> improve

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
gaining muscle that's how you improve

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.630 
gaining muscle that's how you improve
composition<00:01:56.979> ok<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.039> what's<00:01:58.280> happening<00:01:58.550> right

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
composition ok so what's happening right

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.339 
composition ok so what's happening right
now<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:59.000> gonna<00:01:59.090> take<00:01:59.149> about<00:01:59.330> 45<00:01:59.780> seconds<00:02:00.319> to

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
now it's gonna take about 45 seconds to

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.139 
now it's gonna take about 45 seconds to
do<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:00.679> test<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.129> there's<00:02:01.459> five<00:02:01.789> different

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
do this test and there's five different

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.150

well<00:03:02.409> I've<00:03:02.650> designed<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.099> ab<00:03:03.280> machine<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.610> do

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
well I've designed this ab machine to do

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.729 
well I've designed this ab machine to do
exactly<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.450> when<00:03:04.870> we<00:03:05.019> add<00:03:05.170> weight<00:03:05.409> to<00:03:05.590> this

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
exactly that when we add weight to this

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.949 
exactly that when we add weight to this
post<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.310> acts<00:03:06.519> as<00:03:06.670> a<00:03:06.700> gravity<00:03:07.180> assist<00:03:07.209> so

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
post it acts as a gravity assist so

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.780 
post it acts as a gravity assist so
we're<00:03:08.110> adding<00:03:08.290> 20<00:03:08.769> pounds<00:03:09.099> so<00:03:09.489> let's<00:03:09.670> say<00:03:09.730> you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
we're adding 20 pounds so let's say you

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.210 
we're adding 20 pounds so let's say you

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.670 
reps whatever that number is and you
can't<00:03:13.720> quite<00:03:13.840> get<00:03:14.019> it<00:03:14.140> well<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.349> can<00:03:14.470> add

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
can't quite get it well you can add

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.770 
can't quite get it well you can add
weight<00:03:14.920> until<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.280> do<00:03:15.430> as<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:16.239> strengthen<00:03:16.510> as

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
weight until you do as you strengthen as

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.940 
weight until you do as you strengthen as
you<00:03:16.959> improve<00:03:17.200> we<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.530> take<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> weight<00:03:17.890> off

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
you improve we can take the weight off

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.039 
you improve we can take the weight off
it<00:03:18.310> ultimately<00:03:18.760> add<00:03:19.120> resistance<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.959> the

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
it ultimately add resistance to the

it ultimately add resistance to the
other<00:03:20.170> post<00:03:20.470> so<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.280> an<00:03:21.400> Annihilator<00:03:21.910> if

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
other post so this is an Annihilator if

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.509 
other post so this is an Annihilator if
you<00:03:22.060> want<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.239> give<00:03:22.329> it<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.450> try<00:03:24.450> all<00:03:25.450> right<00:03:26.519> now

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
you want to give it a try all right now

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.650 
you want to give it a try all right now
the<00:03:27.579> more<00:03:27.819> you<00:03:27.849> pull<00:03:28.060> with<00:03:28.150> your<00:03:28.209> quads<00:03:28.480> are

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
the more you pull with your quads are

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.850 
the more you pull with your quads are
the<00:03:28.720> more<00:03:28.870> low<00:03:29.079> ab<00:03:29.230> you're<00:03:29.379> going<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.560> get<00:03:29.680> the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
the more low ab you're going to get the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.069 
the more low ab you're going to get the
more<00:03:30.040> arms<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.579> more<00:03:30.700> upper<00:03:30.970> ab<00:03:31.120> can<00:03:31.870> always

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
more arms the more upper ab can always

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.360 
more arms the more upper ab can always
hit<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.319> inner<00:03:32.470> crosses<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:32.980> oblique<00:03:33.220> by

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
hit the inner crosses and oblique by

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.009 
hit the inner crosses and oblique by
twisting<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.940> feel<00:03:34.209> in<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.450> lower<00:03:34.569> abs<00:03:34.870> right

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
twisting I feel in the lower abs right

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.800 
twisting I feel in the lower abs right
now<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:36.120> mean<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.180> don't<00:03:37.329> think<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.599> do<00:03:37.660> much

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
now I mean I don't think I can do much

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:46.199 
now I mean I don't think I can do much
more<00:03:38.019> but<00:03:38.079> really<00:03:38.769> maybe<00:03:39.250> two<00:03:39.489> tens<00:03:45.060> suck<00:03:46.060> it

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
more but really maybe two tens suck it

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:54.660 
more but really maybe two tens suck it
up<00:03:52.410> those<00:03:53.410> abs<00:03:53.680> are<00:03:53.890> dunzo

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
up those abs are dunzo

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.910 
up those abs are dunzo
all<00:03:55.629> right<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:55.959> grant<00:03:56.410> tell<00:03:56.560> me<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.650> little<00:03:56.799> bit

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
all right so grant tell me a little bit

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.620 
all right so grant tell me a little bit
about<00:03:57.099> this<00:03:57.430> machine<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:57.940> what<00:03:58.060> separates<00:03:58.540> it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
about this machine and what separates it

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.740 
about this machine and what separates it
from<00:03:58.690> typical<00:03:59.760> free<00:04:00.760> weight<00:04:01.480> training

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
from typical free weight training

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.949 
from typical free weight training
ribbons<00:04:02.319> this<00:04:03.160> is<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.340> strive<00:04:03.669> machine<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.419> think

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
ribbons this is a strive machine I think

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.390 
ribbons this is a strive machine I think
it's<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.319> best<00:04:05.470> machine<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.859> the<00:04:05.950> planet<00:04:05.980> as

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
it's the best machine on the planet as

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.460 
it's the best machine on the planet as
is<00:04:06.579> all<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.060> strive<00:04:07.299> line<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:08.049> reason<00:04:08.230> is

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
is all of the strive line the reason is

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.470 
is all of the strive line the reason is
it's<00:04:08.650> got<00:04:08.769> an<00:04:08.859> adjustable<00:04:08.950> cam<00:04:09.609> now<00:04:10.120> for<00:04:10.359> what

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
it's got an adjustable cam now for what

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.759 
it's got an adjustable cam now for what
the<00:04:10.599> audience<00:04:10.959> may<00:04:11.049> not<00:04:11.230> realize<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.739> that

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
the audience may not realize is that

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.259 
the audience may not realize is that
most<00:04:12.130> strength<00:04:12.430> pieces<00:04:12.730> of<00:04:12.790> equipment<00:04:13.120> all

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
most strength pieces of equipment all

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.300 
most strength pieces of equipment all
the<00:04:13.329> fix<00:04:13.930> cam<00:04:14.230> which<00:04:14.470> means<00:04:14.709> it's<00:04:14.889> generally

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
the fix cam which means it's generally

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.650 
the fix cam which means it's generally
heaviest<00:04:15.669> at<00:04:15.819> the<00:04:15.910> midpoint<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.479> lift

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
heaviest at the midpoint of the lift

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.270 
heaviest at the midpoint of the lift
obviously<00:04:17.289> this<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.590> bicep<00:04:17.919> machine<00:04:18.160> so

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
obviously this is the bicep machine so

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.529 
obviously this is the bicep machine so
we're<00:04:18.370> going<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.519> targeting<00:04:18.970> your<00:04:19.060> biceps<00:04:21.539> so

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
we're going to targeting your biceps so

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.779 
we're going to targeting your biceps so
give<00:04:23.410> me<00:04:23.500> about<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:24.010> know<00:04:24.130> four<00:04:24.340> or<00:04:24.400> five<00:04:24.550> reps

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
give me about you know four or five reps

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.820 
give me about you know four or five reps
now<00:04:25.030> another<00:04:25.510> misnomer<00:04:25.960> out<00:04:26.349> there<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.710> that

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
now another misnomer out there is that

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.520 
now another misnomer out there is that
if<00:04:26.979> he<00:04:27.099> went<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.400> complete<00:04:27.729> failure<00:04:28.320> he's<00:04:29.320> not

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
if he went to complete failure he's not

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.990 
if he went to complete failure he's not
attacked<00:04:29.889> all<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.070> muscle<00:04:30.430> fibers<00:04:30.729> if<00:04:30.880> we

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
attacked all the muscle fibers if we

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.400 
attacked all the muscle fibers if we
actually<00:04:31.330> change<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.690> cam<00:04:31.990> he<00:04:32.169> would<00:04:32.289> be

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
actually change the cam he would be

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.750 
actually change the cam he would be
fresh<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:32.830> be<00:04:32.889> able<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.099> knock<00:04:33.220> off<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.430> couple

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
fresh and be able to knock off a couple

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.790 
fresh and be able to knock off a couple
more<00:04:33.880> okay<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:34.630> now<00:04:34.930> immediately<00:04:35.320> I'm<00:04:35.650> going

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
more okay so now immediately I'm going

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.379 
more okay so now immediately I'm going
to<00:04:35.860> change<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.130> camp<00:04:36.370> tell<00:04:36.849> me<00:04:36.970> what<00:04:37.090> happens

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
to change the camp tell me what happens

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.120 
to change the camp tell me what happens
okay<00:04:38.200> oh<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:40.570> harder<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.960> top<00:04:41.169> right<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.010> now

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
okay oh it's harder the top right so now

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.440 
okay oh it's harder the top right so now
we're<00:04:42.280> attacking<00:04:42.789> a<00:04:42.849> different<00:04:43.120> part<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
we're attacking a different part of the

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.600 
we're attacking a different part of the
biceps<00:04:43.599> we're<00:04:44.470> recruiting<00:04:44.740> different<00:04:45.280> fibers

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
biceps we're recruiting different fibers

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.159 
biceps we're recruiting different fibers
and<00:04:45.760> we're<00:04:45.880> gonna<00:04:45.970> try<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.300> annihilate<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.050> now

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
and we're gonna try to annihilate it now

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.450 
and we're gonna try to annihilate it now
