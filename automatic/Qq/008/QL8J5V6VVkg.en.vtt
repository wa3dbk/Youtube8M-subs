00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.370
 hello to all friends 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.430
 a greeting to panic and welcome to this 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.360
 new video on right-handers today we come back with 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.670
 a series I used to do 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.949
 let's say at the beginning of the birth of 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.449
 channel that I continued until we say 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.610
 a few months ago it was suspended 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.340
 or testing best weapon x which 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.630
 resumes today because in very many me 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.850
 you asked to talk to you and to 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.649
 review the sniper rifle from 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.660
 sniper I'm using in these 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.000
 weeks that you often see me 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.460
 use in the various live I'm talking about 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.020
 of veiled shadow what a good side is 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.930
 umbro velata and the sniper that it was 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.899
 introduced with the last dlc released on 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.090
 wolf hunter and that is for sale or 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.860
 the better it is for sale has been in 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.129
 sale by various loyal csil which is the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.050
 vendor on the atoll that deals with 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.010
 sell equipment and gifts 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:05.799
 inherent in the house of wolves or 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.229
 probable through the legs then the 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.790
 slow legs let's say what it means 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.250
 giving inside an armored core a 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.860
 armed core you have the possibility of 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.049
 generate weaponry equipment 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.430
 random always from the wolf family or 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.430
 drop skilled even here from prison 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.110
 of the elderly at level 35 once 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.750
 defeated you know you have the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.930
 possibility of dropping a weapon I have it 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.000
 dropped the first day I did 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.740
 the principal of the elderly because they hogan 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.290
 plateau indeed and honeyed in reward 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.250
 I never have this veiled shadow 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.780
 used 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.400
 I'm honest I used it in 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.710
 last weeks because after the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.250
 a lot of criticisms, even right to 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.110
 second of the opinions seen mine 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.000
 use of the final round in the crucible 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.220
 with regard to the light hooks 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.979
 you know things now I'll show you that 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.930
 I used it only for convenience, but I think it was 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.520
 even without an ending and therefore among all 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.159
 the snipers I decided to use 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.439
 this veiled shadow and you will tell me panic 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.640
 but because since it is a gun from 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.670
 sniper 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.560
 fact is studied for pve why 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.000
 so why the statistics are a lot 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.860
 very good and above all cadence 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.260
 impact are more than satisfying then 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.480
 because he has the car and in but it is not right 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.700
 call it 8m we call haim assistance 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.670
 higher than the game with regard to i 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.170
 Sniper rifles are not something you 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.110
 it helps, I would certainly be there if you are not 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.480
 capable and meanwhile under my house passes 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.660
 in the garbage truck we said if 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.819
 you are not able to use the sniper no 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.060
 is that with the car you haim become 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.320
 suddenly phenomena indeed 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.660
 find the same difficulties is one thing 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.810
 that for those who dope like me there 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.550
 helps lane assist and as practically vi 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.870
 makes aiming slow a little 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.890
 when you pass on the head of an enemy 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.890
 as on call of duty 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.489
 to understand each other and above all when you want 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.140
 do quick scoop you have more possibilities 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.790
 to hit the head 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.260
 the parks I use are viewfinder brought 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.140
 look because it allows me precisely to 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.160
 be faster in taking aim 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.019
 refueling is the only one because really 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.840
 useful at pvp level because when 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.390
 We're running out of ammunition and let's do it 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.269
 exceeds the charger fills in the tier 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.980
 of the parks half use stability 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.739
 this because unfortunately the rifles from 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.019
 sniper year in big defect that is 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.280
 that when they shoot you aiming it lands 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.590
 all especially if you are stuck 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.540
 on the head of an enemy with balance 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.000
 perfect in spite of charger from 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.130
 field that gave me one more blow 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.470
 but let's say he didn't help me in the 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.690
 stability with the perfect shot the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.340
 I can do this first and then ad 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.380
 avoid that barrier problem 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.480
 of amira when the last one shoots me 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.459
 because oil burns stilettos for the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.870
 more pine we care absolutely nothing 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.060
 this sniper I'm with 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.320
 really good that I'm using 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.470
 very much I have collected so many 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.760
 so many clips with this sniper this 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.500
 because they plan to do 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.780
 let me make a mount c for September that 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.430
 include sniper and other things and all 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.230
 the clips I've made can be found anyway 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.470
 on my profile so if anything on people 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.820
 on xbox and search go in mine 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.829
 activity you see all the clips but 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.810
 however it came I will leave some here 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.760
 at the end of the video to show you also a 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.410
 little bit of gameplay summarizing 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.390
 this is a sniper that absolutely 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.269
 I recommend you buy it to try 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.379
 it seems if you don't have it yet 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.120
 you will see that if you are a little bit 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:23.289
 this sniper's ability to do this 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.690
 tell you why I also really like the 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.729
 skin the gameplay as it shoots as a target 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.800
 etcetera etc. and also precisely of 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.289
 increase your accuracy 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.330
 your satisfaction in blowing up the 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.620
 head to the opponents 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.180
