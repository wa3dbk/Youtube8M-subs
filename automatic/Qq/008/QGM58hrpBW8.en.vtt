hello<00:00:02.100> YouTube<00:00:03.380> today<00:00:04.380> we're<00:00:04.589> going<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.799> be

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
hello YouTube today we're going to be

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.360 
hello YouTube today we're going to be
looking<00:00:05.040> at<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.700> m2<00:00:06.480> flat<00:00:06.810> knife<00:00:07.160> this<00:00:08.160> would

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
looking at the m2 flat knife this would

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.150 
looking at the m2 flat knife this would
have<00:00:08.460> originally<00:00:08.970> been<00:00:09.000> carried<00:00:09.660> by<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.650> USA

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
have originally been carried by the USA

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.330 
have originally been carried by the USA
born<00:00:11.340> troops<00:00:11.700> during<00:00:11.910> World<00:00:12.210> War<00:00:12.269> two<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
born troops during World War two the

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.440 
born troops during World War two the
main<00:00:14.340> reason<00:00:14.639> why<00:00:14.730> I'm<00:00:14.820> actually<00:00:14.969> doing<00:00:15.299> this

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
main reason why I'm actually doing this

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.029 
main reason why I'm actually doing this
video<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.020> fact<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.470> couldn't<00:00:16.800> find

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
video is the fact that I couldn't find

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.060 
video is the fact that I couldn't find
any<00:00:17.340> information<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.710> YouTube<00:00:19.710> more<00:00:19.949> on

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
any information on YouTube more on

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
any information on YouTube more on
anything<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.970> axon<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.510> thought<00:00:21.689> it'd<00:00:21.810> be

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
anything on this axon I thought it'd be

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.990 
anything on this axon I thought it'd be
nice<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> sort<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.250> show<00:00:23.519> little<00:00:23.760> video<00:00:23.970> about

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
nice to sort of show little video about

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
nice to sort of show little video about
there<00:00:24.390> start<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.320> discussion<00:00:25.740> maybe

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
there start a little discussion maybe

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.500 
there start a little discussion maybe
about<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.430> knife<00:00:26.609> ii<00:00:26.939> little<00:00:27.269> bit<00:00:27.359> more

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

some comments sort of just telling me a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.069 
some comments sort of just telling me a
little<00:00:32.759> bit<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.000> may<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.540> great<00:00:33.840> that

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
little bit that may that be great that

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.280 
little bit that may that be great that
would<00:00:34.399> this<00:00:35.399> was<00:00:35.730> produced<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
would this was produced for the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.340 
would this was produced for the
briquette<00:00:37.800> british<00:00:38.190> market<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.350> they've

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
briquette british market so they've

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.779 
briquette british market so they've
actually<00:00:40.500> disabled<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.489> flicking<00:00:41.910> mechanism

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
actually disabled the flicking mechanism

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.220 
actually disabled the flicking mechanism
they've<00:00:44.789> actually<00:00:45.059> disabled<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> flicking

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
they've actually disabled the flicking

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
they've actually disabled the flicking
mechanism<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.120> when<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.149> first<00:00:48.390> picked<00:00:48.570> up

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
mechanism on this when I first picked up

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.959 
mechanism on this when I first picked up
also<00:00:48.960> sort<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.559> around<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> hinged<00:00:50.399> area<00:00:50.760> they

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
also sort of around the hinged area they

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.450 
also sort of around the hinged area they
did<00:00:51.030> seem<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> put<00:00:51.570> some<00:00:51.690> sort<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> wood<00:00:51.989> glue

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
did seem to put some sort of wood glue

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.799 
did seem to put some sort of wood glue
on<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.610> well<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.000> slow<00:00:54.329> sort<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
on as well just to slow sort of the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.170 
on as well just to slow sort of the
mechanism<00:00:55.260> down<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.850> spring

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
mechanism down as you can see the spring

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.930 
mechanism down as you can see the spring
is<00:00:57.329> pretty<00:00:57.660> pathetic<00:00:58.250> with<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.489> messing

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
is pretty pathetic with a bit of messing

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.790 
is pretty pathetic with a bit of messing
around<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.539> go<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> work<00:01:01.199> sort<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.620> flick

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
around you can go to work sort of flick

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.850 
around you can go to work sort of flick
it<00:01:01.890> out<00:01:01.949> yourself<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:02.579> bit<00:01:03.500> it's<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.589> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it out yourself a little bit it's not so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.550 
it out yourself a little bit it's not so
bad<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:06.240> say<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.810> mainly<00:01:07.409> for

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
bad as I say this is mainly for

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.820 
bad as I say this is mainly for
re-enacting<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.430> display<00:01:08.880> purposes<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.830> I'm

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
re-enacting and display purposes so I'm

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.810 
re-enacting and display purposes so I'm
not<00:01:11.010> particularly<00:01:11.250> worried<00:01:11.549> about<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
not particularly worried about the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.080 
not particularly worried about the
actual<00:01:12.299> action<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> knife<00:01:12.960> itself<00:01:14.090> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
actual action of the knife itself the

main specifications this actual knife is
a<00:01:18.170> GP<00:01:19.170> plastic<00:01:19.710> handle<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.600> knife<00:01:21.600> is

stainless steel and goes camera to focus
here<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:28.430> probably<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> half

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
there are flicking actions you can see

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.460 
there are flicking actions you can see
is<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.299> simple<00:01:45.600> push<00:01:45.810> button<00:01:48.470> locking

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is just a simple push button locking

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
actual quality of the knife itself isn't

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.209 
actual quality of the knife itself isn't
too<00:01:55.829> bad<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.399> honest<00:01:57.560> it's<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:58.770> bit

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
too bad to be honest it's a little bit

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.540 
too bad to be honest it's a little bit
loose<00:01:59.460> it<00:02:00.390> could<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> bit<00:02:00.840> tighter<00:02:01.079> but

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.140 

like<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:06.640> say<00:02:06.760> this<00:02:06.880> would<00:02:07.000> have<00:02:07.090> been

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
like you say this would have been

one actually carried their kit in it in

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.040 
one actually carried their kit in it in
a<00:02:22.030> specific<00:02:22.150> way<00:02:22.450> where<00:02:22.750> they<00:02:22.840> felt

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
a specific way where they felt

a specific way where they felt
comfortable<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:24.430> generally<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.060> was<00:02:25.150> used

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
comfortable in but generally it was used

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.000 
comfortable in but generally it was used

flick knife sorry really the sort of

flick knife sorry really the sort of
general<00:02:30.940> purpose<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.540> would<00:02:31.630> imagine<00:02:31.840> where

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
general purpose I would imagine where

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.979 
general purpose I would imagine where
they<00:02:32.230> would<00:02:32.350> have<00:02:32.440> carried<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.780> if<00:02:34.780> they

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
they would have carried this is if they

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.810 
they would have carried this is if they
got<00:02:35.230> sort<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.709> caught<00:02:35.920> up<00:02:36.100> in<00:02:36.220> their<00:02:36.340> parachute

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
got sort of caught up in their parachute

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.460 
got sort of caught up in their parachute
for<00:02:37.000> example<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.540> rigging<00:02:37.750> or<00:02:38.170> they

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
for example in the rigging or they

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.199 
for example in the rigging or they
couldn't<00:02:38.739> get<00:02:38.830> out<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.070> harness<00:02:39.280> as<00:02:39.700> the

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
couldn't get out of the harness as the

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.490 
couldn't get out of the harness as the
first<00:02:40.420> patent<00:02:40.750> harness<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.260> AE<00:02:41.380> to

first patent harness on the AE to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.680 
first patent harness on the AE to
parachute<00:02:42.090> was<00:02:43.090> actually<00:02:43.390> quite<00:02:43.510> difficult

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
parachute was actually quite difficult

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.000 
parachute was actually quite difficult
to<00:02:43.900> get<00:02:44.019> out<00:02:44.110> though<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.500> they<00:02:44.620> generally

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
to get out though so they generally

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.220 
to get out though so they generally
tends<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.340> cut<00:02:45.550> themselves<00:02:45.760> at<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.269> red<00:02:46.420> now

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
tends to cut themselves at the red now

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.810 
tends to cut themselves at the red now
if<00:02:47.350> they<00:02:47.470> were<00:02:47.590> able<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.890> get<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.310> M<00:02:48.459> 3

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
if they were able to get to that M 3

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.180 
if they were able to get to that M 3
fighting<00:02:49.090> night<00:02:49.420> for<00:02:49.570> example<00:02:49.660> then<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:51.010> is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
fighting night for example then this is

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.690 
fighting night for example then this is
the<00:02:51.370> next<00:02:51.640> best<00:02:51.790> thing<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.060> turn<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:53.700> looking

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
the next best thing to turn to looking

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.930 
the next best thing to turn to looking
at<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.910> handle<00:02:55.120> if<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.300> go<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.480> focus<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:57.700> you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
at the handle if I go to focus as you

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.300 
at the handle if I go to focus as you
can<00:02:58.060> see<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.930> part<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.560> there<00:02:59.830> we<00:02:59.950> go

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
can see the part in there we go

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.660 
can see the part in there we go
this<00:03:00.510> actually<00:03:01.950> looks<00:03:02.950> like<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.160> rigid<00:03:03.430> would

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
this actually looks like a rigid would

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.220 
this actually looks like a rigid would
be<00:03:03.790> made<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.180> bone<00:03:04.390> or<00:03:04.660> some<00:03:04.959> sort<00:03:05.110> of<00:03:05.140> an

be made of a bone or some sort of an
antler<00:03:05.910> visit<00:03:06.910> here<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:07.239> just<00:03:07.420> plastic
