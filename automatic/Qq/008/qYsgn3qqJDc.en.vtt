information<00:02:41.000> on<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.140> have<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.470> say<00:02:42.590> it's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
information on it and I have to say it's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.170 
information on it and I have to say it's
a<00:02:42.709> lot<00:02:42.859> smaller<00:02:43.129> than<00:02:43.250> other<00:02:43.519> ones<00:02:43.730> other<00:02:44.000> ones

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
a lot smaller than other ones other ones

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.319 
a lot smaller than other ones other ones
about<00:02:44.390> double<00:02:44.689> the<00:02:44.750> size<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.319> lot<00:02:45.500> thicker<00:02:45.650> too

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
about double the size a lot thicker too

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.030 
about double the size a lot thicker too
so<00:02:47.329> it's<00:02:47.450> kind<00:02:47.599> of<00:02:47.629> easier<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.560> hide<00:02:48.709> behind
