phenomenal this is something I've
noticed<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.930> most<00:01:19.170> net<00:01:19.470> Tim<00:01:19.680> phones<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
noticed on most net Tim phones is that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
noticed on most net Tim phones is that
they<00:01:21.180> tend<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.570> three<00:01:21.840> four<00:01:22.200> bars<00:01:22.740> no

this<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:30.509> Neptune<00:01:30.990> has

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this is because I think Neptune has

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.289 
this is because I think Neptune has
deals<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.619> use<00:01:31.770> both<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.189> Verizon<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> 18
