the Hari old kettle the electric kettle

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.390 
the Hari old kettle the electric kettle
that's<00:00:17.369> powered<00:00:18.150> now<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.710> kettle<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.220> nice

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
that's powered now this kettle is nice

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.810 
that's powered now this kettle is nice
because<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.650> disconnects<00:00:22.650> from<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.670> base

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
because it disconnects from the base

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.990 
because it disconnects from the base
there<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.779> no<00:00:24.930> wired<00:00:25.890> connecting<00:00:26.760> while

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
there is no wired connecting while

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.560 
there is no wired connecting while
you're<00:00:27.570> pouring<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.230> features<00:00:29.269> nice<00:00:30.269> things

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570

stainless<00:00:31.289> steel<00:00:31.470> finished<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.550> has<00:00:32.730> again

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
stainless steel finished that has again

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.040 
stainless steel finished that has again
the<00:00:33.390> gooseneck<00:00:34.760> spout<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the gooseneck spout that we all know and

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.810 
the gooseneck spout that we all know and
love<00:00:39.200> inside<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.620> basically<00:00:41.219> pretty<00:00:42.000> clear

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
love inside is basically pretty clear

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.340 
love inside is basically pretty clear
there's<00:00:44.820> just<00:00:45.059> basically<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.539> heater<00:00:45.780> barn<00:00:46.079> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
there's just basically a heater barn I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
there's just basically a heater barn I
can't<00:00:46.800> see<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.329> just<00:00:48.329> move<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> light<00:00:48.809> here

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
can't see it just move the light here

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.450 
can't see it just move the light here
you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.620> over<00:00:49.800> here<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you can see over here and it's just a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.799 
you can see over here and it's just a
heater<00:00:50.670> bar<00:00:50.989> there's<00:00:51.989> also<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.350> max<00:00:52.649> line<00:00:53.809> see

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
heater bar there's also a max line see

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.619 
heater bar there's also a max line see
if<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.079> could<00:00:55.289> show<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.920> over<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
if I could show you over here see it's a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.630 
if I could show you over here see it's a
species<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> max<00:00:58.590> line<00:00:58.829> over<00:00:59.100> here<00:01:01.640> all

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
species just the max line over here all

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.929 
species just the max line over here all
right<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:04.110> base<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> okays<00:01:05.280> length<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
right so the base has a okays length and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.950 
right so the base has a okays length and
cord<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:07.080> say<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.380> about<00:01:07.680> maybe<00:01:08.750> 3<00:01:09.750> feet

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
cord I would say is about maybe 3 feet

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920 
cord I would say is about maybe 3 feet
or<00:01:10.170> maybe<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.439> yard<00:01:10.710> ruff<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:11.939> since<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
or maybe a yard ruff there since this is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
or maybe a yard ruff there since this is
a<00:01:13.020> Japanese<00:01:13.470> company<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.920> probably<00:01:14.130> some<00:01:15.090> one

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
a Japanese company is probably some one

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.649 
a Japanese company is probably some one
meter<00:01:15.570> by<00:01:15.900> half<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.229> meter<00:01:16.729> okay<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.420> let's<00:01:18.600> just

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
meter by half a meter okay so let's just

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.310 
meter by half a meter okay so let's just
go<00:01:19.020> try<00:01:19.710> using<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> over<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.259> I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
go try using this out so over here I

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.880 
go try using this out so over here I
have<00:01:22.409> some<00:01:23.040> water<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.520> pre<00:01:24.390> measured<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:25.680> pot

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
have some water I pre measured this pot

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.530 
have some water I pre measured this pot
roughly<00:01:28.040> from<00:01:30.650> from<00:01:31.650> using<00:01:32.270> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> past

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
roughly from from using in the past

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
roughly from from using in the past
filling<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> max<00:01:34.950> line<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
filling up to the max line and I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.550 
filling up to the max line and I
measured<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:38.900> 770<00:01:39.900> grams<00:01:39.930> of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
measured it it's about 770 grams of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.230 
measured it it's about 770 grams of
water

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
water

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
water
just<00:01:42.240> probably<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.020> provides<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.470> pretty<00:01:43.710> good

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
just probably it provides a pretty good

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.550 
just probably it provides a pretty good
yield<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.960> hot

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
yield all right so I'm just hot

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.490 
yield all right so I'm just hot
basically<00:01:47.450> once<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> fill<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.170> put<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
basically once you fill up you put the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.780 
basically once you fill up you put the
cap<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.930> push<00:01:52.079> down<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.380> button<00:01:52.790> no

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
cap on you just push down this button no

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.870 
cap on you just push down this button no
I'll<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.360> time<00:01:54.659> over<00:01:54.840> here

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.340 

and<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.090> can<00:02:02.240> see<00:02:02.420> roughly<00:02:02.689> how<00:02:02.990> long<00:02:03.200> it

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and you can see roughly how long it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.259 
and you can see roughly how long it
takes<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:04.450> boil<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.600> water<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:07.119> started<00:02:08.119> a

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
takes to boil the water so I started a

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.540 
takes to boil the water so I started a
couple<00:02:08.569> seconds<00:02:08.869> off<00:02:09.019> so<00:02:09.679> we<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.220> have<00:02:10.459> to

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
couple seconds off so we just have to

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:20.290 
couple seconds off so we just have to
take<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.000> into<00:02:11.330> account<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.910> see<00:02:20.090> over

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
take that into account you see over

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.759 
take that into account you see over
there<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.599> takes<00:02:20.840> roughly<00:02:21.019> about<00:02:21.290> four

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
there it takes roughly about four

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.920 
there it takes roughly about four
minutes<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.160> 30<00:02:22.340> seconds<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:23.330> our<00:02:23.480> case<00:02:23.750> it's

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
minutes and 30 seconds in our case it's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.550 
minutes and 30 seconds in our case it's
nice<00:02:24.430> unscientific<00:02:25.430> method<00:02:25.959> okay<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.349> as<00:02:27.500> you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
nice unscientific method okay so as you

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.390 
nice unscientific method okay so as you
see<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.250> light<00:02:28.430> went<00:02:28.640> off<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:31.010> button<00:02:31.250> over

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
see the light went off the button over

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.490 
see the light went off the button over
here<00:02:31.430> popped<00:02:31.819> up<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.269> Yuka<00:02:32.989> actually<00:02:33.290> seems

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
here popped up and Yuka actually seems

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.030 
here popped up and Yuka actually seems
in<00:02:33.650> steam<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.610> just<00:02:35.030> want<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.299> warn<00:02:35.480> you

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
in steam so I just want to warn you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.080 
in steam so I just want to warn you
while<00:02:37.040> you're<00:02:37.160> using<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.580> cow<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:38.000> be

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
while you're using this cow just be

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.270 
while you're using this cow just be
careful<00:02:38.420> where<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.660> holes<00:02:38.900> are<00:02:39.099> because<00:02:40.099> if

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
careful where the holes are because if

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.009 
careful where the holes are because if
you<00:02:40.400> put<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:42.560> above<00:02:43.489> your<00:02:43.670> hand<00:02:43.970> area<00:02:44.299> to

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
you put it right above your hand area to

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.570 
you put it right above your hand area to
steam<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.380> come<00:02:45.560> up<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.040> might<00:02:46.130> burn<00:02:46.340> you

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
steam I come up and it might burn you

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.320 
steam I come up and it might burn you
okay<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:48.049> one<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.190> flaws<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:49.819> don't<00:02:50.209> like

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
okay so one of the flaws I don't like

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.500 
okay so one of the flaws I don't like
about<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.610> really<00:02:52.940> made<00:02:53.150> for<00:02:53.450> a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
about this this is really made for a

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.380 
about this this is really made for a
right-handed<00:02:54.110> person<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.910> reason<00:02:56.209> is

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
right-handed person the reason is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.900 
right-handed person the reason is
because<00:02:56.510> if<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.709> had<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.220> kettle<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.670> way

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
because if you had the kettle this way

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.160 
because if you had the kettle this way
you<00:02:59.420> can't<00:02:59.660> see<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.019> light<00:03:00.760> right<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.599> you<00:03:02.870> do

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
you can't see the light right but you do

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.870 
you can't see the light right but you do
see<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.530> lever<00:03:03.709> pop<00:03:03.980> up<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.489> can<00:03:04.670> hear<00:03:04.819> it

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
see the lever pop up and you can hear it

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.000 
see the lever pop up and you can hear it
okay<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.709> now<00:03:06.829> I'm<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.190> gonna<00:03:07.400> show<00:03:07.609> you<00:03:09.010> the

okay so now I'm just gonna show you the
flow<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.730> water<00:03:10.940> here<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:12.470> give<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.680> an

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.550 
flow of the water here to give you an
idea<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.250> how<00:03:13.519> fast<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.690> how<00:03:14.720> slow<00:03:15.049> you<00:03:15.200> go<00:03:15.319> for

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
idea of how fast and how slow you go for

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.680 
idea of how fast and how slow you go for
it<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:18.010> I'm<00:03:19.010> gonna<00:03:19.100> show<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.639> if<00:03:20.569> you

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
want to pour really fast for pretty fast

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.530 
want to pour really fast for pretty fast
oh<00:03:24.310> by<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.340> way<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.579> water<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.030> scalding<00:03:26.510> hot

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
oh by the way the water is scalding hot

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.599 
oh by the way the water is scalding hot
so<00:03:27.049> what<00:03:27.470> you're<00:03:27.650> doing<00:03:27.889> is<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.160> be<00:03:28.250> definitely

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
so what you're doing is to be definitely

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.099 
so what you're doing is to be definitely
careful<00:03:29.030> okay

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
careful okay

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.720 
careful okay
so<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.530> just<00:03:30.829> want<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.040> show<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.430> level<00:03:31.670> of

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
so I just want to show you the level of

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.770 
so I just want to show you the level of
control<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.150> can<00:03:32.329> have<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:35.269> can<00:03:35.420> see<00:03:35.600> you

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
control you can have you can see you

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.520 
control you can have you can see you
could<00:03:35.930> pour<00:03:36.290> very<00:03:36.590> very<00:03:36.950> very<00:03:37.250> slow<00:03:38.319> also<00:03:39.319> very

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
could pour very very very slow also very

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.910 
could pour very very very slow also very
fast<00:03:40.569> all<00:03:41.569> right<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.109> does<00:03:42.440> require<00:03:42.799> some

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
fast all right so this does require some

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.670 
fast all right so this does require some
practice<00:03:43.750> when<00:03:44.750> you're<00:03:44.840> making<00:03:45.049> pour<00:03:45.440> with

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
practice when you're making pour with

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.490 
practice when you're making pour with
coffee<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:47.269> whatever<00:03:47.780> you're<00:03:48.079> doing<00:03:48.380> with

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
coffee and whatever you're doing with

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.379 
coffee and whatever you're doing with
this<00:03:48.620> kettle<00:03:48.920> but<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.459> could<00:03:49.970> have<00:03:50.030> basic

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
this kettle but you could have basic

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.770 
this kettle but you could have basic
control<00:03:50.720> where<00:03:51.019> you<00:03:51.049> want<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.560> water<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.859> be

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
control where you want the water to be

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.150 
control where you want the water to be
it's<00:03:53.780> very<00:03:53.810> easy<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.530> could<00:03:54.650> control<00:03:55.010> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
it's very easy you could control the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.460 
it's very easy you could control the
screen<00:03:55.310> basically<00:03:55.849> by<00:03:56.000> tilting<00:03:56.420> in<00:03:57.349> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
screen basically by tilting in the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.020 
screen basically by tilting in the
beginning<00:03:57.859> it's<00:03:58.130> gonna<00:03:58.310> be<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.430> little<00:03:58.519> hard<00:03:58.819> to

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
beginning it's gonna be a little hard to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.870 
beginning it's gonna be a little hard to
control<00:03:59.920> but<00:04:00.920> once<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.280> get<00:04:01.459> used<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.970> it

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
control but once you get used to it

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.659 
control but once you get used to it
be<00:04:04.880> very<00:04:05.090> easy<00:04:05.859> and<00:04:06.859> I<00:04:06.920> want<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.280> also<00:04:07.400> point
