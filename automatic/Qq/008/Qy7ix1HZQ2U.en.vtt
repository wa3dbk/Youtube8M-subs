00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello you love here I show you how 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.780
 her an origami ladybug side ahead 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.050
 I'll make a suitable one first 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.090
 shamrock for the lucky beetle 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.650
 You fold the paper from below 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.780
 above and then from the right again 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.840
 to the left so that the closed 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.400
 page shows to you now paint a her 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.779
 heart up or do it like me and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.779
 just cut it off 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.240
 the leaflet unfolded again and that 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.240
 Shamrock is ready 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.690
 Now continue with the ladybird 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.170
 garden you need a triangular piece 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.170
 paper 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.730
 the closed lower corner of old animal 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.730
 to the middle 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.299
 thus the beetle is symmetrical make 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.189
 I can feel like a little help 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.189
 I get the corners better with the times 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.240
 and now the two lower ones will be 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.870
 corners on the half of the diagonal 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.870
 filed 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.360
 the two little wing tips become 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.560
 Laid down so that he leaves the wings 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.560
 could move freely 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.200
 so that the whole looks like a wing 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.160
 the same tips will be repeated 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.160
 folded after them 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.330
 so after loud peak times 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.569
 all you need is the ladybug on 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.569
 Main 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.200
 and along with the cloverleaf is that 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.090
 a nice idea for the new year's panel 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.040
 or soon for spring 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.600
 That's it. See you next time 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.600
 video up because
