00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
schools to all the children that the

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.850 
schools to all the children that the
solar<00:01:40.180> system<00:01:40.690> has<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.990> Sun<00:01:41.259> in<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.530> middle

and planets going in circles around it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.399 
and planets going in circles around it
like<00:01:45.070> this<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.549> we<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.909> mean<00:01:46.540> in<00:01:46.659> my<00:01:46.840> school<00:01:47.170> we

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
like this and we I mean in my school we

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.340 
like this and we I mean in my school we
even<00:01:47.560> had<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.280> little<00:01:48.820> device<00:01:49.270> where<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:50.140> had

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
even had a little device where you had

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.139 
even had a little device where you had
the<00:01:50.500> Sun<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.009> middle<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.550> you<00:01:51.640> could<00:01:51.790> turn

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
the Sun in the middle and you could turn

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.630 
the Sun in the middle and you could turn
the<00:01:52.330> little<00:01:52.680> thing<00:01:53.680> on<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:53.920> bottom<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.460> and

the little thing on the bottom and and

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.359 
the little thing on the bottom and and
the<00:01:55.060> planets<00:01:55.509> would<00:01:55.630> go<00:01:55.810> around<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.220> know

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
the planets would go around and you know

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.690 
the planets would go around and you know

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
thinking of the solar system this way is

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.300 
thinking of the solar system this way is
equivalent<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.789> thinking<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.450> earth<00:02:04.660> is<00:02:04.960> flat

are following producing a huge
elliptical<00:02:16.420> quarrel<00:02:17.110> in<00:02:17.260> space<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.250> year

after<00:02:19.360> year<00:02:19.660> we<00:02:20.590> do<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.190> trace<00:02:21.850> them<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.750> same

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
after year we do not trace them the same

after year we do not trace them the same
circle<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.940> space<00:02:25.360> were<00:02:25.630> actually<00:02:26.130> thousands

and thousands and millions of miles from

and thousands and millions of miles from
where<00:02:29.319> we<00:02:29.709> were<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.400> year<00:02:30.670> before<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.540> to

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
where we were the year before so to

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.759 
where we were the year before so to
think<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.620> our<00:02:32.769> solar<00:02:33.069> system<00:02:33.220> as<00:02:33.819> some<00:02:34.150> flat

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
think of our solar system as some flat

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.100 
think of our solar system as some flat
structure<00:02:35.769> that's<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:37.150> stationary<00:02:37.780> is

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
structure that's that stationary is

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.910 
structure that's that stationary is
again<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:39.280> result<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.230> isolating<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.350> system

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
again the result of isolating a system

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.550 
again the result of isolating a system
and<00:02:42.220> trying<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.360> analyze<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.380> and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
and trying to analyze it and and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.949 
and trying to analyze it and and
typically<00:02:45.370> when<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.790> do<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.420> get<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
typically when you do so you get the

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.530 
typically when you do so you get the
wrong<00:02:47.170> data<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:48.280> soon<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.910> open<00:02:49.510> the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
wrong data as soon as you open the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.660 
wrong data as soon as you open the
system<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.410> realize<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.950> solar<00:02:51.190> system

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
system and you realize the solar system

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.729 
system and you realize the solar system
is<00:02:51.820> inside<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.390> galaxy<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:53.110> moving<00:02:53.470> through

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
is inside the galaxy and moving through

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.250 
is inside the galaxy and moving through
space<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.120> realize<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.540> actually

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
space then you realize that actually

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.220 
space then you realize that actually
we're<00:02:56.440> making<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:57.160> pilgrimage<00:02:58.230> literally

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
we're making a pilgrimage literally

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.729 
we're making a pilgrimage literally
through<00:02:59.890> space<00:03:00.370> as<00:03:00.670> we<00:03:01.329> evolve<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.560> could

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
through space as we evolve and you could

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.009 
through space as we evolve and you could
even<00:03:02.980> think<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.180> concept<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.870> a

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
even think of it in the concept of a

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.849 
even think of it in the concept of a
vacuum<00:03:05.980> structure<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.299> we<00:03:07.570> are<00:03:07.859> embedding

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
vacuum structure that we are embedding

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.670 
vacuum structure that we are embedding
all<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.579> our<00:03:09.730> evolution<00:03:10.510> on<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:11.079> structure<00:03:11.650> of

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
all of our evolution on the structure of

all of our evolution on the structure of
the<00:03:11.799> vacuum<00:03:11.950> as<00:03:12.579> we<00:03:13.090> move

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
the vacuum as we move

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.210 
the vacuum as we move
to<00:03:13.879> that<00:03:14.090> great<00:03:14.569> spiral<00:03:15.170> we<00:03:15.620> producing

to that great spiral we producing

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.420 
to that great spiral we producing
through<00:03:16.489> space<00:03:16.819> every<00:03:17.750> single<00:03:18.349> individual<00:03:19.220> on

our planet producing that very specific

the way back when - when they were in

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.089 
the way back when - when they were in
the<00:03:32.000> womb<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.510> their<00:03:32.690> mother<00:03:32.750> which<00:03:33.620> connects

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
the womb of their mother which connects

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.850 
the womb of their mother which connects
their<00:03:34.459> spiral<00:03:34.849> with<00:03:35.540> their<00:03:35.840> mother's<00:03:36.260> spiral

their spiral with their mother's spiral
and<00:03:36.980> then<00:03:37.310> followed<00:03:37.819> that<00:03:37.849> back<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.810> again

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
and then followed that back and again

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.440
