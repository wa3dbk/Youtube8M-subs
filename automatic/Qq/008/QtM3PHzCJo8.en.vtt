 khan on television more open than

 never teams that prepare for the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.510
 2014 closing and started in a good way 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.130
 the preseason for blue cross a team 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.740
 that directed by luis fernando tena 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
 defeated the colts in friendly match 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.160
 iron of the atlante precisely the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.050
 current quarterback of the machine spoke of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.279
 how he saw his team and also the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.279
 Fabian frame performance 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 little by little, luis fernando had a strategist 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.689
 of blue cross goes knowing the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.419
 strengths and weaknesses of your team 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.010
 face the next tournament after returning 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.360
 to work in the facilities of the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.250
 ferris wheel and direct their first 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.620
 Workouts in front of the machine 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.420
 Skinny showed up at the blue stadium 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.760
 after several years to beat the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.710
 Atlante 2 for 0 in his second encounter 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.790
 of preparation facing the next 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.730
 season 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.270
 it's also pretty good is a team 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.510
 that has a good base that has 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.480
 good soccer habits and in 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.650
 terms of being good professionals 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.810
 we just wanted to grab 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.150
 all all that good of a team that in 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.360
 general plays soccer well 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.210
 and the ball is to say we did not start from 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.130
 zero even if we are arriving a team 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.590
 with good base and with good habits and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.560
 that's what we're grabbing for 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.630
 give it to fly 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.490
 regardless of the result before the foals 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.740
 that ended has defined with goals 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 christian gimÃ©nez and javi vice tena 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.460
 discarded the arrival of another possible 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 reinforcement and took the opportunity to clarify that the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.869
 argentino mariano pavone will not leave the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.710
 club weigh the interest of the independent 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.479
 from argentina 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.549
 it's difficult in general we're happy 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.549
 with the staff we have 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.430
 I think we have a very good team 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.860
 that we know little by little and in 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.840
 general issues I think we're 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.850
 pretty good to fight the two 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.650
 tournaments in which we are going to compete not 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.040
 it does not come out we are not in the context 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.740
 see with with a lot of blood with very 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.409
 good temperament to play and we believe 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.390
 that little by little will be playing better not 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.970
 then if they wanted they seem 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.440
 independent but we told you 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.030
 that we did not know that he was staying 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.130
 here 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.170
 when questioned by the behavior that 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.240
 must show marked fabian on blue cross 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.850
 after some extracancha problems that 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.830
 They walked their exit of chivas have no 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.390
 He hesitated to answer that he will try to take it 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.880
