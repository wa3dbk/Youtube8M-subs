why now is the time for action we're the
first<00:00:17.250> generation<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> feel<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.510> impact<00:00:19.410> of

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
first generation to feel the impact of

first generation to feel the impact of
climate<00:00:20.039> change<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.910> last<00:00:20.939> generation

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
climate change and the last generation

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.380 
climate change and the last generation
that<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.590> something<00:00:22.619> about<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:26.390> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
that can do something about it and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.210 
that can do something about it and
that's<00:00:27.990> why<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> committed<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> United<00:00:28.920> States

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that's why I committed the United States

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
that's why I committed the United States
to<00:00:29.519> leading<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.300> world<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.050> challenge

to leading the world on this challenge

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
to leading the world on this challenge
because<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.700> believe<00:00:33.210> there<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.630> such<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.079> thing

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
because I believe there is such a thing

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.720 
because I believe there is such a thing
as<00:00:34.559> being<00:00:34.829> too<00:00:34.950> late<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.950> ambitious<00:00:38.460> plan

the year 2030 mr. Obama says Americans
are<00:00:47.850> already<00:00:48.120> feeling<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.690> effects<00:00:49.020> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
are already feeling the effects of

have<00:00:52.800> been<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> planets<00:00:53.489> warmest<00:00:54.329> years<00:00:54.690> on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
have been the planets warmest years on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.369 
have been the planets warmest years on
record<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> breaking<00:00:57.989> point<00:00:58.289> for

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379

record so what is the breaking point for
climate<00:00:58.890> change<00:00:59.160> well<00:00:59.430> some<00:00:59.609> experts<00:01:00.000> say<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
climate change well some experts say it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.779 
climate change well some experts say it
could<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.899> 2<00:01:01.350> degrees<00:01:01.710> Celsius<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.640> if

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
could be just 2 degrees Celsius and if

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.910 
could be just 2 degrees Celsius and if
the<00:01:02.940> planet<00:01:03.270> warms<00:01:03.600> more<00:01:03.809> than<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.710> odds

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the planet warms more than that the odds

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.280 
the planet warms more than that the odds
of<00:01:05.220> climate<00:01:05.610> catastrophes<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.780> very<00:01:07.020> high

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
of climate catastrophes are very high

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.410 
of climate catastrophes are very high
but<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.369> place<00:01:08.640> already<00:01:09.000> seen<00:01:09.270> the

shows is an island nation that's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.730 
shows is an island nation that's
starting<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> disappear

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.100 

this<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.700> Marshall<00:01:22.970> Islands<00:01:23.329> a<00:01:23.540> country

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
this is the Marshall Islands a country

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.170 
this is the Marshall Islands a country
way<00:01:24.320> out<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.680> Pacific<00:01:24.790> it's<00:01:25.790> already

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
way out in the Pacific it's already

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.560 
way out in the Pacific it's already
super<00:01:26.540> tiny<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:27.380> about<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.799> get<00:01:27.890> smaller

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
super tiny and it's about to get smaller

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.830 
super tiny and it's about to get smaller
why<00:01:29.570> is<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.979> country's<00:01:31.369> sinking<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:32.659> the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
why is that the country's sinking or the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.359 
why is that the country's sinking or the
oceans<00:01:33.170> rising<00:01:33.409> depending<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.009> how<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.159> look

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
debate climate change is real and people

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.950 
debate climate change is real and people
see<00:01:39.920> it<00:01:39.950> happening<00:01:40.460> now<00:01:46.179> when<00:01:47.179> I<00:01:47.210> look<00:01:47.570> at<00:01:47.750> the
