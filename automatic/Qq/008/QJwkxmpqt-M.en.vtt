00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 the big-band comrades relationship with yourself 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.760
 he can not find it because of the fight 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:18.110
 by Martin Schläpfer Gameplay support against the market trend 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.039
 This is 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.039
 sent the game 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.009
 The opponents now leave percent no longer weapons 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.420
 if you take it at least so Teso 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.640
 I do not understand the game to turn a longer stay in St 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.560
 victorious I myself do not quite go there exactly I have the game 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.560
 begins buying as the first NMI Institute 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.430
 and percent down 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.150
 by no means evaluate themselves 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.410
 and today Kalle was an analyst 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.410
 Match day 1 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.680
 the versions for PC Xbox 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.680
 It does not work as far as I know 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.460
 he sends his 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.430
 recognizes 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580
 I've got more 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 but the game board can only gain one point 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.530
 Although not until late in the afternoon at Hefele we wanted it 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 again beautiful 31 degrees in the shade 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 and percent I got the game up 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.380
 60 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.630
 Karadzic was not and percent at the biggest heat by that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.680
 absolutely 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.400
 blood 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.729
 Townships Meinert 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.729
 the first fans to place produced percent 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.670
 the shipping became 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.580
 either on the page already notes or bow in three days to thank 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 it depends on weight so it creates the recordings 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.930
 Vogt 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.029
 we have 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.509
 what the performances in Cologne 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.509
 the more expensive ones 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.879
 in the mirror 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 sit there at zero 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:27.399
 directly on protruding rocks 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.829
 just as he does change the combat system I need 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.719
 I almost know 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.719
 but that sees her friends playing 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.449
 if we have different skills then 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.949
 like a snail - tower 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.359
 Fire 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.989
 Peter and St are running here 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.839
 as braked against 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.489
 there 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.489
 Olpe but do not worry 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.909
 HK APA 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:05.299
 right off 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.499
 and she gives two things very well by the hand 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.499
 whether that is in Rheine 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.489
 Sky thinks I'm a bit stupid but listen to it yourself 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.199
 functional and bells 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.199
 Personally, I did not find the suite by Erna 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.099
 to evade after attacks by the ECtHR 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.059
 in Denmark 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.649
 more often almost destroyed us 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.029
 they are all called 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.879
 Bender Sahin Cuba 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.619
 draw 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.179
 and percent just like 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.049
 this player may have to fight 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.239
 consumed the internet 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.239
 20 enemies at once 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.499
 recovered 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.649
 percent 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:58.649
 yes and I have actually forgotten 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:00.679
 until 11 o'clock on 11 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.079
 several opponents 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.079
 a man has 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.799
 to say that with her fiction used more often 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.269
 careful pressure 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.370
 very quickly to say a clash 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.729
 otherwise you would 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.820
 not get on your face so that is personally determined 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.770
 it is now according to witnesses up to 30 50 pence 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:35.469
 play 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:38.469
 and even on 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.120
 there will be no Sprint Nextel Red 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.129
 its important 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.059
 Paper initially said cutscene play better 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.529
 so much time together 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.699
 and to complement meanwhile sequences of hers also change relatively rapidly GM 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:56.490
 haggle 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.849
 or Cretaceous 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.849
 gt 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.699
 at larger should be his family 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.349
 perhaps 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.710
 it leaves 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.330
 for a fake 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.219
 in a last attempt 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.539
 60 francs out 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.210
 plain text 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.219
 Dorothea 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.589
 are on it 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.589
 Wieland 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.029
 I do not think so 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.539
 on 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.689
 by no means Fr 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.189
 becomes 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.860
 The Invitation 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.749
 false alarm yet 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:04.139
 but no interruption 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.050
 So now we see what good team open the call as fast as possible 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.020
 because it's all called Cergy 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.020
 By the way, one is just as threatening 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.150
 that is happening 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.529
 but nicely done if you live at least percent now 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.529
 when fails here 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.539
 he says 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.960
 Farkas 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.439
 Here it goes directly under 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.439
 next «I am elected 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.830
 they did it 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:59.749
 what are you thinking of kindling yours? 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:04.389
 by the way I think the artist has run away with Business Jung 

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:09.449
 just so just open my mind 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:13.240
 Indians head on good departure somehow Peter Schmidt loves differently 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.389
 presented 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.779
 Propolis percent that finds it times 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:19.919
 wonderful everything is done to cook 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.119
 especially since there are quite a lot 

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:23.999
 between Popal 

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.249
 the limits are and I can not get down now 

00:07:27.249 --> 00:07:29.899
 "Me and me" 

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:31.490
 to 7 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.899
 much faster 

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:35.899
 the Optic guests nevertheless 

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:45.409
 Jarre 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.669
 Students go 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.669
 so drop their cover 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:59.349
 maybe also interesting to know about the game 

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:01.419
 BSP 

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:04.580
 that was 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.290
 three encores
