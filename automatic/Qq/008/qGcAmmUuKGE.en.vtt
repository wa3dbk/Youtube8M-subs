00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.409 

let's<00:00:00.630> look<00:00:00.810> at<00:00:00.989> division<00:00:01.560> by<00:00:01.860> grouping<00:00:02.399> if<00:00:03.270> we

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
let's look at division by grouping if we

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.170 
let's look at division by grouping if we
look<00:00:03.689> at<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.899> question<00:00:04.140> six<00:00:05.000> divided<00:00:06.000> by

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
look at the question six divided by

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.320 
look at the question six divided by
three<00:00:06.560> this<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.620> asking<00:00:08.189> us<00:00:08.370> if<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:09.030> were<00:00:09.120> to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
three this is asking us if we were to

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.070 
three this is asking us if we were to
buy<00:00:09.660> 2<00:00:09.719> 6<00:00:10.230> into<00:00:11.099> 3<00:00:11.130> equal<00:00:11.429> groups<00:00:11.900> how<00:00:12.900> many

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
buy 2 6 into 3 equal groups how many

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.070 
buy 2 6 into 3 equal groups how many
would<00:00:13.320> be<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.799> each<00:00:14.250> group<00:00:14.670> well<00:00:15.599> let's<00:00:15.809> draw<00:00:16.049> a

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
would be in each group well let's draw a

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.189 
would be in each group well let's draw a
picture<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.279> three<00:00:17.670> groups<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> I'm

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
picture we have three groups so I'm

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.550 
picture we have three groups so I'm
going<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.500> draw<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.100> group<00:00:21.590> two<00:00:22.590> groups<00:00:24.560> three

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
going to draw one group two groups three

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.670 
going to draw one group two groups three
groups<00:00:26.119> can<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.449> six<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.140> divide<00:00:28.470> between

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
groups can I have six to divide between

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:39.130 
groups can I have six to divide between
them<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> count<00:00:30.199> 1<00:00:31.759> 2<00:00:33.140> 3<00:00:34.670> 4<00:00:36.170> 5<00:00:37.760> 6

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
them so I'm going to count 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.080 
them so I'm going to count 1 2 3 4 5 6
now<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> question<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.680> asking<00:00:41.070> us<00:00:41.250> how<00:00:41.790> many

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
now the question is asking us how many

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.920 
now the question is asking us how many
are<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.140> each<00:00:43.379> group<00:00:43.670> well<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:45.120> there's<00:00:45.539> 2

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
are in each group well I see there's 2

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.130 
are in each group well I see there's 2
in<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.230> group<00:00:46.500> 2<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.700> group<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.510> 2<00:00:49.020> in

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
in this group 2 in this group and 2 in

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.880 
in this group 2 in this group and 2 in
this<00:00:49.320> group<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.940> 6<00:00:51.300> divided<00:00:52.260> by<00:00:52.440> 3<00:00:53.000> equals<00:00:54.000> 2

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
this group so 6 divided by 3 equals 2

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.130 
this group so 6 divided by 3 equals 2
let's<00:00:55.890> look<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.190> another<00:00:56.280> one

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
let's look at another one

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.090 
let's look at another one
12<00:00:58.190> divided<00:00:59.190> by<00:00:59.219> 2<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:01.079> means<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.590> 12<00:01:01.949> in

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
12 divided by 2 that means I have 12 in

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189 
12 divided by 2 that means I have 12 in
total<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.629> divide<00:01:03.930> them

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
total and I'm going to divide them

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.450 
total and I'm going to divide them
between<00:01:05.030> two<00:01:06.030> groups<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> there's<00:01:08.189> my<00:01:08.400> two

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
between two groups so there's my two

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.590 
between two groups so there's my two
groups<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.770> 12<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.430> distribute<00:01:12.000> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
groups then I have 12 to distribute so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.649 
groups then I have 12 to distribute so
let's<00:01:12.840> count<00:01:13.110> 1<00:01:14.030> 2<00:01:15.030> 3<00:01:16.759> 4

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
let's count 1 2 3 4

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:28.910 
let's count 1 2 3 4
five<00:01:19.609> six<00:01:20.609> seven<00:01:22.249> eight<00:01:23.249> nine<00:01:24.799> 10<00:01:25.799> 11<00:01:27.619> 12

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
five six seven eight nine 10 11 12

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.429 
five six seven eight nine 10 11 12
so<00:01:29.549> I've<00:01:29.670> distributed<00:01:30.030> 12<00:01:30.569> in<00:01:30.869> between<00:01:31.229> two

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so I've distributed 12 in between two

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.349 
so I've distributed 12 in between two
routes<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> count<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:32.939> many<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
routes I'm going to count how many I

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:39.289 
routes I'm going to count how many I
have<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.780> each<00:01:33.929> group<00:01:34.229> 1<00:01:34.859> 2<00:01:35.250> 3<00:01:35.640> 4<00:01:36.060> 5<00:01:36.359> 6<00:01:36.780> &amp;<00:01:37.159> 1<00:01:38.159> 2<00:01:38.459> 3<00:01:38.819> 4

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
have in each group 1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp; 1 2 3 4

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.429 
have in each group 1 2 3 4 5 6 &amp; 1 2 3 4
5<00:01:39.780> 6<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.740> since<00:01:41.039> I<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.250> 6<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.729> each<00:01:41.969> group<00:01:42.439> 12

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
5 6 so since I have 6 in each group 12

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.789 
5 6 so since I have 6 in each group 12
divided<00:01:44.039> by<00:01:44.069> 2<00:01:45.079> equals<00:01:46.079> 6

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.940 

but<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.490> example<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.060> 15<00:01:51.689> divided<00:01:52.380> by<00:01:52.560> 5

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but this example we have 15 divided by 5

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.179 
but this example we have 15 divided by 5
our<00:01:53.939> number<00:01:54.450> 5<00:01:54.719> is<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> represent<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
our number 5 is going to represent the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.529 
our number 5 is going to represent the
number<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.579> groups<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.229> there's<00:01:58.409> 1<00:01:59.539> 2

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
number of groups we have so there's 1 2

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.719 
number of groups we have so there's 1 2

and<00:02:06.210> five<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.740> 15<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.610> distribute<00:02:09.149> so

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and five and I have 15 to distribute so

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.190 
and five and I have 15 to distribute so
instead<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.379> X's<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.099> always<00:02:11.250> draw<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> dot<00:02:12.200> 1

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
instead of X's I can always draw a dot 1

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:28.550 
instead of X's I can always draw a dot 1

I'm<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.830> look<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.099> how<00:02:29.310> many<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.700> have

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
I'm going to look to see how many I have

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.780 
I'm going to look to see how many I have
in<00:02:30.120> each<00:02:30.269> group<00:02:30.569> have<00:02:31.560> three<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.830> 15<00:02:35.459> has

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
in each group have three so 15 has

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.850 
in each group have three so 15 has
divided<00:02:36.330> by<00:02:36.629> five<00:02:38.450> equally<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.590> there's

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
divided by five equally and there's

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.460 
divided by five equally and there's

three<00:02:54.989> children<00:02:55.019> how<00:02:56.010> many<00:02:56.190> cookies<00:02:56.430> will

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
three children how many cookies will

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.569 
three children how many cookies will
each<00:02:57.180> child<00:02:57.569> receive<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:59.220> we're<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.519> to

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
each child receive so we're going to

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.530 
each child receive so we're going to
write<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.849> in<00:03:00.090> pictures<00:03:00.299> numbers<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.590> words

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
write this in pictures numbers and words

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.449 
write this in pictures numbers and words
for<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.630> pictures<00:03:04.049> she<00:03:04.829> has<00:03:05.010> three<00:03:05.430> children

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
for the pictures she has three children

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.660 
for the pictures she has three children
so<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.390> know<00:03:07.340> there's<00:03:08.340> three<00:03:08.940> groups<00:03:10.670> question

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
so I know there's three groups question

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.860 
so I know there's three groups question
is<00:03:11.819> how<00:03:12.060> many<00:03:12.239> are<00:03:12.299> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> be<00:03:12.630> in<00:03:12.690> each

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
is how many are going to be in each

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.569 
is how many are going to be in each
group

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
group

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.129 
group
so<00:03:14.579> there's<00:03:14.760> 24<00:03:15.180> total<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:15.870> I'm<00:03:15.930> going<00:03:16.109> to

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
so there's 24 total so I'm going to

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.780 
so there's 24 total so I'm going to
count<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.440> 24<00:03:17.069> one

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790

23<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.980> 24<00:03:44.689> going<00:03:45.689> to<00:03:45.750> stop<00:03:45.930> at<00:03:46.049> 24<00:03:46.560> because

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
23 and 24 going to stop at 24 because

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.509 
23 and 24 going to stop at 24 because
there's<00:03:47.099> 24<00:03:47.730> sugar<00:03:48.090> cookies<00:03:49.069> if<00:03:50.069> I<00:03:50.219> were<00:03:50.340> to

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
there's 24 sugar cookies if I were to

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:58.960 
there's 24 sugar cookies if I were to
write<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:50.909> in<00:03:51.239> numbers<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.920> picture

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.110 

barbar<00:03:59.660> right<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.050> numbers<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:03.190> have<00:04:04.190> 24<00:04:04.790> sugar

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
barbar right in numbers I have 24 sugar

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.940 
barbar right in numbers I have 24 sugar
cookies<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:07.070> was<00:04:07.250> dividing<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.170> by<00:04:09.170> three

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
cookies and I was dividing it by three

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.200 
cookies and I was dividing it by three
children<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.870> my<00:04:11.930> answer<00:04:12.680> was<00:04:12.890> one<00:04:13.520> two<00:04:13.820> three

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
children and my answer was one two three

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.650 
children and my answer was one two three
four<00:04:14.510> five<00:04:14.810> six<00:04:15.140> seven<00:04:15.440> eight<00:04:16.239> so<00:04:17.239> they<00:04:17.390> each

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
four five six seven eight so they each

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.410 
four five six seven eight so they each
get<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.320> clue<00:04:20.019> in<00:04:21.400> words<00:04:22.400> we<00:04:22.820> would<00:04:22.970> write<00:04:23.210> our

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
get a clue in words we would write our

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.010 
get a clue in words we would write our
therefore<00:04:24.020> statement<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.650> we<00:04:27.800> would<00:04:28.010> say<00:04:29.020> each

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
therefore statement so we would say each

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.670 
therefore statement so we would say each
child<00:04:32.470> will<00:04:33.470> receive

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.269 

eight<00:04:37.250> cookie

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.509 

so<00:04:42.789> there<00:04:42.969> is<00:04:43.089> a<00:04:43.119> complete<00:04:43.539> solution<00:04:44.249> we<00:04:45.249> have

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:45.519 
so there is a complete solution we have

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:48.539 
so there is a complete solution we have
pictures<00:04:46.329> where<00:04:46.899> we<00:04:47.049> drew<00:04:47.229> our<00:04:47.349> groups<00:04:47.589> we

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:48.549 
pictures where we drew our groups we

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:51.059 
pictures where we drew our groups we
have<00:04:48.729> the<00:04:48.909> numbers<00:04:49.269> where<00:04:49.899> we<00:04:50.079> have<00:04:50.289> 24

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
have the numbers where we have 24

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.329 
have the numbers where we have 24
divided<00:04:51.639> by<00:04:51.789> 3<00:04:52.119> equals<00:04:52.149> 8<00:04:52.509> and<00:04:53.009> we've<00:04:54.009> included

00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:54.339 
divided by 3 equals 8 and we've included

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:57.509 
divided by 3 equals 8 and we've included
our<00:04:54.579> words<00:04:54.819> each<00:04:55.359> child<00:04:55.809> will<00:04:56.139> receive<00:04:56.319> 8<00:04:57.189> cook

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:57.519 
our words each child will receive 8 cook

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:02.999 
our words each child will receive 8 cook
all<00:04:57.759> and<00:04:58.379> that<00:04:59.379> is<00:04:59.739> division<00:05:00.249> by<00:05:00.609> grouping
