00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
from the from the mall and they tried to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.040 
from the from the mall and they tried to
drive<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> salvation<00:00:48.090> didn't<00:00:48.690> quite<00:00:48.840> work

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
drive it to salvation didn't quite work

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.270 
drive it to salvation didn't quite work
out<00:00:49.289> as<00:00:49.469> well<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.219> were

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
out as well that is what they were

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.400 
out as well that is what they were
hoping<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.969> they<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.239> stuck<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.719> traffic<00:00:51.750> in

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
hoping so they got stuck in traffic in

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.939 
hoping so they got stuck in traffic in
in<00:00:53.719> at<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> beginning<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.170> Dark<00:00:55.379> Carnival<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
in at the beginning of Dark Carnival and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
in at the beginning of Dark Carnival and
so<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.090> passing<00:00:57.600> sort<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> fills<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> gap

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
so the passing sort of fills in the gap

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.130 
so the passing sort of fills in the gap
between<00:00:58.800> those<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.460> campaigns<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.989> a

Faliszek from valve described it to me a

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.970 
Faliszek from valve described it to me a
moment<00:02:20.849> ago<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.239> imagine<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.440> survivors

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
moment ago is imagine if the survivors

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.740 
moment ago is imagine if the survivors
that<00:02:23.190> we're<00:02:23.310> seeing<00:02:23.519> here<00:02:23.580> were<00:02:24.060> not<00:02:24.299> immune

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
that we're seeing here were not immune

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.660 
that we're seeing here were not immune
to<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.049> virus<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.680> as<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.340> know<00:02:26.459> they're

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
to the virus so as you know they're

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.220 
to the virus so as you know they're
they're<00:02:26.879> able<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.299> attacked<00:02:27.569> by<00:02:27.810> zombies

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
they're able to get attacked by zombies

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.020 
they're able to get attacked by zombies
left<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.680> right<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.519> are<00:02:29.790> they're

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
left and right and they are they're

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.699 
left and right and they are they're
immune<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.629> they<00:02:30.840> don't<00:02:31.019> they<00:02:31.349> don't<00:02:31.379> take<00:02:31.680> any

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
immune so they don't they don't take any

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.619 
immune so they don't they don't take any
damage<00:02:31.980> which<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.340> certainly<00:02:33.180> nice<00:02:33.329> for<00:02:33.540> them

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
damage which is certainly nice for them

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.920 
damage which is certainly nice for them
but<00:02:33.900> not<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.440> nice<00:02:34.650> for<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.950> Fallen<00:02:35.930> survivors

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
but not so nice for the Fallen survivors

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.559 
but not so nice for the Fallen survivors
so<00:02:37.349> basically<00:02:37.980> those<00:02:38.549> are<00:02:38.849> guys<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.090> are

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
normal survivor but they are infected by

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.390 
normal survivor but they are infected by
the<00:02:54.989> virus<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:55.739> they're<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> little<00:02:56.069> bit<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.340> a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the virus so they're a little bit of a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.369 
the virus so they're a little bit of a
threat<00:02:56.609> to<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.849> now<00:02:57.209> they're<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.959> quite<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
threat to you now they're not quite the

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.860 
threat to you now they're not quite the
same<00:02:58.590> as<00:02:58.799> a<00:02:58.829> normal<00:02:59.220> one<00:02:59.579> because<00:03:00.030> if<00:03:00.359> they<00:03:00.810> see

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
same as a normal one because if they see

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.410 
same as a normal one because if they see
you<00:03:01.459> chances<00:03:02.459> are<00:03:02.609> they're<00:03:02.819> gonna<00:03:02.940> take<00:03:03.239> off

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
you chances are they're gonna take off

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.690 
you chances are they're gonna take off
running<00:03:03.629> so<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.260> might<00:03:04.500> wonder<00:03:04.680> why<00:03:04.890> would<00:03:05.670> I

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
running so you might wonder why would I

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.339 
running so you might wonder why would I
attack<00:03:06.030> them<00:03:06.390> if<00:03:06.510> they're<00:03:06.659> not<00:03:06.780> too<00:03:06.989> much<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.290> a

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
attack them if they're not too much of a

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.229 
attack them if they're not too much of a
threat<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.739> answer<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:08.849> have<00:03:09.090> all

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
threat the answer is because I have all
