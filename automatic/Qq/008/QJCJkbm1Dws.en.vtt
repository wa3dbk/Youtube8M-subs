lighthouse

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.100 
lighthouse

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
that's something

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.810 
that's something
I<00:04:03.170> wanted<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.590> do<00:04:03.740> for<00:04:03.950> quite<00:04:03.980> some<00:04:04.370> time<00:04:04.550> I

just couldn't find a good place to put

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.090 
just couldn't find a good place to put
it<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.810> can't<00:04:09.080> I'm<00:04:09.350> kinda<00:04:09.620> iffy<00:04:09.890> about

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
it and I can't I'm kinda iffy about

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.400 
it and I can't I'm kinda iffy about
putting<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.490> here<00:04:10.520> as<00:04:10.880> well<00:04:11.150> because<00:04:11.390> well<00:04:12.230> the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
putting it here as well because well the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.110 
putting it here as well because well the
other<00:04:12.590> white<00:04:12.860> house<00:04:13.070> is<00:04:13.310> right<00:04:13.490> over<00:04:13.670> that<00:04:13.790> way

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
other white house is right over that way

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.880 
other white house is right over that way
I<00:04:14.330> mean<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.720> can't<00:04:14.960> see<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.530> can't<00:04:15.740> tell

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
I mean you can't see it you can't tell

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.370 
I mean you can't see it you can't tell
that<00:04:15.950> it's<00:04:16.220> there<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.720> think<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.170> might<00:04:18.350> be

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
that it's there so I think it might be

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.680 
that it's there so I think it might be
all<00:04:18.620> right<00:04:18.890> but<00:04:19.280> yeah<00:04:19.850> I<00:04:19.880> think<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.480> think

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
all right but yeah I think that I think

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.440 
all right but yeah I think that I think
I<00:04:20.780> said<00:04:20.959> I'm<00:04:21.109> going<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.320> put<00:04:21.500> here<00:04:22.090> I'm<00:04:23.090> waiting

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.440 
on you know actually recording me
actually<00:04:26.900> building<00:04:27.290> it<00:04:27.440> or<00:04:27.620> I<00:04:28.250> might<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:29.330> know

entertaining and I don't know when I
build<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.790> lot<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.120> us<00:04:44.360> just<00:04:44.630> clearing<00:04:44.990> out<00:04:45.200> and

snow area I thought it didn't exist in
this<00:05:24.200> world<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.800> then<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.280> come<00:05:25.490> over<00:05:25.610> here<00:05:25.910> and

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
this world and then I come over here and

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.210 
this world and then I come over here and
look<00:05:26.450> there's<00:05:26.720> this<00:05:26.810> one<00:05:27.080> patch<00:05:27.290> of<00:05:27.320> snow<00:05:27.590> you

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
look there's this one patch of snow you

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.820 
look there's this one patch of snow you
move<00:05:28.400> on<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.610> little<00:05:28.790> farther<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:29.800> when<00:05:30.800> I

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
move on a little farther and when I

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.980 
move on a little farther and when I
let's<00:05:31.040> get<00:05:31.220> down<00:05:31.400> here<00:05:31.610> go<00:05:32.600> down<00:05:32.750> a<00:05:32.780> little

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
let's get down here go down a little

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.659 
let's get down here go down a little
farther<00:05:33.169> there's<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.590> few<00:05:33.860> more<00:05:33.979> patches<00:05:34.280> over

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
farther there's a few more patches over

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.670 
farther there's a few more patches over
here<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.120> then<00:05:35.810> there's<00:05:36.020> actually<00:05:36.320> some<00:05:36.470> ice

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
here and then there's actually some ice

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.980 
here and then there's actually some ice
over<00:05:37.070> here<00:05:37.100> but<00:05:37.880> honestly<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.360> think<00:05:38.450> this<00:05:38.780> is

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
over here but honestly I think this is

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.020 
over here but honestly I think this is
the<00:05:39.110> end<00:05:39.260> of<00:05:39.350> my<00:05:39.500> world<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:40.190> need<00:05:40.340> to<00:05:40.550> get<00:05:40.669> a<00:05:40.700> map

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
the end of my world I need to get a map

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.090 
the end of my world I need to get a map
I<00:05:41.240> need<00:05:41.419> to<00:05:41.510> get<00:05:41.600> a<00:05:41.660> boat<00:05:41.990> so<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.650> can<00:05:42.740> see<00:05:42.950> some

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
I need to get a boat so you can see some

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.370 
I need to get a boat so you can see some

have some dark wood there was actually a
couple<00:05:51.710> trees<00:05:52.070> over<00:05:52.340> here<00:05:52.370> that<00:05:52.640> I<00:05:52.669> chopped

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
couple trees over here that I chopped

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.020 
couple trees over here that I chopped
down<00:05:53.180> but

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
down but

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.180 
down but
being<00:05:54.330> you<00:05:54.720> know<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:54.990> light<00:05:55.140> wood<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.950> wood

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
being you know the light wood the wood

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.930 
being you know the light wood the wood
that<00:05:56.340> I<00:05:56.460> got<00:05:56.670> a<00:05:56.700> ton<00:05:57.060> of<00:05:57.090> already<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:58.730> I'm<00:05:59.730> not

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
that I got a ton of already and I'm not

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.700 
that I got a ton of already and I'm not
sure<00:06:00.150> if<00:06:00.270> it<00:06:00.390> works<00:06:00.600> but<00:06:01.020> I<00:06:01.140> need<00:06:01.320> to<00:06:01.440> get<00:06:01.500> some

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
sure if it works but I need to get some

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.320 
sure if it works but I need to get some
saplings<00:06:02.160> and<00:06:02.280> maybe<00:06:02.640> I<00:06:02.730> could<00:06:02.910> plant<00:06:03.210> it

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
saplings and maybe I could plant it

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.140 
saplings and maybe I could plant it
right<00:06:03.450> there<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:04.080> I<00:06:04.650> don't<00:06:05.610> know<00:06:05.850> it<00:06:06.000> probably

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
right there and I don't know it probably

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.030 
right there and I don't know it probably
wouldn't<00:06:06.480> work<00:06:06.570> but<00:06:06.900> maybe<00:06:07.230> it<00:06:07.650> would<00:06:07.800> grow

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
wouldn't work but maybe it would grow

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.950 
wouldn't work but maybe it would grow
into<00:06:08.280> some<00:06:08.610> dark<00:06:08.760> wood<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:09.270> then<00:06:09.660> I<00:06:09.780> could

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
into some dark wood and then I could

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.480 
into some dark wood and then I could
just<00:06:10.110> grab<00:06:10.260> the<00:06:10.470> sapling<00:06:10.950> and<00:06:10.980> we<00:06:11.160> just<00:06:11.340> keep

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
just grab the sapling and we just keep

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.340 
just grab the sapling and we just keep
doing<00:06:11.550> that<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.180> end<00:06:12.450> up<00:06:12.600> with<00:06:12.780> a<00:06:12.810> bunch<00:06:13.050> of<00:06:13.140> it

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
doing that and end up with a bunch of it

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.410 
doing that and end up with a bunch of it
but<00:06:13.920> i<00:06:14.010> seriously<00:06:14.310> doubt<00:06:14.760> that's<00:06:15.030> gonna<00:06:15.120> work

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
but i seriously doubt that's gonna work

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.590 
but i seriously doubt that's gonna work
if<00:06:15.660> anybody<00:06:16.050> knows<00:06:16.380> please<00:06:16.860> let<00:06:17.100> me<00:06:17.220> know<00:06:17.600> well
