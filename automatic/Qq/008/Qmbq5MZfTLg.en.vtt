00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
goal we went played with a bit of

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.250 
goal we went played with a bit of
freedom<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.570> could<00:02:58.690> have<00:02:58.780> been<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.930> little<00:02:59.080> bit

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
freedom it could have been a little bit

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.720

more<00:02:59.350> convincing<00:02:59.800> do<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.489> they<00:03:00.580> might

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
more convincing do you think they might

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.970 
more convincing do you think they might
have<00:03:00.790> played<00:03:01.420> slightly<00:03:02.019> under<00:03:02.410> estimating

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
have played slightly under estimating

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.180 
have played slightly under estimating
years<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.430> he's<00:03:03.519> always<00:03:03.640> in<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:03.970> room
