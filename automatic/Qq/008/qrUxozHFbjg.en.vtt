that's fantastic bio dynamics has been
around<00:00:24.810> since<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.830> late<00:00:26.460> 20s<00:00:27.269> started<00:00:28.170> by<00:00:28.260> a

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.089 
auger that's in there that actually
turns<00:02:05.310> such<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.060> forces<00:02:06.479> all<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> grapes

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
turns such that it forces all the grapes

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.070 
turns such that it forces all the grapes
towards<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.550> incline<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
towards a little incline and then that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.140 
towards a little incline and then that

that<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:27.480> want<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.840> end<00:02:27.930> up<00:02:28.019> in<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.470> bins<00:02:29.569> so

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
that we want to end up in the bins so

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.660 
that we want to end up in the bins so
that<00:02:30.870> gets<00:02:31.019> separated<00:02:31.349> out<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:32.160> stems<00:02:32.459> are

that gets separated out the stems are

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.370 
that gets separated out the stems are
actually<00:02:33.000> dumped<00:02:33.660> into<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> separate

out to a composting field we try to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.589 
out to a composting field we try to
create<00:02:38.160> zero<00:02:38.489> waste<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.030> we're<00:02:39.150> pretty<00:02:39.390> good

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
create zero waste and we're pretty good

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:48.580 
create zero waste and we're pretty good
at<00:02:39.750> it

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.670

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
seeds the must goes into several bins

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.830 
seeds the must goes into several bins
and<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:55.560> filled<00:02:55.800> up<00:02:55.920> three<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.310> them<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.840> each

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and we filled up three of them and each

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.420 
and we filled up three of them and each
one<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.170> those<00:02:58.290> bins<00:02:58.560> will<00:02:58.800> probably<00:02:59.280> hold

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
one of those bins will probably hold

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.620 
one of those bins will probably hold
about<00:02:59.940> two<00:03:00.480> tons<00:03:00.720> worth<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.410> material<00:03:02.040> and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
about two tons worth of material and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.390 
about two tons worth of material and
we'll<00:03:03.630> put<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:04.050> cap<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.650> top<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:05.010> those<00:03:05.130> guys

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
we'll put a cap on top of those guys

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.070 
we'll put a cap on top of those guys
we'll<00:03:05.820> let<00:03:05.970> them<00:03:06.060> set<00:03:06.360> for<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.570> day<00:03:06.750> or<00:03:06.870> two<00:03:07.050> just

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
we'll let them set for a day or two just

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.140 
we'll let them set for a day or two just
to<00:03:07.380> let<00:03:07.560> them<00:03:07.680> get<00:03:07.800> some<00:03:07.950> rest<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:09.000> we'll

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
to let them get some rest and then we'll

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.730 
to let them get some rest and then we'll
actually<00:03:09.300> inoculate<00:03:10.020> them<00:03:10.200> with<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.470> yeast

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
actually inoculate them with the yeast

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.740 
actually inoculate them with the yeast
after<00:03:11.340> what<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.610> called<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.910> two-day<00:03:12.150> cold<00:03:12.450> soak

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
after what is called a two-day cold soak

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.600 
after what is called a two-day cold soak
so<00:03:13.260> now<00:03:13.410> we're<00:03:13.590> in<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.800> cellar<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
so now we're in the cellar and the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.760 
so now we're in the cellar and the
fermentations<00:03:15.300> are<00:03:15.630> going<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.140> be<00:03:16.260> starting

fermentations are going to be starting

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.680 
fermentations are going to be starting
for<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.460> yeast<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.790> work<00:03:18.000> properly<00:03:18.360> you

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
for the yeast to work properly you

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.260 
for the yeast to work properly you
actually<00:03:19.110> need<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.320> have<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.590> fairly<00:03:19.980> warm<00:03:20.430> tank

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
actually need to have a fairly warm tank

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.000 
actually need to have a fairly warm tank
or<00:03:21.540> warm<00:03:21.750> environment<00:03:22.380> for<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.560> yeast<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.860> be

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
or warm environment for the yeast to be

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.340 
or warm environment for the yeast to be
happy<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.630> particularly<00:03:24.630> with<00:03:24.870> red<00:03:25.080> wines

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
happy in particularly with red wines

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.050 
happy in particularly with red wines
usually<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.100> them<00:03:26.190> around<00:03:26.580> 80<00:03:26.880> degrees

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060

to two weeks and at that point we kind

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.060 
to two weeks and at that point we kind
of<00:03:33.810> make<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> determination<00:03:34.260> if<00:03:34.770> we<00:03:34.920> will
