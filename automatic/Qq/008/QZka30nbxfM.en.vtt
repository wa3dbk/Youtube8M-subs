00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 there are people who do not like to change 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.660
 march takes all to the turning limit 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 often laziness 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.330
 Is this attitude beyond the noise 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 can be harmful long if it is precisely 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.400
 what the jova wants to know that asks if 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.840
 run very close to the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 turning the engine may cause some damage 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.500
 initially give Jehovah the central 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 engine electronics is programmed to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.140
 not to exceed the limit of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.340
 for which it was designed 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.989
 precisely to avoid damage to the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.270
 internal components 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.910
 even this is not beneficial either 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.250
 in no way increased consumption to the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.520
 pollution and does not bring any 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.950
 performance and more runs on a good 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.110
 make the engine last even longer 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.360
 that it was designed by the factory 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.539
 I'm going to pull a pen that is a 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.300
 special authorization if the sum 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.620
 of the weight of your car loaded plus the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.110
 weight of the trailer is less than 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.510
 3,500 pounds can normally tow 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.140
 using your category b rating 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 up to 6 thousand kilos is 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.060
 need to have the driver's license in the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.189
 category c 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.130
 rogÃ©rio perhaps worried about the increase 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.860
 of fuel prices asks whether 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.500
 with the passing of mileage is true 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 that consumption improves the response if 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.740
 jairo 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.200
 but do not expect zero-speed vehicles 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.630
 kilometer until the parts are accepted 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.689
 right to a little more friction and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.079
 per table the consumption is even higher is 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.229
 the famous softening period after 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.240
 of the 500 or 1,000 kilometers 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.820
 consumption and performance among 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.399
 axes and improve a bit in truth 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.380
 many times the improvements even pass 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.259
 unnoticed from so small that they are 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.140
 On the other hand the engines at most 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.020
 due to wear of the parts and 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.259
 without proper maintenance start to spend 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.259
 more
