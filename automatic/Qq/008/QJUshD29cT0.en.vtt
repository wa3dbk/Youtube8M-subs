00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 good morning friends youtube writers 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.140
 today we are going to bring the unboxing of the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.599
 logitech ying controller awards are 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.049
 boys and hear only is that just 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.610
 clean and save everything so it 's like 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.920
 that very clean everything so we go with the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.920
 logo and let's start with this hype 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 ok boy here we have the logitech sorry 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.109
 I 'm also recording with the glass 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.020
 but sometimes in my life here we have the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.180
 logitech ok and let's do om boxing 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.530
 before I start I want to excuse 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.719
 because in the other video in the video 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.800
 previous where the unboxing of the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.860
 mobile 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 I said it was the same but then I said 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.120
 which was similar for what I wanted 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.300
 to say is that it is similar to a control of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.629
 Playstation or xbox is not the same 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.270
 guys are not the same I did not mean 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.109
 that are equal, I meant that they are 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.789
 similar ones ok 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.520
 they are similar something that is not similar is 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.110
 a control of this but really these 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.750
 controls so much this 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.810
 as the control the move that already 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.210
 present are similar to the controls 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.190
 of playstation to the things that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.710
 honestly make him om boxing like 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.050
 we can see the box is very different to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.840
 the fashion is a slightly longer box 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.670
 fashion is a small control that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.670
 it enlarges when you are going to use it but this one 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.290
 not this one comes great look at it here and what 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.170
 that we can see is a box with a very 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.960
 nice design in this part of here and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.450
 we can see in this part what it is 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.400
 the powers the simple control weighs a 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.860
 little bit good I do not feel very heavy it 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.860
 feels good from behind and is a little more 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.780
 simple looks less like controls 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 conventional we can only see 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.740
 has this part of here these four 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.780
 buttons here pause and these two of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.090
 here in vogue has many more controls 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.350
 but let's finish to see what we are going to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.590
 find in the rural box out there 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.760
 and be able to open this part of here 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.460
 and try 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.920
 our love 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.820
 here to see if we find a little 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.690
 difficult madryn 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.210
 let's put the manuals or something 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.460
 talking about our show barbie is something 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.800
 weird that is called bar and also control 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.600
 and battery are being promoted so much 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.370
 the control as in the battery the one that 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.650
 present the mobile also brings a 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.740
 battery and this is a 1500mah battery 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.690
 pérez and fashion is a battery of 1800 and 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.670
 does not say that it is the mocano has no 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.260
 promotes both the battery and this 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.390
 that has the battery in the name there 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.040
 are the instructions that's normal 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.950
 let's see and let's see him 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.130
 this will be the cable has a pro we are going to 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.950
 see this plan 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.750
 how was this before 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.540
 or to remove seems to obstruct you 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.480
 see this part of here obstructs the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.840
 sound and this is to pull out the cable 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.090
 sound over here and usb to connect it to 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.800
 the computer and its teacher and the beat and 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.470
 any other the only thing that is good is 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.560
 of colors and this is the control we have 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.930
 the top part very few buttons and 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.680
 simpler does not open and closes 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.590
 It's just like that and it leaves you in little eyes 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.989
 this side for what is the camera and the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.239
 internal flash in that big hole 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.220
 there are those who will want to take pictures and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.560
 play at the same time but that's what 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.319
 they are promoting more 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.150
 that is the cakes ok is one that I did what 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.890
 see this as a case that I gave myself 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.959
 account I think more like a controller 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.750
 but this is a case and has these 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.700
 buttons in case you want to play 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.709
 I already see that it is one of the difference 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.810
 now let's try the games we're going to 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.049
 see what it feels is very good simple 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.090
 dam - let's prove that you feel a 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.000
 game let's play it 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.519
 I'm going to give you a review with both 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.430
 devices to prove which is the 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.400
 better I saw several differences this 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.650
 has fewer games and this one has 1500 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.820
 miriam pérez battery while the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.840
 Mocha has 1,800 whole points 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.840
 that's how you enter 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.819
 we'll see 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.889
 if we can play some games it feels 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.499
 almost the same but something that I love them 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.889
 to say is that he does not have so many games 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:38.020
 As in fashion it is better to wait for 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.770
 review that I will have both in 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.810
 comparison but boys of god was not 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.520
 so easy to find a game and this was 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.889
 one of the best two games so in 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.779
 against and are career and it's something that 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.759
 you will imagine because you can see that 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:54.849
 does not have as much configuration as the 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.720
 mocha you see that no or I do not have 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:02.130
 so many controls to play 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.130
 and I am the best in your children what happens 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.130
 learn 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.320
 I 'm taking a little bit of nitro 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.660
 I'm not using 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.900
 there is also now not also know 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.900
 here 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.820
 it's hard to be watching the screen 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.310
 Jason any myth 

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:50.179
 and you are watching how the game 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:53.149
 how I feel but what's more 

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:57.639
 advisable guys is to wait in 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:06:00.069
 river cane but with both 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.419
 to see which one is better but it's already like 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.849
 that is losing a bit of points 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:07.479
 with me because he does not have so many buttons 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:10.060
 so it will not be the same because in the 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.759
 I fashion game is cool when I have 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.560
 to use all the controls to do 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.479
 something in each of the configurations 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.360
 of control so jordan stevie up 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.590
 what guys if the video liked 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.449
 tell me here below in the comments 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.000

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.650
 you 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.370
 to see if every time I upload a new 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.770
 video to a topic at the time above 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.450
 also guys it is very important to be give 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.640
 the taste and if they are exploring the ring 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.940
 also so I want to send this video 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.940
