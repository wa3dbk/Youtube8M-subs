hamstrings just because of the amount of
volume<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> I'm<00:00:59.910> currently<00:01:00.809> doing<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.500> my

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
volume that I'm currently doing for my

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.840 
volume that I'm currently doing for my
lower<00:01:03.270> body<00:01:03.589> old<00:01:04.589> volume<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.100> frequency<00:01:05.189> then

here we got some foam foam rolling for
my<00:01:08.189> glutes<00:01:09.260> my<00:01:10.260> advice<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:10.799> foam<00:01:11.189> rolling<00:01:11.400> is

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
my glutes my advice for foam rolling is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
my glutes my advice for foam rolling is
that<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.270> hurts<00:01:12.510> you're<00:01:12.780> probably<00:01:12.990> doing

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that if it hurts you're probably doing

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
that if it hurts you're probably doing
it<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> hurts<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> should

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it right if it hurts them you should

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.960 
it right if it hurts them you should
keep<00:01:15.450> doing<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.049> spot<00:01:16.759> another<00:01:17.759> thing<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.510 
if you want to call it that or my
routine<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:55.350> your<00:01:55.590> routine<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.340> like

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
routine is that your routine just like

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.429 
routine is that your routine just like
your<00:01:56.670> training<00:01:56.939> split<00:01:57.180> or<00:01:57.390> anything<00:01:57.689> else<00:01:57.840> on

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
your training split or anything else on

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.069 
your training split or anything else on
your<00:01:58.680> diet<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.450> it's<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.780> doing<00:02:00.899> for

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
your diet is it's going to be doing for

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.690 
your diet is it's going to be doing for
every<00:02:01.590> single<00:02:01.740> person<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> mean<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.460> what

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
every single person I mean like what

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.850 
every single person I mean like what
works<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.420> me<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.689> might<00:02:03.780> work<00:02:03.930> decently<00:02:04.740> well

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
works for me it might work decently well

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.670 
works for me it might work decently well
for<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.610> probably<00:02:05.790> won't<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.680> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
for you but it probably won't be the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.969 
for you but it probably won't be the
best<00:02:07.890> so

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
best so

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.350 
best so
this<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:09.489> just<00:02:09.580> sort<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.879> to<00:02:10.000> give<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.209> an<00:02:10.300> idea

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
this is just sort of to give you an idea

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.360 
this is just sort of to give you an idea
of<00:02:10.629> what<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.899> do<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.010> want<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.280> try

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
of what I do and if you want to try

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.500 
of what I do and if you want to try
these<00:02:12.430> out<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.730> see<00:02:13.030> how<00:02:13.090> they<00:02:13.180> work<00:02:13.330> for<00:02:13.420> you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
these out and see how they work for you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.630 
these out and see how they work for you
that's<00:02:13.659> great<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.650> don't<00:02:14.830> recommend<00:02:15.069> just

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
that's great but I don't recommend just

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.910 
that's great but I don't recommend just
doing<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> same<00:02:16.239> thing<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.659> do<00:02:16.920> just

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
doing the same thing that I do just

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.899 
doing the same thing that I do just
because<00:02:18.159> I'm<00:02:18.220> doing<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.610> just<00:02:18.640> because

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
because I'm doing and just because

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.330 
because I'm doing and just because
somebody<00:02:19.180> else<00:02:19.269> is<00:02:19.390> doing<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:20.190> which<00:02:21.190> is

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
somebody else is doing it which is

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.360 
somebody else is doing it which is
precisely<00:02:21.760> why<00:02:22.090> I've<00:02:22.510> adapted<00:02:23.370> little

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
precisely why I've adapted little

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.550 
precisely why I've adapted little
sections<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.970> everybody<00:02:25.540> else's<00:02:25.870> or<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> few

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
sections of everybody else's or a few

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.530 
sections of everybody else's or a few
different<00:02:26.650> people's<00:02:27.040> routines<00:02:27.450> for<00:02:28.450> my

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
different people's routines for my

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.350 
different people's routines for my
mobility<00:02:28.959> routine<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.980> here<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:30.640> one<00:02:30.849> you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
mobility routine so here this one you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.880 
mobility routine so here this one you
can<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.989> might<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.260> able<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.410> hear<00:02:32.560> us<00:02:32.590> talking

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
can you might be able to hear us talking

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.160 
can you might be able to hear us talking
to<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.099> background<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.489> looks<00:02:33.640> kind<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.790> funny

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
to the background it looks kind of funny

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.110 
to the background it looks kind of funny
then<00:02:35.170> we<00:02:35.440> got<00:02:35.590> been<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.129> iron<00:02:36.400> crosses<00:02:36.700> I

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
then we got been the iron crosses I

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.539 
then we got been the iron crosses I
think<00:02:37.360> they're<00:02:37.480> called<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
think they're called just to get the

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.339 
think they're called just to get the
warp<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.940> lower<00:02:40.180> back<00:02:40.450> warmed<00:02:41.140> up<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.290> little

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
warp the lower back warmed up a little

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.559 
warp the lower back warmed up a little
bit<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.769> stretch<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.640> looks<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.120> little<00:02:43.329> bit

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
bit and stretch it looks a little bit

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.449 
bit and stretch it looks a little bit
you<00:02:44.379> could<00:02:44.470> do<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> variation<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.099> this<00:02:45.220> with

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
you could do a variation of this with

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.220 
you could do a variation of this with
your<00:02:45.660> legs<00:02:46.660> extended<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.359> you'll<00:02:49.359> see<00:02:49.569> sort

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
your legs extended and you'll see sort

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.470 
your legs extended and you'll see sort
of<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.349> next<00:02:50.560> one<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:52.030> not<00:02:52.209> sure<00:02:52.329> what<00:02:52.420> all

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
of the next one I'm not sure what all

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.360 
of the next one I'm not sure what all
these<00:02:52.629> are<00:02:52.810> called<00:02:53.019> actually<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.129> next

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
these are called actually but the next

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.030 
these are called actually but the next
one<00:02:54.519> you'll<00:02:55.090> see<00:02:55.269> how<00:02:55.750> i'm<00:02:56.019> flexible<00:02:56.620> i<00:02:56.769> am<00:02:56.920> i

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
one you'll see how i'm flexible i am i

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.160 
one you'll see how i'm flexible i am i
guess<00:02:57.359> by<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.420> way<00:02:58.569> guys<00:02:58.720> when<00:02:58.900> you're<00:02:58.989> doing

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
guess by the way guys when you're doing

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.740 
guess by the way guys when you're doing
these<00:02:59.940> try<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.000> keep<00:03:01.150> your<00:03:01.299> hands<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
these try to keep your hands on the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.569 
these try to keep your hands on the
ground<00:03:01.959> or<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.200> shoulders<00:03:02.530> down<00:03:02.650> but

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
ground or the shoulders down but

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.190 
ground or the shoulders down but
obviously<00:03:03.910> like<00:03:04.090> i<00:03:04.150> said<00:03:04.359> i<00:03:04.569> am<00:03:04.629> probably<00:03:05.079> the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
obviously like i said i am probably the

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.770 
obviously like i said i am probably the
least<00:03:05.410> flexible<00:03:05.829> person<00:03:06.160> i<00:03:06.220> know<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.540> i<00:03:07.599> have<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
least flexible person i know so i have a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.660 
least flexible person i know so i have a
hard<00:03:07.959> time<00:03:08.140> with<00:03:08.319> these<00:03:08.440> things<00:03:08.739> which<00:03:09.549> is

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
hard time with these things which is

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.210 
hard time with these things which is
precisely<00:03:09.819> why<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.299> do<00:03:10.450> my<00:03:10.870> mobility<00:03:11.140> work<00:03:11.470> as

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
precisely why I do my mobility work as

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.159 
precisely why I do my mobility work as
often<00:03:12.489> as<00:03:12.609> I<00:03:12.700> do<00:03:12.760> when<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.060> do<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.720> like<00:03:13.840> he<00:03:13.930> like

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
often as I do when I do and like he like

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.830 
often as I do when I do and like he like
I<00:03:14.260> said<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.470> can<00:03:14.530> see<00:03:14.650> what<00:03:14.709> I'm<00:03:14.799> saying

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
I said you can see what I'm saying

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.349 
I said you can see what I'm saying
ideally<00:03:16.840> my<00:03:16.959> life<00:03:17.139> would<00:03:17.319> be<00:03:17.349> straight<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.940> it

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
ideally my life would be straight but it

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.750 
ideally my life would be straight but it
looks<00:03:19.569> absolutely<00:03:19.840> terrible<00:03:20.410> so<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:21.669> know

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
looks absolutely terrible so you know

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.099 
looks absolutely terrible so you know
I'm<00:03:21.910> just<00:03:22.030> working<00:03:22.299> with<00:03:22.359> what<00:03:22.419> I<00:03:22.599> got<00:03:22.630> try<00:03:23.049> to

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
I'm just working with what I got try to

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.069 
I'm just working with what I got try to
improve<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:24.150> onto<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.239> back<00:03:25.419> side<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.930> does

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
improve and onto the back side so does

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.449 
improve and onto the back side so does
the<00:03:26.139> same<00:03:26.260> idea<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.919> just<00:03:27.130> throw<00:03:27.340> in<00:03:27.400> your

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
the same idea you just throw in your

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.360 
the same idea you just throw in your
heel<00:03:28.120> up<00:03:28.299> toward<00:03:28.510> your<00:03:28.540> hand<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.069> again<00:03:30.069> if

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370

because it decreases the amount of
tension<00:05:28.840> on<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.140> muscle<00:05:29.440> which<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.680> probably
