00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.319
 next we have 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 the next generation pvc closet 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.860
 that we just pulled out 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.070
 a few days ago this closet 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.070
 it is called 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.500
 the drop-down ones are going to you now 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.510
 are you going to see how the operation works? 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.930
 great advantage of this closet that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.930
 have 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.870
 Well, you have a very clear option that 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.329
 is when the doors open 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.530
 You can see all the interior 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.050
 yes yes yes it is a much more closet 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.940
 functional than the traditional closet in 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.870
 this case can be put with 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.350
 chest of drawers 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.690
 on the bottom 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.969
 yes 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.059
 this is optional, it can also be 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.000
 without the drawer can be integrated or 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.700
 it can be like in this case and here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 apart we are if you can see you 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.799
 here we are integrating the new framework 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.440
 board type if you will see this the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.659
 that do not see the lines of union between a 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.499
 panel and another pvc panel yes 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.040
 then we will proceed in this case to 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.740
 show the interior 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.310
 in this case this class can be used 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.640
 With we have 9 colors for you 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.440
 select we have a handle a lot 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.750
 more decorative than those 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.260
 previous we will proceed to open the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.260
 closet 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.500
 we open a part if they are fixed 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.340
 open the whole part 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.190
 here they leave nothing uncovered all 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.660
 and everything looks open opens the other 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.660
 part of the closet 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.190
 then as we can observe 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.660
 we have a full amplitude at the time 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.720
 to use this type of foldable klose 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.070
 we have an equal hanger tube can be 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.590
 depending on the size 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.560
 this closet is 1 meter 40 but same 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.250
 you can 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.770
 it can also be placed between cloths 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.680
 in this case 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:40.360
 here is a chest of drawers that we integrate 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.730
 here in the bottom of the closet that 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.700
 is just above that of the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.770
 drawers as you can see the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.410
 closet in the traditional closet no 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.270
 we coated the tips are not re cover the 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.360
 walls in this case they are 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.700
 completely covered in pvc and 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.760
 it gives a very much very much appearance 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.980
 elegant to the product yes 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.159
 we will also proceed to open what is 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.159
 the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.150
 yes 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.859
 In this case, it is in this case 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.170
 the rails are full extension wants 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:25.090
 say that they can hold a lot of weight 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.670
 it's a kind of super deep drawer 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.859
 yes it is very deep because it has a lot 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.959
 greater capacity than the previous drawer unit 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.620
 that we were using in models 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.260
 previous yes 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.799
 As I tell you, this is a rail 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.080
 folding yes they almost do not occupy anything of 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.140
 space is a system is a technology 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.380
 new that just came out then that 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.110
 It is extremely 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.140
 practical 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.070
 if the doors are fixed boards 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:02.000
 extremely elegant if we proceed to 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.370
 Puebla also open 'the door as 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.780
 which is the trunk as you can 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.090
 watch 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.800
 has a system of pistons in both 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.820
 sides 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.580
 if on one side and on the other side of such 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.160
 way you can observe 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.430
 all completely everything in the 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.139
 trunk without having to compromise the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.620
 other half 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.439
 if the other half in the case of the other 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.800
 sliding closet because this is much more 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:36.770
 superior and it's simply much more 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.159
 functional than the traditional closet and not 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.599
 it takes up a lot of space in it 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.599
 at the time of gray 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.900
 this is the most what invades slowly in 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.110
 this case even one meter 40 no more 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.730
 to invade 35 centimeters what is the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:01.180
 area of them if the area the area 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.710
 folding since it is practically is very 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.950
 It is very practical 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:13.810
 and it's very functional as I tell you 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.639
 offer in 89 colors if we will see 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.830
 what is the 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.830
 this is the range of colors that exist 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:27.289
 all these can chocolate 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:31.940
 cherry tree there are some light colors 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:36.289
 whites and so on then 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.289
 take advantage of this type of d 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.460
 design can be the same if the 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.890
 client, then do not want the interior 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.230
 there is no problem inside the 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:53.240
 coating can be given 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:55.669
 you can do different different 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.900
 well adaptations this kind any 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.690
 another type of d 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.449
 in this case April or the other closet if 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.270
 any other type of design is this is 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.789
 acceptable for this closet if in 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.639
 case that is not desired in the drawers in 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:15.039
 if they are the rails by 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.520
 Super-heavy extension holds up a lot 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.520
 weight 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.410
 Well, this is the welcome for 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.590
 this kind of pleasure I think this is 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:30.250
 Is this new technology or system of 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:33.400
 roots because it is in the PVC line 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.430
 is going to be going to be this as something very 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.220
 important in him 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:43.000
 in the feed that this type of product 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.270
 He already is here to stay because it 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.810
 Worth the functionality 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.810
 yes 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.820
