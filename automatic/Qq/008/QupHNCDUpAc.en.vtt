fraggin<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.390> today<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.699> to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
fraggin a can today and I was going to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.170 
fraggin a can today and I was going to
use<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> bandsaw<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:25.400> my<00:00:26.400> blades<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.939> so

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
use the bandsaw but my blades just so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.420 
use the bandsaw but my blades just so
thick<00:00:27.560> I'd<00:00:28.560> rather<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:30.470> use<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> dremel<00:00:31.920> which

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
thick I'd rather just use a dremel which

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.660 
thick I'd rather just use a dremel which
I<00:00:32.550> make<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:33.030> easy<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:34.399> before<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> pull

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
I make it really easy so before you pull

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
I make it really easy so before you pull
a<00:00:35.700> cans<00:00:36.120> out<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.660> your<00:00:36.930> tank<00:00:37.200> make<00:00:37.559> sure<00:00:37.739> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
a cans out of your tank make sure you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.729 
a cans out of your tank make sure you
get<00:00:38.040> them<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> close<00:00:38.550> up<00:00:39.320> that's<00:00:40.320> probably

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
get them the close up that's probably

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.990 
get them the close up that's probably
the<00:00:40.829> most<00:00:40.950> important<00:00:41.430> thing<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:41.730> they

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the most important thing because they

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.180 
the most important thing because they
obviously<00:00:42.210> can't<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.200> once

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
obviously can't really do that once

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.299 
obviously can't really do that once
they're<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.450> tank<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.649> basically

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
they're out of the tank but basically

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.680 
they're out of the tank but basically
we're<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.030> taking<00:00:48.180> straight

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we're just going to be taking straight

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
we're just going to be taking straight
sections<00:00:49.200> off<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> be

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
sections off of here I'm not going to be

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
sections off of here I'm not going to be
able<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.420> anything<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.980> going

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
able to do anything about not going

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:54.110 
able to do anything about not going
through<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> mouth<00:00:54.000> since<00:00:54.629> we're<00:00:54.809> using

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.110 

what<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.690> do<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> take<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> look

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
what I do is I'm going to take a look

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.060 
what I do is I'm going to take a look
and<00:01:57.120> kind<00:01:57.480> of<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.810> an<00:01:57.900> idea<00:01:58.260> how<00:01:58.320> deep<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:59.040> am

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and kind of get an idea how deep I am

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.710 
and kind of get an idea how deep I am
because<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.820> technically<00:02:00.330> stick<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
because I can technically stick a

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.060 
because I can technically stick a
screwdriver<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.010> break<00:02:02.760> this<00:02:02.970> apart

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
screwdriver in here and break this apart

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.840 
screwdriver in here and break this apart
what<00:02:05.070> we're<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.490> see<00:02:06.650> exactly<00:02:07.650> how<00:02:08.130> deep

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
what we're going to see exactly how deep

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.900 
what we're going to see exactly how deep
we<00:02:09.150> are<00:02:09.800> which<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.550> we're<00:02:11.700> still

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
we are which we are so we're still

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.480 
we are which we are so we're still
connected<00:02:12.180> there<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.070> razor

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
connected there if you have a razor

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.240 
connected there if you have a razor
knife<00:02:14.930> or<00:02:15.930> exacto<00:02:16.650> knife<00:02:17.450> sometimes<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:20.040> can

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
knife or exacto knife sometimes you can

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.020 
knife or exacto knife sometimes you can
get<00:02:20.400> away<00:02:21.260> with<00:02:22.260> slicing<00:02:25.670> through<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.850> right

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
get away with slicing through the right

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.150 

so<00:04:26.840> this<00:04:26.990> is<00:04:27.110> going<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.320> be<00:04:27.440> our<00:04:27.560> biggest<00:04:27.770> cut

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
so this is going to be our biggest cut

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.640 
so this is going to be our biggest cut
basically<00:04:29.090> I'm<00:04:29.540> going<00:04:29.660> to<00:04:29.750> make<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.900> cut<00:04:30.230> here

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
basically I'm going to make a cut here

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.860 
basically I'm going to make a cut here
and<00:04:30.830> I'm<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.460> V<00:04:31.850> it<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.270> go<00:04:32.390> all<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.720> way<00:04:32.750> to

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
and I'm a V it and go all the way to

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.890 
and I'm a V it and go all the way to
here<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.940> we'll<00:04:34.940> be<00:04:35.090> able<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.390> knock<00:04:35.600> out

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
here and we'll be able to knock out

00:04:35.900 --> 00:05:11.450 
here and we'll be able to knock out
maybe<00:04:36.290> three<00:04:36.590> frags<00:04:37.070> out<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.430> this

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.409 

so<00:05:12.460> that<00:05:12.610> one<00:05:12.730> didn't<00:05:12.970> take<00:05:13.090> very<00:05:13.120> long

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
so that one didn't take very long

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.150 
so that one didn't take very long
because<00:05:13.810> it's<00:05:14.169> so<00:05:14.440> thin<00:05:15.030> I'm<00:05:16.030> going<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.300> see

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
because it's so thin I'm going to see

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.530 
because it's so thin I'm going to see
I'm<00:05:18.160> going<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.400> be<00:05:18.490> fortunate<00:05:19.120> enough<00:05:19.360> to

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
I'm going to be fortunate enough to

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:32.420 
I'm going to be fortunate enough to
break<00:05:19.810> this

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:06:02.520 

when<00:05:33.430> I<00:05:33.460> hit<00:05:33.699> this

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.900 

make<00:06:03.530> sure<00:06:03.740> you<00:06:03.830> don't<00:06:03.889> cut<00:06:04.190> your<00:06:04.340> finger<00:06:04.729> on

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
make sure you don't cut your finger on

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:27.869 
make sure you don't cut your finger on
the<00:06:05.060> other<00:06:05.090> side

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:27.879 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:34.899

so if you guys can see we've all we've
done<00:06:34.939> is<00:06:35.389> taken<00:06:35.659> off<00:06:35.929> the<00:06:36.110> edges<00:06:36.499> of<00:06:36.619> this<00:06:36.739> main

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
done is taken off the edges of this main

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.459 
done is taken off the edges of this main
mother<00:06:37.699> colony<00:06:38.209> right<00:06:38.389> here<00:06:38.659> so<00:06:39.139> basically

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:39.469 
mother colony right here so basically

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:41.169 
mother colony right here so basically
