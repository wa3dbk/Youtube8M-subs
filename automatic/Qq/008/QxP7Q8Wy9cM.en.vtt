00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.340
 hi i'm proud of him on the agenda 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.460
 4 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.270
 how to solve otherwise elise finally how do you pose 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.630
 warn them of risk by class 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.839
 for children to find themselves 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.060
 finally how a suite three by three 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.089
 so then took place 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.939
 retirement according to the CFA so much tracking and it is also the state that 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.619
 I have the most time 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.409
 so for 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.409
 I teach you delfin not play here 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.490
 Montreal 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.560
 3 finally three little bags of food a joke 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.680
 these phrases like thousands to form like that write everything that 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.680
 suggests a name of logic but it makes sense 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.060
 so that in the first quarter 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
 the backdrop so you can grab 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.550
 she 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.619
 the first one who so has there the measurements carried out the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.340
 red here it is mekhissi 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.180
 so it's in a room so there the formula to recompose what this 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.080
 announcement is this 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.400
 then not against hunger 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.110
 like to go if you have observed that even if you have an activity in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.210
 done here 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.210
 the mspb weekly statistics of stocks 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.350
 so to amaze 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.580
 karin nothing is done so it's a dream 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 so in fact the formula 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.780
 it is not necessary that this one 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 we were all waiting for them to eat 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 so the crowd composed the afp 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.300
 the envoy of the very long 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.240
 and to business love 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.040
 and to leave then admission 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.140
 so is she 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.460
 if you see that to accuse her of being arrested but she is there and when 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.750
 was in the opposition 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.340
 she breaks 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.260
 so a debt you really have to pillar no haaretz well done here we can 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
 hear him do it 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.489
 so after us 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.489
 she 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.999
 then 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.929
 in this case this time they are 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.929
 so like that 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.790
 so had ben there it is finally and appeared ioia no more humor 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.310
 a similar option the one he calls the first and the last rotation of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.129
 exchange 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.200
 except this time the police are there with whom he acquired these coins 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.139
 that's it then 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.949
 so for that you can 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.949
 this small brick defense 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.919
 so the child does not stop he sends very far 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.189
 we know then there you see the reactivity here drop finds there 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:02.509
 and in the press 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.459
 so more beautiful to die in fact well be careful that is no edges 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.459
 and you have to vote right 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.029
 while in europe 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.279
 you do this Saturday his target remains more than 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.279
 m there is a link between the text 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.949
 same date last year to gori concentrated these men 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.299
 when there is 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.589
 a coincidence was on the same line 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.089
 so speech what were you saying you're the most concrete this algorithm 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.069
 but for those who do not stop will be tested 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.139
 while you do 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.239
 maxime plunge spicy 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.029
 there is the pinard and breaks 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.039
 So here we go 

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:06.619
 so it's longer than a correction to lower the one that 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.619
 when there will be nothing but arest affairs 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.329
 ebay and that's the one I can practice 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.709
 so when you have two left 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.680
 it may be that for you who were elective 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.320
 you know in this configuration with both acts the data of the flight 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.669
 so please tibesar 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.669
 finally the ultimate little gift percent in one of these two axes 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.219
 but although if they do replicate bones may 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.669
 hidden talents 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.479
 he occupies death the trouble you will shine the last album rhythm 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:43.729
 that m 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.409
 I showed 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.659
 already searched on the moon all that smells online 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.889
 so it's like that 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.309
 not 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:57.289
 it was not the only site 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.449
 he's a tired useless cop 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:01.979
 and you but it's like that 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.169
 he was able to join 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.949
 lhuillier 2 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.300
 zarate in the miami year 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.300
 v 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.769
 here is alas all the northern ridges had expressed are resolved 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.379
 you can now results score three by three 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.779
 c afp keep 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:38.589
 you need at the same time the next video that melty fr you explain that 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.650
 there are looting of parity what he 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.839
 what is teaming this issue with his ministers 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.129
 see camisards 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.599
 so here is a good example of which parity that is to say that 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.210
 according to him it is perhaps because one could never forgive to be the 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.930
 rookie 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.400
 so since May 6 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.150
 there you both have followers 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.309
 complaint because everything is there 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:14.199
 except that it is of course biarritz 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.770
 mbaye samb 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.980
 happens as if people who are likely to harm a certain on the site 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.999
 we must doubt 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.930
 and now a war the team is solved
