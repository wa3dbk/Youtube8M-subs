00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.460
 today I'm going to show you a stitch 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.450
 specially designed for your 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:14.170
 Christmas projects despite the fact that 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.840
 I'm going to do with the tone that I used in the 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.490
 next stitch is going to have a change 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.650
 totally 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.680
 drastic let's do the following 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.689
 we are going to work a lay of three 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.779
 colors we are going to employ six zebras 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.520
 white two yellow and two red and 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.800
 let's repeat the sequence up 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.160
 finish our project we are going to 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.080
 changing tone preference to green and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:46.930
 we are going to lift only the first 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:49.450
 strand of the groups of six ie the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.100
 White color 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.750
 It is worth mentioning that you can 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:59.650
 change the tone of yellow yellow 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.750
 and red and they can put it in color 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.750
 silver and blue 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.550
 let's lift 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.040
 the second strand 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.370
 and we're going to continue like that you know until 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.640
 finish our sequence of 6 out of 6 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.710
 we're going to go up one to the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.180
 time but traveling upwards 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.510
 for example now we have the third 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.390
 line that is being this and we are going to 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.210
 work the third line of each group 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.540
 then the fourth the fifth and so 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.540
 successively 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.509
 and this is how we have left when 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.890
 we finish our 6 zebras now we go 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.890
 to continue as follows 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.210
 let's lift 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.210
 our two yellow strands 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.650
 let's lift our two strands 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.080
 yellows of each group 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.790
 Y 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.790
 back 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.700
 let's start or continue rather 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.490
 with our white strands 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.140
 and we are going to work like this 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.940
 just like we went up now let's go down 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.940
 let's raise the first 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.319
 of each group 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.490
 and we're going to go up when we go 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 come back you know we're going to raise the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.700
 second 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.850
 we are going to follow the sequence 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.150
 as well as we start is to say if we start 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.990
 from above this is going to be our second 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.170
 our second strand 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.000
 and we will continue like this until we finish 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.000
 with the 6 white strands 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.819
 since we finished our 6 strands 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.639
 white now in the downward direction 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.139
 now we are going to raise our two 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.139
 red strands 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.610
 of all groups 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.610
 and we are going to paste it here 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.310
 and we start the sequence now 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.650
 we have to make our white strands 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.620
 but you know we're going to start 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.520
 down we lift all our threads 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.430
 the first strand 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.610
 white of each group and we will work 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.550
 how we had been working 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.450
 traveling one by one until lifting 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.450
 the 6 strands 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.560
 Now you know that we are coming here 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.180
 we lift the second strand and so 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.890
 successively until we finish our 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.819
 group d 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.819
 of 6 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.220
 since we finished our 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.480
 six zebras let's repeat the sequence 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.450
 let's lift the two yellow 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.170
 then we return working our 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.170
 six zebras 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.759
 whites already know that in the direction of 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.310
 top down then we continue 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.050
 we raised two reds and started to 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.729
 work with white from below to 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.050
 above and I show you how it is 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.400
 finished our 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.400

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.310
