00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.440
 the report's chor marjorie tie I'll show you two 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.750
 video to act strong 9 600 dieter and beyond 1 4 8 3 0 if you are looking for a 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.600
 plate that has a little more than the basics but also does not want to spend 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.119
 that future all that are two blinds options in the market they have 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.669
 meetings are more or less similar 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.770
 with this thin body 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 and that's why they fit only one example taken in mind your monkey 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420
 are the so-called low profile cards 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.160
 besides not taking up so much space so the plates also do not heat much 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.500
 like those models with two graphics processors 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.129
 and talking a little delicate technical critiques 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220
 they are also very similar 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.670
 the two have 512 average memory ddr3 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.270
 in are built with 55 nanometer processors 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.270
 except that the outsiders come out in front of the body of memory 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.360
 which has 900 megahertz 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.590
 while the one here 4 and 30 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.870
 has only 575 mega refi 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.360
 but at the time we'll see who took the best even was that amd board 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.910
 in the tests that we did here in infolab and with the crisis that is the game 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.620
 heavier today 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.530
 this board did 16 frames per second more or less while the amd model 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.930
 day made 14 hectares 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.860
 already in the teeth marques the two boards practically tied they did 1 5 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.850
 one thousand and 500 points 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 points on average nourishment of machines in 3d 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.620
 which is the best program to evaluate the 3d graphics the collections of the two 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.230
 are identical they have two vehicle doors in a recent video 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.850
 it's good to know before you buy a hsq card you need a font in your 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.440
 midfield 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.430
 who has at least 550 vacancies 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.920
 to 9,680 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.240
 is in stores for more or less 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.540
 fifty reais 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.560
 and at 4,83 0, costing an average of 500 reais depending on the manufacturer
