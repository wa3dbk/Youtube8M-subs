and<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> lot<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> guys<00:01:40.350> backed<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:40.799> from

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and so a lot of guys backed down from

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.600 
and so a lot of guys backed down from
that<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> shy<00:01:41.640> away<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.520> know

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that and shy away from that and you know

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.399 
that and shy away from that and you know
from<00:01:44.850> my<00:01:44.909> perspective<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.659> lot<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.960> guys<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
from my perspective a lot of guys that I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
from my perspective a lot of guys that I
played<00:01:46.619> against<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.950> guard<00:01:47.250> me<00:01:47.430> are

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
played against that guard me are

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.330 
played against that guard me are
intimidated<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:48.840> back<00:01:49.049> down<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.860> met

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
intimidated and they back down so we met

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.740 
intimidated and they back down so we met
each<00:01:50.369> other<00:01:50.700> he<00:01:50.880> played<00:01:51.090> against<00:01:51.360> each<00:01:51.479> other

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
each other he played against each other

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050 
each other he played against each other
it<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.140> oh<00:01:52.350> okay<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.490> could<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.759> know<00:01:53.820> we

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it was like oh okay we could you know we

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
it was like oh okay we could you know we
got<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.630> mutual<00:01:55.020> respect<00:01:55.140> going<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.829> because

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
got this mutual respect going on because

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.499 
got this mutual respect going on because
we<00:01:56.219> both<00:01:56.369> didn't<00:01:56.640> back<00:01:56.820> down<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.240> were<00:01:57.299> both

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
we both didn't back down and were both

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.959 
we both didn't back down and were both
competitive<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:59.040> think<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.729> pressure

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
competitive and I think this pressure

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.740 
competitive and I think this pressure
grew<00:02:00.420> from<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.840> point<00:02:01.079> forward<00:02:02.420> last<00:02:03.420> night

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
grew from that point forward last night

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.080 
grew from that point forward last night
is<00:02:04.049> an<00:02:04.229> example<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.100> happens<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> NBA

last night's loss to the Clippers one of
those<00:02:15.459> nights<00:02:15.760> Kobe<00:02:16.269> where<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.810> was<00:02:17.049> a

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
those nights Kobe where it was a

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.399 
those nights Kobe where it was a
motivational<00:02:17.920> issue<00:02:18.480> well<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.840> know<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:19.989> think

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
motivational issue well you know I think

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.020 
motivational issue well you know I think
at<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.799> start<00:02:20.859> of<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.189> game<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.639> just<00:02:21.670> didn't

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
at the start of the game we just didn't

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.489 
at the start of the game we just didn't
come<00:02:22.150> out<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.569> with<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.049> right<00:02:23.260> energy

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:23.499 
come out with the with the right energy

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:24.989 
come out with the with the right energy
or<00:02:23.829> we<00:02:23.950> came<00:02:24.129> out<00:02:24.249> with<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> right<00:02:24.579> energy<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:24.999 
or we came out with the right energy the

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.429 
or we came out with the right energy the
Clippers<00:02:25.299> came<00:02:25.450> out<00:02:25.599> with<00:02:25.719> more<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.170> think<00:02:26.230> they

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
Clippers came out with more I think they

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.890 
Clippers came out with more I think they
were<00:02:26.530> more<00:02:26.560> motivated<00:02:26.889> to<00:02:27.609> you<00:02:28.569> know<00:02:28.659> in<00:02:28.780> this

because in this league it's hard to

in the league and you're the best team
last<00:04:11.079> year<00:04:11.319> I<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:12.370> keep<00:04:12.519> driving<00:04:12.909> them<00:04:12.939> to

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
last year I just keep driving them to

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.520 
last year I just keep driving them to
keep<00:04:13.329> problems<00:04:13.750> keep<00:04:13.930> pushing<00:04:14.259> them<00:04:14.319> keep

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
keep problems keep pushing them keep

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.080 
keep problems keep pushing them keep
challenging<00:04:14.739> oh<00:04:15.069> my<00:04:15.219> I<00:04:15.250> think<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.759> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
challenging oh my I think that the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.120 
challenging oh my I think that the
biggest<00:04:16.299> issue<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.659> that<00:04:17.079> teams<00:04:17.560> facing

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
biggest issue that that teams facing

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.149 
biggest issue that that teams facing
when<00:04:18.789> it<00:04:18.909> back-to-back<00:04:19.090> is<00:04:19.599> not<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:20.159> motivation

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
when it back-to-back is not a motivation

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.100 
when it back-to-back is not a motivation
I<00:04:21.250> think<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.699> first<00:04:21.969> step<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:22.930> is

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
I think that the first step to that is

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.550 
I think that the first step to that is
injuries

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
injuries

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.350 
injuries
I<00:04:24.590> think<00:04:25.130> that's<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.400> first<00:04:25.610> step<00:04:25.970> because

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
I think that's the first step because

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.790 
I think that's the first step because
then<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.690> have<00:04:26.810> injuries<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.560> then<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.710> have

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
then you have injuries and then you have

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.920 
then you have injuries and then you have
to<00:04:27.920> kind<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.190> battle<00:04:28.700> back<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.390> get<00:04:29.540> yourself

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
to kind of battle back to get yourself

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.300 
to kind of battle back to get yourself
back<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.140> condition<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.710> play<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.160> lot<00:04:31.190> of

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
back in condition to play and a lot of

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.710 
back in condition to play and a lot of
times<00:04:31.580> that's<00:04:31.820> when<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.150> motors<00:04:32.420> lack<00:04:32.570> of

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
times that's when the motors lack of

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.870 
times that's when the motors lack of
motivation<00:04:32.960> kicks<00:04:33.350> in<00:04:33.560> because<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.460> okay<00:04:34.670> no

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
motivation kicks in because it's okay no

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.580 
motivation kicks in because it's okay no
you're<00:04:35.030> already<00:04:35.180> done<00:04:35.450> this<00:04:35.720> coming<00:04:36.500> back

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
you're already done this coming back

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.110 
you're already done this coming back
from<00:04:36.710> some<00:04:36.890> serious<00:04:37.100> injuries<00:04:37.610> do<00:04:37.700> I<00:04:37.790> really

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
from some serious injuries do I really

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.460 
from some serious injuries do I really
want<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.360> push<00:04:38.510> myself<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.990> get<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.320> next

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
want to push myself to get to the next

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.790 
want to push myself to get to the next
level<00:04:39.680> to<00:04:39.980> win<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.780> think<00:04:42.110> injury<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.770> really

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
level to win so I think injury is really

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.430 
level to win so I think injury is really
the<00:04:43.450> main<00:04:44.450> thing<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:44.900> you<00:04:45.020> have<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.260> have<00:04:45.410> a
