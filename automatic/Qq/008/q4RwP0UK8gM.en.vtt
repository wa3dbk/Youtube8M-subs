not<00:00:04.050> a<00:00:04.080> day<00:00:04.290> goes<00:00:04.320> by<00:00:04.530> that<00:00:04.710> we<00:00:04.980> don't<00:00:05.040> look<00:00:05.279> at

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
not a day goes by that we don't look at

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.460 
not a day goes by that we don't look at
the<00:00:05.490> time<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.480> first<00:00:06.720> thing<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.170> do<00:00:07.319> when

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
the time the first thing that we do when

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.410 
the time the first thing that we do when
we<00:00:07.590> wake<00:00:07.740> up<00:00:07.800> is<00:00:08.160> we<00:00:08.580> look<00:00:08.730> at<00:00:08.850> a<00:00:08.880> clock<00:00:09.120> as

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
we wake up is we look at a clock as

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.450 
we wake up is we look at a clock as
we're<00:00:10.080> commuting<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.530> work<00:00:10.680> we<00:00:11.160> look<00:00:11.310> at<00:00:11.430> a

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
we're commuting to work we look at a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.880 
we're commuting to work we look at a
clock<00:00:12.110> when<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.530> work

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:13.890 
clock when we get to work

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.310 
clock when we get to work
we<00:00:14.040> even<00:00:14.220> clock<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.750> we<00:00:15.750> look<00:00:15.900> at<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.080> clock

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
we even clock in we look at the clock

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.050 
we even clock in we look at the clock
all<00:00:16.529> day<00:00:16.770> long<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.220> then<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> last<00:00:17.850> thing

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
all day long and then the last thing

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.090 
all day long and then the last thing
that<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.269> do<00:00:18.390> before<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.779> go<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> bed<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.860> look

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
that we do before we go to bed is look

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.770 
that we do before we go to bed is look
at<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.370> clock<00:00:20.580> our<00:00:21.270> lives<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.750> so

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:21.780 
at that clock our lives are so

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.529 
at that clock our lives are so
intertwined<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:23.190> time<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.610> it<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.450> we

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
intertwined with what time is it that we

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.939 
intertwined with what time is it that we
could<00:00:24.690> hardly<00:00:24.960> function<00:00:25.260> without<00:00:25.650> these

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
could hardly function without these

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.730 
could hardly function without these
timepieces<00:00:26.690> for<00:00:27.690> many<00:00:27.810> years<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.650> been

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
timepieces for many years we have been

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.010 
timepieces for many years we have been
fascinated<00:00:29.400> by<00:00:29.460> unique<00:00:29.820> clocks<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.750> we've

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
fascinated by unique clocks and we've

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.150 
fascinated by unique clocks and we've
been<00:00:31.170> wanting<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.440> build<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.680> clock<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.070> our

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
been wanting to build a clock of our

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
been wanting to build a clock of our
very<00:00:32.430> own<00:00:32.539> so<00:00:33.539> we<00:00:33.660> set<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> build<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
very own so we set out to build the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.580 
very own so we set out to build the
clock<00:00:35.129> os<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.960> beautifully<00:00:36.960> designed<00:00:37.140> clock
