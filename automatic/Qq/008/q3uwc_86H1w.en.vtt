00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.680
 kidney cancer and the center of a 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.360
 meeting held today in Verona e 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.349
 which brings together the leading experts of the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.059
 sector 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.830
 let's take stock of the disease with the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.790
 doctor giuseppe procopio of the institute 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.609
 of milan tumors 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.100
 a doctor, first of all a tumor 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.890
 disease but there are no more TV 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.140
 there are various various forms of cancer of the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.869
 both from a histological point of view 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.609
 that from the point of view of the so-called 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.189
 components that then favor them 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.649
 the onset there are more than one type of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 rap tumor more than one type means 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.090
 that there are histological features 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.420
 different that these are also accompanied 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.370
 to different prosthesis different behavior 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.789
 of the disease 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.860
 which form these are common here 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.640
 so called light up the shape 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.610
 more common 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.530
 this photo is one of three 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.109
 quarters of all primitive tumors of the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.270
 kidney is often accompanied by some 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.340
 types of genetic mutations one of the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.409
 balls have been identified and has been 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.229
 thanks to this that then you are 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.110
 developed specific drugs for the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.549
 cure of this pathology as widespread 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.630
 kidney cancer can give us some 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.270
 number 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.400
 he is not one of the so-called big killers 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.860
 so it's not one of the four 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.020
 major oncological diseases e 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.330
 definitely a rising disease of 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.780
 incidence if we think in the world are 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.710
 about 200,000 cases in Italy 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.530
 by relating them our reality is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.909
 entry to 6 thousand new cases have a 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.340
 This gave proof adds 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.110
 so-called prevalence data ie say 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.360
 being of forms that often 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.090
 many of them relapsed from a distance 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.940
 years and 30 do not reform that thanks today 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.100
 even they have an expectation 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.540
 life that is definitely longer than that 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.000
 which is important is that the given of 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.500
 prevalence ie how many people have 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.580
 that disease in a given 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.670
 period 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.160
 we count that in Italy there are about 20 thousand 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.380
 therefore people have numbers 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.530
 far from negligible 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.240
 there is some privileged facility 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.990
 we say so or it affects us indiscriminately 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.940
 at any age an illness increases 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.750
 of incidence with the aging of the 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.660
 population 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.810
 let's say that a quarter of the cases are 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.670
 even in the over 70 75 then one 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.760
 illness certainly of the average age and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.280
 more often decidedly killed in the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.170
 little boys who in the little girls which 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.480
 are the most common symptoms as can be 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.250
 notice that there is something that nothing 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.330
 the most common symptoms are the presence of 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.430
 blood in the urine therefore red sheep 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.440
 abdominal pain of normal honor e 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.170
 this can also be perception 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.690
 therefore of an abdominal mass then 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.490
 of an effect tied to the fabric not 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.730
 always all this theory of 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.620
 symptomatology is present 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.959
 of the presentation can be much more 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.849
 out of tune as it is diagnosed on the base 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.980
 of clinical symptoms rather than 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.989
 incidental ecography in 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.640
 Typically, the first examination that there followed the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.120
 first exam that allows you to identify 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.099
 solid and then kidney injury 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.590
 to that follows the implementation of 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.629
 more in-depth methods also 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.879
 rather than magnetic resonance a 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.060
 which then needs a histological confirmation e 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.670
 so there is a biopsy of the same 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.250
 risk factors for this tumor 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.810
 there are risk factors that are 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.329
 constituted primarily by the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.370
 familiarity just for that kind of 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.950
 mutation I referred to in 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.410
 civil precedence are of the populations 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.000
 which are in theory more at risk 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.650
 secondly there are factors of 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.180
 environmental risk and among these a 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.370
 exposure to cigarette smoke e 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.019
 what I recognized is not 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.410
 possible to prevent against 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.750
 of the tumor but a primary prevention 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.390
 I would say it is difficult to read primary 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.299
 indeed this moment is therefore impossible 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.569
 we cannot prevent a pathology from 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.549
 which we have not very clear then Lennox e 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.590
 pathogenic, that is the elements that then 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.299
 lead to the development of the same yes 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.430
 it can lead to early diagnosis 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.419
 surely you can get to do one 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.549
 timely diagnosis to implement 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:16.669
 the most valid therapeutic measures 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.160
 possible we can give a message e 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.829
 general practitioners among helping them 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.240
 seize the first signs of alarm but 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.190
 I believe it is a message that must 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.139
 share a bit all the medical class 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.039
 we all listen more to our own 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.169
 patients 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.450
 I say it like a cone on me is 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.970
 obviously aimed at everyone let's hear it 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.490
 more because I believe that by listening to the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.550
 patient the first step is born 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.950
 for a valid patient and medical report 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.710
 then then include those that 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.910
 are the necessities that in theory also the 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.910
 diseases that can occur
