00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
along the inside that's what it's going

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.380 
along the inside that's what it's going
to<00:02:39.600> look<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.320> then<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.280> simply<00:02:42.060> rolls

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
