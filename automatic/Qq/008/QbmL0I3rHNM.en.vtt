00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
ago we will when the tower comes down we

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
ago we will when the tower comes down we
will<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> quick<00:01:38.040> survey<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> make<00:01:39.570> sure

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
will do a quick survey just to make sure

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
will do a quick survey just to make sure
there's<00:01:39.930> no<00:01:40.079> radiation<00:01:40.470> there<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.100> don't

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
there's no radiation there but we don't

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.789 
there's no radiation there but we don't
really<00:01:41.520> expect<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.509> any<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.140> tower<00:01:43.409> had

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
really expect to see any the tower had

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.460 
really expect to see any the tower had
three<00:01:44.159> legs<00:01:44.399> sets<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.240> guy<00:01:45.450> wires<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.049> twelve
