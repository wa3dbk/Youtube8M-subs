poi in motion with simple bounces you
can<00:03:11.239> even<00:03:11.510> learn<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.780> do<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:11.989> with<00:03:12.170> one<00:03:12.380> hand

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
can even learn to do this with one hand

can even learn to do this with one hand
as<00:03:13.010> long<00:03:13.459> as<00:03:13.610> one<00:03:13.850> string<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.150> held<00:03:14.510> higher

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
than the other it's not as hard as you
