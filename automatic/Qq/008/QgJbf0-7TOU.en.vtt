00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.449 
possible that jumping for the sketch is
a<00:04:00.540> little<00:04:00.750> bit<00:04:00.900> wonky<00:04:01.080> but<00:04:01.560> yeah<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.159> got<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> put

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
a little bit wonky but yeah I got to put

a little bit wonky but yeah I got to put
some<00:04:02.610> objects<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.110> cafe<00:04:04.730> shut<00:04:05.730> the

cafe<00:04:07.129> and<00:04:09.049> yeah<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.319> think<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.950> should<00:04:11.099> be<00:04:11.190> it

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
cafe and yeah I think that should be it

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.630 
cafe and yeah I think that should be it
still<00:04:13.379> I<00:04:13.590> said<00:04:13.860> there's<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.069> lot<00:04:14.190> of<00:04:14.220> work<00:04:14.400> at

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
still I said there's a lot of work at

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.560

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
all that stuff but it's probably one of

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.909 
all that stuff but it's probably one of
