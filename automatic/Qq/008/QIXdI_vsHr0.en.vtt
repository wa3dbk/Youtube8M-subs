00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.350
 now just sitting in this wallet brings 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.510
 I always have to keep doing it. 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.290
 A little favor for him, man, do not you? 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.290
 nothing alone 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.310
 and you are that any woman 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.640
 from the boy's childhood, it's going 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:36.070
 want to let the day 11 is that so 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:42.970
 as it is called Gabriel avoids a 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.750
 thing this boy is very cute is the 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.280
 Gabriel 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.879
 I think I already did work like him 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.879
 find here 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.240
 The goalkeeper is a fake 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.210
 It's the equity day today. Let's see. 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.870
 that I remember never let me stay 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.380
 careful if we can hide 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.470
 Rafael made himself by night in the dark. 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.030
 it's always dark for me 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.950
 Imagine that it 's cool if you can 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.540
 Where no one knows you, you can 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.860
 to invent a new personality if you 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.590
 I wish you do not like your 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:27.790
 August personality but the problem is not 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:31.800
 It's me, it's me, it's all nice. 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.800
 talking to him wearing hair 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.030
 I must stay the things that we always 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.030
 let's save it 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.800
 pure 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.530
 She talks to me like she is yours. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.970
 Geez, yes, why does everybody stay? 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.329
 wanting to control me and no one wants 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.329
 the kiss nobody 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.520
 What do you imagine your great love is? 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.370
 You said that in our room alone 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.370
 I thought I'm ready
