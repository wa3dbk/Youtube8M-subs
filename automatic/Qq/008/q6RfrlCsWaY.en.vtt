00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 the international airport tancredo neves confins in the first semester of 2007 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.790
 occupied the eighth position among the airports with the highest 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.569
 brazil passengers 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.559
 the congonhas flights are going to be transferred to 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.570
 confines at other airports in the country 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.329
 since the Tam airplane crash on July 17 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.009
 the proposals and plans for the changes at the airport miners only increased 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.159
 changes range from the airport infrastructure to the 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.630
 Airlines 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.140
 I think you're going to do something like this because there are few 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.250
 another as a powerful team to be able to meet 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.250
 this one of today the biggest loss is that the braga did not 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.900
 reforms of the roads and the capacity of the 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.440
 boundary airport 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 is greater than this is a daily movement 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.480
 tancredo neves airport could be a hub for 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.260
 Brazil 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.450
 how to get to port de janeiro 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.850
 the government will have to invest more than 40 million reais and will extend to the runway 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 of landings and departures 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.970
 I think 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.330
 is not prepared to 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.840
 receive punishments 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.930
 vehicle 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.130
 the galleon on the river is not ready either 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.110
 it's half past three 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 iron infrastructure 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.560
 in training 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 been observed and in other airports in Brazil 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.040
 here at the international airport tancredo neves confins 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.080
 the drive is solid nothing better than it backed was little 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.380
 changes in confines increase the flow of passengers and flights due to 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.100
 transfer 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.160
 from congonhas to the airport tancredo snows between the changes are the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.890
 collections from the south of the country to the northeastern regions brought 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.460
 possibility of change at the airport, but nobody would leave corn 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.580
 will be expressed airport forecast they wanted to pronounce
