00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hey guys, I'm good, Lucas. 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.839
 knights with one more hint of 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.780
 photo on the sixth tip I have 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.809
 For you it's the composition rule of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 thirds if you have heard of rule 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.870
 two thirds of the congratulations you're in 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.910
 right path 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.439
 What are you really studying? 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.140
 it matters for photography what 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.810
 really changes the way you look 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.689
 photograph that is composition composition 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.369
 nothing is more than choosing choose the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.560
 that I'll put in my picture 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.840
 choose if my photo will stay 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.149
 catching more sky the period plus one 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.460
 piece under the ground if I'm going to put 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.079
 the person's eyes on the left face 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.059
 of the person on the left on the right 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.010
 if the eyes will be in the middle of the image 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.289
 more up but down are 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.180
 choices that we make the rule of 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.340
 thirds is a very simple rule it is a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.280
 very simple concept a concept that 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 aims to give harmony the final result of 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.629
 image and consists of dividing the scene 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.690
 between the parts three horizontal parts 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.750
 and vertical transport and joy says 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.060
 it is interesting to put the points 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.100
 are more relevant to our image in the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.770
 meeting of these girls or in this one 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 of these four points 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 This is what the rule says is that everything 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.450
 world learns but in truth actually 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.290
 the basis of the service rule is 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.909
 make the image more harmonic and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.100
 necessarily we need to put 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.820
 on top of these points to have a photo 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.820
 more harmonic 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.569
 there are no definitive rules 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 The rule in general is to have a 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.360
 Pleasing result look and not enough alone 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.430
 put interesting subjects in the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.110
 meeting points of the third lines 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.810
 to have an interesting way I 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.180
 I need more elements than elements 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.200
 I can join the knowledge of rules 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.520
 Tuesday 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.290
 classic example is to split my scene 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.050
 in this upper line of the thirds line 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.420
 divide with information different from 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.360
 colors with information different from 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.390
 textures divide the scene with information 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.670
 of interest for example are 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.459
 many ideas that we can put together 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.350
 to have one more result a photo with 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.239
 more visual impact 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.920
 a request that I make to all my 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.170
 students and all the contacts that are 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.080
 beginning to leave the composition that is the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.900
 It's what happened to me, and do not be a 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.300
 place of things in the text points 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.150
 who is a setter of things at that point 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.870
 to succeed is someone a photographer who 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.450
 simply puts for example looking at the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.850
 model who is photographing at the meeting 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.130
 of the lines have their upper students 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.920
 left for example finding the lines 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.380
 which is the top point that puts the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.630
 model face there and take the picture and 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.820
 then put it on the right and take the picture and 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.519
 then put inferior in the colon 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.739
 and take the two pictures, that is 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.829
 for each photo he needs to deliver 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.260
 for every photo he needs to do it 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.739
 can make four wheels 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.530
 he does not think in harmony he does not try 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.630
 see a scene a harmony it 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.620
 simply put what he wants 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.290
 highlight what he wants to draw attention to 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.459
 the four points and see what was 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.340
 best 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.070
 this is not think and do not photograph 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.799
 is to make up this is simply 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.870
 putting things in consistency is the 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.890
 what I call the settler of things 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.900
 posters 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.450
 I already went to put things to pain was 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.180
 tense and I do not save all 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.800
 my students 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:26.740
 Do not be one nowadays I do not think 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.050
 more in rules of the text I do not think anymore 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.500
 bolatti spiral I no longer think of 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.270
 golden ratio I do not think about 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.820
 composition by triangles all these 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.169
 you can search in 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.060
 books that talk about it 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.340
 that on the screen putting a book that I think 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.620
 very good composition that I look at 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.770
 future is very good, I recommend reading 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.169
 all the right photographers but today in 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.750
 day I do not think anymore of rule 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.169
 does not think about going back to 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.750
 record a scene and the spare look like this I 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.300
 I'm going to put her face on the point of 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.060
 meeting the lines of right-thirds 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:08.740
 I do not think I just move to 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.590
 camera and inside to see the best 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.080
 harmony for that scene I try to do 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.139
 a key in my brain to turn and 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.289
 lock the right lock so that 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.789
 happened that they happened to that 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.699
 harmony on the scene 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.340
 only for this to happen in my brain 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.470
 I need to educate my mind I 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.860
 I need the carmo look and how the 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.349
 people educate our gaze by studying 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.380
 rules of composition the rules of 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.020
 composition serve to educate our 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.930
 they serve to accustom our 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.930
 look at our head our brain our 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:50.259
 way of thinking to think to see 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.300
 things that are harmonic 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:55.990
 if we get used to seeing things 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.590
 harmonics we simply ignore the 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.289
 rules 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.070
 rules make it easier to find 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.199
 harmony 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.870
 if we can internalize these 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:08.110
 rules we no longer think of the rules 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.229
 we think of makeup we think 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.840
 to leave the harmonic photo 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.270
 this is the hint of today of composition 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.070
 to educate your head do not study your 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.070
 rule of thirds study of other forms 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.440
 composition research on composition 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.699
 this is very important to change the 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.470
 picture of you 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.470
 Big hug and until next time
