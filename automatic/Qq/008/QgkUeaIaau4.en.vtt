00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
works like that was my LeBlanc that you

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.480 
works like that was my LeBlanc that you
just<00:01:17.710> saw<00:01:17.920> let's<00:01:18.909> try<00:01:19.450> my<00:01:19.659> free<00:01:19.869> our<00:01:20.080> game<00:01:20.500> I'm

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
just saw let's try my free our game I'm

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:30.830 
just saw let's try my free our game I'm
going<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.820> load<00:01:22.000> that<00:01:22.240> up<00:01:22.619> we'll<00:01:23.619> try<00:01:23.890> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.560 

now<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.679> the<00:01:31.770> same<00:01:31.979> thing<00:01:35.000> ignore<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.149> text

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
now it's the same thing ignore the text

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.880 
now it's the same thing ignore the text
by<00:01:36.719> the<00:01:36.750> way<00:01:37.159> that's<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.520> stream<00:01:39.890> anyways

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
by the way that's from my stream anyways

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.580 
by the way that's from my stream anyways
it<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:41.490> load<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.700> quickly<00:01:42.319> just<00:01:43.319> like<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it will load up quickly just like a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.690 
it will load up quickly just like a
mullet<00:01:44.310> block<00:01:45.060> replay<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.250> might<00:01:47.459> work

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
mullet block replay this one might work

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.440 
mullet block replay this one might work
actually<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.530> freezes<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:51.030> might<00:01:51.209> hear

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
actually so it freezes you might hear

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.370 
actually so it freezes you might hear
sound

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.200 

wait<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> couple<00:01:59.399> seconds<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.770> bugs<00:02:01.770> flat<00:02:02.210> now

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
wait a couple seconds and bugs flat now

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.170 
wait a couple seconds and bugs flat now
I<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.509> done<00:02:04.170> almost<00:02:04.619> everything<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.880> can<00:02:06.030> do

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.069 
me an air just like this so I close that
and<00:02:48.980> then<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.069> try<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.310> repair<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.880> again<00:02:51.090> but

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
and then I try to repair it again but

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.470 
and then I try to repair it again but
instead<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.040> repairing<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.519> as<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> false<00:02:54.060> patch

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
instead of repairing it as a false patch

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.949 
instead of repairing it as a false patch
I<00:02:54.840> already<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.640> repair<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.790> as<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.720> patch

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
I already I repair it as the patch

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.059 
I already I repair it as the patch
currently<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.610> go<00:02:59.900> for<00:03:00.900> point<00:03:01.440> twenty<00:03:01.890> one

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
currently so I go for point twenty one

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.630 
currently so I go for point twenty one
point<00:03:02.579> zero<00:03:02.670> point<00:03:03.209> three<00:03:03.269> nine<00:03:03.450> seven<00:03:04.640> okay

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
point zero point three nine seven okay

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.120 
point zero point three nine seven okay
so<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> current<00:03:07.140> patch<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.829> right

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
so this is a current patch this is right

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:16.380 
so this is a current patch this is right
a<00:03:08.810> plate
