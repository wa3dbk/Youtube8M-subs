00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
away on the other one so it'd just be

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.350 
away on the other one so it'd just be
great<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.200> they<00:02:58.530> got<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> ton<00:02:59.100> of

the first time today and my first

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.370 
the first time today and my first
thoughts<00:03:20.700> were<00:03:21.709> this<00:03:22.709> game<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.959> going<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.260> be

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
thoughts were this game is going to be

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.610 
thoughts were this game is going to be
the<00:03:25.500> best<00:03:25.830> cod<00:03:26.550> yet<00:03:26.959> now<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:27.989> say<00:03:28.320> this<00:03:28.470> because

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.920 

everything<00:03:31.620> about<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:32.370> has<00:03:33.060> been<00:03:33.330> improved

modern warfare 3 they make killstreaks

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.750 
modern warfare 3 they make killstreaks
harder<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.820> get<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.860> scrubs<00:03:40.860> couldn't<00:03:41.640> use

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
harder to get so scrubs couldn't use

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.520
