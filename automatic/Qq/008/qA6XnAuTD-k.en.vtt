00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.660 
had in mind by introducing this room
glaive<00:01:33.869> item<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.500> compared<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> major

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
glaive item is compared it to the major

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.670 
glaive item is compared it to the major
so<00:01:36.090> after<00:01:36.360> all<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> item<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.439> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
so after all that is the item that it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
so after all that is the item that it
has<00:01:37.799> replaced<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> improved<00:01:39.270> upon<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:39.810> there

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
has replaced and improved upon now there

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.210 
has replaced and improved upon now there
are<00:01:40.049> three<00:01:40.079> significant<00:01:40.710> things<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.009> mention

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
are three significant things to mention

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
are three significant things to mention
about<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.180> first<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> give

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
about this the first of which is to give

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.499 
about this the first of which is to give
these<00:01:43.530> AP<00:01:43.890> junglers<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.520> early<00:01:44.850> game<00:01:45.030> damage

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
these AP junglers more early game damage

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.969 
these AP junglers more early game damage
and<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:45.810> specifically<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.530> help<00:01:46.560> them<00:01:46.860> with

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and more specifically to help them with

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.100 
and more specifically to help them with
their<00:01:47.189> clears<00:01:47.549> thanks<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.509> Sheen<00:01:48.810> effect

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
their clears thanks to that Sheen effect

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
their clears thanks to that Sheen effect
in<00:01:49.320> addition<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.399> also<00:01:50.520> helps<00:01:50.790> with

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
in addition to that it also helps with

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
in addition to that it also helps with
the<00:01:50.970> air<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> also<00:01:52.200> alleviate<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:52.890> of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the air we and also alleviate some of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
the air we and also alleviate some of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
their manner issues those three things I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.530 
their manner issues those three things I
just<00:01:55.350> mentioned<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.189> weak<00:01:56.610> spots<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.180> AP

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
just mentioned are all weak spots of AP

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.330 
just mentioned are all weak spots of AP
junglers<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> make<00:01:59.009> AP

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
junglers and if you want to make AP

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.069 
junglers and if you want to make AP
junglers<00:01:59.520> stronger<00:02:00.210> are<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.600> things<00:02:00.960> you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
junglers stronger are all things you

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.530 
junglers stronger are all things you
should<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.350> taking<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.890> look<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.909> theory

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
should be taking a look at so in theory
