then when you no longer rest it it'll

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
then when you no longer rest it it'll
let<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.979> leave<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.230 
resting in a bed you know for that makes
sense<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.159> only<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> log<00:01:54.000> off

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
sense but not only that if you log off

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.760 
sense but not only that if you log off
in<00:01:54.570> an<00:01:54.720> inn<00:01:54.840> room<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.259> log<00:01:55.409> back<00:01:55.439> on

in an inn room and then log back on

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.139 
in an inn room and then log back on
you'll<00:01:55.920> actually<00:01:56.070> get<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> short<00:01:56.759> cutscene

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you'll actually get a short cutscene

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.300 
you'll actually get a short cutscene
that<00:01:57.540> shows<00:01:57.899> your<00:01:58.079> character<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.619> hanging

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310

off the side of the bed sleeping and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.100 
off the side of the bed sleeping and
then<00:02:00.930> waking<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.710> ah<00:02:02.930> there<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.960> go

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
visual of that that's actually what they

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.059 
visual of that that's actually what they
do<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.439> continue<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
do and then you continue on with the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.889 
do and then you continue on with the
game<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.879> that's<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> bed<00:02:09.450> does<00:02:09.660> that's

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
game so that's what the bed does that's

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.050 
game so that's what the bed does that's
its<00:02:10.080> purpose<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.860> big<00:02:11.370> questions<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.970> get

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
its purpose the big questions that I get

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.350 
its purpose the big questions that I get

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
up mispronouncing like six times because

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.500 
up mispronouncing like six times because
I'm<00:02:16.990> trying<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.290> all<00:02:17.320> fancy<00:02:17.530> about<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.510> it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
I'm trying to be all fancy about it it

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.960 
I'm trying to be all fancy about it it
stores<00:02:19.810> items<00:02:20.050> but<00:02:20.550> people<00:02:21.550> who<00:02:21.670> know<00:02:21.850> about

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
stores items but people who know about

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.280 
stores items but people who know about
the<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.240> rooms<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.630> ask<00:02:22.810> about<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.170> actually

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the in rooms and ask about it actually

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.320 
the in rooms and ask about it actually
always<00:02:23.650> ask<00:02:23.830> why<00:02:24.370> can't<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.730> store<00:02:24.970> anything<00:02:25.120> in

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
always ask why can't I store anything in

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.520 
always ask why can't I store anything in
here<00:02:25.450> that's<00:02:25.480> because<00:02:25.960> it's<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.170> new<00:02:26.320> player

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
here that's because it's a new player

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.810 
here that's because it's a new player
you<00:02:26.710> usually<00:02:26.860> don't<00:02:27.190> have<00:02:27.310> any<00:02:27.460> items<00:02:27.760> that

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
you usually don't have any items that

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.120 
you usually don't have any items that
actually<00:02:28.180> qualify<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.750> be<00:02:28.960> stored<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.350> here<00:02:29.530> so

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
actually qualify to be stored in here so

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.150 
actually qualify to be stored in here so
uh<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.850> reason<00:02:31.180> why<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.530> doesn't<00:02:32.770> store<00:02:33.070> your

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
uh the reason why it doesn't store your

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.800 
uh the reason why it doesn't store your
items<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.580> because<00:02:33.760> it's<00:02:33.910> meant<00:02:34.150> for<00:02:34.210> storing

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
items is because it's meant for storing

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.020 
items is because it's meant for storing
specific<00:02:35.680> items<00:02:36.040> if<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.310> stored<00:02:36.460> everything

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
specific items if it's stored everything

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.550 
specific items if it's stored everything
it<00:02:37.540> would<00:02:37.720> kind<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.050> be<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.230> little<00:02:38.290> bit

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
it would kind of be a little bit

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.140 
it would kind of be a little bit
excessive<00:02:38.950> considering<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.640> already<00:02:39.970> have

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
excessive considering you already have

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.790 
excessive considering you already have
the<00:02:40.300> storage<00:02:40.600> options<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:41.170> your<00:02:41.380> your

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
the storage options of your your

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.010 
the storage options of your your
retainers<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.120> what<00:02:43.570> is<00:02:43.690> what<00:02:43.840> does<00:02:43.990> it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
retainers so what is what does it

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.720 
retainers so what is what does it
actually<00:02:44.320> stores<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.860> big<00:02:45.010> question<00:02:45.130> well<00:02:45.400> one

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
actually stores a big question well one

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.160 
actually stores a big question well one
thing<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.090> definitely<00:02:46.450> stores<00:02:46.630> vanity

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
thing is it definitely stores vanity

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.960 
thing is it definitely stores vanity
items<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:47.740> able<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.040> as<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.370> can<00:02:48.490> see<00:02:48.670> here

their<00:03:38.350> answer<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.709> them<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.790> basically<00:03:39.940> you

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
their answer to them so basically you

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.090 
their answer to them so basically you
can<00:03:40.360> store<00:03:40.600> these<00:03:40.720> items<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.290> it's<00:03:41.739> not<00:03:41.950> only

because<00:03:42.220> they're<00:03:42.850> decent<00:03:43.150> items<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.870> you

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
because they're decent items that you

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.300

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
backup and you can store them here so

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.670
