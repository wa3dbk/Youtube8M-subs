 that my father parades me the 2 year old woman from Texas may choose the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.840
 horses that would not be abused

 that's right, you know that place and that has been going on for a long time 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.900

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.350
 as soon as children become adults, abuse usually stopped but with that 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.360
 the problems are not over 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.469
 there are people who 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.930
 after a heavy burden of 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.770
 even people who only want to tell a screen with the story like 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.730
 consequence that says you are invisible 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.870
 feel good at all but in order to surpass a threshold, you actually have to 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.440
 completely on zero 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.100
 the same school daycare

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.660
 and then my daughter 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.369
 the ja ses probably will be about 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.579

 abuse can be prevented but the great silence of both 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.139
 Victims as environment stands in the way of solving the problem 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.529

 I kept silent for a long time about the past because I didn't really want to be there 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.549
 reason for it and people don't like it to be because of it too

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.099
 and everyone away from the past 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.859
 and all are afraid of doing something 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.789
 although it should also just go to it is not at all normal course 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:57.779

 that you can also feel well that has to do with the people involved 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:05.589
 but I did when I forgot the story if there was something wrong 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:06.850
