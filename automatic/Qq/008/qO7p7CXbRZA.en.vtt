saying she's not responsible for her
behavior<00:04:32.670> but<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.150> think<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.480> she<00:04:33.600> has<00:04:33.690> a

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
behavior but I think that she has a

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.540 
behavior but I think that she has a
psychological<00:04:34.560> disorder<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.340> agree

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
psychological disorder and I agree

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.270 
psychological disorder and I agree
whereby<00:04:36.000> she<00:04:36.240> has<00:04:36.420> absolutely<00:04:36.690> no<00:04:37.440> feeling

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
whereby she has absolutely no feeling

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.580 
whereby she has absolutely no feeling
for<00:04:38.460> any<00:04:38.610> other<00:04:38.850> human<00:04:39.060> being<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.660> think<00:04:40.080> Harry

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
for any other human being I think Harry

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.800 
for any other human being I think Harry
Helmsley<00:04:41.070> is<00:04:41.310> probably<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.880> only<00:04:42.060> individual

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
Helmsley is probably the only individual

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.230 
Helmsley is probably the only individual
that<00:04:43.200> she<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.740> capable<00:04:44.280> of<00:04:44.340> sticking<00:04:44.760> with<00:04:44.970> and

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
that she is capable of sticking with and

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.000 
that she is capable of sticking with and
of<00:04:45.720> course<00:04:45.960> it's<00:04:46.140> because<00:04:46.260> he<00:04:46.500> has<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> five

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
of course it's because he has a five

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.890 
of course it's because he has a five
billion<00:04:47.310> dollar<00:04:47.460> real<00:04:47.820> estate<00:04:48.060> empire<00:04:48.270> he's
