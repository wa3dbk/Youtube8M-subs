exactly the other way in if we just go

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.190 
exactly the other way in if we just go
on<00:00:43.200> over<00:00:43.469> here<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> break<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> lock<00:00:45.020> you<00:00:46.020> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
we're going to be looking at this hidden

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.729 
we're going to be looking at this hidden
stone<00:01:01.649> generating<00:01:02.489> bud<00:01:02.940> kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.570> thing<00:01:03.780> as

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
stone generating bud kind of thing as

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.080 
stone generating bud kind of thing as
you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.400> break<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.760> little

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you can see when we break this little

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
you can see when we break this little
block<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:07.140> gives<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> redstone<00:01:07.830> output<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
block it gives this redstone output and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
block it gives this redstone output and
it<00:01:08.820> regenerates<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.630> new<00:01:09.780> piece<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.140> stone<00:01:10.409> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it regenerates a new piece of stone it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
it regenerates a new piece of stone it
was<00:01:11.220> amazing<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> me<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.119> youtube<00:01:12.510> there

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
was amazing to me that on youtube there

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.080 
was amazing to me that on youtube there
were<00:01:12.900> no<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.439> small<00:01:13.799> designs<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
were no really small designs and all of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.270 
were no really small designs and all of
them<00:01:15.240> were<00:01:15.360> pretty<00:01:15.509> impractical<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.860> common

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
them were pretty impractical one common

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
them were pretty impractical one common
problem<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.759> noticed<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.240> those<00:01:18.390> other

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
problem we noticed with those other

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
problem we noticed with those other
designs<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.470> kept<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> lava<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.520> if

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
designs is that it kept the lava and if

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.520 
designs is that it kept the lava and if
you<00:01:21.030> want<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> make<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.540> thing<00:01:21.810> hidden<00:01:22.170> which

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you want to make this thing hidden which

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
you want to make this thing hidden which
of<00:01:22.710> course<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.570> hearing<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.600> lava<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
of course you do hearing that lava in

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
of course you do hearing that lava in
the<00:01:25.229> wall<00:01:25.439> will<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> dead<00:01:26.070> giveaway<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.909> as

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the wall will be a dead giveaway but as

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.730 
the wall will be a dead giveaway but as
you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.540> there's<00:01:27.750> no<00:01:27.960> lava<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you can see there's no lava when it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.490 
you can see there's no lava when it's
not<00:01:28.920> running<00:01:29.630> there's<00:01:30.630> only<00:01:30.810> lava<00:01:31.229> that's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
not running there's only lava that's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
not running there's only lava that's
dispensed<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> needs<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> create<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> new

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
dispensed when it needs to create a new

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.850 
dispensed when it needs to create a new
block<00:01:33.420> what's<00:01:34.049> also<00:01:34.200> cool<00:01:34.380> about<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
block what's also cool about this is

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
block what's also cool about this is
that<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.369> survival<00:01:35.850> you're<00:01:36.030> always<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that in survival you're always going to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.380 
that in survival you're always going to
have<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.900> pickaxe<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.650> your<00:01:37.799> hand<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> it's

always<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.930> easy<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> activate<00:01:40.409> alright

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
always really easy to activate alright

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.160 
always really easy to activate alright
so<00:01:41.460> let's<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.790> started<00:01:41.930> alright<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.049> we're

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
so let's get started alright so we're

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.480 
so let's get started alright so we're
going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> start<00:01:43.560> off<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.950> four<00:01:44.189> by<00:01:44.340> five

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
going to start off with a four by five

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.030 
going to start off with a four by five
platform<00:01:45.090> right<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.509> on<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.680> block<00:01:47.009> right

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
platform right here on this block right

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.859 
platform right here on this block right
here<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.060> block<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> you're<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
here is the block that you're going to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.330 
here is the block that you're going to
break<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.740> block<00:01:49.920> that's<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
break and it's the block that's going to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
break and it's the block that's going to
be<00:01:50.460> regenerated<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.600> block<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.140> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
be regenerated so this block is going to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.899 
be regenerated so this block is going to
be<00:01:52.320> made<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> stone<00:01:53.040> we're<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> come

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
be made of stone we're going to come

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.609 
be made of stone we're going to come
back<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.570> we're<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.409> place<00:01:55.590> a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.400 
redstone line that's three long going
across<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.879> will<00:02:12.060> go<00:02:12.239> up<00:02:12.480> into<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
across like so that will go up into a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.950 
across like so that will go up into a
lock<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> redstone<00:02:14.760> torch<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.270> top<00:02:15.480> then

lock with a redstone torch on top then

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.940 
lock with a redstone torch on top then
you're<00:02:16.140> going<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.320> come<00:02:16.470> around<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
you're going to come around to the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.220 
you're going to come around to the
inside<00:02:17.400> place<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> dispenser<00:02:18.540> right<00:02:18.750> here<00:02:19.050> and

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
in it you're going to eventually place

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.930 
in it you're going to eventually place
your<00:02:22.560> lava<00:02:22.710> but<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.010> wouldn't<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.550> yet

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
your lava but I wouldn't do that yet

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.240 
your lava but I wouldn't do that yet
just<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> save<00:02:24.750> your<00:02:24.900> redstone<00:02:25.170> wiring<00:02:25.500> coming

your water bucket then inside this
dispenser<00:03:30.570> we're<00:03:31.140> going<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.320> place<00:03:31.500> our<00:03:31.620> lava

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
dispenser we're going to place our lava

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.830 
dispenser we're going to place our lava
now<00:03:32.610> we<00:03:32.670> can<00:03:32.850> come<00:03:33.030> around<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.420> front<00:03:33.540> go

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
now we can come around to the front go

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.570 
now we can come around to the front go
ahead<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.140> break<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.470> block<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.040> it's

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
ahead and break that block and it's

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.280 
ahead and break that block and it's
going<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.940> generate<00:03:36.180> our<00:03:36.540> first<00:03:36.780> stone<00:03:37.050> block

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
going to generate our first stone block

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.500 
going to generate our first stone block
then<00:03:38.220> from<00:03:38.459> now<00:03:38.490> on<00:03:38.790> when<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.150> break<00:03:39.300> this

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
then from now on when we break this

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.180 
then from now on when we break this
stone<00:03:39.750> block<00:03:40.020> it's<00:03:40.230> going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.560> retract<00:03:40.890> and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
stone block it's going to retract and

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.920 
stone block it's going to retract and
it's<00:03:41.640> going<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.850> create<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.150> new<00:03:42.239> one<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.660> for

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
it's going to create a new one just for

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.140 
it's going to create a new one just for
us<00:03:43.050> now<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:43.680> far<00:03:43.860> as<00:03:44.010> taking<00:03:44.190> an<00:03:44.489> output<00:03:44.850> out<00:03:45.030> of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
us now as far as taking an output out of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.240 
us now as far as taking an output out of
this<00:03:45.239> thing<00:03:45.480> I'd<00:03:45.959> recommend<00:03:46.440> taking<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:47.040> from

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
this thing I'd recommend taking it from

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.420 
this thing I'd recommend taking it from
when<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:48.060> redstone<00:03:48.540> block<00:03:48.900> comes<00:03:49.140> down<00:03:49.470> so

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
when this redstone block comes down so

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.949 
when this redstone block comes down so
when<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.880> comes<00:03:51.060> down<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.450> will<00:03:51.570> power<00:03:51.780> that

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
when it comes down it will power that

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.570 
when it comes down it will power that
redstone<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.950> can<00:03:53.100> lead<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.400> wherever

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
redstone and you can lead that wherever

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.050 
redstone and you can lead that wherever
you<00:03:53.850> want<00:03:54.140> as<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.320> can<00:03:55.410> see<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.340> now
