 Frank tell me how the team prepared 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.389
 to play in Astrakhan in Samara until the weather 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.099
 frosty there plus good 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.529
 temperatures are expected to finally be good 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.529

 felder tempera chonsokom punch 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.579
 I think that all circumstances 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.290
 weather field and so on this is not an excuse 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.320
 catching on all adaptive you are flexible 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.450
 thin he senses 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 players must adapt must 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:56.850
 be able to play any 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:01:00.000
 circumstances , ventures ps2 throw 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.049

 boulevard all suites de thong beach 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.510
 preparation was positive normal 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.750
 besides the fact that some players we 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.540
 lost due to injury and some players 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.920
 Unfortunately they can not be there for example 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.110
 ram gabul 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.240
 due to injuries they cannot fully 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.020
 to train this is somewhat ours 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 preparation of course out of temptation 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.070
 room with both cries cause in brussels 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.110
 here are the tanks here than 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.159
 however on the other hand we got 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.420
 back bruno 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.140
 he is again in the ninja steel team 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.390
 opportunism pick up a good god therefore 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.689
 it gives us more opportunities to choose 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.759
 a good team maybe more 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.680
 for the press is a signboard rather than for a trainer 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.380
 in preparation but two will meet 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.539
 football players who played in the final hit 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.659
 In the expanded list team Russia 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.060
 this very rarely happens the first time 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.009
 Backgammon is also something to us players 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.009
 may affect add charm and 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.569
 onegin flows away yes but maybe not 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.970
 Of course, but it's not like 2 players one 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.269
 against another trailer to vote in game and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.910
 company team this part of the command 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.930
 Game shave collective competition in 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.340
 every grandfathers analysis failure is not easy 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.860
 they start to begin to populate it lte 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.450
 but also it is good that fnl 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.489
 delivers players for national teams for 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.989
 players who can play national teams for 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.060
 me two or eibl 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.209
 michael with beta it means that we 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.610
 can players make better lipids 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.860
 incandessence for da Vinci and kicking water 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.200
 on their cheeks and prepare them up to such 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.920
 states that they are suitable even for 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.690
 national team and not only we have 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.220
 loss of Petrovich due to busting yellow 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.879
 cards will not play the Astrakhan team 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.950
 It is believed that this is one of the key 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.620
 opponent players 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:20.000
 how much can this be an important factor 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.460
 this business is also here 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.770
 Of course it is on the one hand for a long time with 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.680
 the other side and xyzware panin 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.710
 Amnona will come running legends without you 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.600
 not an excuse I am also not pleased because 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.540
 I would like to play against the best 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.480
 teams everlast knight filed unison 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.910
 games I'm 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.580
 the last send weaned though he and 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.470
 important player but he didn't start in 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.540
 starting lineup so they too 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.330
 there are many different possibilities 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.320
 removing the bottomless rabbit after all rajda 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.880
 by could easily 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.709
 Well, of course it changes something because 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.110
 we always take into account those 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.290
 the good qualities that he has in 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.590
 risen 2 to life d but not because his 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.310
 no give you looked out 0 will be over 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.930
 idle at all this week 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.610
 unexpectedly appeared enough 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.070
 statements of your colleagues in the press 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.810
 some yes about the game of wings 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.180
 tips 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.970
 leave even brackets in principle 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:33.650
 moral part of things like that you read 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:37.250
 is this and what do you think about it 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.440
 this minute until at first I have such things not 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.320
 reading in general there is little to read since 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:47.750
 they are not counting what is worth losing my 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.940
 energy responds to this on a business trip 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.210
 because others certainly come and 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.580
 tell me but mana one garden string 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.430
 bass dance usually on such things 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.030
 you answer with silence the new man himself 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.900
 considered in our language in our language 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.850
 there is definitely one sustainable 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.760
 expressions that I would not like to say 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.610
 here you are a biscuit that we speak 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.810
 about these these comments cheap 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.070
 I would just be the only way to air 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.950
 no teams will 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.960
 what am i if i have a fireplace if u 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.229
 I have a comment from others and why 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.660
 not given I do not 100 for it when it 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.270
 I will not express such an opinion 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.850
 mikrotik no criticism is donna 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:39.050
 set up a fact if i don't know real 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.300
 facts for insights then the task which 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.300
 was stood inside this team and 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.580
 formation camp but tonda trailing if 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.100
 i'm not on the field if i'm not on three notes not 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.670
 We train not in the dressing room but 3d tactic 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.820

 someone else their gay baku team 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.520
 field but when surges loop to this 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.380
 you can comment like that 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.570
 comment on the people you are 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.290

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.600

 shine throw out your salon the easy way and 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.180

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.090
 and watch tv and there 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.740
 chatting about something shrunk my second 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.040
 and we have been building people for a very long time 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.930
 then itâ€™s mostly emotions 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:35.840
 disappointed people but up to eight love 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:39.710
 power is not a big full of times when they 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:43.310
 not the most say not with the best 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.130
 intentions are always given by collision 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.860
 of the therefore meaning a lot of time 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.490

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.640
 we need to improve 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.030
 rattle but finally dance you are 2 and 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.700

 with all due respect how to do the analysis and to 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.300
 other comments made it of 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.980
