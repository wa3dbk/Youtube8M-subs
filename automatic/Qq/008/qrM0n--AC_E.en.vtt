00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.110
 He can only follow a new one 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.599
 topmodel talk here at Bunte.de today 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.370
 with us the guest Dominique the third 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.019
 the seventh season has become 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.449
 nice that you are with us hello 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.670
 be received 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.140
 very nice of you , too , I would 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.369
 Of course you like knowing you were at the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.920
 Look, you know exactly what they do 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.510
 takes place and yesterday in the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.340
 broadcast was already so on now 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.470
 the first blasphemy is fraternizing 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.320
 some people become one with another 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.330
 outsider titled how is it when there 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.450
 so many girls together 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.660
 how fast are there such 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.300
 dynamics 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.680
 So I think that's like everyone else 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.140
 given to other girls 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.000
 that's 16 girls on a pile and 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.220
 then it's already pre-programmed 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.930
 Tiny war but so I find in 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.150
 TV is always completely different 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.610
 So you do not know the prehistory 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.620
 what's still all happened so yes 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.270
 I do not think that girl just because 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.240
 the chocolate now she was yesterday 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.530
 So the war breaks out, the so zicken 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.140
 I do not think it has to be there anyway 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.790
 something had happened before 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.380
 maybe not been shown though 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.880
 do you mean the knowledge of the production 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.140
 so a bit forced so how 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.790
 it's far with you that you say okay 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.760
 now talking again so the chocolate 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.100
 because that was not really bad 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.000
 really so i have to say where you are 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.190
 actually everything really 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.440
 So, behind the scenes, a little bit 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.450
 our real emotions that's what 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.980
 we say how do you estimate that a dredger 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.260
 - next topmodel can be a real one 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.580
 Friendships develop friendship 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.120
 people really at germany's next 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.270
 topmodel 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.730
 I am also so with the sarah net 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.580
 So we have at the beginning where we are 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.840
 got to know because it was more so ok 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.680
 I think so, come on, I gave it that way 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.790
 rightly so and in the end as were 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.260
 thickest friends still have 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.900
 contact we even have a group 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.610
 men germany's next top model first 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.130
 all because her legs and when we both 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.230
 then there is the sarah coupÃ©s with beef 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.960
 the lisa the laura 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.630
 the inga is still spinning and the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.030
 luisa what is being discussed so 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.580
 So, for example, yesterday went the whole 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.050
 baby baby baby also looks at grad 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.160
 germany's next topmodel and you have 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.590
 but now I miss her 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.900
 old times what you now in the last 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.370
 consequence was announced sport program so it 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.020
 the diet was again under the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.550
 It took a lot of sports 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.650
 made what what was that so with you 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.570
 heidi also considers something like that 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.770
 that is eaten just healthy that the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.580
 people move properly 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.890
 ok so as extreme as it is now in the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.380
 show it was not with us 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.820
 so it was honest so we got it 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.860
 many mails as well as with us to be able to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.130
 because whenever we had filmed 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.650
 already in the morning and a caravan 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.130
 open up you could be ex and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.590
 banks over bagels with cream cheese or 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.620
 Chocolate is in it but it is not 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.700
 model s p so there were also fruits and has 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.310
 About no and then at noon there was stop 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.810
 always exist for 70 man 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.180
 and it was really a whole lot 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.090
 one way or so and there and there 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.810
 time everything but I have read and that 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.270
 I wanted to ask if it at all 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.280
 Is that true that you are somehow ten kilos for 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.050
 the show has taken off that he agrees 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.870
 Is she right because I have more 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.610
 weighed so I was normal so 64 kilo 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.390
 I weighed as a pig had 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.190
 a bit wicki and then you can 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.989
 Get better with me and said you 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.540
 why do you sign up for germany's next 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.950
 Topmodel to God as I look 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.290
 I'm not mine but I have 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.880
 so google what is on the internet and then 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.440
 do you have model to six kilo of the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.180
 war definitely called a whole 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.489
 other topics that dealt with tasks yesterday 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.440
 was that somehow the girls yes all 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.850
 clearly under extreme pressure 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.830
 everybody wants to win and then this one is 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.800
 competition there and then 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.510
 somehow 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.940
 was written about that they even 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.170
 have considered several home 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.780
 drive because just not anymore 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.400
 Do not pack anymore and think you are there 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.590
 then she definitely says that's it 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.130
 definitely too much for me 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.110
 So I also find Germany's next 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.270
 go topmodel 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.700
 So I think I am me personally 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.170
 I was also one of the oldest I was 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.019
 16 is too young 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.620
 I think it's better from 18 because then 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.000
 at 16 o'clock in the school and then must 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.650
 Maybe one year out of school 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.500
 go out and that is then repeat 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.270
 and you 're not so tight at all 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.590
 Life knows what you really do 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.090
 and select zeller I think only rough 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.590
 with 18 already a bit further 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.120
 do you think heidi would be so 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.740
 okay because she always says so 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.390
 Of course, the younger the girls are 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:47.670
 the sooner you can somehow still 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.670
 yes, you can shape them beautifully 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.750
 of course, that's right 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.580
 you can also educate them a bit 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.230
 the children with 16 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.760
 but you can also be an 18 year old 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.169
 stocks now comes for what 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:08.530
 our self-confidence you have like you 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:11.560
 so domini is about to occur 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.410
 calls for rule change in Topmodel from 18 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.260
 Blach are think we better come 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.660
 to the very last question with yes 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.060
 which we always ask, namely who is 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.110
 run away your favorite wins this 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.960
 year germany's next topmodel 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.900

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.940
 is mother young mother and you are 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.950
 just so sympathetic and I think so 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.150
 direct thing she calls my is almost 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.700
 all right 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.669
