00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.030
 before disembarking in high araguaia in the factory of concrete sleepers that 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.099
 are used for the construction of railroad rails 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.840
 with the helicopter, the railway stretches over three 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.980
 cities of haiti quiet and high araguaia in the interior of the state of mato grosso 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.920
 Sergio Silva da Silva accompanied by the directors of the 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.560
 land transport 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.569
 and directors of latin america logistics 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.129
 that the railway company responsible for the 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.510
 prolongation of the tracks that it brings to very good memory I see that the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 work is in a good rhythm 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.230
 leaves with enough advance the call 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.430
 we are working on the prospect that 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.290
 we will still have 2011 as a year of much activity 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.580
 and is surely 2002 in the garden with this railway - in 60 kilometers 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.940
 made known the collision structures manufactured the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.440
 concrete sleepers 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.140
 that took the rails of the ferronorte to the city of rondonópolis to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.740
 factory produces about $ 600 per day 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.190
 more than 700 employees will work for workers and 23 3 and wagons that 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.310
 this is very important - they are 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.510
 Speaking 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.950
 of Brazilian state prosperous state of the river 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.840
 the state that has an expressive agricultural production 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.400
 needs highlighted 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.640
 of a mode of transport 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.729
 of poor and able to carry great efforts I think it is a moment 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.780
 the rail sector as a whole I think I will see 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.840
 very intense that in the railroad segment 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.000
 According to this history, I have long accepted this vision to adopt 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.740
 I think the coming of the minister is that I think it's a question of collaboration. 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.860
 strong demand from the Greek government to violate the eyes of the railway sector 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.100
 who had the idea says as being a very positive thing of the sector the lines 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.640
 of trains that connect the thicket to the port of santos 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.920
 in the state of são paulo from the terminals of high araguaia and high 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.020
 taquari 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.380
 in the south of the state 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.500
 the railway network that reaches rondonópolis has about 250 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.739
 kilometers 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.410
 according to the national land transport agency 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.050
 more than two thousand trucks loaded with grain will 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.790
 highway that allows 3-4 every day 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.190
 when the works of the ferronorte are ready the trucks starts to make the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.190
 role where they are competitive than others by short distance 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.519
 transport over long distances to be done 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.710
 finally the day 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.900
 this generates a gain for the productive sector that has a cost transportation 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.149
 cheaper 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.749
 and generates a gain for a society as a whole because it took away the pressure 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:54.519
 of roads creates more safety on the inland lorries 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.569
 despite the circulation not rest of the world according to the Minister the works 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.080
 in the section between cuiabá 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.440
 can bring advancements to the transport of passengers but today we will see the flames 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.649
 He is the one who taught class together. 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.649
 the state government 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:20.629
 in fact and the last cooperation agreement at the expense of mato grosso 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.629
 which will promote important fundamental studies 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.599
 is that the attractiveness of the key is linked leading the highs until cuiabá 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.009
 It's obvious that when we're talking 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.839
 in construction of new segments the exploitation that is thought 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.609
 transport but also passenger transport 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.329
 it is perfectly reasonable to think that in the scope of this study 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.089
 there is nothing on the list 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.089
 is considered the possibility of the use 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.769
 in passenger transport the state government should invest about 5 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:55.870
 millions of reais 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.500
 study in the area that will receive the rails from the city of rondonópolis to the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.479
 Brazil's capital city is far behind in terms of 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.559
 to the rail transport of persons 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.409
 it's just ours to check in the united states and across europe 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.900
 rail transport is used very heavily in the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.629
 linking cities even between regions and between countries 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:25.089
 we are a country with a continental dimension in that it 

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:26.270
 advanced 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.379
 in the construction of modern railways 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:30.779
 No doubt 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.179
 the possibility of utilization 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.259
 is that for the transportation of passengers of high araguaia the minister followed of 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.690
 helicopter to the capital cuiabá 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.750
 where he signed a cooperation agreement with the state government 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.440
 for the extension of the rails of the ferronorte
