00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.059
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.700
 Another small video of me 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.490
 theme cars 2 today i want you guys 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.210
 the number 41 is the galloping ghost rider 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.550
 imagine 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.439
 Mattel obviously has in Germany 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.770
 currently slight delivery problems 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.630
 as far as the three cast series are concerned 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.300
 the newer models is in germany 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 really difficult to get 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.449
 Nevertheless, I caught one 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.890
 and I'll relax now 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.940
 and then we take a closer look 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.839
 and here's a quick look at 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.839
 the back of the packaging 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.990
 so the model is now without times 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.320
 Packaging the model is in scale 1 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:02.450
 55 is made of metal and plastic and 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.980
 the manufacturer's mattel doping here 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.440
 brender is by far the distance 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.790
 most beautiful model from the second part 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.140
 already travel are the first time 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.880
 I saw myself in the movie 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.850
 if that would come out as a model that 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.400
 would be cool for processing 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.350
 There are many small parts in it as well 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.150
 example a small shovel one 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.560
 small hedge and of course the latte you 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
 were individually in the packaging the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.000
 take out camera one by one and that must 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.580
 it's hard to hang on to it now 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.869
 I can, for example, the shovel and 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.350
 do the little pick in 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:43.340
 However , the ones on the side could meet 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.950
 I still hang the lanterns with ours 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.460
 friend what you in the dark 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.869
 So it's really a really cool model 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.270
 he also has other wheels special 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.789
 Wheels have seen the movie knows that 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.600
 rails are driven are the devices 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.299
 free to move but also still 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:07.159

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:10.940

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.440

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.200

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.220

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.599

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.870
