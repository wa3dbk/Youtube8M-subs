00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.370
 rock 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.330
 playing andor 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.610
 filed 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.789
 lanús the second 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.769
 a game for one and up to five players of seven more years 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.970
 and with an approximate duration 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.400
 45 minutes 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.079
 the material is the next one is played inside the box 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.109
 and we see that here we have treasures perroncel second in each quadrant 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.810
 we must place a single treasure 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.169
 thereafter 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.410
 we take these 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 plastic pyramids and let's cover the board 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.290
 in this way we put all the pyramids that come inside the box 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.490
 once we finish placing all these pyramids 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.630
 we will see the following 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.370
 that there is an empty space 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.640
 consumption is then that will give us the ability to slide well 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.050
 the pyramids for both of us that our eyes 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.570
 we also have these cards the cards come numbered from the 1 altars 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.640
 they stir but they must be from 1 to 3 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.490
 once this is done what the first elbows do, uncover the first and we see that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.680
 he asks us to find the sphinx 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 at this moment the totora game of looking for that treasure 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.610
 as he does it good he will slide the pyramids in this way and while not 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 find a treasure or and in that case and found a treasure 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.060
 but it's not the sphinx let's see this is the potomac type 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.600
 then that player loses his turn and the next player is the one who 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.980
 will try to locate you fingen 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.820
 after doing the number movements that need to be but here yes 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.240
 found them zinc 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.460
 then a person or that game wins the card and receives a point 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.270
 there is indicated the points that each of them is worth 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.250
 so they continue now there are several special cards we are going to show a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.940
 of them in is well and ready a strong sir 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.910
 a strong thing that happens will allow us to make this type of movement 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.510
 where we can of the cis arms of one pyramid at a time 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.660
 we flipped the card to see what treasures we are looking for is a pact 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.529
 rock 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.590
 we can all be 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.200
 three movements moving the number of pyramids that I want and the rule is 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.560
 they keep without driver just ends myth here found a treasure and 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.120
 look 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.129
 just the pope then that malaga million adn card to give three points 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.989
 how the card marks 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.189
 so they're going to continue let's see what other special card there is this one 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.749
 in which they show us the station of a scorpion here the dynamics change 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:41.439
 Each one of us navigates the movement of a single stone, measuring each one just 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.449
 the movements 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.359
 that 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.879
 player who finds 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.559
 a treasure what is going to happen is that he receives the sting of the scorpion and 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.659
 will lose one of the cards that he had already won 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.359
 by last 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.729
 we are going to look for it ortemán card that is this one has a cyclone or a 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.739
 whirlwind when this sidewalk comes out tour moment of the board and continue 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.099
 with the young way rules 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.619
 is that young ramses second 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:11.229
