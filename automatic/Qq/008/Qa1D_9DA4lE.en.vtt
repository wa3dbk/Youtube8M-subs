there okay put it all through to the
other<00:03:50.060> side

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:04.040 

place<00:03:56.480> my<00:03:56.660> gusset<00:03:57.080> on<00:03:57.200> top<00:03:58.270> pin<00:03:59.270> it

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.720 

and<00:04:04.910> another<00:04:05.910> pin

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.330 

okay<00:04:08.909> so<00:04:09.750> let's<00:04:10.140> have<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.349> look<00:04:10.560> at<00:04:10.769> this<00:04:11.010> and

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
okay so let's have a look at this and

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.910 
okay so let's have a look at this and
what<00:04:11.819> that<00:04:11.879> does<00:04:12.300> here<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:13.110> can<00:04:13.319> see<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.739> it

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
what that does here you can see it it

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.020 
what that does here you can see it it
would<00:04:14.129> case<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:14.940> perfectly<00:04:15.930> like<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.380> so

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
would case it in perfectly like that so

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.020 
would case it in perfectly like that so
again<00:04:18.030> let's<00:04:18.570> have<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> close<00:04:19.079> look<00:04:19.430> where<00:04:20.430> they

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
again let's have a close look where they

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.650 
again let's have a close look where they
are<00:04:21.169> basically<00:04:22.310> turn<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.790> through<00:04:24.419> that

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
are basically turn it through that

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:36.250 
are basically turn it through that
little<00:04:24.840> gap<00:04:26.030> stitch<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.449> it's<00:04:28.139> done

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.580 

oil<00:04:37.190> case<00:04:37.430> 10<00:04:37.730> or<00:04:37.940> lovely<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:38.870> while<00:04:39.080> I'm<00:04:39.260> here

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
oil case 10 or lovely and while I'm here

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.830 
oil case 10 or lovely and while I'm here
so<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:40.670> can't<00:04:41.000> go<00:04:41.210> anywhere<00:04:41.600> when<00:04:41.720> I'm

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
so that this can't go anywhere when I'm

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.150 
so that this can't go anywhere when I'm
sewing<00:04:42.170> I'm<00:04:42.950> going<00:04:43.430> to<00:04:47.050> big<00:04:48.050> stitch<00:04:48.380> I'm<00:04:49.100> going

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
sewing I'm going to big stitch I'm going

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.470 
sewing I'm going to big stitch I'm going
to<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.550> can<00:04:52.820> trim<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.330> edge<00:04:53.480> off<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.240> do

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
to and I can trim the edge off so you do

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:09.400 
to and I can trim the edge off so you do
that<00:04:56.630> on<00:04:56.810> both<00:04:56.990> sides<00:05:03.670> side<00:05:04.670> seams<00:05:07.750> quickly<00:05:08.750> so

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
that on both sides side seams quickly so

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.770 
that on both sides side seams quickly so
this<00:05:09.680> with<00:05:09.920> a<00:05:09.950> centimeter<00:05:10.640> silver<00:05:11.420> bow<00:05:11.540> once

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
again if you've got an overlocker

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.250 
again if you've got an overlocker
you<00:05:16.010> can<00:05:16.220> just<00:05:16.460> go<00:05:16.670> over<00:05:16.910> that<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.450> in<00:05:17.660> America

of practice need to go again to your
triple<00:05:30.020> zig-zag<00:05:30.590> stitch<00:05:30.850> I'm<00:05:31.850> on<00:05:32.150> 5'4<00:05:32.810> on<00:05:32.930> my

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
triple zig-zag stitch I'm on 5'4 on my

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.930 
triple zig-zag stitch I'm on 5'4 on my
faff<00:05:33.410> so<00:05:33.710> if<00:05:33.800> you've<00:05:33.950> got<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.310> same<00:05:34.520> machine

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
faff so if you've got the same machine

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.890 
faff so if you've got the same machine
it's<00:05:35.240> 5<00:05:35.570> and<00:05:35.960> stitch<00:05:36.230> length<00:05:36.560> is<00:05:36.950> just<00:05:37.940> under

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
it's 5 and stitch length is just under

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.100 
it's 5 and stitch length is just under
three<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:39.730> you<00:05:40.730> fold<00:05:41.030> that<00:05:41.120> over<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.810> now<00:05:42.050> the

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
three and you fold that over and now the

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.100 
three and you fold that over and now the
trick<00:05:42.590> is<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:43.130> mind<00:05:43.910> for<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.300> probably

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
trick is to mind for that probably

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.020 
trick is to mind for that probably
lasting<00:05:45.590> of<00:05:45.680> it<00:05:45.800> don't<00:05:46.280> pull<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.580> too<00:05:46.700> much

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
lasting of it don't pull it too much

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.000 
lasting of it don't pull it too much
because<00:05:47.330> it's<00:05:47.690> already<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:48.110> Jersey<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.830> it's

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
because it's already a Jersey and it's

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.930 
because it's already a Jersey and it's
elasticated<00:05:49.670> anyway<00:05:50.450> so<00:05:51.260> a<00:05:51.320> little<00:05:51.470> bit<00:05:51.940> make

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
elasticated anyway so a little bit make

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.450 
elasticated anyway so a little bit make
sure<00:05:53.210> that<00:05:53.390> you've<00:05:53.600> got<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:54.080> scallop<00:05:54.460> just

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
sure that you've got the scallop just

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.450 
sure that you've got the scallop just
right<00:05:55.700> on<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:55.970> edge<00:05:56.330> of<00:05:56.600> the<00:05:56.750> fabric<00:05:57.070> here<00:05:58.070> and

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
right on the edge of the fabric here and

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.960 
right on the edge of the fabric here and
then<00:05:59.300> take<00:06:00.140> one<00:06:00.410> hand<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.890> the<00:06:01.010> back<00:06:01.390> and<00:06:03.940> sew<00:06:04.940> a

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
then take one hand to the back and sew a

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.080 
then take one hand to the back and sew a
little<00:06:05.180> bit<00:06:05.860> turn<00:06:06.860> your<00:06:07.040> fabric<00:06:07.220> over<00:06:07.610> again

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
little bit turn your fabric over again

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.200 
little bit turn your fabric over again
stretch<00:06:08.660> it<00:06:08.840> a<00:06:08.900> little<00:06:08.930> bit<00:06:12.400> next<00:06:13.400> the

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
stretch it a little bit next the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.600 
stretch it a little bit next the
important<00:06:14.840> thing<00:06:15.080> this<00:06:15.320> is<00:06:15.500> vital<00:06:16.040> actually

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
important thing this is vital actually

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.440 
important thing this is vital actually
is<00:06:16.850> that<00:06:17.420> the<00:06:17.600> needle<00:06:18.050> is<00:06:18.230> done<00:06:18.620> when<00:06:18.920> you<00:06:19.010> go

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
is that the needle is done when you go

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.360 
is that the needle is done when you go
the<00:06:19.540> next<00:06:19.870> step<00:06:20.140> sorry<00:06:20.410> we're<00:06:21.010> not<00:06:21.040> doing<00:06:21.520> it

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
the next step sorry we're not doing it

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.000 
the next step sorry we're not doing it
and<00:06:24.370> you<00:06:24.760> can<00:06:24.940> see<00:06:25.210> here<00:06:25.540> how<00:06:25.840> prettied<00:06:26.410> up<00:06:26.530> is

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
and you can see here how prettied up is

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.250 
and you can see here how prettied up is
already<00:06:27.190> becoming<00:06:29.910> so<00:06:30.910> I've<00:06:31.210> done<00:06:31.480> both<00:06:31.840> legs

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
already becoming so I've done both legs

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.470 
already becoming so I've done both legs
and<00:06:32.650> I'm<00:06:32.920> now<00:06:33.130> going<00:06:33.160> to<00:06:33.550> do<00:06:33.790> the<00:06:34.030> top<00:06:35.760> no<00:06:36.760> turn

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
and I'm now going to do the top no turn

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:47.910 
and I'm now going to do the top no turn
it<00:06:37.510> again<00:06:40.350> and<00:06:41.350> stretch<00:06:43.830> too<00:06:44.830> tight<00:06:46.920> basically

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
it again and stretch too tight basically

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.730 
it again and stretch too tight basically
you<00:06:48.370> can<00:06:48.580> do<00:06:48.730> the<00:06:49.420> side<00:06:49.720> as<00:06:49.960> we<00:06:50.110> did<00:06:50.320> on<00:06:50.680> the

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
you can do the side as we did on the

00:06:50.740 --> 00:07:38.129 
you can do the side as we did on the
lower<00:06:51.520> part<00:06:51.940> of<00:06:52.090> the<00:06:52.150> nikah

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:38.139
