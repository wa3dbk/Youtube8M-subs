towards the root base so we'll need to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.059 
towards the root base so we'll need to
start<00:00:50.429> by<00:00:50.940> putting<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.569> few<00:00:51.899> general<00:00:52.530> wide

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:53.069

start by putting in a few general wide
sweeping<00:00:53.879> motions<00:00:54.329> into<00:00:54.929> this<00:00:55.050> hair<00:00:57.469> that's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
sweeping motions into this hair that's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.559 
sweeping motions into this hair that's
going<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:58.859> push<00:00:59.159> some<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.609> those<00:00:59.699> ends<00:01:00.149> closer

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
going to push some of those ends closer

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.889 
going to push some of those ends closer
towards<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:01.109> root<00:01:01.260> base<00:01:01.879> from<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.179> we<00:01:03.690> can

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
towards your root base from there we can

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
towards your root base from there we can
start<00:01:04.140> making<00:01:04.350> tighter<00:01:04.949> back<00:01:05.460> combing

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
start making tighter back combing

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.250 
start making tighter back combing
motions<00:01:07.970> we're<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.240> several<00:01:09.750> passes

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
motions we're going to do several passes

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:20.310

down<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> entire<00:01:11.430> length<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.600> hair

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
as you back home your passes will get

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.980 
as you back home your passes will get
tighter<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.430> tighter<00:01:24.729> which<00:01:25.510> means<00:01:25.750> that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
tighter and tighter which means that

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:41.429 
tighter and tighter which means that
with<00:01:26.229> each<00:01:26.500> pass<00:01:26.890> your<00:01:27.550> comb<00:01:27.850> will<00:01:28.030> move<00:01:28.210> less

dread it's supposed to be in so base
binding<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.629> incredibly<00:02:11.200> important

I<00:02:12.900> recommend<00:02:13.900> thread<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:14.829> this<00:02:14.920> process<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
I recommend thread for this process and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.280 
I recommend thread for this process and
not<00:02:15.790> rubber<00:02:16.090> bands<00:02:16.329> and<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.750> reason<00:02:17.079> why<00:02:17.230> is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
not rubber bands and the reason why is

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.350 
not rubber bands and the reason why is
because<00:02:17.500> rubber<00:02:17.980> bands<00:02:18.250> will<00:02:18.579> pull<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.180> those

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
because rubber bands will pull on those

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.330 
because rubber bands will pull on those
finer<00:02:19.629> hairs<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.170> cause<00:02:20.590> irritation
