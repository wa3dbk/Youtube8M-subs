00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.860
 hello friends with you tiberian 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.540
 this is the 35th edition of the master category for all 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.520
 the tanks heading in which i'm trying 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 get a sign la tackle master on 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.720
 technique whose name you specify in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 comments today we'll talk again 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.210
 about British medium tanks and this one 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.640
 it will be a centurion 71 estechka 9 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.380
 level this is an interesting and unusual tank 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.690
 you have been asking him for a long time 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 video so today we will deal with it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.710
 to start with as usual a portion of technical 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.329
 characteristics and then we discuss the fight in 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.040
 which I managed to get a mark 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.530
 klassnost master so to begin 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 let's discuss the dynamics of centurions she 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.100
 good tank quickly gaining its 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 maximum speed which is 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.329
 40 kilometers per hour and can it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.980
 Maintain mainly this maximum speed 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.680
 quite enough to change direction 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.360
 or return to base defense but here 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.239
 quickly take some key position 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.280
 like for example does 54 you have to 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.270
 Unfortunately it will not work not high 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.890
 maximum speed 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.080
 this feature is high level 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.000
 British medium tanks and get used to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.820
 no need since the centurion of the eighth 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 level as for booking thats it 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.479
 can hardly be called good 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.759
 armored medium tank though something 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.409
 what armor does the top have 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.990
 armor sheet 120 millimeters thick 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.450
 allows you to repel shells tanks here 7 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.580
 and 8 levels if you successfully tuck 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.130
 the body copes with this task and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.930
 a tower in the forehead of which is 150 millimeters but 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.270
 don't get too carried away because even 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.939
 tanks of the eighth level punches her through 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 times if the valdai tower can take 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.799
 shells without damage then tank overboard 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.899
 I donâ€™t recommend Centurion because 50 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.909
 millimeters in the sides and 6 millimeter 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.130
 the screen is unlikely to save you from getting 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.530
 damage and also this tank has 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.329
 unpleasant feature these are frequent crises 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.820
 warheads which are not only possible 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.329
 when breaking into the side but also when breaking through 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.759
 nld 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.229
 talk further about the gun she has 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.880
 very good breakthrough base 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.369
 piercing projectile which 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.920
 is almost 270 millimeters at 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.040
 different 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.540
 they are 390 units excellent accuracy scatter 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.640
 on 100 meters 032 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.860
 and comfortable time information two whole 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.959
 three tenths of a second but this gun 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.209
 no premium shells that have 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.489
 increased breakthrough instead of them here so 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.120
 called hash bombs which breaks through 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.190
 210 millimeters on average cause 480 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.819
 units of damage and rate of fire in general 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.830
 sadly 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.110
 initially guns makes only five 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.690
 shots per minute with a full body kit 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.209
 from the fraud pudding rammer and 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.340
 ventilation tool recharged 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.959
 in about 9 half seconds but 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.290
 very pleased with the corners of the vertical guidance 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.390
 which is 10 degrees down and 18 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.610
 degrees up in general for comfort 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.769
 firing guns and very good shells 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.930
 fly fast the accuracy is excellent like 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.640
 angles of focus but dpm 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.610
 very, very lacking 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.799
 any other medium tank 9 level 11 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.019
 most likely will shoot you therefore 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.180
 be careful and try once again 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.250
 do not get involved in a duel with classmates 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.040
 Well, in conclusion, we should mention about 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.989
 overview which is 410 meters straight 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.900
 like patton is the best 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.220
 an indicator among all pawns of level 9 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.620
 so you can safely put 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.019
 enlightened optics and more efficiently 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.970
 detect opponents and so about 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.980
 characteristics I talked a bit and 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.690
 now let's move battle in which 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.549
 I managed to get a mark of class 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.100
 the master happened so he was the first 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.660
 on the bill and after that I skated still 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.940
 with a dozen fights to better 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.290
 get acquainted with the tank took place this fight 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.299
 on the map hidden village 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.549
 and since he was the first I was 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.130
 in the topic and in the present except 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.200
 me and enemy m103 more nines in 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.519
 This battle was not so you can already 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.370
 write in the comments what a fight 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.170
 uninteresting dozens not necessary 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.569
 let the corner shoot and generally tiberian 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.159
 bad and the masters give him for free well 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.260
 and while you do your favorite 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.090
 in deed I will say a few words about my 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.370
 actions in this battle to start 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.920
 since i'm playing on a medium tank i decided 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.930
 go to town and try your luck there in 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.879
 this battle except me and artillery were 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.129
 some heavy tanks therefore act 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.930
 it was necessary to first carefully took 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.120
 position that allows you to enlighten 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.610
 entrance of enemy tanks in this case 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.140
 these were two 50100 and one of them is not 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.629
 even managed to shoot 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.489
 my ally on the same French apparently 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.820
 decided to meet his brothers face to 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.949
 to face 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.560
 probably therefore did not react to 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.020
 calls to drive away and waited until 2 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.940
 drummer blow it out take in such 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.889
 situations when he is opposed to words 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.260
 armored opponents for example the same 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.720
 the French can and probably need 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.490
 use those same hash bombs they 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.010
 allow you to do more damage but 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.320
 often behave very unpredictably 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.090
 therefore, they should not be abused 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.400
 just in case I will remind you that land mines 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.380
 burst on caterpillars and all kinds 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.570
 screens and at the same time put quite 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.849
 small amount of damage but in general 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.620
 saying these hash bombs is pretty controversial 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.870
 a thing some players say they are 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.300
 virtually useless and others see in 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.370
 They are a great way to raise dpm 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.470
 I personally think that the ideal option 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.979
 there will be a combination of different types 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.720
 shells 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.300
 that is, no need to completely refuse 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.789
 from hashes to carry things on the 22nd 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.099
 the size of the ammunition it allows and 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.260
 need to use them oh well 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.060
 enough about these land mines and while the fight 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.840
 coming to the end let me let you down 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.820
 small result 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.770
 under the centurion as a whole it is very 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.690
 interesting medium tank to him need 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.449
 get used to and it has two features 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.410
 low maximum speed and gun 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.419
 which does not have 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.970
 he has the missiles and recharges 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.070
 long enough it means playing on 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.680
 this british probably will not work 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.539
 1 hold key positions and efficiently 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.669
 shoot with enemy st 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.199
 but the centurion cannon allows 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.900
 play from relief and maintain 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.060
 allies with medium and long range 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.969
 Of course, if you wish, you can attack 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.679
 go but don't forget what you need 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.839
 enlist the support of allies and 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:53.239
 try to choose a position where on 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:55.669
 recharge time you can hide from 

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:57.559
 enemy fire also remind you that 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.299
 tank's very good overview and when 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:01.549
 need he can effectively 

00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:04.009
 shine for allies in general I consider 

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:06.349
 that centurion 71 is quite interesting 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.689
 medium tank level 9 he is not a little 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.819
 similar to the rest of hash land mines attached 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:11.899
 he has his zest and I recommend it to everyone 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.539
 to try 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:16.549
 this briton is on this for today 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.209
 Thank you all for your attention with you 

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:18.319
 tiberian 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:20.869
 do not forget to write in the comments 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:23.209
 the name of the tank you want me to 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:25.189
 took the master subscribe to the channel here 

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:27.649
 fan and don't forget to look into my 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.699
 channel strong armor precision weapons you 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:30.699
 to new meetings
