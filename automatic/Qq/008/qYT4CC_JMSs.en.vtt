here<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.570> Nikita's<00:00:13.200> new<00:00:13.380> lithium

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
here we have Nikita's new lithium

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.220 
here we have Nikita's new lithium
batteries<00:00:14.340> they<00:00:14.670> are<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.389> new<00:00:15.599> range<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
batteries they are the new range of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.250 
batteries they are the new range of
batteries<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.490> most<00:00:17.699> modern<00:00:18.119> design<00:00:18.600> that

batteries the most modern design that

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.620 
batteries the most modern design that
the<00:00:19.410> greater<00:00:19.680> bunches<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.279> lithium<00:00:20.760> product

the greater bunches of lithium product

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.650 
the greater bunches of lithium product
is<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.369> whatever<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.550> put<00:00:23.789> into<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.210> lithium

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
is that whatever you put into a lithium

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.920 
is that whatever you put into a lithium
