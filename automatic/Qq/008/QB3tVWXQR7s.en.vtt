00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:09.809
 welcome friends to this finally 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:13.019
 htc one unboxing this phone is 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 It was a torture birth and I don't know how 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.369
 other to describe it to describe the thing 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.140
 then I have to beat it here it is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.330
 the package we are there are a little bit 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.039
 so excited for obvious reasons 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.570
 I want to make a very short video because 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.910
 I want to load it on the fly 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.579
 so now we're going to proceed immediately 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.649
 opening an important thing this 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.320
 phone has already been opened because the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.500
 seller had already opened to try it 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.289
 we hope we hope he doesn't 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.920
 used in a strange way with vibrations 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.829
 etc. etc. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.360
 he immediately intends to open the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.530
 box that obviously is not 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:01.430
 incellophanata and checa busillo sta 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.680
 always among the balls here is the phone and 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.860
 reigning in this position here 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.010
 normally I still discover heaven 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.340
 now apart from the galaxy s iii I had 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.659
 put in place with the boson and nothing 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.680
 we see a package I do not know in what 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.369
 been in everything then we have 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.290
 the caps that are fortunately 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.920
 sealed so he didn't do anything to us 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.450
 not if she slipped into any hole 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.270
 Particular we do as she make up 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.820
 artist so that you focus 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.880
 so and no headphones that now 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.340
 I will go to open with 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:46.009
 very orthodox are marked htc and not 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.380
 are audio beats 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.750
 from what i understand around there are 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.479
 versions with beats headphones 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.820
 audio included and which among other things come 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.030
 sold even at a higher price 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.520
 so sticazzi here we have this rent 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.560
 and htc and i'm very nice i don't know if i am 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.119
 good but aesthetically they are fi 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.860
 have the say the flat cable 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.220
 as a sticazzi of the headphones being 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.489
 German the charger is this here and 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.360
 from the Italian but also European outlet e 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:23.750
 not that English crap this is me 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.489
 reflected in evil 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.380
 and then there's the usb cable that this 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:34.430
 even open guy I will go to 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.989
 reopen which is classic cable with none 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.849
 written htc boh I do not know bell stÃ¬ gran 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.530
 cabbage then there should be the tool 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.049
 to extract the sim 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.880
 here it is the guy I see the excerpt 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:52.519
 in a very gentle manner and a bow 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.440
 oh well anyway the tool is nice and 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.670
 marked htc and oh well it's a bit if I can 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.530
 to break away from this stuff 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.480
 but the fingers, however, this is not there 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.889
 interested we go immediately to see the 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.730
 phone that he put back as if 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:13.250
 if it were new it is not, but it is me 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.709
 now I don't know how comfortable I can't 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.109
 actually see if there are gods 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.560
 defects but it has so to the eye not me not 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.450
 seems like first impression in your hand 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.030
 I hold really well the phone will 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.780
 but I had already tried to turn it on 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.010
 let's see what happens 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.640
 I had already tried it all 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:38.819
 fuck the press event such as ibra 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.860
 book well so let's say know what 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.500
 we speak good or bad because he had had 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.390
 way to prove it I do n't know what it was me 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.090
 left it if it is completely drained 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.940
 this is turning on I don't know the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.930
 charge level and I think we have 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.090
 made a restore 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.409
 so now it is a bit ok both at the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.849
 restore so I guess now me 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.379
 I ask all the things that I do not now 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.450
 I'm going to do because I want to close the 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.359
 video then the htc one 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.190
 finally arrived for those who wanted 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.989
 I don't know where I got it from 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.030
 they tell me they got it on ebay from a guy 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.250
 German I absolutely advise against 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.519
 do this thing I advise you against 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.180
 buy it from some very famous stores 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.660
 because they really made us suffer 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.520
 in an incredible way and if you want 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.560
 buy it wait for the exit 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.419
 Italian or speaking of amazon uk ed 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.830
 amazon italy that even are 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.330
 starting to ship even if the date 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.639
 of exit on 12 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.130
 so now I greet you and began a 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.130
 to finally see the well-deserved phone
