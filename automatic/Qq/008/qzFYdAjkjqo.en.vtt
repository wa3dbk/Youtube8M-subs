there<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:01.970> is<00:05:02.680> advantage<00:05:03.680> arms<00:05:07.840> comes<00:05:08.840> with

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
there it is advantage arms comes with

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.430 
there it is advantage arms comes with
just<00:05:11.800> well<00:05:12.800> like<00:05:13.100> all<00:05:13.310> Glocks<00:05:13.729> are<00:05:14.440> cheap

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
just well like all Glocks are cheap

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.650 
just well like all Glocks are cheap
little<00:05:15.740> plastic<00:05:16.130> sights<00:05:16.430> on<00:05:16.669> them<00:05:16.820> but<00:05:17.389> the
