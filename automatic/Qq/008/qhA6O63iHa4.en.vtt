00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
really slow there for some reason and I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
really slow there for some reason and I
needed<00:00:26.310> short<00:00:26.640> games<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.420> whenever<00:00:27.599> I'm

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
needed short games but whenever I'm

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080 
needed short games but whenever I'm
there<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.199> takes<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.619> 10<00:00:28.980> hours<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:29.910> not

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
there it takes like 10 hours and I'm not

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.979 
there it takes like 10 hours and I'm not
even<00:00:30.300> exaggerating<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:31.080> literally<00:00:31.410> my

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
even exaggerating like literally my

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
even exaggerating like literally my
windows<00:00:33.989> media<00:00:34.230> thing<00:00:34.620> says<00:00:34.890> 10<00:00:35.670> hours

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
windows media thing says 10 hours

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.090 
windows media thing says 10 hours
remaining<00:00:36.510> blah<00:00:36.899> blah<00:00:37.050> blah<00:00:37.200> whatever<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
remaining blah blah blah whatever so it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.440 
remaining blah blah blah whatever so it
literally<00:00:38.370> takes<00:00:38.640> 10<00:00:38.879> hours<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.360> then

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
literally takes 10 hours and then

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.479 
literally takes 10 hours and then
sometimes<00:00:39.809> I'll<00:00:40.260> wake<00:00:40.320> up<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
sometimes I'll wake up because I do it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.250 
sometimes I'll wake up because I do it
overnight<00:00:41.790> while<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.180> sleeping<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.110> it

overnight while I'm sleeping so that it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290 
overnight while I'm sleeping so that it
doesn't<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.309> doesn't<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.730> slow<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.149> while

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
doesn't so it doesn't go slow or while

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.869
