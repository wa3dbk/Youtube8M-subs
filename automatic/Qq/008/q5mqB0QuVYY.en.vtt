and you pretty much you just put the
title<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:12.190> put<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> semicolon<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.989> then<00:02:16.560> you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
title you put a semicolon and then you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.440 
title you put a semicolon and then you
put<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:17.920> again<00:02:18.420> so

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.839 

what<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:23.140> semi<00:02:23.680> three<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.129> put<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.640> three

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
what this semi three I put it three

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.030 
what this semi three I put it three
times<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.390> I'll<00:02:25.599> put<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.989> title<00:02:26.349> semicolon

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
times so I'll put the title semicolon

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.420 
times so I'll put the title semicolon
title<00:02:27.670> semicolon<00:02:28.629> title<00:02:29.109> whatever<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.189> file

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
title semicolon title whatever the file

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.240 
title semicolon title whatever the file
is<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.959> means<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.319> gonna<00:02:32.469> look<00:02:32.829> it's

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
is so that means it's gonna look it's

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.250 
is so that means it's gonna look it's
down<00:02:33.790> at<00:02:34.000> three<00:02:34.209> times<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:34.659> that<00:02:34.810> means<00:02:35.019> it's

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
down at three times so that means it's

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.509 
down at three times so that means it's
gonna<00:02:35.439> loop<00:02:35.769> three<00:02:36.069> times<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.980> now<00:02:39.010> I'm<00:02:39.340> gonna

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
gonna loop three times so now I'm gonna

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.839 
gonna loop three times so now I'm gonna
go<00:02:40.109> into<00:02:41.109> my<00:02:41.159> actual<00:02:42.159> win<00:02:42.730> Mooji

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
go into my actual win Mooji

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.040 
go into my actual win Mooji
and<00:02:45.299> uh

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
and uh

00:02:47.050 --> 00:03:09.280 
and uh
a<00:02:47.980> loop

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.199 

and<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.980> name<00:03:10.159> of<00:03:10.340> stage<00:03:10.519> I<00:03:10.700> picked<00:03:10.970> was

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
and the name of stage I picked was

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:29.070 
and the name of stage I picked was
called<00:03:11.900> chaos<00:03:12.409> room<00:03:13.420> if<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.540> didn't<00:03:14.780> see<00:03:14.959> it

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:37.820 

so<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.830> was<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.040> first<00:03:30.220> time

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:50.960 

it's<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.460> second<00:03:38.850> time

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.080 

and<00:03:51.900> that's<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.230> third<00:03:52.410> time

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.020 

so<00:03:57.630> all<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.080> gotta<00:03:58.260> remember<00:03:58.730> all<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.910> have
