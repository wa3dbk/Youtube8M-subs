00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
what the androids skype app used to be

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.710 
what the androids skype app used to be
it's<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.070> much<00:00:29.279> better<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.510> lot

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
it's so much better you know it's a lot

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.590 
it's so much better you know it's a lot
cleaner<00:00:31.099> it<00:00:32.099> looks<00:00:32.279> more<00:00:32.399> i<00:00:32.969> guess<00:00:33.420> more

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
cleaner it looks more i guess more

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.380 
cleaner it looks more i guess more
professional-looking<00:00:34.880> however<00:00:35.880> there's<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
professional-looking however there's a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.900 
professional-looking however there's a
downside<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> which<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
downside to it and which is that in the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.549 
downside to it and which is that in the
US<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.960> cannot<00:00:40.320> use<00:00:40.590> VoIP<00:00:40.950> over<00:00:41.160> 3g<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:42.239> only

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
US you cannot use VoIP over 3g it's only

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.490 
US you cannot use VoIP over 3g it's only
through<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.829> Wi-Fi<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
through on Wi-Fi so that would be you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.850 
through on Wi-Fi so that would be you
know<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:47.460> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.760> bad<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.600> come
