gosh like 1 2 3 4 here we have 3 modes

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.440 
gosh like 1 2 3 4 here we have 3 modes
same<00:02:08.119> works<00:02:08.690> as<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.310> DJI<00:02:10.310> phantom<00:02:10.880> when<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
same works as the DJI phantom when the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.630 
same works as the DJI phantom when the
only<00:02:11.900> there's<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.230> smart<00:02:12.710> port<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.220> smart<00:02:13.580> mode

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
only there's a smart port in smart mode

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.260 
only there's a smart port in smart mode
angle<00:02:14.300> mode<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.720> home<00:02:15.380> mode<00:02:18.880> with<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> smart

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
angle mode and home mode with the smart

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.960 
angle mode and home mode with the smart
mode<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.720> say<00:02:21.380> car<00:02:21.620> for<00:02:21.860> -<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.280> then<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.580> switched

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
mode I say car for - and then I switched

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.750 
mode I say car for - and then I switched
over<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.020> angle<00:02:24.470> mode<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.069> I<00:02:25.490> first

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
over to the angle mode and I first

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720 
over to the angle mode and I first
increasing<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.750> speed<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:27.530> turtle<00:02:28.520> and

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
increasing the speed we have turtle and

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.850 
increasing the speed we have turtle and
the<00:02:29.030> rabbit<00:02:29.060> as<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:29.959> called<00:02:30.200> turtle<00:02:30.590> which

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
the rabbit as they called turtle which

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.250 
the rabbit as they called turtle which
means<00:02:31.130> obviously<00:02:31.490> slow<00:02:31.970> start<00:02:32.810> start<00:02:33.080> with

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
means obviously slow start start with

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.340 
means obviously slow start start with
that<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:33.709> I<00:02:33.950> gently<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.810> know<00:02:35.870> move<00:02:36.170> up

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
that and then I gently you know move up

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.580 
that and then I gently you know move up
and<00:02:36.760> faster<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.569> then<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.050> for<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.319> video

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
and faster and then this is for a video

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.030 
and faster and then this is for a video
for<00:02:40.340> taking<00:02:40.640> pictures<00:02:40.819> moving<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.870> camera<00:02:42.260> up

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
for taking pictures moving the camera up

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.640 
for taking pictures moving the camera up
and<00:02:43.310> down<00:02:43.400> mostly<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.420> screen<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:45.050> can<00:02:45.290> see

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
and down mostly the screen I can see

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.699 
and down mostly the screen I can see
where<00:02:45.920> I'm<00:02:46.040> heading<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:47.630> can<00:02:47.840> see<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.560> how

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
where I'm heading and I can see and how

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.680 
where I'm heading and I can see and how
I'm<00:02:48.980> doing<00:02:49.250> speed<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.000> how<00:02:50.120> many<00:02:50.300> satellites

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
I'm doing speed and how many satellites

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.290 
I'm doing speed and how many satellites
I'm<00:02:51.020> connected<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.490> differences<00:02:53.150> between

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
I'm connected to the differences between

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.360 
I'm connected to the differences between
the<00:02:53.599> Phantom<00:02:53.990> this<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.860> start<00:02:55.130> button

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
the Phantom this is the start button

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.180 
the Phantom this is the start button
starting<00:02:56.330> engines<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.410> then<00:02:57.590> for<00:02:57.800> takeoff

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
starting engines and then for takeoff

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.730 
starting engines and then for takeoff
much<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.700> same<00:02:58.910> push<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.660> off<00:02:59.780> to<00:03:00.349> take<00:03:00.530> off

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
much the same push it off to take off

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.250 
much the same push it off to take off
and<00:03:00.950> down<00:03:01.310> then<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.510> your<00:03:02.690> 360s

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
and down then you to your 360s

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.770 
and down then you to your 360s
three<00:03:04.409> angles<00:03:04.860> forwards<00:03:05.640> reverse<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.569> left

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
three angles forwards reverse the left

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.410 
three angles forwards reverse the left
to<00:03:06.930> right<00:03:07.110> it's<00:03:10.400> pretty<00:03:11.400> much<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.819> same<00:03:11.849> it's

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
to right it's pretty much the same it's

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.960 
to right it's pretty much the same it's
going<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.930> very<00:03:13.170> exciting<00:03:13.829> so<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.819> it

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
going to be very exciting so that is it

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:30.979 
going to be very exciting so that is it
