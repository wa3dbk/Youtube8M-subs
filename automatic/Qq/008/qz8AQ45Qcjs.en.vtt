now<00:00:16.470> rep<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.890> short<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.160> repetition

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
now rep is short for repetition

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.670 
now rep is short for repetition
repetition<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.540> basically<00:00:18.870> one<00:00:19.110> lift<00:00:19.440> of<00:00:19.590> an

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
repetition is basically one lift of an

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.190 
repetition is basically one lift of an
exercise<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.280> raising<00:00:20.790> a<00:00:20.850> way<00:00:21.030> it's<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.540> it's

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
exercise is raising a way it's a it's

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.960 
exercise is raising a way it's a it's
doing<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.740> bench<00:00:22.920> press<00:00:23.130> me<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.370> leg<00:00:23.520> extension

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
doing a bench press me a leg extension

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.240 
doing a bench press me a leg extension
just<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.420> movement<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.380> repetition<00:00:25.770> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
just one movement is one repetition you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.520 
just one movement is one repetition you
usually<00:00:26.340> want<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.760> somewhere<00:00:27.060> between<00:00:27.530> six

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
usually want to do somewhere between six

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.740 
usually want to do somewhere between six
in<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.010> 15<00:00:29.520> or<00:00:29.550> 20<00:00:29.910> repetitions<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.600> that's

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
in like 15 or 20 repetitions and that's

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.940 
in like 15 or 20 repetitions and that's
another<00:00:30.930> thing<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.290> variety<00:00:31.440> you<00:00:31.800> don't

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
another thing with a variety you don't

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.930 
another thing with a variety you don't
want<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> always<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.460> same<00:00:32.700> number

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
want to always do the same number

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.070 
want to always do the same number
repetitions<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.540> want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.720> kind<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.900> change

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
repetitions you want to kind of change

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.050 
repetitions you want to kind of change
it<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> little<00:00:34.440> bit<00:00:34.620> sometimes<00:00:35.310> do<00:00:35.640> low<00:00:35.820> reps

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
it up a little bit sometimes do low reps

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.790 
it up a little bit sometimes do low reps
sometimes<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.510> higher<00:00:36.720> reps<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> then<00:00:37.560> one

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
sometimes do higher reps and then one

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
sometimes do higher reps and then one
set<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.580> grouping<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.150> repetitions<00:00:39.690> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
set is one grouping of repetitions so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.170 
set is one grouping of repetitions so
say<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.350> did<00:00:40.530> two<00:00:40.830> sets<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> an<00:00:41.760> exercise<00:00:42.000> that

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
say you did two sets of an exercise that

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.850 
say you did two sets of an exercise that
means<00:00:42.600> you've<00:00:42.750> done<00:00:42.930> maybe<00:00:43.110> ten<00:00:43.680> repetitions

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
means you've done maybe ten repetitions

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.710 
means you've done maybe ten repetitions
that's<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.610> set<00:00:44.880> you<00:00:45.060> take<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.240> break<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.660> come

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
that's one set you take a break and come

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.760 
that's one set you take a break and come
back<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.170> another<00:00:46.200> ten<00:00:46.590> repetitions

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
back and do another ten repetitions

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.350 
back and do another ten repetitions
that's<00:00:47.280> another<00:00:47.490> set<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.850> you've<00:00:47.970> done<00:00:48.090> two

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that's another set so you've done two

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.890 
that's another set so you've done two
sets<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.810> 10<00:00:49.050> reps<00:00:49.079> or<00:00:49.829> repetitions<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> when

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
sets of 10 reps or repetitions so when

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.120 
sets of 10 reps or repetitions so when
you<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> may<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> store<00:00:52.950> with<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
you do this you may want to store with a

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.350 
you do this you may want to store with a
little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> lighter<00:00:53.790> weight<00:00:54.060> first

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little bit of a lighter weight first

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.790 
little bit of a lighter weight first
you're<00:00:54.540> not<00:00:54.720> that<00:00:54.870> condition<00:00:55.380> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.590> haven't

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you're not that condition if you haven't

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.470 
you're not that condition if you haven't
been<00:00:55.890> training<00:00:56.130> and<00:00:56.400> your<00:00:56.940> body<00:00:57.060> there's<00:00:57.360> an

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
been training and your body there's an

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
been training and your body there's an
inverse<00:00:57.720> relationship<00:00:57.810> between<00:00:58.290> intensity

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
inverse relationship between intensity

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
inverse relationship between intensity
and<00:00:59.460> duration<00:00:59.610> you<00:01:00.000> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> kind<00:01:00.360> of<00:01:00.480> keep

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and duration you want to kind of keep

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
and duration you want to kind of keep
the<00:01:00.899> intensity<00:01:01.290> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.770> lower<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the intensity a little bit lower and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.800 
the intensity a little bit lower and
maybe<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.180> more<00:01:03.329> initially

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
maybe do a little bit more initially

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.299 
maybe do a little bit more initially
just<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.589> body<00:01:04.710> used<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.190> movement

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
just get your body used to the movement

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.530 
just get your body used to the movement
you<00:01:05.519> don't<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> pile<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> weight<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you don't want to pile on the weight and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
you don't want to pile on the weight and
do<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.690> high<00:01:07.530> weight<00:01:08.159> low<00:01:08.190> rep<00:01:08.610> set<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.270> don't

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
do a high weight low rep set you don't

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
do a high weight low rep set you don't
want<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> put<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.870> you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.890> twice<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.370> weight

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
want to put on you know twice the weight

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.530 
want to put on you know twice the weight
you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.700> handle<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> only<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.360> four

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
you can handle the only do four

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.330 
you can handle the only do four
repetitions<00:01:12.750> maybe<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.500> ten<00:01:13.890> or<00:01:14.010> twelve<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
repetitions maybe do ten or twelve to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.250 
repetitions maybe do ten or twelve to
start<00:01:14.550> with<00:01:14.700> maybe<00:01:14.820> even<00:01:15.060> 15<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> get

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
start with maybe even 15 then as you get

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.780 
start with maybe even 15 then as you get
stronger<00:01:16.470> sometimes<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.190> do<00:01:17.250> sets<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
stronger sometimes you can do sets of

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.969 
stronger sometimes you can do sets of
lower<00:01:18.210> numbers<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.750> six<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> eight<00:01:19.290> once<00:01:19.890> in

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
lower numbers like six to eight once in

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.320 
lower numbers like six to eight once in
a<00:01:20.010> while<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.190> can<00:01:20.310> throw<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.729> real<00:01:21.060> shocker

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
a while you can throw in a real shocker

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
a while you can throw in a real shocker
and<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> century<00:01:22.170> set<00:01:22.409> really

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
and do like a century set really

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.399 
and do like a century set really
lightweight<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.370> like<00:01:23.490> 100<00:01:23.880> repetitions

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
lightweight and do like 100 repetitions

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.870 
lightweight and do like 100 repetitions
but<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> key<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.950> keeping<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.370> variety<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
but the key is just keeping a variety to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
but the key is just keeping a variety to
the<00:01:26.940> repetitions<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.750> having<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> target

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the repetitions it's not having a target

number per se either you don't want to
just<00:01:29.940> shoot<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.180> 15<00:01:30.690> reps<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.080> stop<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.409> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
just shoot for 15 reps and stop when you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.750 
just shoot for 15 reps and stop when you
get<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:31.830> you<00:01:32.010> want<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> point

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.940 
get there you want to get to the point
where<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.090> basically<00:01:33.869> almost<00:01:34.320> impossible

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
where it's basically almost impossible

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.289 
where it's basically almost impossible
for<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.159> move<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.760> when<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.060> stop

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
for you to move it that's when you stop

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719 
for you to move it that's when you stop
as<00:01:36.510> long<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.020> safely<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.729> carefully

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
as long as you can safely and carefully

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
as long as you can safely and carefully
do<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.990> far<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.320> sets<00:01:40.590> go<00:01:40.799> there's<00:01:41.070> really

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
do that as far as sets go there's really

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
do that as far as sets go there's really
not<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.490> much<00:01:41.790> reason<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.240> do<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> lot<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
not that much reason to do a lot of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
not that much reason to do a lot of
sense<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:44.010> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.280> three<00:01:44.580> sets<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.939> an

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
sense like if you do three sets of an

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.190 
sense like if you do three sets of an
exercise<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.510> I<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.600> three<00:01:45.900> sets<00:01:46.080> of

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
exercise if I do three sets of

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.539 
exercise if I do three sets of
benchpress<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.860> necessarily<00:01:47.220> gonna<00:01:47.400> get

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
benchpress I'm not necessarily gonna get

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.429 
benchpress I'm not necessarily gonna get
three<00:01:47.760> times<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.119> benefit<00:01:48.540> most<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> benefit

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
three times a benefit most the benefit

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.160 
three times a benefit most the benefit
comes<00:01:49.560> from<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.830> first<00:01:50.100> rep<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.549> first<00:01:50.760> set

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
comes from the first rep the first set

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.719 
comes from the first rep the first set
almost<00:01:52.170> tricked<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.400> comes<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
almost tricked you so it comes from the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.240 
almost tricked you so it comes from the
first<00:01:54.000> set<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.680> that's<00:01:55.680> why<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.860> whole<00:01:56.040> menu

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
first set and that's why this whole menu

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.499 
first set and that's why this whole menu
system<00:01:56.580> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.939> did<00:01:57.060> those<00:01:57.180> seven

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
system if you just did those seven

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.820 
system if you just did those seven
exercises<00:01:57.720> one<00:01:58.140> set<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.439> each<00:01:58.560> you're<00:01:58.710> going

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
exercises one set of each you're going

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.410 
exercises one set of each you're going
to<00:01:58.890> get<00:01:58.950> most<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.340> benefit<00:01:59.729> if<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.180> time

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
to get most the benefit if you have time

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.060 
to get most the benefit if you have time
you<00:02:00.450> want<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.840> additional<00:02:01.229> sets<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:01.890> do

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you want to do additional sets or do

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.440 
you want to do additional sets or do
like<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.220> warm-up<00:02:02.580> set<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.150> heavier

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
like a warm-up set and then a heavier

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.470 
like a warm-up set and then a heavier
set<00:02:03.659> that's<00:02:03.810> fine<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.170> me<00:02:04.200> too
