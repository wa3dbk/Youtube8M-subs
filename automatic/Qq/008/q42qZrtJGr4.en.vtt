included parts this is the setup the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.570 
included parts this is the setup the
simplest<00:00:40.260> setup<00:00:40.680> designed<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.280> go<00:00:41.400> from

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
simplest setup designed to just go from

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.990 
simplest setup designed to just go from
the<00:00:41.840> telescope<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.080> camera<00:00:43.470> itself<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the telescope the camera itself to the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.620 
the telescope the camera itself to the
HD<00:00:45.540> converter<00:00:46.170> box<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
HD converter box and then from the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.560 
HD converter box and then from the
converter<00:00:48.900> box<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.560> TV<00:00:50.310> with<00:00:51.000> an<00:00:51.090> HDMI

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
converter box to the TV with an HDMI

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.380 
converter box to the TV with an HDMI
cable<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.920> need<00:00:53.130> a<00:00:53.160> power<00:00:53.490> cord<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
cable you just need a power cord for the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.060 
cable you just need a power cord for the
box<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.650> means<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
box here and so what that means is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.620 
box here and so what that means is
there's<00:00:56.280> only<00:00:56.400> one<00:00:56.670> cable<00:00:56.970> going<00:00:57.239> from<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
there's only one cable going from the

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.170 
there's only one cable going from the
telescope<00:00:58.100> with<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> very<00:00:59.340> long<00:00:59.460> cable<00:00:59.820> down<00:00:59.970> to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
telescope with a very long cable down to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.540 
telescope with a very long cable down to
the<00:01:00.300> converter<00:01:01.050> box<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> keeps<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.250> setup

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the converter box so it keeps the setup

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.299 
the converter box so it keeps the setup
clean<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.799> cable<00:01:04.799> free<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.009> don't<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
clean and cable free you don't have a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700 
clean and cable free you don't have a
lot<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.460> wires<00:01:05.729> coming<00:01:06.000> off<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.710> telescope

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
lot of wires coming off of the telescope

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.580 
lot of wires coming off of the telescope

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.719 
nozzle slips into any focuser like I
said<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:13.979> 1080p<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.120> it<00:01:16.050> outputs<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.220> 1080

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
said it's 1080p so it outputs the 1080

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.640 
said it's 1080p so it outputs the 1080
signal<00:01:18.090> through<00:01:18.300> this<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.600> wire<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.350> also

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
signal through this one wire it also

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.250 
signal through this one wire it also
outputs<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.370> power<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.150> camera<00:01:21.930> control

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
outputs the power and camera control

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.410 
outputs the power and camera control
through<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.830> wire<00:01:23.700> which<00:01:23.970> again<00:01:24.240> makes

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
through this one wire which again makes

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.320 
through this one wire which again makes
it<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> very<00:01:24.630> simple<00:01:24.990> setup<00:01:25.940> frame<00:01:26.940> rate<00:01:27.120> goes

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it a very simple setup frame rate goes

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.450 
it a very simple setup frame rate goes
from<00:01:27.630> 60<00:01:28.020> frames<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> second<00:01:28.590> very<00:01:28.740> fast<00:01:29.010> down

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
from 60 frames a second very fast down

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.539 
from 60 frames a second very fast down
to<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.950> individual<00:01:31.950> exposures<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.490> be

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to one individual exposures that can be

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.760 
to one individual exposures that can be
ten<00:01:32.729> seconds<00:01:33.120> long<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.170> mostly<00:01:34.320> designed

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
ten seconds long so it's mostly designed

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.050 
ten seconds long so it's mostly designed
for<00:01:35.130> Moon<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.580> planets<00:01:35.659> high-definition

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.340 
cable that plugs into the converter box
here<00:04:09.850> goes<00:04:10.850> out<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.180> an<00:04:11.239> artist<00:04:11.480> 232<00:04:11.959> cable

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
here goes out to an artist 232 cable

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.870 
here goes out to an artist 232 cable
there's<00:04:12.680> an<00:04:12.769> extension<00:04:13.280> cable<00:04:13.609> for<00:04:13.850> the
