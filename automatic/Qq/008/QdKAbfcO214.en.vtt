00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
gain a basic understanding of it so that

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.979 
gain a basic understanding of it so that
you<00:04:18.890> will<00:04:19.010> be<00:04:19.220> better<00:04:19.459> prepared<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:20.390> treat<00:04:20.690> and

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
you will be better prepared to treat and

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:29.310 
you will be better prepared to treat and
deal<00:04:21.350> with<00:04:21.620> this<00:04:21.739> potentially<00:04:22.580> fatal<00:04:22.940> disease
