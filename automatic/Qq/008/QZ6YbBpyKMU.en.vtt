done yeah check it out this what I got
going<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:12.990> far<00:00:13.940> simple<00:00:14.940> just<00:00:15.470> different

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
going on so far simple just different

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.000 
going on so far simple just different
designs<00:00:17.869> go<00:00:18.869> ahead<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.199> take<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.350> over<00:00:19.740> for

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
designs go ahead and take that over for

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.980 
designs go ahead and take that over for
me<00:00:21.920> pretty<00:00:22.920> much<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.400> really<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.420> no<00:00:24.660> set

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
me pretty much it really is no set

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.410 
me pretty much it really is no set
pattern<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.590> need<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:26.119> because<00:00:27.119> if

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
pattern that you need to do because if

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.550 
pattern that you need to do because if
you<00:00:27.539> look<00:00:27.689> at<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> print<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.439> all

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
you look at you to print it's all

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.960 
you look at you to print it's all
different<00:00:28.949> anyway<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.730> can't

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
different anyway so you really can't

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:43.530 
different anyway so you really can't
mess<00:00:30.119> up

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.180 

I<00:00:44.540> just<00:00:44.840> try<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.079> keep<00:00:45.320> nice<00:00:45.530> rounded<00:00:46.010> angles

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
I just try to keep nice rounded angles

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.350 
I just try to keep nice rounded angles
though<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.520> try<00:00:46.730> not<00:00:46.879> to<00:00:46.940> have<00:00:47.059> anything

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
though I try not to have anything

00:00:47.360 --> 00:01:04.240 
though I try not to have anything
looking<00:00:47.780> too<00:00:47.930> sharp

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.650 

it's<00:01:05.250> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.520> pointed<00:01:05.910> right<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.300> so<00:01:06.540> I'm

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
it's kind of pointed right here so I'm

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.910 
it's kind of pointed right here so I'm
going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.050> round<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.440> piece<00:01:07.650> off

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.100 

pretty<00:01:14.920> basic<00:01:15.130> pretty<00:01:15.580> easy

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.170 

so<00:01:21.650> it's<00:01:21.800> a<00:01:22.130> little<00:01:22.340> different<00:01:22.760> some

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
so it's a little different some

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.820 
so it's a little different some
different<00:01:23.510> shapes<00:01:23.690> inside<00:01:24.080> there<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.680> is

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
different shapes inside there this is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:02:16.380 
different shapes inside there this is
kind<00:01:24.980> of<00:01:25.040> make<00:01:25.190> it<00:01:25.220> look<00:01:25.400> more<00:01:25.580> natural

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:03:06.150 

alarm<00:02:17.390> buddy

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.300 

so<00:03:07.120> now<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:08.080> now<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.260> got<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.710> part<00:03:08.980> done<00:03:09.100> what

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
so now so now I got that part done what

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.830 
so now so now I got that part done what
I'm<00:03:09.400> gonna<00:03:09.490> do<00:03:09.670> now<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.030> I'm<00:03:10.210> gonna<00:03:10.330> carve<00:03:10.660> out

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna carve out

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.390 
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna carve out
circles<00:03:11.110> pretty<00:03:11.560> much<00:03:11.740> on<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> inside<00:03:12.370> of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
circles pretty much on the inside of

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.790 
circles pretty much on the inside of
each<00:03:12.640> one<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.240> give<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.900> natural<00:03:14.080> look<00:03:14.530> I

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
each one to give it that natural look I

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.620 
each one to give it that natural look I
don't<00:03:15.010> despair<00:03:15.340> by<00:03:15.730> using<00:03:15.940> these<00:03:16.180> right<00:03:16.450> here

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
don't despair by using these right here

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.720 
don't despair by using these right here
these<00:03:17.140> Detailers<00:03:20.160> it's<00:03:21.160> almost<00:03:21.400> like<00:03:21.580> I'm

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
these Detailers it's almost like I'm

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.910 
these Detailers it's almost like I'm
going<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.940> put<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.150> little<00:03:22.450> bit<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.920> solidly

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
going to put a little bit of the solidly

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.950 
going to put a little bit of the solidly
solidly<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.180> center<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.630> I'm<00:03:25.750> going<00:03:25.840> to

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
solidly in the center and I'm going to

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:45.870 
solidly in the center and I'm going to
kind<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.200> fade<00:03:26.440> around<00:03:26.770> a<00:03:26.860> little<00:03:27.070> bit

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.810 

the<00:03:46.880> other<00:03:47.090> one<00:03:47.570> there
