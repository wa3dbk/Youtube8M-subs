here's another plant of particular
interest<00:00:05.839> violently<00:00:06.839> both<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.919> leaves<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
interest violently both the leaves and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.860 
interest violently both the leaves and
the<00:00:09.150> flowers<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.780> edible<00:00:10.670> and<00:00:11.670> guess<00:00:12.570> what

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the flowers are edible and guess what

to<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.949> didn't<00:00:26.160> plant<00:00:26.369> these<00:00:26.519> dandelions

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
to you I didn't plant these dandelions

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.060 
to you I didn't plant these dandelions
either<00:00:27.619> most<00:00:28.619> people<00:00:28.980> don't<00:00:30.410> they<00:00:31.410> will<00:00:31.650> come

I just paper covered by a heavy organic

I just paper covered by a heavy organic

without disturbing the soil food web we

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970 
without disturbing the soil food web we
could<00:00:45.450> come<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.840> tell<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.350> everything<00:00:46.770> but

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
could come in and tell up everything but

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.190 
could come in and tell up everything but
it<00:00:47.070> would<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.430> set<00:00:47.910> back<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.600> soil

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it would really set back the soil

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.979 
it would really set back the soil
organisms<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.399> want<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.989> really

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
inspect insects and basically it's a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.359 
inspect insects and basically it's a
strategy<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.560> trying<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> kill<00:01:19.950> anybody

and<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.920> more<00:01:27.250> insect<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:28.270> it's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
and the more insect it's it's

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.540 
and the more insect it's it's
counterintuitive<00:01:29.190> especially<00:01:30.190> as<00:01:30.310> we've

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
counterintuitive especially as we've

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.970 
counterintuitive especially as we've
been<00:01:30.700> conditioned<00:01:31.510> you<00:01:32.260> know<00:01:32.410> to<00:01:32.470> think<00:01:32.860> that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
been conditioned you know to think that

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.760 
been conditioned you know to think that
we<00:01:33.190> need<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.460> go<00:01:33.610> out<00:01:33.760> blasting<00:01:34.510> -<00:01:34.720> with<00:01:35.560> with

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
we need to go out blasting - with with

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.040 
we need to go out blasting - with with
insecticides<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.820> kill<00:01:37.090> problem<00:01:37.630> insects

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
insecticides to kill problem insects

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.620 
insecticides to kill problem insects
it's<00:01:38.500> counterintuitive<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.700> say<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
it's counterintuitive to say the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.590 
it's counterintuitive to say the
solution<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.500> more<00:01:42.060> diversity<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.180> insect

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
solution is more diversity of insect

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.470 
solution is more diversity of insect
species<00:01:43.870> but<00:01:44.470> in<00:01:44.620> fact<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.240> case<00:01:46.450> and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
species but in fact that is the case and

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.230 
species but in fact that is the case and
so<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.110> want<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.350> plant<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:47.890> encourage<00:01:48.580> insect

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
so we want to plant to encourage insect

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.100 
so we want to plant to encourage insect
diversity

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
diversity

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.720

this<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:51.130> bergamot<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:55.740> we'll<00:01:56.740> see<00:01:57.040> later<00:01:57.610> on

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
this is bergamot and we'll see later on

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.970 
this is bergamot and we'll see later on
we'll<00:01:58.390> see<00:01:58.630> some<00:01:58.840> other<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.470> group<00:01:59.710> of

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
we'll see some other of a group of

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.480 
we'll see some other of a group of
plants<00:02:00.460> called<00:02:00.670> mountain<00:02:01.240> mints<00:02:01.870> and<00:02:02.490> they're

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
plants called mountain mints and they're

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.850 
plants called mountain mints and they're
there<00:02:03.910> in<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.780> mint<00:02:05.020> family<00:02:05.080> but<00:02:05.680> they're<00:02:05.830> not

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
there in the mint family but they're not

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.710 
there in the mint family but they're not
like<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.430> culinary<00:02:06.700> match<00:02:07.210> you've<00:02:07.450> seen

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
like the culinary match you've seen

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.350 
like the culinary match you've seen
they're<00:02:07.930> bigger<00:02:08.170> plants<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:09.210> when<00:02:10.210> they

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
they're bigger plants and when they

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.130 
they're bigger plants and when they
flower<00:02:10.690> they<00:02:11.050> encourage<00:02:11.820> insects<00:02:12.820> so<00:02:13.780> this<00:02:13.960> is

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
flower they encourage insects so this is

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.550 
flower they encourage insects so this is
just<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.440> small<00:02:14.710> example<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.580> concept

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
food for the home staff so it's it's

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.590 
food for the home staff so it's it's
going<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.850> be<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> more<00:02:28.630> productive<00:02:30.150> garden<00:02:31.150> in

going to be a more productive garden in
the<00:02:31.810> same<00:02:32.290> space

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.270

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
about this forest garden idea I started

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.410 
about this forest garden idea I started
introducing<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.740> concept<00:03:58.980> here<00:03:59.790> as<00:03:59.940> well<00:04:00.180> to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
introducing that concept here as well to

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.210 
introducing that concept here as well to
convert<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.110> existing<00:04:01.710> orchard<00:04:02.330> into<00:04:03.330> a

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
convert the existing orchard into a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.710 
convert the existing orchard into a
considerably<00:04:05.220> more<00:04:05.460> complex<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.450> diverse

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
considerably more complex and diverse

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.120 
considerably more complex and diverse
and<00:04:07.400> productive<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:09.050> interesting

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
and productive and interesting

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.820 
and productive and interesting
environment<00:04:11.130> how<00:04:11.490> long<00:04:11.700> ago<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
environment how long ago this is the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.280 
environment how long ago this is the
second<00:04:14.310> year<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:15.270> forest<00:04:15.630> garden<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.170> so

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
second year of the forest garden and so

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.320 
second year of the forest garden and so
we've<00:04:16.470> been<00:04:16.620> putting<00:04:16.799> down<00:04:17.130> these<00:04:17.400> mulches

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
we've been putting down these mulches

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.289 
we've been putting down these mulches
and<00:04:18.359> trying<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.900> get<00:04:19.080> clovers<00:04:20.120> started<00:04:21.120> as<00:04:21.270> a

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
and trying to get clovers started as a

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.110 
and trying to get clovers started as a
temporary<00:04:22.200> cover<00:04:22.920> crop<00:04:23.220> rather<00:04:23.550> than<00:04:23.820> grass

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
temporary cover crop rather than grass

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.900 
temporary cover crop rather than grass
but<00:04:25.110> with<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:25.620> kind<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.950> space<00:04:26.250> it's<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.730> you

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
but with this kind of space it's a you

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.020 
but with this kind of space it's a you
know<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:28.440> an<00:04:28.560> ongoing<00:04:28.740> process<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.910> so

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
know it's it's an ongoing process and so

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.280 
know it's it's an ongoing process and so
there<00:04:30.180> are<00:04:30.240> some<00:04:30.390> areas<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.780> are<00:04:30.960> still<00:04:31.020> in

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
there are some areas that are still in

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.530 
there are some areas that are still in
grass<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.830> there<00:04:31.980> others<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.520> are<00:04:32.640> that

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
grass and there others that are that

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.090 
grass and there others that are that
have<00:04:33.660> been<00:04:33.780> converted<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.350> little<00:04:34.560> bit<00:04:34.650> more<00:04:34.860> in

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
have been converted a little bit more in

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.440 
have been converted a little bit more in
other<00:04:35.400> directions<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.960> there<00:04:37.920> are<00:04:37.980> a<00:04:38.040> lot<00:04:38.340> of

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
other directions so there are a lot of

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.550 
other directions so there are a lot of
possibilities<00:04:39.450> for<00:04:39.480> introducing<00:04:40.140> other

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
possibilities for introducing other

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.250 
possibilities for introducing other
useful<00:04:41.070> species<00:04:42.350> into<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:45.270> forest<00:04:45.750> garden

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
useful species into the forest garden

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.159 
useful species into the forest garden
idea<00:04:46.800> can<00:04:47.130> be<00:04:47.250> applied<00:04:48.030> on<00:04:48.330> any<00:04:48.630> scale<00:04:49.080> and

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
idea can be applied on any scale and

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.570 
idea can be applied on any scale and
here's<00:04:50.379> a<00:04:50.590> little<00:04:51.900> tiny<00:04:52.900> application<00:04:53.889> of<00:04:54.069> the

the base when it gets to be a mature

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.730 
the base when it gets to be a mature
tree<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.210> will<00:05:04.300> provide<00:05:04.599> shade<00:05:05.110> for<00:05:05.139> the<00:05:05.499> birds

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.830 
tree it will provide shade for the birds
in<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.550> case<00:05:06.759> of<00:05:06.939> the<00:05:07.029> mulberries<00:05:07.599> it<00:05:07.719> will

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
in the case of the mulberries it will

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.439 
in the case of the mulberries it will
provide<00:05:08.110> dropped<00:05:08.710> fruit<00:05:09.249> in<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.969> case<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.360> the

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
provide dropped fruit in the case of the

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.300 
provide dropped fruit in the case of the
chestnuts<00:05:10.990> they<00:05:11.259> will<00:05:11.439> help<00:05:11.620> control<00:05:12.099> the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
chestnuts they will help control the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.450 
chestnuts they will help control the
chestnut<00:05:12.849> weevil<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.979> they<00:05:14.979> will<00:05:15.129> also<00:05:15.279> eat

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
chestnut weevil and they will also eat

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.029 
chestnut weevil and they will also eat
the<00:05:15.789> comfrey<00:05:16.210> so<00:05:16.870> it's<00:05:17.080> another<00:05:17.379> case<00:05:17.710> where

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
the comfrey so it's another case where

the comfrey so it's another case where
you<00:05:18.279> know<00:05:18.430> what<00:05:19.360> could<00:05:19.569> be<00:05:19.749> just<00:05:19.990> one<00:05:20.529> single
