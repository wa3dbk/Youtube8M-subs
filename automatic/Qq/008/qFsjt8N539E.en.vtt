00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
inch guide in mind freehand it I'll be

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.550 
inch guide in mind freehand it I'll be
the<00:03:48.320> best<00:03:48.500> way<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.860> do<00:03:49.130> it

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.630 

shut<00:03:54.560> up<00:03:54.590> for<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.040> minute<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.460> can

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
shut up for a minute so I can

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:04.720 
shut up for a minute so I can
concentrate<00:04:02.770> so<00:04:03.770> I'm<00:04:03.860> just<00:04:04.040> keeping<00:04:04.340> my<00:04:04.370> hand

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
concentrate so I'm just keeping my hand

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.540 
concentrate so I'm just keeping my hand
kind<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.630> constant<00:04:06.170> length<00:04:06.350> away<00:04:06.950> from<00:04:07.160> my

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
kind of a constant length away from my

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.780 
kind of a constant length away from my
from<00:04:08.270> my<00:04:08.300> cheek<00:04:09.220> back<00:04:10.220> here<00:04:10.490> around<00:04:10.670> the

from my cheek back here around the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.490 
from my cheek back here around the
corners<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.480> you're<00:04:11.750> viewed<00:04:11.959> you<00:04:12.080> can<00:04:12.260> kind

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
corners that you're viewed you can kind

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.319 
corners that you're viewed you can kind
of<00:04:12.560> come<00:04:12.800> in<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.010> little<00:04:13.430> bit<00:04:13.610> tighter<00:04:16.000> if<00:04:17.000> you

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
of come in a little bit tighter if you

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.660 
of come in a little bit tighter if you
want<00:04:17.750> it's<00:04:18.410> going<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.650> lay<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.829> lot<00:04:19.100> nicer<00:04:19.370> if

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
want it's going to lay a lot nicer if

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:29.510 
want it's going to lay a lot nicer if
you<00:04:19.730> do<00:04:19.910> that

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.180 

I<00:04:29.550> think<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.840> key<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.289> to<00:04:31.440> take<00:04:31.650> just<00:04:31.889> a<00:04:32.009> little

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
I think the key is to take just a little

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.129 
I think the key is to take just a little
bit<00:04:32.460> off<00:04:32.610> at<00:04:32.789> a<00:04:32.849> time<00:04:33.060> don't<00:04:33.330> try<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.599> go<00:04:33.780> crazy

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
bit off at a time don't try to go crazy

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.559 
bit off at a time don't try to go crazy
and<00:04:34.830> take<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.550> know<00:04:35.669> take<00:04:36.240> all<00:04:36.419> the

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:36.569 
and take the you know take all the

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.089 
and take the you know take all the
linked<00:04:36.810> up<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.110> watch<00:04:37.229> the<00:04:37.410> snip<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.650> little

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
linked up and watch the snip a little

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.950 
linked up and watch the snip a little
bit<00:04:38.250> at<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.520> time<00:04:38.610> kind<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.479> working<00:04:39.810> your<00:04:39.930> way

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
bit at a time kind of working your way

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.080 
bit at a time kind of working your way
in<00:04:40.259> you<00:04:42.289> can<00:04:43.289> see<00:04:43.500> how<00:04:44.160> I'm<00:04:44.340> taking<00:04:44.580> just<00:04:44.940> on

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
in you can see how I'm taking just on

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.570 
in you can see how I'm taking just on
this<00:04:45.210> one<00:04:45.270> side<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.930> my<00:04:46.020> beard<00:04:46.259> right<00:04:46.470> here<00:04:46.710> now

this one side of my beard right here now

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:55.939 
this one side of my beard right here now
trying<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:47.910> rush<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:53.780> okay<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.710> think<00:04:55.830> that

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
trying to rush it okay so I think that

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.129 
trying to rush it okay so I think that
size<00:04:56.250> we've<00:04:56.460> been<00:04:56.580> pretty<00:04:57.000> good<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:57.479> far<00:04:57.509> I'm

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
size we've been pretty good so far I'm

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.890 
size we've been pretty good so far I'm
going<00:04:58.259> to<00:04:58.380> fluff<00:04:58.740> out<00:04:59.360> bottom<00:05:00.360> part<00:05:00.569> here<00:05:00.750> I'm

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
going to fluff out bottom part here I'm

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.740 
going to fluff out bottom part here I'm
kind<00:05:01.139> of<00:05:01.199> come<00:05:01.410> along<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:02.220> bottom<00:05:05.599> kind<00:05:06.599> of

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
kind of come along the bottom kind of

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.180 
kind of come along the bottom kind of
work<00:05:06.930> my<00:05:07.139> way<00:05:07.349> up

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.530 

I'm<00:05:14.760> going<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:14.970> leave<00:05:15.090> a<00:05:15.120> little<00:05:15.330> bit<00:05:15.450> of

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
I'm going to leave a little bit of

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.720 
I'm going to leave a little bit of
length<00:05:15.810> in<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.080> front<00:05:16.320> here<00:05:16.620> just<00:05:17.460> because

it's<00:05:17.880> going<00:05:18.030> to<00:05:18.090> lay<00:05:18.240> a<00:05:18.270> lot<00:05:18.540> nicer<00:05:18.750> when<00:05:19.140> I've

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
it's going to lay a lot nicer when I've

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.070 
it's going to lay a lot nicer when I've
smoothed<00:05:19.920> things<00:05:20.100> back<00:05:20.370> down<00:05:20.810> trying<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.870> get

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
smoothed things back down trying to get

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.360 
smoothed things back down trying to get
some<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.830> that<00:05:22.890> sort<00:05:23.340> of<00:05:23.400> under<00:05:23.820> level<00:05:25.370> cut

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
some of that sort of under level cut

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.280 
some of that sort of under level cut
down<00:05:26.640> a<00:05:26.670> little<00:05:26.880> bit

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.200 

so<00:05:33.800> things<00:05:34.130> that<00:05:34.190> way<00:05:34.400> nicer<00:05:34.790> now<00:05:34.940> I'm<00:05:35.030> coming

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
so things that way nicer now I'm coming

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.740 
so things that way nicer now I'm coming
back<00:05:35.450> down<00:05:35.660> to<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.820> edge<00:05:38.030> of<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.360> beard<00:05:38.600> a

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.110 
back down to the edge of the beard a
little<00:05:39.020> bit<00:05:39.580> not<00:05:40.580> I<00:05:40.610> can<00:05:40.970> kind<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.270> see<00:05:43.120> what

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
little bit not I can kind of see what

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.670 
little bit not I can kind of see what
needs<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.450> be<00:05:44.600> done<00:05:44.750> down<00:05:45.020> there<00:05:45.080> so<00:05:45.560> I'm

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
needs to be done down there so I'm

needs to be done down there so I'm
taking<00:05:45.860> it<00:05:46.160> a<00:05:46.340> little<00:05:46.670> bit<00:05:47.030> closer<00:05:47.210> I'm<00:05:47.390> trying

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
taking it a little bit closer I'm trying

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.020 
taking it a little bit closer I'm trying
to<00:05:47.690> taper<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.230> back<00:05:48.440> to<00:05:48.950> my<00:05:49.100> skin<00:05:49.430> level<00:05:49.700> so

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
to taper it back to my skin level so

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.320 
to taper it back to my skin level so
that<00:05:50.230> lays<00:05:51.230> nice<00:05:51.500> and<00:05:51.680> has<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:51.800> nice<00:05:52.330> defined

that lays nice and has a nice defined
line<00:05:53.720> at<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.350> edge<00:05:54.530> and<00:05:56.530> you<00:05:57.530> notice<00:05:57.890> I'd

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
line at the edge and you notice I'd

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.700 
line at the edge and you notice I'd
switch<00:05:58.820> my<00:05:59.030> grip<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.450> little<00:05:59.720> bit<00:05:59.840> there<00:06:00.050> I'm
