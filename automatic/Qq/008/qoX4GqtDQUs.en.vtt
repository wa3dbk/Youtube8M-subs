here
now<00:01:50.300> when<00:01:50.660> your<00:01:50.810> first<00:01:51.020> pie<00:01:51.349> don't<00:01:51.890> put<00:01:52.160> it<00:01:52.280> in

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
now when your first pie don't put it in

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.820 
now when your first pie don't put it in
direct<00:01:52.700> Sun<00:01:52.970> right<00:01:53.300> away<00:01:53.599> wait<00:01:54.200> about<00:01:54.470> a<00:01:54.500> month

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
direct Sun right away wait about a month

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.309 
direct Sun right away wait about a month
and<00:01:54.979> then<00:01:55.039> you're<00:01:55.910> gonna<00:01:56.030> place<00:01:56.300> this<00:01:56.630> guy<00:01:56.810> in

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
and then you're gonna place this guy in

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.669 
and then you're gonna place this guy in
direct<00:01:57.979> sunlight<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.240> how<00:01:59.690> did<00:01:59.869> desert<00:02:00.229> plants

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
direct sunlight so how did desert plants

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.699 
direct sunlight so how did desert plants
survive<00:02:01.069> on<00:02:01.459> such<00:02:01.670> little<00:02:02.090> water<00:02:02.360> anyway<00:02:03.020> well

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
survive on such little water anyway well

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.449 
survive on such little water anyway well
don't<00:02:04.459> look<00:02:04.640> at<00:02:04.819> me<00:02:05.030> take<00:02:05.509> a<00:02:05.569> closer<00:02:05.959> look<00:02:06.459> at

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
don't look at me take a closer look at

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.059 
don't look at me take a closer look at
this<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:09.080> might<00:02:09.319> thing<00:02:09.590> for<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.860> dry

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
this you might thing for the dry

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.800 
this you might thing for the dry
environment<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.789> desert<00:02:11.060> wouldn't<00:02:11.660> be<00:02:11.720> able

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
environment of a desert wouldn't be able

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.199 
environment of a desert wouldn't be able
to<00:02:11.959> support<00:02:12.170> life<00:02:12.590> but<00:02:13.010> all<00:02:13.220> deserts<00:02:13.819> except

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
to support life but all deserts except

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.630 
to support life but all deserts except
the<00:02:14.300> most<00:02:14.450> extreme<00:02:15.110> dry<00:02:15.530> deserts<00:02:16.130> support

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
the most extreme dry deserts support

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.570 
the most extreme dry deserts support
life<00:02:16.880> cacti<00:02:17.750> are<00:02:17.989> by<00:02:18.170> far<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.500> best<00:02:18.709> evolved

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
life cacti are by far the best evolved

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.010 
life cacti are by far the best evolved
desert<00:02:19.970> plants<00:02:20.450> with<00:02:20.569> their<00:02:20.660> distinctive

long round cylindrical shape which helps

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.990 
long round cylindrical shape which helps
the<00:02:24.140> plant<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.680> hold<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.980> most<00:02:25.160> water<00:02:25.580> without
