okay<00:00:14.129> so<00:00:14.190> let's<00:00:14.639> quickly<00:00:14.879> go<00:00:15.209> over<00:00:15.260> some

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
okay so let's quickly go over some

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.170 
okay so let's quickly go over some
typical<00:00:16.440> workflows<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.190> 3d<00:00:17.460> codes<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.970> how

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
typical workflows in 3d codes and how

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.240 
typical workflows in 3d codes and how
they<00:00:18.360> involve<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.020> different<00:00:19.350> workspaces<00:00:19.920> or

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
they involve the different workspaces or

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.090 
they involve the different workspaces or
rooms<00:00:20.960> if<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.170> want<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.440> do<00:00:22.530> some<00:00:22.710> texture

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
rooms if you want to do some texture

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.550 
rooms if you want to do some texture
painting<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:23.940> pay<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.870> texture<00:00:25.350> maps

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
painting you can pay on texture maps

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
inside of the paint room or you can

you can start a model from scratch there
you<00:00:33.629> can<00:00:33.780> sculpt<00:00:34.140> detail<00:00:34.680> even<00:00:34.980> paint<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.120> to

you can sculpt detail even paint but to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.970 
you can sculpt detail even paint but to
paint<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.570> need<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> go<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.440> paint<00:00:37.770> room

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
voxels in paint room in this case I

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.430 
voxels in paint room in this case I
don't<00:00:46.680> want<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.860> show<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:48.350> because<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
don't want to show that because I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.660 
don't want to show that because I
already<00:00:49.560> have<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> mesh<00:00:50.130> here<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.489> I'll<00:00:50.550> hit

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
already have a mesh here and I'll hit

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.260 
already have a mesh here and I'll hit
the<00:00:50.760> four<00:00:51.000> key<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.450> you<00:00:51.540> can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:54.620> but<00:00:56.120> if<00:00:57.120> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the four key so you can see but if I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.540 
the four key so you can see but if I
were<00:00:57.510> to<00:01:00.230> hide<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.950> objects<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
were to hide these objects that I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.469 
were to hide these objects that I
already<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.970> merged<00:01:03.270> into<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> paint<00:01:04.110> room

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
already have merged into the paint room

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.080 
already have merged into the paint room
and<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.630> enable<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.549> voxel

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and now enable that you can see my voxel

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.620 
and now enable that you can see my voxel
model<00:01:09.240> here<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> paint<00:01:10.380> room<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.070> use

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
model here in paint room and I can use

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
model here in paint room and I can use
the<00:01:12.630> layers<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> very<00:01:13.950> same<00:01:14.340> manner

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the layers just in the very same manner

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.170 
the layers just in the very same manner
as<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.450> would<00:01:15.720> regular<00:01:16.320> texture<00:01:16.620> painting<00:01:17.180> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
as I would regular texture painting so

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.520 
as I would regular texture painting so
it<00:01:18.330> works<00:01:18.510> almost<00:01:18.690> identical<00:01:20.150> there's<00:01:21.150> one

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
it works almost identical there's one

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.090 
it works almost identical there's one
caveat<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.430> depth<00:01:23.990> channel<00:01:24.990> does<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.860> work

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
caveat the depth channel does not work

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
caveat the depth channel does not work
with<00:01:26.310> vertex<00:01:26.610> painting<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.390> simply

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
with vertex painting because it's simply

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.620 
with vertex painting because it's simply
storing<00:01:28.260> color<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.090> specular<00:01:30.090> information

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
storing color and specular information

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
storing color and specular information
as<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.229> recording<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.700> want

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
as of this recording so if you want

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.780 
as of this recording so if you want
depth<00:01:33.630> obviously<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:35.040> already<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> voxel

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
depth obviously you already have a voxel

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.399 
depth obviously you already have a voxel
model<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.390> use<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> sculpting<00:01:37.200> tools

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
model so you can use the sculpting tools

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.910 
model so you can use the sculpting tools
in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.610> voxel<00:01:38.970> room<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.600> very<00:01:39.810> purpose

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
in the voxel room for that very purpose

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
in the voxel room for that very purpose
okay<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.479> then<00:01:42.479> what<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.320> from

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
okay and then what you would do from

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
okay and then what you would do from
that<00:01:43.710> point<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.540> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.780> don't<00:01:46.049> need<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:47.189> low

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that point is if you don't need a low

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.960 
that point is if you don't need a low
poly<00:01:48.420> model<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:50.009> bake<00:01:50.159> all<00:01:50.369> those<00:01:50.490> textures<00:01:50.790> on

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
poly model to bake all those textures on

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.289 
poly model to bake all those textures on
to<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.680> still<00:01:53.100> render<00:01:54.090> or

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
to you can just do a still render or

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.880 
to you can just do a still render or
something<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.900> sort<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.650> if<00:01:55.740> you're<00:01:55.860> just

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
something of that sort or if you're just

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.429 
something of that sort or if you're just
a<00:01:56.220> some<00:01:57.000> product<00:01:57.360> design<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:57.720> quick

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
a some product design or quick

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.590 
a some product design or quick
prototyping<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.759> really<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.180> even<00:02:00.270> need

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
prototyping you really don't even need

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.499 
prototyping you really don't even need
to<00:02:00.659> do<00:02:00.900> any<00:02:01.080> reach<00:02:01.229> apology<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:03.000> could<00:02:03.240> just

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
to do any reach apology you could just

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.749 
to do any reach apology you could just
send<00:02:03.720> us<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.650> an<00:02:04.740> external<00:02:04.950> application<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
send us to an external application and

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.380 
send us to an external application and
use<00:02:06.140> vertex<00:02:07.140> color<00:02:07.439> maps<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.640> represent<00:02:09.119> all

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
use vertex color maps to represent all

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.710 
use vertex color maps to represent all
this<00:02:09.539> color<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.049> you've<00:02:10.200> painted<00:02:11.659> okay<00:02:12.659> so

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this color that you've painted okay so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.370 
this color that you've painted okay so
let's<00:02:13.049> go<00:02:13.170> back<00:02:14.270> uncheck<00:02:15.270> this

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
let's go back uncheck this

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.080 
let's go back uncheck this
that<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.920> voxel<00:02:18.310> object<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.730> no<00:02:18.880> longer

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
that the voxel object is no longer

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.110 
that the voxel object is no longer
showing<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.690> paint<00:02:19.870> room<00:02:20.790> I'm<00:02:21.790> gonna<00:02:21.940> go

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
showing in the paint room I'm gonna go

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.540 
showing in the paint room I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.920> turn<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:24.070> objects<00:02:24.430> back<00:02:24.610> on<00:02:25.110> okay

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
ahead and turn my objects back on okay

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.140 
ahead and turn my objects back on okay
so<00:02:28.230> what<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.290> can<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.860> if<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.190> have<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> model

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
so what I can do is if I have a model

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.480 
so what I can do is if I have a model
that<00:02:31.330> I've<00:02:31.690> created<00:02:31.930> outside<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.710> 30<00:02:32.920> coat<00:02:33.250> I

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
that I've created outside of 30 coat I

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.520 
that I've created outside of 30 coat I
can<00:02:33.700> always<00:02:33.970> bring<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.300> in<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.170> typical

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530

so<00:03:01.000> again<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.720> said<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.960> would<00:03:02.100> suggest

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
so again like I said I would suggest

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.210 
so again like I said I would suggest
going<00:03:03.490> to<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.850> manual<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:05.100> there<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.190> a

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
going to the manual and there is a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.150 
going to the manual and there is a
section<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:07.000> an<00:03:07.360> entire<00:03:07.780> page<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.740> covers

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
section that an entire page that covers

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.100 
section that an entire page that covers
the<00:03:09.370> differences<00:03:09.790> between<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.300> two<00:03:10.480> and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
the differences between the two and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.960 
the differences between the two and
we'll<00:03:11.530> also<00:03:11.650> talk<00:03:11.890> about<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.280> further<00:03:12.490> in<00:03:12.790> a

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
we'll also talk about it further in a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.650 
we'll also talk about it further in a
separate<00:03:13.360> video

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
separate video

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.820

PTX<00:03:15.780> simply<00:03:16.780> allows<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:18.540> dynamically

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
PTX simply allows you to dynamically

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.130 
PTX simply allows you to dynamically
paint<00:03:20.830> areas<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.550> you<00:03:21.700> want<00:03:21.970> greater<00:03:22.570> levels

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
paint areas that you want greater levels

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.060 
paint areas that you want greater levels
of<00:03:23.200> detail<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:24.030> ptex<00:03:25.030> will<00:03:25.300> automatically

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
of detail and ptex will automatically

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.580 
of detail and ptex will automatically
scale<00:03:27.070> those<00:03:27.910> polygons<00:03:28.480> up<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.080> zero-one

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
scale those polygons up in the zero-one

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.490 
scale those polygons up in the zero-one
texture<00:03:30.100> space<00:03:30.310> for<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:31.140> okay<00:03:32.140> so<00:03:32.200> there

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
texture space for you okay so there

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.230 
texture space for you okay so there
again<00:03:32.950> there<00:03:33.430> are<00:03:33.490> some<00:03:33.610> advantages<00:03:34.000> and

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
again there are some advantages and

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.850 
again there are some advantages and
disadvantages<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.990> that<00:03:35.140> approach<00:03:35.410> as<00:03:35.680> well

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
disadvantages to that approach as well

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.890 
disadvantages to that approach as well
but<00:03:36.520> we'll<00:03:36.730> will<00:03:37.060> touch<00:03:37.240> on<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.570> in<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.810> later

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
but we'll will touch on that in a later

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.980 
but we'll will touch on that in a later
video<00:03:38.490> okay<00:03:39.490> so<00:03:39.550> if<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.090> want<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.480> start<00:03:40.810> off

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
video okay so if you want to start off

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.740 
video okay so if you want to start off
in<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.350> voxel<00:03:41.740> room<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.820> do<00:03:43.090> your<00:03:43.240> sculpting

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
in the voxel room to do your sculpting

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.260 
in the voxel room to do your sculpting
and<00:03:43.960> detailing<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.620> such<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:45.640> can<00:03:45.700> simply<00:03:46.120> go

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
and detailing and such you can simply go

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.820 
and detailing and such you can simply go
to<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:47.170> voxel<00:03:47.500> workspace<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.820> file<00:03:49.090> menu

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
to the voxel workspace the file menu

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.980 
to the voxel workspace the file menu
merge<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:51.780> model<00:03:52.780> into<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.050> paint<00:03:53.260> room<00:03:54.990> you

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
merge a model into the paint room you

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.840 
merge a model into the paint room you
can<00:03:56.110> also<00:03:56.260> use<00:03:56.910> under<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.000> object<00:03:58.150> section<00:03:59.850> go

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
can also use under the object section go

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.220 
can also use under the object section go
to<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.000> merge<00:04:01.209> tab<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.810> does<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.020> same

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
to the merge tab and it does the same

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.810 
to the merge tab and it does the same
same<00:04:02.890> thing<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:04.540> you'll<00:04:04.750> see<00:04:04.990> a<00:04:05.310> tool<00:04:06.310> options

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
same thing and you'll see a tool options

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.620 
same thing and you'll see a tool options
panel<00:04:07.030> here<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:08.709> can<00:04:09.420> choose<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.720> have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
panel here and you can choose to have

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.300 
panel here and you can choose to have
the<00:04:13.630> different<00:04:14.020> objects<00:04:14.770> come<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.160> as

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
the different objects come in as

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.170 
the different objects come in as
separate<00:04:15.940> instances<00:04:16.480> or<00:04:17.080> separate<00:04:17.500> volumes

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
separate instances or separate volumes

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.820 
separate instances or separate volumes
you<00:04:19.180> can<00:04:19.330> also<00:04:19.480> merge<00:04:19.780> without<00:04:19.959> voxel<00:04:20.470> izing

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
you can also merge without voxel izing

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.560 
you can also merge without voxel izing
and<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.040> will<00:04:21.250> basically<00:04:21.640> bring<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.270> in<00:04:22.390> in

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
and this will basically bring it in in

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.870 
and this will basically bring it in in
surface<00:04:23.020> mode<00:04:23.230> where<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.650> don't<00:04:24.010> have<00:04:24.190> any

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
surface mode where you don't have any

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.550

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
volume to be concerned about it's just

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.790 
volume to be concerned about it's just

you see this in white here is

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.260 
you see this in white here is
they<00:04:31.570> just<00:04:31.750> a<00:04:31.870> little<00:04:32.320> proxy<00:04:32.830> container<00:04:33.400> to

they just a little proxy container to

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.150 
they just a little proxy container to

more control over the topology okay so

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
to do and through your code you just

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.420 
to do and through your code you just
quickly<00:06:07.600> create<00:06:08.020> your<00:06:08.200> seams<00:06:11.160> hold<00:06:12.160> the<00:06:12.250> shift

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
quickly create your seams hold the shift

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.090 
quickly create your seams hold the shift
key<00:06:12.670> and<00:06:12.910> I<00:06:13.090> can<00:06:13.120> create<00:06:13.570> quick<00:06:13.960> loops<00:06:14.260> just

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
key and I can create quick loops just

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.590 
key and I can create quick loops just
like<00:06:15.310> that

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
like that

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.920 
like that
I'll<00:06:17.050> undo<00:06:17.410> and<00:06:18.420> once<00:06:19.420> you've<00:06:19.570> created<00:06:19.780> your

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
I'll undo and once you've created your

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.610 
I'll undo and once you've created your
seams<00:06:20.290> just<00:06:20.800> simply<00:06:21.420> unwrap<00:06:22.420> and<00:06:22.750> so<00:06:23.410> once

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
seams just simply unwrap and so once

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.990 
seams just simply unwrap and so once
you're<00:06:23.740> done<00:06:25.020> you<00:06:26.020> would<00:06:26.430> merge<00:06:27.430> it<00:06:27.580> into<00:06:27.880> the

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
you're done you would merge it into the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.580 
you're done you would merge it into the
