 and medicinal herbs are used by 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.230
 healers nutritionists and doctors of 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.839
 all kinds to treat various conditions 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.610
 medical a condition that can 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.279
 respond positively to treatment 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.340
 with herbs is the resistance to 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.560
 insulin this is a condition in which 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.140
 the effectiveness of the hormone insulin 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.350
 released by the body to control the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.660
 glucose production is reduced the 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.780
 Insulin resistance can be 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.690
 caused by several factors including 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.899
 but not limited to obesity lack of 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.300
 high blood pressure exercise 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.190
 adult diabetes and smoking in the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.890
 people who have resistance to 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.559
 insulin the body produces enough 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.170
 amount of insulin but the cells of 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.589
 the muscles the fat and the liver do not the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.079
 used to convert glucose into energy 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:58.449
 effectively as a result their bodies 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.120
 they need more insulin to help 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.900
 release glucose from the cells the 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.120
 pancreas the organ that produces insulin 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.150
 overcompensate by producing levels 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.520
 high insulin anyway the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.040
 body can not use it effectively and 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.560
 the result is excessive levels of 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.110
 glucose and insulin in the blood that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.110
 often ends in adult diabetes 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.930
 Other symptoms include difficulties 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.350
 to regulate body weight a high 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.940
 blood pressure and high cholesterol 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.250
 several herbs can improve the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.980
 glucose levels and lower levels 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.380
 of insulin several herbs can 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.660
 improve insulin resistance and 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.660
 Go down on an empty stomach and after the levels 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.340
 of the glucose meals the extract of 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.680
 fenugreek has shown to lower the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.690
 insulin production and levels of 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.180
 insulin after meals when 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.210
 it is used in variable doses 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.670
 cinnamon a commonly called cinnamon is 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.760
 a traditional herb used in the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.920
 Chinese medicine the main action of the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.500
 Cinnamon is the reduction of production 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.810
 of glucose from the liver in the same way 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.660
 like metformin drugs 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 Prescribed faucet is another herb that 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.780
 can decrease insulin levels 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.120
 for the days 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.610
 about diabetics that have levels 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.069
 high insulin and resistance to 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.020
 insulin grifol to increase the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.480
 insulin sensitivity of the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.610
 cells by reducing the amount of 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.340
 insulin that your body produces for 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.530
 control your glucose levels all 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.900
 these herbs have the potential to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.550
 reduce the level of glucose by 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.370
 improvement of insulin sensitivity 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.590
 inside the cells making your 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.300
 body produce less to handle the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.300
 insulin resistance
