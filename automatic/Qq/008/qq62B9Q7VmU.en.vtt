okay<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.770> is<00:00:01.949> May<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:03.060> 12th<00:00:03.470> 2009<00:00:05.029> this<00:00:06.029> will

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
okay this is May the 12th 2009 this will

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.849 
okay this is May the 12th 2009 this will
probably<00:00:06.509> be<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.720> last<00:00:06.870> video<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.620> school

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
probably be the last video of the school

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.030 
probably be the last video of the school
year<00:00:08.540> we've<00:00:09.540> gotten<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.080> close<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.559> getting<00:00:10.889> it

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
year we've gotten so close to getting it

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.270 
year we've gotten so close to getting it
done<00:00:11.280> but<00:00:11.639> yet<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.090> far<00:00:12.300> away<00:00:12.889> we've<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.099> run

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
done but yet so far away we've just run

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.279 
done but yet so far away we've just run
out<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> school<00:00:14.820> year<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> next<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.960> only<00:00:16.109> have

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
out of school year the next we only have

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.779 
out of school year the next we only have
about<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.560> week<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.010> half<00:00:17.039> left<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
about a week and a half left in the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.779 
about a week and a half left in the
school<00:00:18.060> year<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.279> that<00:00:20.279> time<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.670> going

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
school year here and that time is going

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.320 
school year here and that time is going
to<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:20.910> spent<00:00:21.330> reviewing<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:23.269> cleaning<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
to be spent reviewing and cleaning the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.150 
to be spent reviewing and cleaning the
shop<00:00:24.630> up<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.410> type<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.710> thing<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:28.160> I'll

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
shop up and that type of thing so I'll

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.620 
shop up and that type of thing so I'll
just<00:00:29.429> show<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.849> what<00:00:30.119> we've<00:00:30.269> gotten

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
just show you what we've gotten

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.870 
just show you what we've gotten
accomplished<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.500> point<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.759> can

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
accomplished up to this point as you can

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
accomplished up to this point as you can
see<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> radiator<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.020> fully<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.710> place

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
see the radiator now is fully in place

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.450 
see the radiator now is fully in place
fans<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.760> place<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.300> got<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.780> working

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
fans in place we got all that working

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.209 
fans in place we got all that working
the<00:00:39.350> everything<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> pretty<00:00:40.770> much<00:00:41.010> found

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the everything is pretty much found

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.729 
the everything is pretty much found
itself<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> home<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.210> exception<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
itself a home with the exception of the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.430 
itself a home with the exception of the
ECU<00:00:44.399> I'm<00:00:45.329> thinking<00:00:45.809> I'm<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.260> have

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
ECU I'm thinking I'm just going to have

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.100 
ECU I'm thinking I'm just going to have
to<00:00:46.879> probably<00:00:47.879> wrap<00:00:48.090> some<00:00:48.329> insulation<00:00:48.809> around

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
to probably wrap some insulation around

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
to probably wrap some insulation around
that<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.800> good<00:00:50.010> bit<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:50.850> just

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that a good bit of it and then just

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.479 
that a good bit of it and then just
strap<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.629> somewhere<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:53.010> any<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> y'all

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
strap it down somewhere if any of y'all

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.430 
strap it down somewhere if any of y'all
out<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.670> may<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.360> better<00:00:54.930> suggestion

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
out there may have a better suggestion

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560 
out there may have a better suggestion
I'm<00:00:55.739> open<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I'm open for it I really don't like that

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.340 
I'm open for it I really don't like that
idea

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
idea

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.100 
idea
but<00:00:59.629> we<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:02.120> wires<00:01:03.120> cannot<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.750> extended

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
but we the wires cannot be extended

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350 
but we the wires cannot be extended
because<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.580> when<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> extend<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
because when you do when you extend the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
because when you do when you extend the
wires<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.990> through<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.380> ECU<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.100> change

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
wires going through your ECU you change

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.330 
wires going through your ECU you change
the<00:01:08.670> resistance<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:10.770> throwing

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the resistance and then throwing

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.270 
the resistance and then throwing
everything<00:01:11.790> else<00:01:12.000> off<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.070> not

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
everything else off so that's really not

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
everything else off so that's really not
an<00:01:14.430> option<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.880> wish<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.420> could<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
an option I wish I could just put it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.120 
an option I wish I could just put it
somewhere<00:01:16.140> totally<00:01:16.590> different<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.009> that's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
somewhere totally different but that's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.910 
somewhere totally different but that's
just<00:01:17.310> where<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> wiring<00:01:17.970> harness<00:01:18.330> wound<00:01:18.570> up

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
just where the wiring harness wound up

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
just where the wiring harness wound up
putting<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.130> at<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.330> everything

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
putting it at as you can see everything

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.740 
putting it at as you can see everything
else<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.380> place<00:01:22.729> only<00:01:23.729> other<00:01:24.060> thing<00:01:24.390> oh<00:01:24.509> yes

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
else is in place only other thing oh yes

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
else is in place only other thing oh yes
and<00:01:24.960> we've<00:01:25.080> got<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.500> find<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.950> home<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and we've got to find a home for the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.390 
and we've got to find a home for the
cruise<00:01:26.790> control<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:27.420> well<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.350> here

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.950 

probably<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.000> having<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.479> bolt<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
probably just one of having to bolt it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.850 
probably just one of having to bolt it
on<00:01:34.049> top<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:35.040> something<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:36.860> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
on top of that or something like that to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.319 
on top of that or something like that to
get<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.430> work<00:01:40.579> only<00:01:41.579> other<00:01:41.729> thing<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
get that to work only other thing of the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.929 
get that to work only other thing of the
hood<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.720> really<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.229> truly<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.939> is

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
hood we really and truly like is

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.090 
hood we really and truly like is
extending<00:01:45.840> our<00:01:45.990> AC<00:01:46.170> hoses<00:01:46.770> which<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
extending our AC hoses which you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.789 
extending our AC hoses which you
probably<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.670> can't<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.299> here

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
probably really can't see it from here

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.840 
probably really can't see it from here
you<00:01:49.799> might<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:52.399> one<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> filler

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you might can see the one of the filler

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.170 
you might can see the one of the filler
tubes<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.020> low<00:01:55.259> side<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
tubes for I think the low side there you

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.340 
tubes for I think the low side there you
can't<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> compressor<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:58.200> it's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
can't see the compressor because it's

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.260 
can't see the compressor because it's
way<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> bottom<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.909> anyway

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
way down there on the bottom but anyway

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.420 
way down there on the bottom but anyway

most the major stuff is done if I had a

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.530 
most the major stuff is done if I had a
driveshaft<00:02:32.099> made<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.849> right<00:02:33.060> now<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.450> could

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.880 
driveshaft made for right now we could
probably<00:02:33.690> put<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.200> gear<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:34.590> actually

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
probably put it in gear and actually

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.910 
probably put it in gear and actually
move<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:36.390> will<00:02:36.540> crank<00:02:36.840> now<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.319> start<00:02:37.590> and
