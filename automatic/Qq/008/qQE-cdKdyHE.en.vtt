00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 all beaver dear friends with you money 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 and today we'll talk about the top 10 most 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.639
 big puzzles 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.139
 is five nights at freddys 3 if you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.610
 liked this video don't forget 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 please like and also 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.610
 tell your friends about new secrets 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 new pizzeria 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.350
 Well, we ran to the video and in tenth place 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.630
 us a fire about which we can read in 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.830
 newspaper after passing 6 nights under 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.689
 name nightmare 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.340
 First, the question was whether this fire 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.590
 because nightmar translate with 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.660
 English is a nightmare so maybe 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.230
 the main character just dreamed that he 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.630
 burned out 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.489
 but also the question is what after this fire 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
 survived the springtrap can lighten up 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.239
 you will see the newspaper that springtrap is behind 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.309
 however, we only see his head 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.840
 maybe only the head and survived or 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.840
 maybe it's just an old photo 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.059
 for now it's hard to say for sure on the ninth 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.710
 the place we have a mysterious story which 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.780
 told in mini-games 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.100
 they do not understand almost everything if we 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.440
 see the five nights at story 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.360
 freddy's throughout the two parts 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.239
 at least nine children have been killed 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.770
 why then only five here too 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 when animatronics moved they 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.280
 moved because they were driven by children 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.470
 or because these animatronics 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.659
 moved according to their program 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.290
 for both points of view can be said for and 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.090
 vs 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.650
 if you want to say in the comments i 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.600
 then made a separate video about it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.729
 the question also arises that after these 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.409
 mini-games and happens because we 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.299
 saw in the mini-game purple guy 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.970
 climbed springtrap followed got 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.830
 injury incompatible life but five 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 nights at freddys 3 see my which 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 moves and tries to attack us and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.759
 here we are slowly moving on to the next 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.159
 whether the springtrap is alive 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.780
 springtrap lively purple guy or 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.390
 is it just animatronic which 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.640
 wound the corpse of a violet guy 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.320
 he moves according to his 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.180
 the program is in the pictures 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.460
 showing the sprint we see that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.220
 inside the springtrap there is definitely a man and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.439
 this is definitely a purple guy but alive 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 whether he you say no he is not alive because 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.420
 that he was badly hurt because you 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.130
 look it punched with iron sticks 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.500
 before and plus his skin to put it mildly not 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.290
 looks healthy but why then do u 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.930
 trying on 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.780
 love maybe springtrape not body from 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.060
 the spirit of the violet guy next riddle 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.010
 this is a phantom and where did they come from why 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500
 they attack our main character and 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.780
 why do we see them you say because 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.820
 ventilation creates them after all said 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.490
 fungal still that ventilation can 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.070
 create hallucinations and pieces if not 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.990
 still by fnaf2 we know that puppet 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.750
 can also influence animatronics and 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.850
 people and judging by camera 8 because we 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.020
 there we see a puppet actually is 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.150
 five nights at freddys 3 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.180
 I will tell about it in more detail next 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.640
 the video is already what if this puppet 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.280
 creates all these horrible phantoms then 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.170
 question why does she have this next question on 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.820
 which usually gave answers five nights 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.000
 at freddy's one five nights at freddys 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.130
 2 who our mysterious beta tester for 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.810
 the plot of the game our main character is a guy 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.610
 who comes to this place for 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.860
 order to check how much she is 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.530
 works well and then if everything is good 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.989
 works to be here a man who 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.500
 acting as guard scare 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.050
 people 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.090
 however, the game does not say what is his name and 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.370
 how much did he work here before 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.260
 started five nights at freddys 3 and then 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.360
 that he worked here before no doubt 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.239
 cause after all the background guy told us about 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.010
 what's good that you came again this 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.620
 since you will be much more fun than 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.720
 last times that is very opaque 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.820
 hints that he is here at least not in 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.250
 first time again smoothly go to 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.320
 the next riddle and who is this new background 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.030
 gay he appears in the plot suddenly 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.930
 starts telling all about it 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.610
 attraction and after that also suddenly 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.430
 disappears last night says yes yes 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.890
 yes you found a cool thing it's all me 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.510
 come up and runs away and he promised us 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.480
 come back and meet us again 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.390
 however, he did not meet us until the end 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.880
 the whole story who is he and what is with him 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.110
 happened in the future this mystery which 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.989
 remains unanswered 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.750
 but he mentioned from secret rooms about 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.880
 who told us more von guy by 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.739
 their words have such things as secret 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.090
 rooms they existed in all 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.330
 pizzerias but one fine 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.190
 the moment they closed 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.930
 it is known what was kept in these secret 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.640
 The rooms say that it was stored there. 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.280
 equipment that is no longer in use 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.170
 but why then about these secret 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.420
 rooms are not allowed to talk to families 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.420
 parents insurance companies and all 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.320
 the rest and why it is advised if suddenly 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.510
 you clean 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.580
 go to that room what is it 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.260
 a small graveyard inside this pizzeria 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.870
 the only thing that is clear there rather 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.910
 just kept the springtrap well what else 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.250
 so terrible there could keep that 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.680
 keep this secret so next 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.540
 where did springtrap come from and where is it 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.310
 was the first night drew attention to 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.140
 the mini game that we see five nights 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.930
 at freddys 3 there except you 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.540
 Springtrap see three machines that 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.590
 we can also see in the game itself five 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.590
 nights at freddys 3 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.080
 however these automata stand there itself 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.600
 the first night and here is the springtrap in the first 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.760
 the night is still not present, respectively, beyond that 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.040
 the creators of the attraction found this room 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.260
 before the first night they managed to plunder it and 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.200
 all that they found there put in the attraction 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.660
 however, the springtrap was not found there because 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.210
 First springtrap there for 2 nights and 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.490
 in the first it is not, and in the second itself is fungal 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.220
 trying to tell us 2 nights that he 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.680
 found some kind of animatronic then 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.300
 the question arises where was it stored with 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.850
 which before they found him 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.040
 and how he got there because 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.680
 believe mini-game purple guy died 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.750
 after having been tasks of springtrap and 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.940
 in theory, he should have stayed in this 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.710
 the room where it will then find our background 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.810
 guy put us in the old man 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.660
 However, judging by the machines, he is not there 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.880
 found where he lived or did hyundai come 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.470
 his immediately and then why he decided us 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.750
 tell about it only for 2 nights 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.540
 introduce the springtrap in the second night of the game 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.510
 they are in 1 next riddle this riddle 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.760
 about the shadows of animatronics what it is 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.680
 where did they come from polina game we see 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.780
 that the shadows of animatronics she is not easy 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.850
 animatronics after all while 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.330
 animatronics in mini-games go on their 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.790
 two 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.470
 Bonnie Day for example flies and can 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.500
 teleport that at least 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.840
 showing that unusual robot he's something 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.270
 like bringing also five nights at 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.300
 freddys 2 we see besides the shadow more 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.400
 and purple freddy 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.560
 we see it as well and in the third part that 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.169
 This is for animatronics where they came from and 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.990
 which goal does not fulfill it is still the same 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.659
 remains a mystery nakida and more mystery on 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.849
 Guy's background theme and records from which we have it 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:30.889
 hear by phone we are told that these 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.110
 records antediluvian them found at some 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.300
 a pizzeria and I know exactly that 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.889
 pre-series five nights at freddy's 1 and 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.139
 not five nights at freddys 2 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.599
 because all the audio recordings from there we would 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.449
 heard while playing a game then from where 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:46.940
 this family deiner can be a pizzeria 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.340
 which was before the first part or maybe 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.680
 be a pizzeria to 2 or maybe it 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.719
 Generally some kind of pizzeria which 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.180
 was between 1 and 2 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.370
 about which we have not known until now and 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.590
 I did not even know personally when I 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.090
 translated phone ha I noticed that he 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.759
 as if hinting that pizza 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.099
 at the same time there are a few but by 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:09.650
 our previous theory was the sight and 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:12.110
 one after another family tenor 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.360
 then from fnaf 2 then after closing 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.009
 pizza fnaf 2 pets means on ff1 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.289
 we have never heard from others 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.659
 pizzerias that exist along with 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.909
 these three what was this pizzeria 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:24.680
 and when she was well and last 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:27.500
 riddle fnaf 3 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.419
 this is the end i mean no end to sleep 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.210
 on the digit dice as a game and I mean 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:34.190
 as the plot after all seems to be on all the riddles 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.449
 There were almost riddles left 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.490
 who were in the past 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:38.960
 animatronics though sold but possible 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.060
 ideas animatronics will no longer 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.250
 no action to make the soul of 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.590
 they went seemingly sold springtrap 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.020
 However, this is not a fact either. 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.940
 the continuation of this story or scott 

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.069
 for myself this story is completed and now 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.169
 will tell us profanely dinar and 

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:56.120
 other restaurants that were in the past 

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:57.919
 about this i think we can only 

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.879
 guess and wait for it to come out 

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.529
 next part 

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:04.840
 and on it I say goodbye to you all thanks 

00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:04.840
 bye bye bye good luck
