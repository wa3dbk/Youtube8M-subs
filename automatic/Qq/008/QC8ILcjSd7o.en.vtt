 fast pretty simple there you can and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.520
 I leave the link so that the checks and 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.770
 Well, first we'll have to go to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.149
 cydia once all the packages are loaded 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.219
 everything what they have to be 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 cydia updates let's go to the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.860
 pay the part where it says look and we go 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.860
 to write very music music 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.010
 4 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.989
 m as you will see I already have it installed 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.210
 let's open I do not wait for them to load 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.129
 the big box repertoire is totally 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.350
 Free almost all those who have city ​​already 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.049
 they have this report attached and so 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.549
 well the version is the 1.9 the one that 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.830
 seems to modify but you are going to 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.570
 seem to install in Europe from us going to 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.450
 ask us to do the re springboard and 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.310
 that is going to be everything and have already done the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.340
 restart good we will appear this 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.509
 application is called music for me and then 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.480
 well here I already have some songs 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.700
 downloaded 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.920
 it was advertising 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.540
 let's go in the part where it says 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.730
 search for 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.950
 and here we are going to look for the song that 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.350
 we want the one we want 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.920
 download in this case I'm going to download 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.020
 one is called animals de martín gárriz la 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.820
 advantage of this application is that 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.550
 we will be able to listen to it before 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.650
 download it that seems a point to your 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.500
 very big favor we will be able to listen 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.450
 the music in its own music player 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.090
 or import it directly to the player 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.220
 from the iphone and so good here and 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.560
 finding the song that I am 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.840
 looking I'm going to give him play and then 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.490
 to be able to listen to the right nap in the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.950
 I'm looking for in this case I do not 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.080
 I put audio for copyright all that 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.759
 that you are going to be able to check and 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.619
 well, apparently, like saying the 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.600
 song that I was looking for I'm going to give 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.270
 now in download and I will appear 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.400
 here number one in downloads and it goes 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.410
 to be downloading because it's pretty 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.330
 fast compared to how I have in 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.709
 internet and I'll advance a bit the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.660
 video in what you end up downloading 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.060
 the song and well then it's going to end 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.920
 to download and once downloaded 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.810
 will transfer directly to start 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.940
 here we will be able to hear you in your 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.200
 player but the fascinating thing about this 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.569
 application is that you for me 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.849
 will go directly to the player of the 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.530
 iphone we are just going to 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.980
 select the song that we want 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.500
 import we will give you import song 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.750
 and it is not going to port directly 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.940
 a little on what is this importing the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.410
 Another advantage is that since no 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.630
 we want the songs we can go 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.730
 also eliminating slipping towards the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.260
 the left and once here in the 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.670
 iphone player there are some 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.430
 repeated but you can eliminate them 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.769
 eliminating with sliding to the left 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.049
 and well, here is the song that 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.330
 download and it's complete and so good 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.920
 I hope you liked the video is already 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.340
 that we do not need to connect our 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.709
 phone to itunes and well then we can 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.299
 download enough music and had to leave 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.940
 here below the video I had let it rest 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.700
 that he used and well there are some repose 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.140
 where you get the free tweets good 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.880
 and this is all I hope you liked the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.380
 video if you liked comments do not forget 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.380
