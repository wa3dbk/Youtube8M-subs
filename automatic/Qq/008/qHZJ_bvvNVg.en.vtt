double bands and today I'm just going to

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.419 
double bands and today I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.410> single<00:00:13.799> bands<00:00:14.190> because

it's a little bit easier and you can try

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.070 
it's a little bit easier and you can try
it<00:00:17.010> later<00:00:17.250> using<00:00:17.520> two<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:18.840> I'm<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.020> to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
it later using two so what I'm going to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.140 
it later using two so what I'm going to
do<00:00:19.230> first<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.710> start<00:00:19.770> with<00:00:20.070> my<00:00:20.220> loom<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
do first is start with my loom in the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.370 
do first is start with my loom in the
staggered<00:00:21.510> position<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.199> arrow

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
staggered position with the arrow

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.130 
staggered position with the arrow
pointing<00:00:22.470> away<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.369> I'm<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.420> load<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
pointing away and I'm going to load the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.500 
pointing away and I'm going to load the
outside<00:00:25.590> edge<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> flower<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.119> that's<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
outside edge of the flower so that's the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.599 
outside edge of the flower so that's the
part<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.260> goes<00:00:28.529> around<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.070> edge<00:00:29.099> so

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
part here that goes around the edge so

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.790 
part here that goes around the edge so
I'm<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.390> start<00:00:30.660> off<00:00:30.810> using<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.529> dark

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.580 

all<00:01:40.430> right<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:41.690> now<00:01:41.810> we've<00:01:41.960> built<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.320> center

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
all right so now we've built the center

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.960 
all right so now we've built the center
of<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.800> flower<00:01:43.040> we<00:01:43.370> just<00:01:43.520> have<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.790> add<00:01:43.940> a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
of the flower we just have to add a

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.060 
of the flower we just have to add a
capping<00:01:44.480> band<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.080> middle<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:45.890> we're

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
capping band to the middle so we're

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.730 
capping band to the middle so we're
going<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.250> make<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.430> figure<00:01:46.700> eight<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.740> double

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
going to make a figure eight and double

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.040 
going to make a figure eight and double
it<00:01:48.860> up<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.310> that<00:01:49.340> we've<00:01:49.580> got<00:01:49.610> two<00:01:49.970> layers<00:01:50.180> now

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
it up so that we've got two layers now

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.300 
it up so that we've got two layers now
we're<00:01:51.200> just<00:01:51.290> going<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.500> load<00:01:51.770> those<00:01:52.040> two

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
we're just going to load those two

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.070 
we're just going to load those two
together<00:01:52.600> onto<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.470> center<00:01:54.890> peg<00:01:55.900> so<00:01:56.900> this<00:01:56.990> is

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
together onto the center peg so this is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.580 
together onto the center peg so this is
going<00:01:57.230> to<00:01:57.320> hold<00:01:57.470> your<00:01:57.650> flower<00:01:57.920> together<00:01:59.590> all

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590

going<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.470> use<00:04:27.650> green<00:04:27.920> for<00:04:28.760> my<00:04:29.450> finishing<00:04:29.660> off

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
going to use green for my finishing off

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.200 
going to use green for my finishing off
because<00:04:30.380> it's<00:04:30.530> sort<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.890> like<00:04:30.980> it's<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.490> stem

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
because it's sort of like it's the stem

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.270 
because it's sort of like it's the stem
of<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.390> flower<00:04:32.450> so<00:04:33.410> what<00:04:33.530> I'm<00:04:33.620> doing<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:34.130> I'm

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
of the flower so what I'm doing is I'm

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.970 
of the flower so what I'm doing is I'm
just<00:04:34.310> going<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.610> stretch<00:04:34.940> this<00:04:35.270> band<00:04:35.740> on<00:04:36.740> my

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
just going to stretch this band on my

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.260 
just going to stretch this band on my
hook<00:04:37.220> right<00:04:37.820> here

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
hook right here

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.379 
hook right here
nice<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.110> tight<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:41.280> I'm<00:04:41.639> gonna<00:04:41.729> pull<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.210> up

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
nice and tight and I'm gonna pull it up

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.110 
nice and tight and I'm gonna pull it up
through<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.199> middle<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.949> all<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.789> these<00:04:44.940> other

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
through the middle of all of these other

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.620 
through the middle of all of these other
colors

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
colors

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.510 
colors
that's<00:04:47.230> a<00:04:47.320> little<00:04:47.500> tricky<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:47.920> do<00:04:48.160> but<00:04:48.190> if<00:04:48.430> you

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
that's a little tricky to do but if you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.520 
that's a little tricky to do but if you
keep<00:04:48.730> your<00:04:48.910> band<00:04:49.090> tight<00:04:49.390> you<00:04:49.630> can<00:04:49.810> do<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.080> and

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
keep your band tight you can do it and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.480 
keep your band tight you can do it and
then<00:04:50.680> I'm<00:04:50.740> just<00:04:50.860> going<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.010> bring<00:04:51.250> it<00:04:51.400> around

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
then I'm just going to bring it around

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.570 
then I'm just going to bring it around
so<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.360> it's<00:04:52.600> at<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.870> top<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.470> now<00:04:54.460> I'm

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
so that it's at the top and now I'm

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.310 
so that it's at the top and now I'm
going<00:04:54.700> to<00:04:54.760> put<00:04:54.910> both<00:04:54.940> of<00:04:55.180> these<00:04:55.480> on<00:04:55.540> my<00:04:55.720> hook<00:04:56.200> at

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
going to put both of these on my hook at

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.440 
going to put both of these on my hook at
the<00:04:56.380> same<00:04:56.620> time<00:04:56.890> I'm<00:04:57.850> going<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.030> take<00:04:58.210> the

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
the same time I'm going to take the

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.190 
the same time I'm going to take the
front<00:04:58.870> one<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.440> pull<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:00.430> right<00:05:00.460> off<00:05:00.880> hook<00:05:01.200> and

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
front one and pull it right off hook and

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.220 
front one and pull it right off hook and
then<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.410> can<00:05:02.590> tighten<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:04.110> now<00:05:05.110> I'm

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
then I can tighten this and now I'm

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:15.530 
then I can tighten this and now I'm
ready<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.890> remove<00:05:06.070> my<00:05:06.430> flour

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.030 

all<00:05:16.540> right<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:16.990> now<00:05:17.110> we'll<00:05:17.290> just<00:05:17.530> give<00:05:17.890> it<00:05:17.980> a

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
all right so now we'll just give it a

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.670 
all right so now we'll just give it a
little<00:05:18.160> stretch<00:05:18.840> to<00:05:19.840> make<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:20.140> nice<00:05:20.590> and<00:05:20.620> even

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
little stretch to make it nice and even

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.770 
little stretch to make it nice and even
and<00:05:23.680> there<00:05:24.580> you<00:05:24.670> have<00:05:24.700> it<00:05:24.910> so<00:05:25.420> this<00:05:25.540> is<00:05:25.600> a

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
and there you have it so this is a

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.200 
and there you have it so this is a
single<00:05:26.080> Daisy<00:05:26.440> I<00:05:26.830> don't<00:05:27.490> like<00:05:27.730> the<00:05:27.910> colors<00:05:28.180> of

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
single Daisy I don't like the colors of

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.850 
single Daisy I don't like the colors of
this<00:05:28.510> one<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.050> reason<00:05:29.080> I<00:05:29.410> chose<00:05:29.620> these

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
this one and the reason I chose these

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.880 
this one and the reason I chose these
colors<00:05:30.070> was<00:05:30.490> just<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.210> show<00:05:31.480> you<00:05:31.540> how<00:05:32.410> to<00:05:32.440> do<00:05:32.740> it

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
colors was just to show you how to do it

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.320 
colors was just to show you how to do it
so<00:05:33.010> you<00:05:33.100> could<00:05:33.250> easily<00:05:33.430> see<00:05:33.760> which<00:05:33.880> bands<00:05:34.150> I

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
so you could easily see which bands I

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330 
so you could easily see which bands I
was<00:05:34.450> working<00:05:34.810> with<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.560> can<00:05:35.710> see<00:05:35.860> in<00:05:35.950> this<00:05:36.070> one

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
was working with you can see in this one

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.250 
was working with you can see in this one
I<00:05:36.580> did<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.150> all<00:05:37.330> yellow<00:05:37.660> in<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.870> middle<00:05:38.110> I

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
I did it all yellow in the middle I

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.380 
I did it all yellow in the middle I
think<00:05:38.440> that's<00:05:38.590> quite<00:05:38.830> pretty<00:05:39.100> and<00:05:39.460> this<00:05:40.150> one<00:05:40.360> I

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
think that's quite pretty and this one I

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.050 
think that's quite pretty and this one I
did<00:05:40.750> with<00:05:40.900> pink<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:41.830> I<00:05:42.370> used<00:05:42.580> two<00:05:42.760> colors<00:05:42.790> of

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
did with pink and I used two colors of

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.080 
did with pink and I used two colors of
orange<00:05:43.660> for<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.440> petals<00:05:44.860> so<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:45.640> can<00:05:45.910> watch

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
orange for the petals so you can watch

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.970 
orange for the petals so you can watch
another<00:05:46.240> video<00:05:46.780> where<00:05:47.110> I'll<00:05:47.290> demonstrate<00:05:47.500> how

another video where I'll demonstrate how

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.860 
another video where I'll demonstrate how
to<00:05:48.010> do<00:05:48.250> this<00:05:48.400> with<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:49.000> double<00:05:49.330> petals<00:05:49.660> it's

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
to do this with the double petals it's

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.840 
to do this with the double petals it's
really<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:50.230> same<00:05:50.410> procedure<00:05:50.830> just<00:05:51.520> working

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
really the same procedure just working

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.420 
really the same procedure just working
with<00:05:52.000> two<00:05:52.240> bands<00:05:52.810> at<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.050> same<00:05:53.290> time<00:05:53.560> all
