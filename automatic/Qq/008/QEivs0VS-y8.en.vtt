this this is awesome so again it has
power<00:03:46.690> button<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:47.230> can<00:03:47.530> know<00:03:48.310> which

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
power button so you can know which

power button so you can know which
cigarette<00:03:49.720> lighters<00:03:50.050> work<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.500> watch<00:03:50.620> push

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
cigarette lighters work and watch push

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.660 
cigarette lighters work and watch push
this<00:03:51.459> down<00:03:51.640> all<00:03:52.270> through<00:03:52.600> down<00:03:53.489> push<00:03:54.489> them<00:03:54.610> all

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
this down all through down push them all

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.660 
this down all through down push them all
up<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:54.940> doesn't<00:03:55.780> waste<00:03:55.870> any<00:03:56.050> power<00:03:56.489> some<00:03:57.489> can

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
up so doesn't waste any power some can

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.220 
up so doesn't waste any power some can
be<00:03:57.700> on<00:03:57.910> some<00:03:58.150> can<00:03:58.300> be<00:03:58.330> off<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:58.750> check<00:03:58.870> this<00:03:59.020> out

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
be on some can be off and check this out

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.790 
be on some can be off and check this out

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.030 
glossy white and then you got a blue
accented<00:04:06.370> tint<00:04:07.209> right<00:04:07.360> here<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:08.770> looks

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
accented tint right here that looks

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.970 
accented tint right here that looks
super<00:04:10.000> nice<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.200> build<00:04:11.470> quality<00:04:11.680> is

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
super nice so the build quality is

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.940 
super nice so the build quality is
really<00:04:12.070> nice<00:04:12.550> which<00:04:12.910> I'm<00:04:13.090> really<00:04:13.420> happy<00:04:13.570> about

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
really nice which I'm really happy about

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.229 
really nice which I'm really happy about
again<00:04:14.950> you<00:04:15.160> got<00:04:15.310> your<00:04:15.520> power<00:04:15.670> buttons<00:04:16.060> right

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
again you got your power buttons right

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.760 
again you got your power buttons right
here<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:17.250> simple<00:04:19.560> cigarette<00:04:20.560> lighter

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
here just simple cigarette lighter

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.940 
here just simple cigarette lighter
sockets<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:21.850> then<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.570> sides<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:23.410> have<00:04:23.440> a

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
sockets and then on the sides you have a

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.520 
sockets and then on the sides you have a
USB

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
USB

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.310 
USB
or<00:04:24.620> here<00:04:24.860> as<00:04:25.010> well<00:04:25.639> as<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.880> USB<00:04:26.360> port<00:04:26.600> here<00:04:26.810> so

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
or here as well as a USB port here so

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.500 
or here as well as a USB port here so
again<00:04:27.590> they<00:04:27.860> are<00:04:27.889> different<00:04:28.520> electricity

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
again they are different electricity

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.720 
again they are different electricity
outputs<00:04:29.900> for<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.170> to<00:04:30.290> charge<00:04:30.500> maybe<00:04:31.130> an<00:04:31.280> iPad

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
outputs for you to charge maybe an iPad

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.830 
outputs for you to charge maybe an iPad
versus<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> phone<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.410> like<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.310> said<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:35.630> have

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
versus a phone so like I said you have

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.200 
versus a phone so like I said you have
two<00:04:36.080> different<00:04:36.340> electricity<00:04:37.340> output<00:04:37.460> USB

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
two different electricity output USB

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.390 
two different electricity output USB
charging<00:04:38.660> ports<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.290> then<00:04:39.710> you<00:04:39.860> get<00:04:39.980> three

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
charging ports and then you get three

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.879 
charging ports and then you get three
cigarette<00:04:41.150> lighter<00:04:41.360> ports<00:04:41.720> so<00:04:41.930> this<00:04:42.740> is

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
cigarette lighter ports so this is

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.530 
cigarette lighter ports so this is
useful<00:04:43.100> for<00:04:43.310> tons<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.910> different<00:04:44.000> people<00:04:44.419> for

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
useful for tons of different people for

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.870 
useful for tons of different people for
example<00:04:44.630> some<00:04:45.110> people<00:04:45.380> have<00:04:45.590> FM<00:04:46.520> radio

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
example some people have FM radio

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.310 
example some people have FM radio
transmitters<00:04:47.419> that<00:04:47.480> they<00:04:47.690> need<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:47.900> plug<00:04:48.110> in

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
transmitters that they need to plug in

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.100 
transmitters that they need to plug in
some<00:04:48.830> people<00:04:49.160> have<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.790> USB<00:04:50.120> dongle<00:04:50.690> they<00:04:50.990> want

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
some people have a USB dongle they want

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.409 
some people have a USB dongle they want
to<00:04:51.169> plug<00:04:51.320> in<00:04:51.470> so<00:04:51.620> now<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:51.830> can<00:04:52.070> have<00:04:52.160> three<00:04:52.419> and

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
to plug in so now you can have three and

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.879 
to plug in so now you can have three and
some<00:04:53.630> people<00:04:53.900> will<00:04:54.110> have<00:04:54.260> like<00:04:54.530> one<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:54.770> those

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
some people will have like one of those

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.400 
some people will have like one of those
special<00:04:55.130> car<00:04:55.520> mounts<00:04:55.910> /<00:04:56.300> FM<00:04:56.960> transmitter

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
special car mounts / FM transmitter

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.350 
special car mounts / FM transmitter
other<00:04:57.620> things<00:04:57.860> that<00:04:58.040> plug<00:04:58.490> in<00:04:58.669> but<00:04:58.910> just<00:04:59.180> all

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
other things that plug in but just all

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.940 
other things that plug in but just all
different<00:04:59.720> things<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.140> can<00:05:00.230> now<00:05:00.590> have

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
different things that you can now have

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.610 
different things that you can now have
three<00:05:01.310> extra<00:05:01.550> hour<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.660> extra<00:05:03.080> cigarette

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
three extra hour to extra cigarette

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.010 
three extra hour to extra cigarette
ports<00:05:03.980> I<00:05:04.070> guess<00:05:04.250> to<00:05:04.430> plug<00:05:04.640> in<00:05:04.850> plus<00:05:05.480> you<00:05:05.870> get

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
ports I guess to plug in plus you get

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.080 
ports I guess to plug in plus you get
USB<00:05:06.350> ports<00:05:06.740> so<00:05:07.250> like<00:05:07.400> I<00:05:07.520> said<00:05:07.580> there's<00:05:07.910> not

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
USB ports so like I said there's not

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.870 
USB ports so like I said there's not
much<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.720> review<00:05:09.260> or<00:05:09.440> talk<00:05:09.650> about<00:05:09.730> except<00:05:10.730> the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
much to review or talk about except the

quality what comes with it should just

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.340 
quality what comes with it should just
give<00:05:13.040> you<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.190> look<00:05:13.610> at<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:14.150> once<00:05:14.870> i<00:05:14.960> plug<00:05:15.200> it
