00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.870 
powder on if you're sensitive skin and I
think<00:03:55.769> you're<00:03:55.859> putting<00:03:56.099> blush<00:03:56.340> on<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.790> you're

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
think you're putting blush on and you're

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.580 
think you're putting blush on and you're
going<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.389> maybe<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.139> would<00:03:58.349> bother

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
going like this maybe it would bother

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.890 
going like this maybe it would bother
you<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.519> I<00:03:59.609> mean<00:03:59.790> I'm<00:03:59.940> considering<00:04:00.419> my<00:04:00.569> skin

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
you but I mean I'm considering my skin

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.720 
you but I mean I'm considering my skin
to<00:04:01.079> be<00:04:01.200> pretty<00:04:01.410> sensitive<00:04:01.859> nowadays<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.609> it

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
to be pretty sensitive nowadays and it

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.809 
to be pretty sensitive nowadays and it
doesn't<00:04:02.970> bother<00:04:03.299> me<00:04:03.480> at<00:04:03.750> all<00:04:04.489> it's<00:04:05.489> not<00:04:05.760> very

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
doesn't bother me at all it's not very

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.159 
doesn't bother me at all it's not very
dense<00:04:06.450> so<00:04:06.810> it's<00:04:06.959> floppy<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.480> more<00:04:09.870> so

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
dense so it's floppy so this is more so

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.890 
dense so it's floppy so this is more so
I<00:04:10.980> would<00:04:11.459> think<00:04:11.609> an<00:04:11.849> all-over<00:04:12.060> face<00:04:12.510> brush

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
I would think an all-over face brush

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.229 
I would think an all-over face brush
it's<00:04:13.109> not<00:04:13.319> for<00:04:14.220> blush<00:04:14.519> where<00:04:14.849> it's<00:04:15.030> going<00:04:15.180> to

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
it's not for blush where it's going to

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.180 
it's not for blush where it's going to
concentrate<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:16.049> like<00:04:16.229> on<00:04:16.470> your<00:04:16.709> cheekbones

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
concentrate it like on your cheekbones

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.039 
concentrate it like on your cheekbones
or<00:04:17.519> in<00:04:17.669> your<00:04:17.760> apples<00:04:18.269> it's<00:04:18.450> going<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.690> more<00:04:18.870> so

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
or in your apples it's going to more so

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.170 
or in your apples it's going to more so
flop<00:04:19.380> everywhere

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
flop everywhere

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.010 
flop everywhere
think<00:04:20.389> it's<00:04:20.539> for<00:04:20.720> all<00:04:20.780> over<00:04:22.479> but<00:04:23.479> I<00:04:23.690> really

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
think it's for all over but I really

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.210 
think it's for all over but I really
like<00:04:24.199> this<00:04:24.350> i<00:04:24.470> think<00:04:24.530> it's<00:04:24.770> great<00:04:24.889> for<00:04:25.130> a

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
like this i think it's great for a

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.040 
like this i think it's great for a
dollar<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.729> think<00:04:25.970> it's<00:04:26.210> definitely<00:04:26.419> great<00:04:26.810> for

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
dollar I think it's definitely great for

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.090 
dollar I think it's definitely great for
starting<00:04:27.470> out<00:04:27.729> I<00:04:29.410> would<00:04:30.410> give<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:30.830> four<00:04:31.070> stars

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100
