 to conceal what I have just announced 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.109
 but it seems that backpacks 130 fun in the water far from the army 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:15.229
 simply creating 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:19.160
 commissioning ourselves of a team project that has a name that 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.739
 believe that there is in you surely know if I propose two small 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.220
 boys was sticking to his leader and urban 225 the server managers the 

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:30.199
 renewal that will make all that is rare logical 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.490
 and myself a leader rest with his lands 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.780
 so the project and the following one way and if you wish 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 your opinion we are very important in Basque 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.200
 if you are still the reader as viewers will we say will you 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.280
 look at you do not read 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.930
 well we'll get 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.000
 I want to be flushed by a cow 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.330
 I just poured myself through a tarpaulin 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.610
 I will ask a parallel thematic practice and the normal is to recreate 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.940
 a boat 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.510
 so although you have even put in a followed adventure 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.980
 adventure tracking note in which you have your importance for the match 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.350
 back one of the reasons that is the following 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.640
 you have the obligations will I go 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.100
 it's not an obligation you have the right to veto 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.440
 we're going to put that as an obligation because we're mean to us 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.920
 propose a new challenge 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.900
 so it can be parades 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.080
 very diverse girls despite the challenges they will face during 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.320
 this adventure followed 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.060
 you can also offer us ideas of various debris were spread 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.930
 can play more difficult knowing that we will be multiple 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.160
 it will be necessary to decide the daughter of Aquitaine 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.580
 so requested 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.540
 then I sell it I asked myself questions and cowardice does not 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.430
 will not stop if the two series are done in parallel on 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.440
 chain 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.620
 arnaud how to propose a challenge that you can make a comment on the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.740
 videos although I strongly advise against it 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.900
 you can the employment pole ier speech mp ap in d3 unique hen 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.689
 lp in which you put your challenge properly written with a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.980
 clear explanation 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.990
 and that if the challenge is interesting it will be accepted 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.729
 then retired from sending us an email at times figaro but I 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.130
 have no frame yet what you find in the description of this 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.369
 video 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:17.589
 4th technique seems in any case to believe that I am convinced 4e post a 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.849
 comment on the graveyard site 69 on the article related to this video 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:27.129

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.099
 I fell while I wanted to see them on the day of the sunset 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:25.169
