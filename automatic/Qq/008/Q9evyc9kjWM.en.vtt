00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.149 
yeah you can see the sticker on the back
it<00:01:20.040> doesn't<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.640> look<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:22.729> legitimate

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159

it doesn't really look that legitimate
but<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> didn't<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.570> anything<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
but really I didn't have anything to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.920 
but really I didn't have anything to
compare<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.770> against<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.400> my<00:01:30.090> factory<00:01:30.630> or

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
compare it against because my factory or

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.230 
compare it against because my factory or
genuine<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.159> didn't<00:01:32.610> even<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:32.970> on

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
genuine one didn't even have one on

genuine one didn't even have one on
there<00:01:33.390> didn't<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> sticker<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:35.030> but
