later<00:01:35.110> what<00:01:35.980> you<00:01:36.010> do<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.400> we<00:01:36.610> need<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.790> step

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
later what you do and we need to step

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.360 
later what you do and we need to step
that<00:01:37.090> leg<00:01:37.300> back<00:01:37.480> so<00:01:38.130> whenever<00:01:39.130> you're

stepping in here and we're moving and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.200 
stepping in here and we're moving and
moving<00:01:41.020> then<00:01:41.950> I'm<00:01:42.040> going<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.220> step<00:01:42.400> them<00:01:42.610> pop

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
moving then I'm going to step them pop

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
you're still in there but this target

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.820 
you're still in there but this target
requires<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.870> little<00:03:18.989> more<00:03:19.110> commitment<00:03:19.709> if

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
requires a little more commitment if

you're going to hit it he just better
hit<00:03:21.120> 100%<00:03:21.810> because<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.380> mean<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.489> can<00:03:23.610> get<00:03:23.760> it

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
hit 100% because I mean you can get it

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.979

most of the time but if you hit a half

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.380 
most of the time but if you hit a half
ways<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.470> stop<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.799> on<00:03:25.890> your<00:03:26.010> back<00:03:26.330> one<00:03:27.330> of

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
going to take them to hook while you're

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.699 
going to take them to hook while you're
on<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.060> side<00:04:19.260> most<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.410> time<00:04:20.560> I'll

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
on this side most of the time I'll

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.650 
on this side most of the time I'll
switch<00:04:20.919> off<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.850> a<00:04:21.880> headlock<00:04:22.240> right<00:04:22.449> here

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
switch off to a to a headlock right here

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.469 
switch off to a to a headlock right here
or<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:23.680> can<00:04:23.800> sit<00:04:24.039> through<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:25.180> lift<00:04:25.389> this

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
or you can sit through and lift this

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.260 
or you can sit through and lift this
head<00:04:25.690> right<00:04:25.979> here<00:04:26.979> keep<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.340> Jacob<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:27.820> we'll

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
head right here keep the Jacob so we'll

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.460 
head right here keep the Jacob so we'll
just<00:04:28.389> sit<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.780> there's<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:29.050> lot<00:04:29.169> of<00:04:29.260> pressure

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
just sit and there's a lot of pressure

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.159 
just sit and there's a lot of pressure
right<00:04:29.560> there

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
right there

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.800 
right there
so<00:04:32.340> that's<00:04:33.340> all<00:04:33.520> for<00:04:33.639> this<00:04:33.760> week's<00:04:34.090> technique

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
so that's all for this week's technique

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.110 
so that's all for this week's technique
of<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:34.960> week
