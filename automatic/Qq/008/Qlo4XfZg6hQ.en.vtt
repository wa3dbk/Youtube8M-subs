00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.350
 hello youtubers i 'm going to prepare mascarpone 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.670
 home to make a tiramisu 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.310
 we need a liter and a half of milk 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.860
 600 milliliters of whipping cream and the 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.790
 juice of a lemon first let's make 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.680
 the lemon juice 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.050
 I do not have a juicer because I really 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 I do not need it so I do it with the 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.160
 help from a fork 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.110
 [Music] 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.120
 and once we get all the juice 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.400
 let's strain it because if not the seeds 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.470
 and the pulp will end up mixed with the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.960
 cheese 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.850
 Now we put the milk and cream to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.640
 medium heat until 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.070
 start to boil stirring from time to time 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.989
 when so that it does not stick 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 and once they are hot the only thing 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.829
 What we have to do is add the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.829
 lemon smoke and see the reaction 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.830
 we can already see how milk and cream 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.980
 they are cut and the 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.650
 floor of what will be the cheese 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.480
 [Music] 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.330
 and it's ready it's that simple 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.390
 now we only have to strain it for that I 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.980
 I use a pasta drainer and a cloth 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.980
 fine knit that is well clean 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.569
 [Music] 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.649
 [Music] 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.020
 Here you can see how the texture looks 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.939
 after having cast it 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.590
 I have put a little salt but 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.709
 if you want you can skip this step 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.709
 [Music] 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.170
 so it was about 10 or 15 minutes 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.509
 and finally you have to hang it and leave it 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.579
 drain for quite some time I 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.070
 I left the night hanging from the tap 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.620
 of the sink 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.660
 and this is the texture he has after 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.220
 of having drained all night and of 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.440
 have been a few hours in the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.330
 fridge 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.790
 As you can see the texture is very 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.280
 similar to the bought coals and os 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:25.919
 I assure that the taste changes 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.919
