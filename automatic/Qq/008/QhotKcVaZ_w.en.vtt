00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.889
 Talk to us guys, let's bring some beauty. 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 one or more or less to you that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.630
 Personal fought're laughing to you something 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.890
 I think you probably do not 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.510
 they knew about milk the minecraft 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.900
 It's personal milk is not just for you. 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.810
 minecraft brother-in-law case you do not know is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.399
 the milk is also good for something else 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.899
 I'm going to pay that milk first with 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.399
 less kitty swarm inventory of 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:49.200
 bucket of milk 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:54.750
 You're ready to invent. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.960
 the pain here is one more vote 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.710
 um I do not believe because the mother lived 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.710
 All botafoto a mundane 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.360
 It's personal first thing that serves the 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.990
 milk is for you to override the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.050
 effect of hunger when you eat meat 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.280
 rotten zombie as if they are well and are 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.200
 hungry but with cbb milk 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.590
 It returns to normal so this is a good 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.830
 method for you to use your rotten meat 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.780
 it is in other cases besides taming your 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.580
 dog is good another thing is another 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.450
 Which is the thing for you to fight. 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:45.190
 against wizards or witches 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.070
 Either way in the Pacific but talking 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.560
 here and I will not be I will not attack 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.200
 You just slap and attack motherfucker. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.369
 Do you drink milk oil? He canceled the effect. 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.070
 of wizard positions except those 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.360
 functions that are for example the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.149
 snapshot as you can see well 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.590
 this method only needs to load 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.590
 some buckets of milk 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.630

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.459

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.120
