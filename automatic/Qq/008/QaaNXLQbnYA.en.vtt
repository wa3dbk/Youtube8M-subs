because<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.540> sit<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.690> top<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.910> it<00:00:35.910> can

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
because it can sit up top then it can

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.740 
because it can sit up top then it can
still<00:00:36.329> fire<00:00:36.920> from<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.390> constantly

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it might come over a sidecar I've got a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.740 
it might come over a sidecar I've got a
sidecar<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.430> sure<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.510> from

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sidecar but I'm not sure it just from

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.729 
sidecar but I'm not sure it just from
sidecar<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.070> I've<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.570> done<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
sidecar one so I've just got done it and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.650 
sidecar one so I've just got done it and
I<00:00:54.500> think<00:00:55.500> also<00:00:55.800> about<00:00:55.920> four<00:00:56.309> figures<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:57.000> just

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
I think also about four figures I'm just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.420 
I think also about four figures I'm just
picked<00:00:57.899> any<00:00:58.140> four<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.859> show<00:00:59.039> you<00:01:01.280> I'll<00:01:02.280> get

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
picked any four to show you I'll get

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.730 
picked any four to show you I'll get
onto<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.680> set<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> those<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> fun

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
onto the set now so those are the fun

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.350 
onto the set now so those are the fun
open<00:01:08.430> oh<00:01:11.150> yeah

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.700 

nice<00:01:16.360> ride<00:01:16.689> those<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.140> it's<00:01:17.259> kind<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.530> like

nice ride those and it's kind of like
him<00:01:17.950> you<00:01:18.880> wouldn't<00:01:19.060> really<00:01:19.180> expect<00:01:19.390> an<00:01:20.049> army

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
him you wouldn't really expect an army

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.859 
him you wouldn't really expect an army
the<00:01:21.520> army<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.909> be<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:22.119> this<00:01:22.240> house<00:01:22.479> it's<00:01:22.780> like

the army to be in this house it's like
kind<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.259> unpredictable<00:01:24.960> Trayvon<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.110> back

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
kind of unpredictable Trayvon the back

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.740 
kind of unpredictable Trayvon the back
which<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.280> funny<00:01:27.670> access<00:01:28.090> all<00:01:30.420> right<00:01:31.420> you've

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
which is funny access all right you've

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.210 
which is funny access all right you've
got<00:01:31.990> your<00:01:32.020> map<00:01:32.640> view<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.789> plane<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:35.220> target

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
got your map view the plane and target

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.169 
got your map view the plane and target
areas<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:36.820> stuff<00:01:37.080> then<00:01:38.080> becomes<00:01:38.409> of<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.649> laptop

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
areas and stuff then becomes of a laptop

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.600 
areas and stuff then becomes of a laptop
I've<00:01:40.179> just<00:01:40.360> put<00:01:40.570> two<00:01:40.979> tables<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.100> chairs<00:01:42.310> do

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
I've just put two tables and chairs do

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.690 
I've just put two tables and chairs do
come<00:01:42.850> with<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.119> so<00:01:43.299> it's<00:01:43.420> like<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:44.080> army

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
come with it so it's like the army

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.469 
come with it so it's like the army
organizing<00:01:45.700> their<00:01:45.909> mission<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:49.360> got

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
organizing their mission and you got

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.160 
organizing their mission and you got
some<00:01:49.659> stairs<00:01:49.990> here<00:01:50.640> which<00:01:51.640> M<00:01:52.000> go<00:01:52.690> from<00:01:52.959> here

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
some stairs here which M go from here

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.969 
some stairs here which M go from here
and<00:01:54.119> yep<00:01:55.119> there's<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.780> ladder<00:01:56.049> move<00:01:56.679> which

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
and yep there's a ladder move which

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.770 
and yep there's a ladder move which
moves<00:01:57.399> up<00:01:57.789> top<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:59.560> here<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.970> this<00:02:01.090> hatch<00:02:01.330> which

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
moves up top to here to this hatch which

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.230 
moves up top to here to this hatch which
open<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.619> closes<00:02:03.100> it's<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.970> bit<00:02:04.090> awkward

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
open and closes it's a bit awkward

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.059 
open and closes it's a bit awkward
though<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:04.959> I<00:02:04.990> probably<00:02:05.380> wouldn't<00:02:05.649> do<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.890> it

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
though so I probably wouldn't do it it

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.800 
though so I probably wouldn't do it it
probably<00:02:06.640> might<00:02:06.939> snap<00:02:07.240> off<00:02:07.450> look<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.950> it's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
probably might snap off look so it's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.360 
probably might snap off look so it's
pretty<00:02:10.810> hard<00:02:11.049> to<00:02:11.470> get<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:13.709> so<00:02:14.709> it's<00:02:15.069> got<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> lot

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
pretty hard to get it so it's got a lot

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.360 
pretty hard to get it so it's got a lot
of<00:02:15.430> space<00:02:15.640> here<00:02:15.700> for<00:02:16.239> figures<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.370> table

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
of space here for figures and the table

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:27.590 
of space here for figures and the table
stand<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:21.040> put<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.820> can<00:02:22.030> see

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.380 

there<00:02:28.600> we<00:02:28.810> go<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.440> yep<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.430> go<00:02:30.730> over<00:02:33.390> looks

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
there we go so yep it can go over looks

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.020 
there we go so yep it can go over looks
really<00:02:34.840> odd<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.350> it<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.280> go<00:02:36.400> anywhere<00:02:36.700> ready

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
really odd so it can go anywhere ready

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.449 
really odd so it can go anywhere ready
it<00:02:37.180> looks<00:02:37.209> good<00:02:39.209> there's<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.269> lot<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.540> space<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
it looks good there's a lot of space and

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:50.640 
it looks good there's a lot of space and
really<00:02:42.459> good<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.840> fit<00:02:44.709> in<00:02:44.920> total<00:02:45.430> walk

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.149 

let's<00:02:51.930> take<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.110> round<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:53.799> from<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
let's take you round that's from the

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:05.309 
let's take you round that's from the
back<00:02:56.280> side<00:02:59.010> front<00:03:03.239> nice<00:03:04.239> detail<00:03:04.780> as<00:03:04.930> well<00:03:05.080> like

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319
