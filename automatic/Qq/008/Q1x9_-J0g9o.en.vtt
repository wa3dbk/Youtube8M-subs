00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
going to be picking up this PC bringing

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.290

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
and then that takes me one step closer

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.300 
and then that takes me one step closer
to<00:05:59.210> streaming<00:05:59.570> the<00:06:00.260> only<00:06:00.500> thing<00:06:00.740> left<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.190> do

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
after that is to ensure and do some

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.379 
after that is to ensure and do some
testing<00:06:04.130> that<00:06:04.310> my<00:06:04.520> internet<00:06:04.940> is<00:06:05.060> actually

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389
