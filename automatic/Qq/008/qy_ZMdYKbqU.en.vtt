00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
third equation in the legs it's 360 -

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.380 
third equation in the legs it's 360 -
but<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.170> remove<00:01:43.469> all<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.030> because

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
but you can remove all the way because

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.109 
but you can remove all the way because
of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> arms<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:49.020> good<00:01:50.119> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
of the arms of that but it's good the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.920 
of the arms of that but it's good the
trail<00:01:51.509> has<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:53.329> articulation<00:01:54.329> there<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.750> it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930

let's say salsa huzzah
a<00:04:37.250> little<00:04:38.250> effector<00:04:40.430> I<00:04:41.430> don't<00:04:42.120> know<00:04:42.270> how<00:04:42.600> do

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
a little effector I don't know how do

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.130 
a little effector I don't know how do
you<00:04:42.720> say<00:04:43.020> business<00:04:43.260> in<00:04:43.590> English<00:04:43.860> but<00:04:44.010> whatever

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
I'm gonna I'm going to show you a cyst

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.780 
I'm gonna I'm going to show you a cyst
comparison<00:04:48.420> with<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:49.260> got<00:04:49.950> Scylla<00:04:50.190> toys

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
comparison with I got Scylla toys

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.970 
comparison with I got Scylla toys
I<00:04:50.820> got<00:04:51.630> Scylla<00:04:51.810> toy<00:04:52.550> this<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:54.830> burning<00:04:55.830> at

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
I got Scylla toy this is the burning at

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.500 
I got Scylla toy this is the burning at
Scylla<00:04:56.220> figure<00:04:56.610> as<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.090> can<00:04:57.390> see<00:04:59.180> the<00:05:00.180> seeds

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
Scylla figure as you can see the seeds

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.570 
Scylla figure as you can see the seeds
of<00:05:01.040> comparison<00:05:02.040> of<00:05:02.190> these<00:05:02.370> two<00:05:04.070> is<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.130> much

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
of comparison of these two is that much

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.060 
of comparison of these two is that much
today<00:05:05.850> isn't<00:05:06.330> much<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.960> difference<00:05:07.380> but<00:05:11.900> they

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
today isn't much the difference but they

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.120 
today isn't much the difference but they
almost<00:05:14.070> match<00:05:16.640> if<00:05:17.640> I<00:05:17.820> put<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:19.040> spinosaurus<00:05:20.040> in

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
almost match if I put the spinosaurus in

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.690 
almost match if I put the spinosaurus in
another<00:05:20.490> position<00:05:21.020> he<00:05:22.020> will<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:23.310> will<00:05:23.490> get

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
another position he will it will get

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.840 
another position he will it will get
bigger<00:05:23.970> of<00:05:24.210> course<00:05:24.480> because<00:05:25.470> of<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.850> big

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
bigger of course because of the big

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.960 
bigger of course because of the big
mountain<00:05:27.390> that<00:05:31.070> it's<00:05:32.070> a<00:05:32.190> really<00:05:32.550> nice<00:05:32.730> figure

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
mountain that it's a really nice figure

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.390 
mountain that it's a really nice figure
I<00:05:33.120> guess<00:05:34.190> if<00:05:35.190> you<00:05:35.780> if<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:37.230> go<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.590> Disneyland

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
I guess if you if you go to Disneyland

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.810 
I guess if you if you go to Disneyland
or<00:05:38.880> Orlando<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:40.680> Jurassic<00:05:41.100> Park<00:05:41.280> area<00:05:41.640> you

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
or Orlando the Jurassic Park area you
