 each city has its own spirit in constant movement in terms of 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.730

 with the well-being of its inhabitants 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.590
 to respond to these challenges allston has developed its line of vlt instead quote 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.100
 say 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.620
 the industry says is a concept of vlt completely reinvented 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.769
 today the main objective is to be with the clubs action 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.139
 well other words 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:54.600
 you create the concept for your city 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.830
 the cities have a design that fit the spirit of your city 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.900
 guaranteeing accessibility through its low weight 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.560
 citadis combines all of your aesthetic needs 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.119
 comfort 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.630

 what facilities give a unique identity to each of them is why 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 halston presents a design for each project 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.590
 in the city of são vicente and unique 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 who became a symbol of his hometown Rosita says 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.070
 allows for the choice of certain technical aspects which meet the needs of 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.750
 specific 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.109
 and the requirements of each network 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:47.499
 as the length the width design river according to the preferences 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:53.389
 we customize the visible aspects of the city's external decoration 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.050
 as well as the interior design, the shape of the seats and the position of the doors 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.520
 access are each customer's choice of large windows that we provide 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.840
 luminosity

 ensure passenger satisfaction 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.280
 security is one of the major considerations in the design of 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:21.949
 city 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.969
 security of passage 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.230
 thanks to an enhanced structure 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.790
 and the years of research and experience of Houston in this area 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.740
 safety of the braking system 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.189
 adapted to the traffic conditions of the city 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.189
 safety for passengers and drivers

 which are more than 400 passengers 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.640
 in addition to using electricity that is renewable and does not emit CO2

 therefore environmentally correct 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:10.589
 the leading system can still introduce the technology to psp 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.210
 electric power from the ground 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.360

 sockets 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.060
 the modular design of the industry says 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.630
 ensure not only cost savings and reliability to the operator but also 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.770
