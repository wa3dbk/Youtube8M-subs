00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
along see it just pops off it easily

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.240 
along see it just pops off it easily
just<00:04:47.460> comes<00:04:47.970> apart<00:04:48.180> here<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:48.960> gets<00:04:49.500> really

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
just comes apart here that gets really

annoying<00:04:51.380> right<00:04:52.380> if<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:53.460> was<00:04:53.940> for<00:04:54.240> kids<00:04:54.540> then

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
annoying right if this was for kids then

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.360 
annoying right if this was for kids then
they<00:04:55.710> could<00:04:55.950> just<00:04:56.780> be<00:04:57.780> asking<00:04:58.080> a<00:04:58.800> parent<00:04:59.220> to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370

if you want to have like a battle with

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.190 
if you want to have like a battle with
your<00:05:46.290> Legos<00:05:46.560> or<00:05:46.620> something<00:05:47.100> yeah<00:05:47.600> but<00:05:48.600> what

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
your Legos or something yeah but what

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.110 
your Legos or something yeah but what
really<00:05:49.350> is<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.590> standout<00:05:50.160> part<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.700> this<00:05:50.850> set

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
really is the standout part of this set

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.020 
really is the standout part of this set
is<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.800> motorcycle<00:05:52.800> itself<00:05:54.260> very<00:05:55.260> very<00:05:55.710> good

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
is the motorcycle itself very very good

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.020 
is the motorcycle itself very very good
for<00:05:57.030> play<00:05:57.270> and<00:05:57.750> for<00:05:58.530> display<00:05:59.130> but<00:05:59.610> I<00:05:59.640> think

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
for play and for display but I think

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.790 
for play and for display but I think
it's<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.480> little<00:06:00.780> better<00:06:01.050> for<00:06:01.350> a<00:06:01.380> display

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
it's a little better for a display

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.040 
it's a little better for a display
because<00:06:02.190> like<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.550> said<00:06:02.820> these<00:06:03.330> pieces<00:06:03.660> aren't

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
because like I said these pieces aren't

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.630 
because like I said these pieces aren't
here<00:06:04.200> very<00:06:04.650> very<00:06:04.980> easily<00:06:05.820> just<00:06:06.210> break<00:06:06.960> off<00:06:07.169> and

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
here very very easily just break off and

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.090 
here very very easily just break off and
makes<00:06:08.640> it<00:06:08.820> annoying<00:06:09.120> to<00:06:09.540> try<00:06:09.870> to<00:06:09.930> play<00:06:10.680> with<00:06:10.919> it

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
makes it annoying to try to play with it

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.320 
makes it annoying to try to play with it
or<00:06:11.220> race<00:06:11.370> around<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:11.730> Sun<00:06:11.850> all<00:06:11.970> day<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:12.150> I
