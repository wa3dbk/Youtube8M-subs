00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.580 
and I stumbled upon the sale and they
had<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.850> muscle<00:03:55.330> tee<00:03:55.480> on<00:03:55.690> now<00:03:55.870> which<00:03:56.110> I<00:03:56.260> have

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
had a muscle tee on now which I have

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.650 
had a muscle tee on now which I have
been<00:03:56.770> worried<00:03:57.250> for<00:03:57.459> us<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:57.970> ages<00:03:58.270> in<00:03:58.420> the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
been worried for us and the ages in the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.180 
been worried for us and the ages in the
cell<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.290> think<00:03:59.830> it<00:03:59.890> was<00:04:00.010> like<00:04:01.560> $55<00:04:02.560> and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
cell and I think it was like $55 and

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.960 
cell and I think it was like $55 and
then<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.120> found<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.510> coupon<00:04:04.780> code<00:04:05.290> which<00:04:05.970> took

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
then I found a coupon code which took

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.110 
then I found a coupon code which took
off<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:07.510> think<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.530> was<00:04:08.650> like<00:04:08.800> 20<00:04:09.370> or<00:04:09.550> 15<00:04:09.940> percent

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
off I think it was like 20 or 15 percent

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.300 
off I think it was like 20 or 15 percent
which<00:04:11.110> was<00:04:11.260> pretty<00:04:11.590> much<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.890> same<00:04:12.070> with

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
which was pretty much the same with

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.520 
which was pretty much the same with
shipping<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.150> didn't<00:04:13.450> mind<00:04:13.570> that<00:04:13.690> but<00:04:14.440> on

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
shipping so I didn't mind that but on

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.289 
shipping so I didn't mind that but on
top<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.800> that<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:14.950> did<00:04:15.220> have<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.580> pay<00:04:15.700> customers

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
top of that I did have to pay customers

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.030 
top of that I did have to pay customers
which<00:04:16.450> sucks<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.290> customs<00:04:17.650> wasn't<00:04:17.950> too

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
which sucks but the customs wasn't too

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.390 
which sucks but the customs wasn't too
bad

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400
