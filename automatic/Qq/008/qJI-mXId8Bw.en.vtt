00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.790
 DVD review with another trailer 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.470
 check for a documentation 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.090
 dealing with a number of young people 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.800
 employs those in life's dream true 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.509
 but also wanted to do it 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.340
 are too close to their physical limits 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.780
 go because that turns in the ballet and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.850
 the difficulty there in the first 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.590
 row dance and what all of that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.029
 one demanded and with that we would be in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.000
 look at the German trailer of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.000
 first position ballet is your life 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.170
 I have fun with the dancing loose 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.170
 But now this is so much 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.820
 more than that the people are not clear 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.110
 how difficult is it to be a dancer 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.089
 Children create next to their childhood 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.920
 on 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.780
 It never stops to see you should 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.149
 your body to the last page 5 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.460
 Persistence is the most important thing 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.460
 if you have to pursue your dream 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.490
 Many men do not think that I have 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.030
 never thought that my son was dead but me 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.310
 could not be prouder of him 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.460
 I was in Sierra Leon in West Africa 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.259
 become 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.390
 my parents were from the rebels 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.520
 It's a miracle that I shot 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.740
 I'm here at all, I believe 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.570
 a pretty normal live nickname in 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.899
 The school is partie because I am in 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 all kinds of directions can bend 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.759
 when people say that i have no childhood 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.440
 would have 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.789
 but I think that's exactly what I am 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.069
 right childhood and on 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.460
 she had high to high ballet 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:40.950
 high 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.440
 i am from colombia i work for 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.599
 my family my dream is it 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.599
 to become professional dancers 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.060
 so many dancers would like to be a career 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.070
 but make very few at least 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.210
 5000 participate in the competition and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.310
 then only a few hundred can do it 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.900
 to new york it was awful 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.700
 you get five minutes on stage 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.790
 and to prove why you have this chance 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.790
 would have 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.380
 My heart beats as fast as I am 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.380
 on learned 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.910
 a to rejoice the dream of my life 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.910
 spent 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.019
 I do not necessarily know that ballet that way 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.849
 a big topic is rather a niche 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.409
 things ultimately is how many 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.510
 people still go to the ballet these days 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.340
 or dance it yourself but when you look at yourself 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.099
 movies like center stage or black swan 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.239
 or just save the last dance or 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.739
 something in the direction looks 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.000
 you get the synonymous with this film 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.290
 Actually only for entertainment 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.299
 are already designed the feeling what 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.829
 physical strain that is and me 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.060
 have always respectful before any kind of 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.189
 dance or you can see that for one 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.750
 posture what a constant 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.329
 discipline behind it is passion 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.920
 and at the same time tact and discipline 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.359
 It is like that for me 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.769
 that ballet when I look at myself 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.389
 think that is almost one of the highest 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.069
 not only shape in this direction 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.349
 entertainment but a high form of 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.209
 art the one still pretty blatant 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.159
 half-life because there in the top 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.930
 Playing the league means you have to be very 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.310
 can start very early and can not 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.290
 really long make this one 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.389
 the body takes on a permanent burden 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.709
 Ultimately it takes the body very strong 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.329
 with and is not exactly conducive 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.739
 for the joints come all that 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.720
 ClichÃ©s around the diet and 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.280
 anorexia in this direction that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.569
 that here at this point quite 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.879
 interest then also for this one 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.680
 Documentation develops developers because 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.359
 I believe that the animal is worth such 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.099
 accompanied by at least six young people 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.949
 on her way to a festival 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.199
 an event called use of america grand 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:51.560
 prix where you have five minutes time so 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:53.209
 300 seconds to perform then one 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.889
 to have to endure a decision whether she 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.629
 get a scholarship or not and 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.030
 virtually all your preparations over 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.409
 years away on these five minutes 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.209
 That's why I believe that 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.340
 illuminated here six fates 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.349
 will show him what happens when 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.940
 a maybe a hobby to work in 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.470
 quotes will be a passion 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.209
 to obsession and that's why 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.530
 subject in gross total interesting and 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.030
 also in the core because of that I wanted one 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.459
 bit attention as 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.260
 chain left this documentation on 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.139
 4th of july interesting that you on 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.020
 Independence day to do the US on 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.430
 fourth july 2013 in german cinemas 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.720
 I hope I can unfortunately, too 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.030
 imagine such a documentation 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.380
 finally director dividium blu ray 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.880
 was published because you like me 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.620
 look at the canvas 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.180
 would be okay here at this point 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.160

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.590
 thematic ballet physical stress 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.270
 generally the you this performance 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.560
 measured integrated at an early years as 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.700
 Your opinion would be very important to me 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.830
 interest or if you yourself in 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.330
 the direction is dancing because this me 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.680
 very like the comments on it 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.690
