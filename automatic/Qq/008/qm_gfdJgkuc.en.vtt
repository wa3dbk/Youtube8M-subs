this<00:02:58.079> car<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.530> not<00:02:58.709> really<00:02:59.040> getting<00:02:59.159> this<00:02:59.370> a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
this car is not really getting this a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.369 
this car is not really getting this a
nap<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.819> getting<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> different<00:03:00.359> one<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:01.019> if<00:03:01.230> you

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
nap is getting a different one so if you

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.610 
nap is getting a different one so if you
do<00:03:01.620> have<00:03:01.919> this<00:03:02.909> blue<00:03:03.540> tape<00:03:03.749> I<00:03:03.930> would<00:03:04.319> squeeze

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
do have this blue tape I would squeeze

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.199 
do have this blue tape I would squeeze
that<00:03:04.859> little<00:03:05.129> hole<00:03:05.280> together<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.879> little<00:03:06.090> bit

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
that little hole together a little bit

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.550 
that little hole together a little bit
tighter<00:03:06.389> it's<00:03:06.599> okay<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:07.349> it's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
tighter it's okay like that but it's

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.490 
tighter it's okay like that but it's
better<00:03:07.799> if<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:08.579> squeezed<00:03:08.819> tight<00:03:09.379> all<00:03:10.379> right

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
better if it's squeezed tight all right

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.509 
better if it's squeezed tight all right
this<00:03:10.919> goes<00:03:11.069> into<00:03:11.280> here<00:03:12.859> and<00:03:13.859> then<00:03:14.129> last<00:03:14.430> but

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
this goes into here and then last but

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.580 
this goes into here and then last but
not<00:03:14.639> least<00:03:14.969> with<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.689> blue<00:03:15.900> side<00:03:16.079> facing<00:03:16.469> out

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
not least with the blue side facing out

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.720 
not least with the blue side facing out
I<00:03:16.620> believe<00:03:16.919> this<00:03:17.909> plugs<00:03:18.180> into<00:03:18.269> here<00:03:19.609> all<00:03:20.609> right

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
I believe this plugs into here all right

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.369 
I believe this plugs into here all right
now<00:03:20.939> the<00:03:21.359> outside<00:03:21.659> cable<00:03:21.959> it's<00:03:22.049> really<00:03:22.230> easy

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
now the outside cable it's really easy

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.409 
now the outside cable it's really easy
