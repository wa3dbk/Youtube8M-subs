00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
that these waves actually shortened the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.910 
that these waves actually shortened the
length<00:01:33.759> of<00:01:34.119> my<00:01:34.240> hair<00:01:34.479> because<00:01:35.020> my<00:01:35.050> hair<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.649> way

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
length of my hair because my hair is way

length of my hair because my hair is way
past<00:01:36.100> my<00:01:36.310> bud<00:01:36.520> now<00:01:37.090> it's<00:01:37.330> up<00:01:37.509> to<00:01:37.539> my<00:01:37.750> hips<00:01:38.080> but<00:01:38.470> I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
past my bud now it's up to my hips but I

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.410 
past my bud now it's up to my hips but I
still<00:01:38.800> do<00:01:39.039> like<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:39.399> if<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.700> don't<00:01:39.940> like<00:01:40.149> that

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
still do like it if you don't like that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.790 
still do like it if you don't like that
it<00:01:40.569> rubs<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.960> length<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.319> your<00:01:41.409> hair<00:01:41.470> then

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
it rubs the length of your hair then

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.649 
it rubs the length of your hair then

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
hair too long or simply just let it stay

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.510 
hair too long or simply just let it stay
on<00:01:46.090> your<00:01:46.240> hair<00:01:46.569> for<00:01:46.600> several<00:01:47.229> hours<00:01:47.380> also<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
on your hair for several hours also the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.700 
on your hair for several hours also the
more<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.729> separate<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.509> waves<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:50.110> bigger<00:01:50.409> my

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
more I separate the waves the bigger my

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.469 
more I separate the waves the bigger my
hair<00:01:50.979> look<00:01:51.190> like<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:51.700> if<00:01:51.880> you're<00:01:52.060> into<00:01:52.299> big

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
hair look like so if you're into big

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.300 
hair look like so if you're into big
hair<00:01:52.780> then<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.409> definitely<00:01:53.920> for<00:01:54.250> you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
hair then this is definitely for you

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.370 
hair then this is definitely for you
also<00:01:54.850> if<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:55.360> have<00:01:55.509> layered<00:01:55.750> hair<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.319> don't

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
also if you have layered hair I don't

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.260 
also if you have layered hair I don't
suggest<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.490> use<00:01:57.700> this<00:01:58.030> technique

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
suggest that you use this technique

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.090 
suggest that you use this technique
because<00:01:59.049> it's<00:01:59.200> going<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.619> make<00:01:59.770> your<00:01:59.860> hair

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
because it's going to make your hair

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.550 
because it's going to make your hair
puffy<00:02:00.490> if<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.850> do<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.420> suggest<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.409> you

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
puffy if you do this I suggest that you

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.380 
puffy if you do this I suggest that you
try<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:03.070> one<00:02:03.219> that<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.490> did<00:02:03.670> with<00:02:03.820> my<00:02:03.850> sister's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
try the one that I did with my sister's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.300 
try the one that I did with my sister's

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
to link that video down below but this

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.199 
to link that video down below but this
method<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.679> really<00:02:08.890> going<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.280> work<00:02:09.429> well<00:02:09.940> if

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
method is really going to work well if

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.090 
method is really going to work well if
you<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:10.929> one<00:02:11.200> length<00:02:11.410> hair<00:02:11.709> like<00:02:11.890> mine

and I don't know if you guys noticed but
the<00:02:39.850> waves<00:02:40.120> kind<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.140> relaxed<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:42.010> bit<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.459> I

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
the waves kind of relaxed a bit and I

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.509 
the waves kind of relaxed a bit and I
also<00:02:42.970> decided<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.989> add<00:02:44.320> some<00:02:44.350> hair<00:02:45.070> style<00:02:45.340> to

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
also decided to add some hair style to

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.640 
also decided to add some hair style to
match<00:02:45.670> up<00:02:45.880> with<00:02:46.030> my<00:02:46.090> waves<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.140> what<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.290> did<00:02:47.470> is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
match up with my waves so what I did is

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.830 
match up with my waves so what I did is
I<00:02:47.769> simply<00:02:48.100> took<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.609> part<00:02:49.090> or<00:02:49.299> section<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.720> my

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
I simply took that part or section of my

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.840 
I simply took that part or section of my
hair<00:02:50.109> and<00:02:50.260> then<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.739> brushed<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.609> make<00:02:51.730> it

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
hair and then I brushed it to make it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.150 
hair and then I brushed it to make it
look<00:02:51.880> even<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.660> twisted<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.350> at<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.650> back<00:02:53.890> and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
look even I twisted it at the back and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160 
look even I twisted it at the back and
then<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.340> got<00:02:54.549> a<00:02:54.579> bobby<00:02:54.850> pin<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.299> pin<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:55.989> in

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.710 
then I got a bobby pin and pin that in
place<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.150> always<00:02:58.329> find

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
place and that is it and I always find

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.900 
place and that is it and I always find
this<00:02:58.959> hair<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.440> great<00:02:59.769> for<00:03:00.010> my<00:03:00.160> hair

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
this hair so great for my hair

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.690 
this hair so great for my hair
is<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.570> asked<00:03:01.990> up<00:03:02.080> volume<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.800> top<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.310> my<00:03:03.460> head

is it asked up volume on top of my head

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.460 
is it asked up volume on top of my head
because<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:04.000> don't<00:03:04.450> really<00:03:04.630> have<00:03:04.870> much<00:03:05.110> volume

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
because I don't really have much volume

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.530 
because I don't really have much volume
