basically<00:00:11.250> should<00:00:11.490> think<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.880> as<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.179> little

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
basically should think of it as a little

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.419 
basically should think of it as a little
bit<00:00:12.599> like<00:00:12.719> cable<00:00:13.110> television<00:00:13.710> for

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
bit like cable television for

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.000 
bit like cable television for
location-based<00:00:15.330> services<00:00:15.960> basically<00:00:16.920> what

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
location-based services basically what

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.650 
location-based services basically what
it<00:00:17.039> does<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> bring<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.449> list

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
it does is it's going to bring up a list

it<00:01:10.470> stays<00:01:10.710> locked<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.670> object<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.720> can

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it stays locked to that object and I can

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.060 
it stays locked to that object and I can
just<00:01:12.990> walk<00:01:13.200> through<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.439> city<00:01:13.560> streets<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
just walk through the city streets to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
just walk through the city streets to
get<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.180> want<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.509> ease<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> map

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
get there or if I want I can ease a map

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
get there or if I want I can ease a map
we<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.770> arrow<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> map<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
we also have an arrow on the map that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.390 
we also have an arrow on the map that
shows<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.150> found<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.600> pointing<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
shows which we found is pointing and the

shows which we found is pointing and the
real<00:01:20.580> world<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.540> cool<00:01:22.310> we're

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to point this way and we're going to get

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
to point this way and we're going to get
a<00:01:30.840> different<00:01:31.079> list<00:01:31.350> entirely<00:01:31.680> one<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.670> the
