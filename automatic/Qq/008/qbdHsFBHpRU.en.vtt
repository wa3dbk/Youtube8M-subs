00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
ok I'm back and after looking at some of

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.490 
ok I'm back and after looking at some of
this

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
this

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.410 
this
here<00:00:16.710> I've<00:00:17.160> realized<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.850> once<00:00:18.030> again<00:00:18.240> I

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
here I've realized that once again I

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.560 
here I've realized that once again I
need<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.920> dismantle<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.850> wheel<00:00:21.210> off<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
need to dismantle the wheel off the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.730 
need to dismantle the wheel off the
chair<00:00:21.960> again<00:00:22.350> as<00:00:22.619> power<00:00:23.520> supply<00:00:24.029> hooks<00:00:24.390> right

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
chair again as power supply hooks right

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.749 
chair again as power supply hooks right
into<00:00:25.740> there<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> does<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.500> shifter<00:00:29.009> which<00:00:29.520> I

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
into there so does the shifter which I

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.190 
into there so does the shifter which I
only<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> worry<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.390> right<00:00:30.509> now<00:00:30.750> but

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
only have to worry about right now but

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.689 
only have to worry about right now but
it<00:00:31.439> also<00:00:31.590> hooks<00:00:31.890> into<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> other<00:00:32.309> side<00:00:32.580> where

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 
it also hooks into the other side where

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.490 
it also hooks into the other side where
I<00:00:32.790> was<00:00:32.879> trying<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> look<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.510> pedals<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
I was trying to look up the pedals the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.830 
I was trying to look up the pedals the
first<00:00:34.710> time<00:00:34.949> so<00:00:35.370> kind<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.239> pays<00:00:36.390> off<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
first time so kind of pays off to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
first time so kind of pays off to
actually<00:00:37.290> look<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.280> you're<00:00:38.400> trying<00:00:38.580> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
actually look at what you're trying to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.500 
actually look at what you're trying to
do<00:00:38.989> um<00:00:41.720> looks<00:00:42.720> like<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.890> computer

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
do um looks like to be to the computer

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.139 
do um looks like to be to the computer
the<00:00:45.510> PlayStation<00:00:47.930> as<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.290> here<00:00:50.149> like

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the PlayStation as you can see here like

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.069 
the PlayStation as you can see here like
I<00:00:51.270> said<00:00:51.329> before<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.520> undo<00:00:53.719> one<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> these<00:00:54.930> right

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
I said before to undo one of these right

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.160 
I said before to undo one of these right
here<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.770> simply<00:00:56.340> push<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.850> twist<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.960> left

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
here you simply push it in twist it left

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.840 
here you simply push it in twist it left
and<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.829> pops<00:00:59.040> out<00:00:59.899> once<00:01:00.899> again<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.320> shut<00:01:01.680> it

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
and it pops out once again to shut it

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.029 
and it pops out once again to shut it
push<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:03.949> and<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
push it in just to the right and it

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.770 
push it in just to the right and it
locks<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.289> mean<00:01:08.300> not<00:01:09.300> that<00:01:09.330> difficult

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
locks in so I mean not that difficult

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.830 
locks in so I mean not that difficult
process<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:11.090> painstaking<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.240> you're<00:01:12.539> like

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
process just painstaking if you're like

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.090 
process just painstaking if you're like
me<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> read<00:01:13.890> directions

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
me and you don't like to read directions

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.770 
me and you don't like to read directions
before<00:01:14.399> you<00:01:14.550> actually<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.880> stuff<00:01:14.940> so<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.630> ended

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
before you actually do stuff so I ended

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.540 
before you actually do stuff so I ended
up<00:01:15.840> screwing<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.320> everything<00:01:16.440> in<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.100> long

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
up screwing up everything in the long

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.700 
up screwing up everything in the long
run<00:01:17.580> making<00:01:18.509> everything<00:01:18.720> longer<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.410> more

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
run making everything longer and more

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.820 
run making everything longer and more
drawn<00:01:19.950> out<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.790> let's<00:01:21.240> take<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.170> off<00:01:22.409> again

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
drawn out so let's take this off again

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:46.730 
drawn out so let's take this off again
and<00:01:23.040> put<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.780> power<00:01:24.780> supply<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:44.210> it's<00:01:45.619> kind<00:01:46.619> of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and put the power supply in it's kind of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.499 
and put the power supply in it's kind of
hard<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.329> hole

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
hard to see but it's it's a little hole

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.120 
hard to see but it's it's a little hole
right<00:01:48.689> next<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> where<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:51.140> pedals<00:01:52.140> hook<00:01:52.920> into

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
right next to where the pedals hook into

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
right next to where the pedals hook into
so<00:01:54.110> just<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.470> where<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:57.350> i'll

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
so just so you see where it's at i'll

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.510 
so just so you see where it's at i'll
try<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.579> where<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.090> i<00:02:00.119> guess<00:02:01.520> take

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
try to see where it's at i guess take

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.749 
try to see where it's at i guess take
this<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.180> plug<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.750> right<00:02:03.780> into<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
this just plug it right into here and

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:12.259 
this just plug it right into here and
then<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.689> before<00:02:08.269> undo<00:02:09.269> this<00:02:09.420> real<00:02:09.660> quick<00:02:11.209> as<00:02:12.209> a

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
then as before undo this real quick as a

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.960 
then as before undo this real quick as a
little<00:02:12.570> bow<00:02:12.750> tie<00:02:13.019> on<00:02:13.049> there<00:02:13.730> with<00:02:14.730> all<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
little bow tie on there with all the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.600 
little bow tie on there with all the
cables

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.520 

go<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:24.390> guess<00:02:25.390> try<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.200> fit<00:02:26.769> all<00:02:26.980> your<00:02:28.530> cables

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
go I guess try to fit all your cables

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.170 
go I guess try to fit all your cables
into<00:02:29.739> these<00:02:29.890> little<00:02:29.950> notches<00:02:30.370> here<00:02:30.730> because

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
into these little notches here because

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.180 
into these little notches here because
it'll<00:02:31.510> really<00:02:31.750> clear<00:02:32.440> things<00:02:32.680> up<00:02:32.830> for<00:02:32.890> you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
it'll really clear things up for you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.949 
it'll really clear things up for you
live<00:02:33.340> in<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.580> long<00:02:33.790> run<00:02:33.819> make<00:02:34.659> everything

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
live in the long run make everything

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.860 
live in the long run make everything
less<00:02:35.590> messy<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.209> overall<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.480> will<00:02:37.540> give<00:02:37.720> your

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
less messy and overall it will give your

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.430 
less messy and overall it will give your
steering<00:02:38.680> wheel<00:02:38.769> more<00:02:39.670> grip<00:02:39.970> once<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:41.049> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
steering wheel more grip once on the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.559 
steering wheel more grip once on the
stand<00:02:41.739> because<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.549> know<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:43.329> don't<00:02:43.510> have

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
stand because you know you don't have

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.190 
stand because you know you don't have
all<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.230> wires<00:02:45.129> messing<00:02:45.430> up<00:02:45.519> with<00:02:45.700> how<00:02:46.200> high

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
all the wires messing up with how high

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.069 
all the wires messing up with how high
up<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.769> we're<00:02:48.340> low<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:50.260> may<00:02:50.500> be<00:02:51.900> stood<00:02:52.900> that

bit<00:03:12.000> because<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.390> really<00:03:13.599> don't<00:03:13.659> want<00:03:13.840> to

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
bit because you really don't want to

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.420 
bit because you really don't want to
have<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.079> bunch<00:03:14.349> of<00:03:14.500> pedals<00:03:14.799> get<00:03:15.069> in<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.280> way

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
have a bunch of pedals get in the way

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.509 
have a bunch of pedals get in the way
while<00:03:15.730> you're<00:03:15.970> trying<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.390> race<00:03:17.349> so<00:03:18.159> I<00:03:20.519> mean

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
while you're trying to race so I mean

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:29.280 
while you're trying to race so I mean
you<00:03:21.760> can<00:03:21.940> see<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.230> hooked<00:03:23.230> my<00:03:24.660> xbox<00:03:26.639> stuff<00:03:28.109> up<00:03:29.109> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
you can see I hooked my xbox stuff up to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.270 
you can see I hooked my xbox stuff up to
the<00:03:29.380> actual<00:03:29.620> stand<00:03:29.950> itself<00:03:30.340> using<00:03:30.790> some<00:03:32.280> teeth

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
the actual stand itself using some teeth

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.030 
the actual stand itself using some teeth
wire<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.480> guess<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:34.989> i<00:03:35.230> don't<00:03:35.260> really<00:03:35.950> know

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
wire I guess it is i don't really know

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.670 
wire I guess it is i don't really know
the<00:03:36.310> exact<00:03:36.639> term<00:03:36.879> but<00:03:37.209> that's<00:03:37.930> what<00:03:38.109> it<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.260> for

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
the exact term but that's what it is for

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.039 
the exact term but that's what it is for
me<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.730> then<00:03:40.450> i<00:03:40.980> will<00:03:42.480> continue<00:03:43.480> hooking<00:03:43.810> this

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
me and then i will continue hooking this

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.680 
me and then i will continue hooking this
up<00:03:44.230> basically<00:03:45.040> all<00:03:45.069> you<00:03:45.220> have<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.370> do<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.760> hook

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
up basically all you have to do is hook

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.059 
up basically all you have to do is hook
this<00:03:46.930> power<00:03:47.260> supply<00:03:47.500> up<00:03:47.650> like<00:03:47.799> you<00:03:47.919> would

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
this power supply up like you would

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.920 
this power supply up like you would
anything<00:03:48.340> else<00:03:48.730> with<00:03:48.879> an<00:03:49.000> adapter<00:03:49.239> because

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
anything else with an adapter because

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.750 
anything else with an adapter because
the<00:03:50.290> camera<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.739> running<00:03:50.829> out<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.040> battery<00:03:51.430> so

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
the camera is running out of battery so

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.610 
the camera is running out of battery so
i<00:03:51.790> need<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.180> let<00:03:52.359> it<00:03:52.389> charge<00:03:52.720> for<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.079> bit<00:03:53.260> so

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
i need to let it charge for a bit so

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.409 
i need to let it charge for a bit so
this<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.639> end<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:56.400> unboxing

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
this is the end of the unboxing

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.300 
this is the end of the unboxing
