00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
fantastic and this guitar really nice

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.890 
fantastic and this guitar really nice
sort<00:01:06.100> of<00:01:06.159> sound<00:01:06.400> we're<00:01:06.700> going<00:01:06.910> on<00:01:07.060> we've<00:01:07.750> got

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
sort of sound we're going on we've got

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.280 
sort of sound we're going on we've got
an<00:01:08.020> edge<00:01:08.260> zero<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.460> tremolo<00:01:10.090> which<00:01:10.780> if<00:01:11.050> we<00:01:11.170> look

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
an edge zero to tremolo which if we look

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.260 
an edge zero to tremolo which if we look
at<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.500> back<00:01:11.710> here<00:01:11.740> it's<00:01:12.400> got<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.700> zero<00:01:12.910> point

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
at the back here it's got the zero point

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.480 
at the back here it's got the zero point
system<00:01:13.810> which<00:01:14.320> basically<00:01:14.500> keeps<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.220> tremolo

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
system which basically keeps the tremolo

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.080 
system which basically keeps the tremolo
at<00:01:16.410> even<00:01:17.410> standing<00:01:17.980> with<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.220> body<00:01:18.730> so<00:01:19.030> it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
at even standing with the body so it

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.700 
at even standing with the body so it
doesn't<00:01:19.360> sort<00:01:19.660> of<00:01:19.810> get<00:01:20.020> seen<00:01:20.350> when<00:01:20.500> it<00:01:20.530> goes

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
doesn't sort of get seen when it goes

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.950 
doesn't sort of get seen when it goes
back<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.190> zero<00:01:21.220> point<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:21.760> comes<00:01:22.000> back<00:01:22.240> in<00:01:22.450> nice

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
back to zero point it comes back in nice

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.480 
back to zero point it comes back in nice
and<00:01:23.140> easy<00:01:23.260> but<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:23.770> also<00:01:23.920> take<00:01:24.160> that<00:01:24.190> out

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
and easy but you can also take that out

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.400 
and easy but you can also take that out
if<00:01:24.730> you<00:01:24.820> wish<00:01:24.970> it's<00:01:25.150> being<00:01:25.360> more<00:01:25.480> three<00:01:25.690> but

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
if you wish it's being more three but

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.260 
if you wish it's being more three but
for<00:01:26.560> 7-string<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.160> think<00:01:27.340> that's<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.700> brilliant

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
for 7-string I think that's a brilliant

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.960 
for 7-string I think that's a brilliant
idea<00:01:28.570> because<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.170> really<00:01:29.350> need<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.970> sort

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
idea because you really need that sort

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.490 
idea because you really need that sort
of<00:01:31.030> tuning<00:01:31.390> stability<00:01:31.570> especially<00:01:32.050> in<00:01:32.410> the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
of tuning stability especially in the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.490 
of tuning stability especially in the
low<00:01:32.620> end<00:01:32.650> we've<00:01:33.460> got<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.670> 5-way<00:01:34.600> pickup<00:01:34.870> switch

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
low end we've got a 5-way pickup switch

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.590 
low end we've got a 5-way pickup switch
here<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.400> get<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.550> whole<00:01:37.000> variety<00:01:37.150> of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
here so you get a whole variety of

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.920 
here so you get a whole variety of
humbucking<00:01:38.380> hands<00:01:38.710> or<00:01:39.010> parallel<00:01:39.460> tones

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
humbucking hands or parallel tones

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.820 
humbucking hands or parallel tones
volume<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.610> tone<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:44.170> there<00:01:44.380> we<00:01:44.500> go<00:01:44.620> that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
volume and tone and so there we go that

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.190 
volume and tone and so there we go that
is<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.060> that's<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.300> basis<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.080> just

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
is the that's the basis of it it just

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.810 
is the that's the basis of it it just
sounds<00:01:47.560> fantastic<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.340> let's<00:01:48.520> have<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.670> listen

sounds fantastic so let's have a listen

00:01:48.820 --> 00:03:19.500 
sounds fantastic so let's have a listen
to<00:01:49.000> how<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.330> sounds
