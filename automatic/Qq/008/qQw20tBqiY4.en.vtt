rather<00:02:20.530> because<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.220> light<00:02:21.400> screen<00:02:21.670> I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
rather because of light screen I

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.310 
rather because of light screen I
completely<00:02:22.690> forgot<00:02:23.020> about<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.150> he's

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
completely forgot about it and he's

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.240 
completely forgot about it and he's
curiously<00:02:26.320> going<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.100> brick<00:02:27.520> break<00:02:27.790> me<00:02:28.200> after

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
curiously going to brick break me after

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.340 
curiously going to brick break me after
the<00:02:30.250> light<00:02:30.730> screen<00:02:30.940> goes<00:02:31.150> away<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.140> is

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the light screen goes away so that is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.690 
the light screen goes away so that is
pretty<00:02:35.430> um<00:02:37.260> well<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.160> good<00:02:39.400> thing

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
pretty um well it's not a good thing

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.640 
pretty um well it's not a good thing
because<00:02:40.300> he<00:02:40.570> should<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:40.840> done<00:02:40.960> it<00:02:41.110> first<00:02:41.350> and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
because he should have done it first and

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.410 
because he should have done it first and
then<00:02:41.680> probably<00:02:42.640> Brick<00:02:43.030> Break<00:02:43.060> would've

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
then probably Brick Break would've

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.200 
then probably Brick Break would've
brickma<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:43.900> because<00:02:44.260> he<00:02:44.320> had<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.440> coil<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.210> all

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
brickma so because he had a coil and all

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.280 
brickma so because he had a coil and all

contact um so I decided that Chomper is
my<00:05:06.090> best<00:05:06.360> bet<00:05:06.540> he<00:05:07.320> can<00:05:07.470> hopefully<00:05:07.770> take<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.430> out

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520
