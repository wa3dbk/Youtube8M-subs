entry into the wearable market which is

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.710 
entry into the wearable market which is
still<00:00:52.340> not<00:00:52.520> confirmed<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.240> may<00:00:53.450> not<00:00:53.570> even

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
still not confirmed and may not even

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.840 
still not confirmed and may not even
exist<00:00:53.990> but<00:00:54.770> if<00:00:54.860> it<00:00:54.980> does<00:00:55.190> launch<00:00:55.580> it'll

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
exist but if it does launch it'll

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.240 
exist but if it does launch it'll
probably<00:00:56.000> launch<00:00:56.300> in<00:00:56.510> September<00:00:56.990> or<00:00:57.020> October

probably launch in September or October

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.160

about<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.400> time<00:00:58.670> when<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.060> new<00:00:59.210> iPods<00:00:59.660> would

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
about the time when the new iPods would

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.160 
about the time when the new iPods would
normally<00:01:00.620> be<00:01:00.830> unveiled<00:01:01.400> now<00:01:02.360> in<00:01:02.540> some<00:01:02.840> ways<00:01:02.990> it

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
normally be unveiled now in some ways it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.990 
normally be unveiled now in some ways it
does<00:01:03.320> make<00:01:03.560> sense<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.129> Apple<00:01:04.489> would<00:01:04.640> want<00:01:04.820> to

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
does make sense the Apple would want to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.880 
does make sense the Apple would want to
push<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.449> iPod<00:01:05.720> Touch<00:01:05.869> 5th<00:01:06.079> generation<00:01:06.229> and

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
push the iPod Touch 5th generation and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.999 
push the iPod Touch 5th generation and
any<00:01:07.399> new<00:01:07.670> iPod<00:01:08.030> models<00:01:08.359> into<00:01:08.600> 2015<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.740> make<00:01:09.890> it

any new iPod models into 2015 to make it

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.770

easier for their customers to spend

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.529 
easier for their customers to spend
money<00:01:12.079> on<00:01:12.200> an<00:01:12.380> iWatch<00:01:12.829> but<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.030> reasoning

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539
