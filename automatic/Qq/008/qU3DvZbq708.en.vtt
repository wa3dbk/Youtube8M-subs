00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.419
 hello to all and all these figures of 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.300
 tomatoes for a new video 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.529
 so today I will introduce you 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.810
 how well started in minecraft 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.110
 simply to start the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.230
 video and we'll see in several 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.110
 steps after over time how 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.800
 mines and minerals etc 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:49.620
 you will see well go good good video 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.510
 so in the beginning we start I take the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.479
 map 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.400
 I look pretty much where is 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.430
 I try to avoid the snow because 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.339
 it's a place that I do not like so 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.320
 I start I take wood so 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.540
 preferably I take 10 not more 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 to start what it's all for nothing 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.130
 knowing that you have to take shelter before 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.140
 night 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.470
 So here it is, it's really for 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.840
 start as a beginner 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.460
 after, of course, for connoisseurs 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.259
 you can put the workshop directly 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.560
 made cloud finally for is there for 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.350
 go faster so what are you going 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 see there I take no more than ten months 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.069
 to start quietly 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:40.069
 so it's a bit long 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:42.329
 like that in hand it speaks is 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.240
 so then I look a little bit 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.640
 on the map so here I am bar 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.200
 the snow because it's not my corner 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.399
 prefer 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.590
 so first we have to find 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.289
 sheep so to make a 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.759
 handlebars to make a bed it takes 3 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.480
 aisne 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:10.930
 that's good 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:12.220
 it takes to bale him it's so bad 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.290
 it's a bit long to kill animals in 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.030
 manu we can make a sword of course 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.020
 the bomb there that's really the way 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.440
 beginner started for those who do not 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.730
 do not know minecraft to learn it 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.530
 simply 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.830
 so here I am at the aisne so a 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.830
 third 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.660
 I fell well so no matter the 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.980
 color that is doubling his patience and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.980
 wool workers anyway 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:45.480
 Here I like and then Rolen auxi am 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.800
 the little pig we'll go there too 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.270
 good fairy 30 body athletes lo 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:02.380
 so it's a bit long to kill them as 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:07.660
 that with a wooden cube I'll let you 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:10.150
 no it's so here are the poor them they 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.130
 really give that meat is a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.930
 little price geeks so we could see the xp 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.800
 it's the little green bar underneath 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.260
 hearts that fills each time 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.020
 that you do something like kills 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.530
 animals monsters and so it's 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.070
 the image provides food but 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.390
 not only 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.300
 Too bad for you it provides leather 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.800
 so the leather is very useful at the beginning 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.380
 to start you will see in a 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.160
 next video that I will make you 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.010
 why leather is useful then come 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.500
 here it's true that it's not practical 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.920
 without a sword, but hey it's just for 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.180
 show here so at the beginning do not have to 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.120
 to annoy you have to build a 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.300
 little house just claudie it's 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.340
 a quiet place before dark 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.900
 of the night 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.400
 like there for example that's it will be very 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.430
 well 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.220
 the cubes of earth this may be when 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.690
 even doing the workshop is maybe a 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.880
 little better 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:17.670
 so here is finally the workshop boards 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:22.310
 wood hop like that one installs 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:26.250
 we make a pickaxe and sticks 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.250
 here is a piece of wood will suffice for 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.990
 the moment to dig a small house 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.330
 any simple after that to modify by 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.830
 yourself 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.570
 so here we pick up the stone well 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.010
 plus there is coal so it's 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.670
 beautiful that was not often that 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.400
 happen like that was going very well so 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.450
 we still dig a little trick 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:55.400
 wide a simple but wide to be able 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:05:00.170
 install the bed the workshop a chest and 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:04.740
 an oven so there I still find a little 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.250
 again it must be enough 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.700
 wide g 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.020
 on the other hand, it is said 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.020
 right next because I hear 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:21.630
 a beautiful garden sharon that will suffice for 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.669
 show you what I have to show you 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.000
 so we take a workshop we will 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.650
 put inside preferably after 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 it's according to your way of doing me I 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:37.870
 just shows you how I do it 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:41.470
 to proceed then the workshop then more 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.639
 makes the bed be an oven because 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.370
 I have the pair I have what it takes on 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.370
 the hand so the book the mattress by 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.580
 example adding now chest is 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.229
 here I installed oven here so I 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.450
 go slowly so that you can 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.530
 see correctly what I'm doing the 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.550
 charcoal and you can cook the steaks 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.070
 weight hurdle finally side of the 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.810
 portable 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.389
 then I make a door so the door 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.789
 in wood not very effective so you 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.020
 can make an iron door later 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.550
 because wooden door zombies 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.270
 can smash therefore is boring 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:23.110
 so see put a cube 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:26.789
 rush for the night here is the port 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:30.520
 I eat a little here to resume 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:32.620
 then you have to see all the 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.690
 ways a sword is making a sword 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.220
 to defend himself in case 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.930
 so after you can do as you 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.840
 will want according to the minerals that you 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:46.889
 find the same for axes and 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.889
 so that's going to be cooked 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:54.170
 we will take that no I will remove 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.400
 here we are going to make torches 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.300
 since it takes torches to illuminate 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.430
 inside your house and 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.070
 outdoors 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:05.270
 so that 's coal debate 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:07.190
 just 4 so that's enough for you 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.290
 put a 2 it's you who see 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.650
 simply who's lighting we're going 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:15.350
 the cube up and one inside and me 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.540
 I want your little cube the outside the 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.160
 simple landmarks if I ever want one 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.920
 little further to find the map 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.990
 so that's it so I hope it has you 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.390
 more and I'll show you a next 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.390
 video very soon thank you very much
