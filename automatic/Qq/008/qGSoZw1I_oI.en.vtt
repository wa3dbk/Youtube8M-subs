here and what we want to do ties in

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:45.250 
here and what we want to do ties in
comes<00:01:34.509> up<00:01:35.369> into<00:01:36.369> your<00:01:38.100> Hartford<00:01:39.100> loop

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.110 

it<00:01:46.040> comes<00:01:46.310> up<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:46.820> over<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:49.460> ties<00:01:49.790> back<00:01:50.060> into

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
it comes up and over and ties back into

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:00.110 
it comes up and over and ties back into
the<00:01:50.570> boiler

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.250 

this<00:02:01.120> goes<00:02:01.360> down<00:02:01.630> into<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.230> boiler<00:02:03.930> comes<00:02:04.930> up

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
this goes down into the boiler comes up

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.240 
this goes down into the boiler comes up
and<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:06.070> branch<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.090> return<00:02:08.250> this

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and this branch is the return this
