did not notice any drops which is a huge
improvement<00:01:20.909> from<00:01:21.299> where<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.750> were<00:01:21.780> at<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
improvement from where we were at the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
improvement from where we were at the
beginning<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.860> year<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.270> that's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
beginning of this year so that's that's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.140 
beginning of this year so that's that's
good<00:01:24.810> news

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
good news

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.710 
good news
but<00:01:26.750> there's<00:01:27.230> not<00:01:27.830> all<00:01:28.270> positives<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.420> this

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
but there's not all positives to this

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.860 
but there's not all positives to this
game<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.140> still<00:01:30.560> feel<00:01:30.830> conflicted<00:01:31.310> about<00:01:31.910> what

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
game I still feel conflicted about what

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.010 
game I still feel conflicted about what
the<00:01:33.170> order<00:01:33.350> is<00:01:34.030> starting<00:01:35.030> off<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.510> camera

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
the order is starting off the camera

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.990 
the order is starting off the camera
felt<00:01:36.230> kind<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.650> claustrophobic<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:37.670> me<00:01:37.820> that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
felt kind of claustrophobic to me that

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600 
felt kind of claustrophobic to me that
may<00:01:38.150> come<00:01:38.360> off<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.540> nitpicking<00:01:39.260> but<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:40.280> just

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
may come off as nitpicking but it just

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.150 
may come off as nitpicking but it just
was<00:01:40.880> something<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.300> was<00:01:41.540> right<00:01:42.530> there<00:01:42.890> and

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
was something that was right there and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.300 
was something that was right there and
felt<00:01:43.700> off<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.750> me<00:01:44.900> this<00:01:45.500> may<00:01:45.680> be<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.830> result<00:01:46.040> of

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
felt off to me this may be a result of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.430 
felt off to me this may be a result of
the<00:01:46.490> aspect<00:01:46.970> ratio<00:01:47.030> actually<00:01:47.750> has<00:01:47.900> when<00:01:48.410> I

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
the aspect ratio actually has when I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.620 
the aspect ratio actually has when I
played<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.010> evil<00:01:49.310> within<00:01:49.430> which<00:01:50.240> uses<00:01:50.600> a

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
played the evil within which uses a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.420 
played the evil within which uses a
similar<00:01:50.990> design<00:01:51.260> with<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:52.220> letter

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
similar design with the the letter

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.830 
similar design with the the letter
boxing<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.030> top<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.420> bottom<00:01:53.570> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
boxing on the top and bottom the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.560 
boxing on the top and bottom the
different<00:01:54.200> aspect<00:01:54.620> ratio<00:01:54.980> I<00:01:55.250> felt<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.330> same

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
different aspect ratio I felt the same

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.660 
different aspect ratio I felt the same
at<00:01:56.750> different<00:01:57.140> points<00:01:57.380> as<00:01:57.530> well<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:58.430> camera

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
at different points as well the camera

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.300 
at different points as well the camera
wasn't<00:01:59.000> quite<00:01:59.450> as<00:01:59.630> tight<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.920> character

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
wasn't quite as tight on the character

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.920 
wasn't quite as tight on the character
in<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.610> game<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:01.970> there<00:02:02.180> were<00:02:02.360> times<00:02:02.600> where

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
in that game but there were times where

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.800 
in that game but there were times where
I<00:02:02.960> felt<00:02:03.020> like<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.710> was<00:02:04.310> in<00:02:04.340> way<00:02:04.820> too<00:02:04.880> close<00:02:05.479> and

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
I felt like I was in way too close and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.570 
I felt like I was in way too close and
it<00:02:06.410> worked<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.860> little<00:02:07.010> better<00:02:07.220> than<00:02:07.460> that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
it worked a little better than that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.130 
it worked a little better than that
because<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:08.030> was<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> horror<00:02:08.479> game<00:02:08.600> but<00:02:08.990> for

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
because it was a horror game but for

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.960 
because it was a horror game but for
this<00:02:09.260> at<00:02:09.800> least<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.250> section<00:02:10.610> i'm<00:02:10.700> playing

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
this at least the section i'm playing

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.090 
this at least the section i'm playing
was<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:11.570> was<00:02:12.050> supposed<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.470> be<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> third-person

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
was it was supposed to be a third-person

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.770 
was it was supposed to be a third-person
shooter<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.880> felt<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.360> little<00:02:14.570> awkward

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
shooter so it felt a little awkward

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.660 
shooter so it felt a little awkward
getting<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.860> out<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.010> cover<00:02:16.340> especially

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
getting in and out of cover especially

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.660 
getting in and out of cover especially
with<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> camera<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.500> tight<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
with the camera in that tight the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.990 
with the camera in that tight the
gameplay<00:02:20.120> itself<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.950> wasn't<00:02:21.950> blown<00:02:22.220> away<00:02:22.459> you

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
gameplay itself I wasn't blown away you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.240 
gameplay itself I wasn't blown away you
know<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:24.200> don't<00:02:24.590> know<00:02:24.680> if<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:24.830> want<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.010> say<00:02:25.130> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.699 
know I I don't know if I want to say it
was<00:02:25.370> lacking<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.780> demo<00:02:27.020> itself<00:02:27.500> what

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
was lacking but the demo itself what

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.470 
was lacking but the demo itself what
you're<00:02:27.830> seeing<00:02:28.130> here<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.459> footage<00:02:29.060> which<00:02:29.330> is

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
you're seeing here this footage which is

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.410 
you're seeing here this footage which is
not<00:02:29.630> my<00:02:29.780> own<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.440> demo<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:30.739> played

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
not my own but it is the demo I played

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.320 
not my own but it is the demo I played
it's<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:33.019> I<00:02:33.350> don't<00:02:34.220> know<00:02:34.400> because<00:02:34.970> maybe

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
it's just I don't know because maybe

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.699 
it's just I don't know because maybe
because<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.690> footage<00:02:35.959> has<00:02:36.110> been<00:02:36.140> around<00:02:36.440> for

because the footage has been around for
so<00:02:36.860> long<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.489> just<00:02:37.940> wasn't<00:02:38.420> really<00:02:39.970> blown<00:02:40.970> away

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
so long I just wasn't really blown away

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.380 
so long I just wasn't really blown away

work<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.019> idea<00:03:15.320> of<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> thermite

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.670 
work and the the idea of the thermite
rifle<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.459> cool<00:03:16.730> they<00:03:17.510> felt<00:03:17.989> less<00:03:18.230> powerful

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
rifle is cool they felt less powerful

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.500 
rifle is cool they felt less powerful
than<00:03:18.890> I'd<00:03:19.130> hoped<00:03:19.310> especially<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> thermite

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
than I'd hoped especially the thermite

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.080 
than I'd hoped especially the thermite
rifle<00:03:20.930> III<00:03:21.769> really<00:03:22.160> hope<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.790> would<00:03:22.910> pack

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
rifle III really hope that would pack

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.870 
rifle III really hope that would pack
more<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.750> punch<00:03:23.780> with<00:03:24.350> with<00:03:24.799> more<00:03:25.130> explosive

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
more of a punch with with more explosive

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.060 
more of a punch with with more explosive
power<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:27.080> ignition<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.560> thermite<00:03:27.920> is

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
power the ignition of the thermite is

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.250 
power the ignition of the thermite is
definitely<00:03:28.640> just<00:03:28.790> gorgeous<00:03:29.420> see<00:03:29.989> this<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.230> a
