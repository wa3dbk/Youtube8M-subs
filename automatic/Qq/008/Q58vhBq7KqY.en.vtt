years<00:00:08.940> I've<00:00:09.630> painted<00:00:09.929> all<00:00:10.349> sorts<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.860> plastics

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
years I've painted all sorts of plastics

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.849 
years I've painted all sorts of plastics
fiberglass<00:00:13.040> how<00:00:14.839> it's<00:00:15.839> preparation<00:00:16.650> where<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
fiberglass how it's preparation where I

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.240 
fiberglass how it's preparation where I
prepared<00:00:17.369> cars<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:18.660> six<00:00:19.080> years<00:00:19.250> so

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
prepared cars for about six years so

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.400 
prepared cars for about six years so
it's<00:00:20.550> basically<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> same<00:00:21.210> thing<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.660> what

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
it's basically the same thing but what

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.460 
it's basically the same thing but what
you<00:00:22.529> want<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> use<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.580> these<00:00:24.470> burgundy

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470

scotch-brite because big sanding the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
scotch-brite because big sanding the
cracks<00:00:29.010> better<00:00:29.340> than<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.699> paper<00:00:29.939> sandpaper

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599

the plastic and another good thing you
can<00:00:39.059> use<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:40.070> adhesion<00:00:41.070> promoter<00:00:41.700> primer

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
can use is a adhesion promoter primer

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.680 
can use is a adhesion promoter primer
whether<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.230> primer<00:00:43.620> itself<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.340> he's

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
whether it's primer itself that he's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.130 
whether it's primer itself that he's
adhesives<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.100> plastic<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> glue<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
adhesives to the plastic as a glue but

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
adhesives to the plastic as a glue but
you<00:00:49.140> must<00:00:49.469> sand<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.610> don't<00:00:50.820> sand<00:00:51.149> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
you must sand it if you don't sand it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
you must sand it if you don't sand it
your<00:00:52.320> paint<00:00:53.129> primer<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.300> stick<00:00:54.860> either

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860

your paint primer will not stick either
you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.250> bend<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.789> plastic<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.870> pop

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you can bend the plastic and gonna pop

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.650 
you can bend the plastic and gonna pop
off<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.859> very<00:00:59.670> important<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> make<00:01:00.420> sure<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
off so very important to make sure you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.070 
off so very important to make sure you
standard<00:01:03.199> with<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.710> least<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.189> some<00:01:06.080> 320

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
or 220 is okay I like to do it dry

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.810 
or 220 is okay I like to do it dry

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
primer because I sanded my plastic very

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020 
primer because I sanded my plastic very
well<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.500> scotch<00:01:34.860> brite<00:01:35.159> until<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> was<00:01:35.820> not

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
well with scotch brite until it was not

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.670 
well with scotch brite until it was not
glossy<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
glossy and

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.210 
glossy and
so<00:01:39.460> anyway<00:01:39.850> if<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.180> if<00:01:40.420> it's<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:41.010> solid<00:01:42.010> base

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
so anyway if you if it's a solid base

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.940 
so anyway if you if it's a solid base
painting<00:01:42.640> you're<00:01:42.730> not<00:01:42.880> using<00:01:43.140> metallic<00:01:44.140> you

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
painting you're not using metallic you

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.090 
painting you're not using metallic you
can<00:01:45.220> paint<00:01:45.760> with<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.470> rather<00:01:47.470> than<00:01:47.740> use<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
can paint with that rather than use the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.930 
can paint with that rather than use the
primer<00:01:48.400> because<00:01:48.850> it'll<00:01:49.750> cover<00:01:50.020> better<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:52.150> I

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
primer because it'll cover better so I

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.620 
primer because it'll cover better so I
used

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.990 

for<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.290> metallic<00:02:02.229> this<00:02:03.229> here<00:02:03.530> all<00:02:06.790> call<00:02:07.790> up
