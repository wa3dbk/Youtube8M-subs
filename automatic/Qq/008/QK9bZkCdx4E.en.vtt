in<00:00:01.040> these<00:00:01.520> soils<00:00:02.510> we<00:00:02.659> have<00:00:03.399> high<00:00:04.399> ph<00:00:04.759> soils

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330 
in these soils we have high ph soils

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.740 
in these soils we have high ph soils
lots<00:00:05.900> of<00:00:06.080> calcium<00:00:06.609> they're<00:00:07.609> low<00:00:07.970> in<00:00:08.000> organic

lots of calcium they're low in organic

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.620 
lots of calcium they're low in organic
matter<00:00:09.460> the<00:00:10.460> organic<00:00:10.760> matters<00:00:11.420> not

contributing<00:00:12.320> much<00:00:12.559> to<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:12.920> crop<00:00:13.389> lots<00:00:14.389> of

contributing much to the crop lots of

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.320 
contributing much to the crop lots of
times<00:00:14.840> these<00:00:15.230> soils<00:00:15.740> will<00:00:15.860> be<00:00:16.070> one<00:00:16.520> percent<00:00:17.090> or

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
times these soils will be one percent or

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.980 
times these soils will be one percent or
less<00:00:17.570> in<00:00:17.900> organic<00:00:18.410> matter<00:00:18.820> and<00:00:19.990> our

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
less in organic matter and our

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.880 
less in organic matter and our
irrigation<00:00:21.859> water<00:00:22.460> is<00:00:22.930> normally<00:00:23.930> high<00:00:24.199> in<00:00:24.410> pH

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
irrigation water is normally high in pH

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.450 
irrigation water is normally high in pH
also<00:00:26.470> seven<00:00:27.470> five<00:00:27.740> to<00:00:28.130> eight<00:00:28.369> so<00:00:28.939> it's

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
also seven five to eight so it's

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.490 
also seven five to eight so it's
particularly<00:00:31.689> challenging<00:00:32.689> for<00:00:32.960> these<00:00:33.110> crops

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
particularly challenging for these crops

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.520 
particularly challenging for these crops
and<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:33.980> anything<00:00:34.370> we<00:00:34.520> can<00:00:34.700> do<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:34.940> increase

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
and so anything we can do to increase

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.290 
and so anything we can do to increase
the<00:00:36.530> efficiency<00:00:37.070> of<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.460> fertilizers<00:00:38.090> we're

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
the efficiency of the fertilizers we're

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.020 
the efficiency of the fertilizers we're
putting<00:00:38.719> out<00:00:38.930> will<00:00:39.350> improve<00:00:40.070> these<00:00:40.579> crops

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
putting out will improve these crops

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.600 
putting out will improve these crops
there<00:00:41.809> is<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:42.020> lot<00:00:42.350> of<00:00:42.379> fall<00:00:42.649> fertilization<00:00:43.579> and

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
there is a lot of fall fertilization and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.479 
there is a lot of fall fertilization and
with<00:00:44.239> high<00:00:44.840> pH<00:00:45.230> soils<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:45.920> plenty<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.280> calcium

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
with high pH soils and plenty of calcium

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.029 
with high pH soils and plenty of calcium
that<00:00:46.969> can<00:00:47.629> be<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.809> problem<00:00:48.140> if<00:00:48.649> we're<00:00:48.860> not

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
that can be a problem if we're not

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.080 
that can be a problem if we're not
protecting<00:00:49.789> our<00:00:49.969> phosphate<00:00:50.600> because<00:00:50.899> it

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
protecting our phosphate because it

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.939 
protecting our phosphate because it
likely<00:00:53.090> will<00:00:53.390> start<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.899> be<00:00:54.050> tied<00:00:54.320> up<00:00:54.350> before

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
likely will start to be tied up before

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.299 
likely will start to be tied up before
spring<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.360> crop<00:00:56.629> is<00:00:56.870> actually<00:00:57.379> planted

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
spring and the crop is actually planted

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.849 
spring and the crop is actually planted
in<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.449> spring<00:00:59.750> they<00:01:00.379> know<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
in the spring they know that the

in the spring they know that the
phosphate<00:01:01.399> is<00:01:01.579> is<00:01:02.420> very<00:01:02.870> important<00:01:03.879> early<00:01:04.879> in

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
phosphate is is very important early in

phosphate is is very important early in
the<00:01:05.119> season<00:01:06.610> when<00:01:07.610> we<00:01:07.790> have<00:01:08.000> cool<00:01:08.810> soil

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
the season when we have cool soil

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.340 
the season when we have cool soil
temperatures<00:01:10.130> often<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.479> plants<00:01:11.869> will<00:01:12.020> start

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
temperatures often the plants will start

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.120 
temperatures often the plants will start
to<00:01:12.470> look<00:01:12.760> purplish<00:01:13.760> because<00:01:14.210> of<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.830> tie<00:01:15.830> up

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
to look purplish because of that tie up

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.990 
to look purplish because of that tie up
of<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.580> phosphate<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:17.600> cold<00:01:18.200> soil<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.100> the

research work that we can protect that

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
nitrogen longer by keeping it in the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.530 
nitrogen longer by keeping it in the
ammonium<00:01:39.409> form<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.820> we<00:01:40.970> can<00:01:41.150> keep<00:01:41.360> the

ammonium form and if we can keep the
nitrogen<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.409> ammonium<00:01:42.950> form<00:01:43.250> longer<00:01:43.670> one

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.389 
nitrogen in the ammonium form longer one
that<00:01:44.270> helps<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.689> plant<00:01:44.990> with<00:01:45.740> its<00:01:45.920> uptake<00:01:46.340> of

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
that helps the plant with its uptake of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.670 
that helps the plant with its uptake of
nitrogen<00:01:47.149> and<00:01:47.329> it's<00:01:48.049> less<00:01:48.500> likely<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.610> be<00:01:50.680> lost

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
nitrogen and it's less likely to be lost

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.280 
nitrogen and it's less likely to be lost
through<00:01:51.979> leaching<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.540> that's<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.049> goal

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
through leaching and so that's the goal

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.850 
through leaching and so that's the goal
of<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.710> Nutri<00:01:55.549> sphere<00:01:55.820> end<00:01:56.200> product<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.439> to

of the Nutri sphere end product is to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.850 
of the Nutri sphere end product is to

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
keep it in the ammonium form in the soil

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.429 
keep it in the ammonium form in the soil
longer<00:02:01.369> we<00:02:01.969> want<00:02:02.299> them<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.540> make<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.990> most<00:02:03.200> out
