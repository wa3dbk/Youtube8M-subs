00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello motorists not only today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.150
 on our stage here this experimental you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.190
 He has already been seen in many of my videos and 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.040
 today today he will 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.260
 modernize one means such 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.779
 my easier let's do and make races 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.769
 Well, let's go well, here we go 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.769
 shops chase 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.140
 Well, I went to the store and bought 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.960
 some good parts 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:45.510
 Now we go to the analysis and buy more 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:47.010
 a couple of parts for our Zaporozhets well 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.650
 here we were on the analysis 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.800
 and I managed to make a bargain I 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.570
 acquired two such pens are here 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.940
 setter useful other parts 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.089
 which we needed was not found alas but 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.050
 it's okay we will find them on 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.920
 other parsing 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.800
 and we went so we returned with 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.020
 the second analysis we did not write 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.659
 video how we got to it means 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.840
 how to summarize everything we bought in 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.530
 Generally for me, well, that means we took 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.610
 wire plan from the VAZ 2108 399 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.420
 then the relay regulator from the VAZ 2101 on 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.790
 three switches 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.110
 we took 1 3 for important and 2 2 for important 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.130
 means given 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
 we took two pens as we have on that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 the doors 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.189
 broke down and we decided to replace so they 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.969
 were the same 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:55.530
 then we took the wheel from oka 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:58.649
 already put it and the nurse from the Muscovite 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.740
 she's not in the best condition but we i 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.079
 just passed until they tried it means well 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.570
 I think that's all 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.360
 Well , I think the first video on this 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.140
 can complete several parts 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.910

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.110

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.360
 bonny wires 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.520
 Relay controller and explain how I set 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.430
