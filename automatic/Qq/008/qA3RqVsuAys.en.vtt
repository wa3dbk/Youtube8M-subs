similar<00:00:48.559> to<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.799> jawbone<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.729> similar<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.449> the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
similar to the jawbone is similar to the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.039 
similar to the jawbone is similar to the
jawbone<00:00:50.979> it<00:00:51.979> sends<00:00:52.519> the<00:00:52.820> vibration<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.629> BOGO

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
jawbone it sends the vibration the BOGO

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.850 
jawbone it sends the vibration the BOGO
vibration<00:00:54.559> at<00:00:54.739> your<00:00:54.860> jaw<00:00:55.269> to<00:00:56.269> make<00:00:56.989> light<00:00:57.710> to

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
vibration at your jaw to make light to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.670 
vibration at your jaw to make light to
cancer<00:00:58.189> holdin<00:00:58.549> all<00:00:58.729> the<00:00:58.820> noises<00:00:59.119> around<00:00:59.680> okay

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
cancer holdin all the noises around okay

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.740 
cancer holdin all the noises around okay
so<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:02.570> stealth<00:01:02.869> mode<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:03.350> then<00:01:03.619> the<00:01:04.280> bone

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
so the stealth mode and then the bone

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.820 
so the stealth mode and then the bone
what<00:01:05.750> they<00:01:05.869> call<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.350> bone<00:01:06.590> conduction

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
what they call is the bone conduction

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.660 
what they call is the bone conduction
technology<00:01:07.400> okay<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.509> you<00:01:08.659> see<00:01:08.719> in<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:10.640> II

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
technology okay the you see in the II

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.760 
technology okay the you see in the II

stealth<00:01:36.979> mode<00:01:37.219> sensor<00:01:37.759> this<00:01:38.689> is<00:01:38.749> the<00:01:39.049> one<00:01:39.200> that

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
stealth mode sensor this is the one that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.529 
stealth mode sensor this is the one that
when<00:01:39.469> you<00:01:39.590> put<00:01:39.829> into<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> year<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:41.119> part

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
when you put into a year this part

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.660 
when you put into a year this part
actually<00:01:41.869> need<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.439> need<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.039> be<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.460> touch

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
actually need to need to be in touch

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.999 
actually need to need to be in touch
with<00:01:43.729> your<00:01:44.060> inner<00:01:44.119> ear<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.289> it<00:01:45.560> sends<00:01:45.770> all<00:01:45.979> of

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
with your inner ear so it sends all of

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.120 
with your inner ear so it sends all of
our<00:01:46.219> patients<00:01:46.429> oh<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.960> cancer<00:01:48.829> all<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
our patients oh and and cancer all the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.830 
our patients oh and and cancer all the
unnecessary<00:01:49.549> noises<00:01:50.439> it<00:01:51.439> has<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.829> microphone

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
unnecessary noises it has to microphone

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.940 
unnecessary noises it has to microphone
it's<00:01:53.840> really<00:01:54.139> hard<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.380> locate<00:01:54.499> where<00:01:54.859> the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
it's really hard to locate where the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.580 
it's really hard to locate where the
phone<00:01:55.130> head<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.880> microphone<00:01:56.299> is<00:01:56.479> but<00:01:56.810> it's

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
phone head the microphone is but it's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.929 
phone head the microphone is but it's
there<00:01:58.780> there's<00:01:59.780> an<00:01:59.899> LED<00:02:00.609> right<00:02:01.609> here<00:02:03.939> decides

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
there there's an LED right here decides

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.609 
there there's an LED right here decides
well<00:02:05.240> let<00:02:05.420> me<00:02:05.539> let<00:02:05.719> me<00:02:05.749> compare<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.380> size

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
well let me let me compare the size

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.779 
well let me let me compare the size
first<00:02:07.360> X<00:02:08.360> x1<00:02:08.660> on<00:02:09.440> out<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:09.830> my<00:02:10.009> hand<00:02:10.250> this<00:02:10.369> one<00:02:10.610> is

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
first X x1 on out on my hand this one is

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.950 
first X x1 on out on my hand this one is
the<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.959> x12

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
the the x12

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.750 
the the x12
look<00:02:14.960> at<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.140> size<00:02:15.350> different<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.580> little

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
look at the size different is a little

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.449 
look at the size different is a little
bit<00:02:17.090> longer

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
bit longer

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.190 
bit longer
then<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.549> would<00:02:19.670> say<00:02:19.819> like<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> x12<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.750> little

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200
