00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:10.250
 the environment I think he is always a 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:13.429
 reflection of what you carry from the 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:20.320
 to which you participated in the 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.320
 environment in which you lived hi kisses 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.879
 I am I was a manager 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.670
 We're here at the office. I'm from 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.790
 who is currently my office 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.670
 interior design and architecture I 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.690
 I always had a great passion for 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.260
 different areas is in music in the movies in 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.839
 plastic arts and I believe that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.360
 architecture, it comes to unite all 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.360
 universes is that I'm in love with 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.900
 it is a reflection of what you 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.160
 believe in what you carry is the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.250
 your choices 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.250
 the design is never one of my reflexes 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.650
 the project must always be an exchange 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.380
 between what you have to offer and the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.810
 luggage that the customer brings here in the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.190
 office so this reflects the very 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.110
 my universe right? 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.330
 the things that I choose the things that 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.810
 I fight for the studio, which is a 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.520
 much reference to my childhood that 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.820
 are those dolls that are 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.520
 hanging on bs plays a little song 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.860
 so he has up to the appetite the original 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.810
 of him hanging in the crib 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.869
 when you are small things seem 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.720
 very big and I always had this 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.729
 feeling of entering the spaces and 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.729
 a space swallowing space will welcome 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.470
 with that who already has people believing
