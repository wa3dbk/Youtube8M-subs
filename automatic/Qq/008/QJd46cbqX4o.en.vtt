first<00:04:05.590> started<00:04:05.920> this<00:04:06.040> whole<00:04:06.340> thing<00:04:06.700> I<00:04:08.310> was

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
first started this whole thing I was

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.000 
first started this whole thing I was
pretty<00:04:09.640> much<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.850> way<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.210> I<00:04:10.270> am<00:04:10.360> now<00:04:10.950> but<00:04:11.950> I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
pretty much the way that I am now but I

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.060 
pretty much the way that I am now but I
look<00:04:12.190> a<00:04:12.280> lot<00:04:12.400> different<00:04:12.460> now<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:14.890> weights

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
look a lot different now so the weights

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.009 
look a lot different now so the weights
just<00:04:15.160> reached<00:04:15.430> you're<00:04:15.640> being<00:04:15.790> itself<00:04:16.120> that

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
just reached you're being itself that

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.910 
just reached you're being itself that
and<00:04:17.350> these<00:04:18.160> were<00:04:18.340> after<00:04:18.549> benches<00:04:19.799> check<00:04:20.799> my

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
and these were after benches check my

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.660 
and these were after benches check my
body<00:04:21.130> fat<00:04:21.340> recently<00:04:21.700> too<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.150> 20.4<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:24.370> go

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.370 
consistent but I've gotten heavier one
person<00:04:31.000> told<00:04:31.120> me<00:04:31.240> it's<00:04:31.360> because<00:04:31.510> I'm<00:04:31.990> gaining

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
person told me it's because I'm gaining

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.810 
person told me it's because I'm gaining
body<00:04:32.590> fat<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.130> muscle<00:04:33.370> at<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.670> same<00:04:33.820> rate

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
body fat and muscle at the same rate

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.260 
body fat and muscle at the same rate
don't<00:04:36.820> know<00:04:36.910> if<00:04:36.970> that's<00:04:37.150> necessarily<00:04:37.360> true<00:04:39.270> it

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
don't know if that's necessarily true it

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.150 
don't know if that's necessarily true it
makes<00:04:40.570> sense<00:04:40.720> now<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.230> think<00:04:41.260> about<00:04:44.160> but

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
makes sense now and I think about but

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.310 
makes sense now and I think about but
anyway<00:04:45.400> I<00:04:45.610> digress<00:04:45.990> cuz<00:04:46.990> I'm<00:04:47.050> not<00:04:47.140> really

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
anyway I digress cuz I'm not really

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.050 
anyway I digress cuz I'm not really
working<00:04:47.770> out<00:04:47.980> so<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.280> can't<00:04:48.490> possibly<00:04:48.640> be<00:04:48.940> any

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
working out so I can't possibly be any

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.010 
working out so I can't possibly be any
muscle<00:04:49.480> um<00:04:49.810> but<00:04:51.480> more<00:04:52.480> things<00:04:52.720> are<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:52.930> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
muscle um but more things are on the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.020 
muscle um but more things are on the
horizon<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:54.280> want<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.640> see<00:04:54.700> what<00:04:54.820> they<00:04:54.910> are

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
horizon and I want to see what they are

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.290 
horizon and I want to see what they are
