00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 however poletti however in company 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:07.259
 of the senator apulia of the movement 5 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 stars to you is we are good morning 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.719
 Gianluca actually continues these 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.460
 distances within the party 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.980
 democratic with all of them 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.390
 differences between the position of those who 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.910
 that today responded in a very manner 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.289
 net to the woods minister because the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.760
 minister woods basically has 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.980
 asked again chiti of 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
 pick up the text the face his drawing 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.119
 of constitutional law claiming that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.780
 already at the time of the olive tree the olive tree 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.730
 presented a reform in which the senate 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.760
 he was not elective but a very senate 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.770
 similar to the German one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 chiti was net we said park has 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.820
 replicated in the woods telling him 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.149
 clearly that the wood project the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.120
 Government draft law has not 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.070
 as a model that of the federal senate 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.190
 German and above all it would be 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 disproportionate and unsuitable at a time 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.719
 in which calico them but is going instead 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.859
 towards a hyper-majority law e 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.850
 therefore there would not be enough 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.740
 safeguards and guarantees in fact chiti not 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.110
 withdraw this bill of his that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 many like it in the Democratic party in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.310
 actually we are with the honorable 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.860
 which and we thank him for being here with 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.869
 we also like many of the movement 5 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.900
 stars reduction of parliamentarians of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.540
 halved the deputies 100 senators 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.340
 you would be ready to vote on this design 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.869
 of law 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.640
 absolutely yes then pardon not 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.850
 honorable but simple citizen 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.509
 spokesman to the Senate certainly yes because 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.290
 is not possible in our opinion 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.580
 go into the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.070
 the Renzian and Berlusconian vision the pd 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.230
 he must choose what to do when he grows up 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.240
 continue to vote with Berlusconi as 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.770
 we have seen with the lowering of the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.780
 penalties on the political exchange vote 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.490
 very serious mafioso 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.710
 or instead vote with us in this 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.530
 case a very important reform that 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.920
 will mark the pace for future generations 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.350
 to me it seems so much to hear a king who 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.220
 he wants to build his gold statue 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.540
 immense and great without paying attention to that instead 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.480
 the people need something else 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.690
 so we certainly believe that the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.550
 senate must be not a corporation 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.130
 like the one they want to do not 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.720
 elective then even then there will be 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.090
 a party of the president of 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.740
 republic 1 senators established by him 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.400
 that is, therefore truly a party of the 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.160
 president 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.260
 a corporation in one of them 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.270
 category that of mayors and gods 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.250
 customers of regions they should do 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.670
 all in life because they have been 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.160
 actually elected to do anything else 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.959
 instead we believe that the senators 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.780
 they must be elected by suffrage 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.320
 universal therefore from the people and therefore 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.450
 they must be absolutely that 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.820
 representation of the people then obviously 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.519
 we have our own idea that it is 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.820
 fundamental to give more strength to the 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.530
 people for which to give the chance 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.070
 to have referenda also 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.670
 proactive and also give the possibility 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.670
 of the so-called recall or recall 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.900
 a parliamentarian who is not doing the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.670
 his duty in such a way that the citizens 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.370
 who voted for it can 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.519
 possibly withdraw their trust a 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.310
 this parliamentarian here is what you will ask 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.080
 some changes to who I'd be you 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.380
 arranged in this first part at least in 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.930
 commission to vote that text to give 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.610
 a strong signal to the executive but 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.360
 we believe that the text for now is 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.950
 good and it's obvious that he needs us 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.020
 notice of some corrections in 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.170
 particular must be given 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.610
 more strength to the people so here is the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.270
 direct participation of citizens 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.310
 because now the Italians have one 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.960
 certain culture we are no longer really 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.940
 in 1940 when maybe not many 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.420
 they could neither read nor write then 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.010
 the Italian people is a people 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.500
 quite erect by now and then 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.030
 we can also give us perfect strength 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.750
 we thank the citizen of Puglia of 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.750
 to have been with us
