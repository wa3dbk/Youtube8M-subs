osteoarthritis is a huge problem around

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.250 
osteoarthritis is a huge problem around
the<00:00:13.639> world<00:00:13.820> and<00:00:14.240> in<00:00:14.389> the<00:00:14.480> United<00:00:14.780> States<00:00:14.809> today

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.370 
the world and in the United States today
it's<00:00:15.799> a<00:00:16.010> disease<00:00:17.000> affecting<00:00:17.599> the<00:00:17.779> cartilage

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
it's a disease affecting the cartilage
