00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 seems to be normal and predict here 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.300
 we still act very aggressively 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.250
 tighten more precisely clamp attack just 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.080
 base yourself let them blame them 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.020
 started to sit still in that round 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.520
 model on the nightmare position for na'vi on 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.350
 in fact, this is plus what the opponent 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.660
 seated slow not arkady die 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.820
 give some rounds but then this is only 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.230
 I don't know how to piss you off 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.730
 stir up and before the second half 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.010
 when you need to run and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.960
 destroy that's the most important thing to mana 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.239
 it remains to protect all they do not spend 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 looked shaves old sleep man perform 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.290
 they seem to be trying to go out 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.710
 on a plan but it would be a divorce and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.750
 The main output will go to Zeus Zeus 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.329
 I saw, in principle, yes, I saw everything dear 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.680
 here the carpets from all ate the team ate 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.739
 na'vi on the grant but in total 33 looks 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.199
 against the entity of such shortened composition 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.149
 hempstead markels against whom on the very 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 and nightmer, but the three of them are 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.010
 has chances of knocking out 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.080
 very clear and step by step so let's 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.530
 Only I am afraid to watch Markelov 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.030
 but it scares me in a good way 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.950
 I wonder how they will be captive 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.340
 ibid only kan lan window position 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.729
 oh here sat diffusion as a factor means and 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.409
 write drop pit and dad donation in the mouth 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.409
 owls drive 3 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.970
 no 3 edges created what was happening 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.740
 just remember dude marik 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.470
 missed probably six shots 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.670
 in a row despite the fact that even the latter is already on 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:43.370
 Vera when he shot 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:46.250
 but it kills the first in a thought which sat 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.440
 d5 bomb sits down and even became 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.170
 presses squeezes to the same point and not 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.630
 hit 1-series 30 bullets 1 nowhere 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.170
 flies smoke ends today such 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 sitting live balance windows dude dude i 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.050
 and how Galanova cuts for today such well 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.090
 OK, fine, but this is a rolling completo 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.220
 This is the most important thing after this. 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.530
 such a knockout on likes for luck 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.510
 here already leave to shower right away and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.110
 look at once three minus from margelov 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.370
 Now in all his critics and that's me 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.140
 including because the previous round 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.780
 Marik missed really 5 shots 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.700
 in a row for top on this is just a failure yes 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.959
 he has but a thousand victories in this dota 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.150
 cool that's cool but he caesar how would yes 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.510
 oh well, that's 1000 hours of dota and 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.760
 by bet he i'm sure that there is now 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:40.520
 flashlight will be on the path of truth all the same 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:44.320
 here is the clock in dota will be gradually 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:47.320
 gradually we decrease with all the same 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.320
 will reward
