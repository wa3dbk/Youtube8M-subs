00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 Good morning, everyone I'm doing is 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.110
 this video 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.679
 I've been in Caldas the client asked 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.609
 for me to teach her how she 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.609
 could improve the printouts of 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.609
 transparent 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:01:23.970
 An example like how I do not have 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 any printer connected this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.070
 equipment this year it will 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 present as j 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:39.770
 No problem, you can put any 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.770
 printer that comes here in settings 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.210
 quality 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.899
 bani mp 30/10 there you depend on what 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 you use the handle on the quality being 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.369
 here interpolation it will be like 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.310
 neighboring standard I like 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.649
 work more like a beak and this 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.960
 direction I put one-way because 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.170
 unidirectional is the difference of the other 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:18.640
 of the bi directional is that it unites directional 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.640
 it only prints from right to left 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:33.890
 directional and small of a definition 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 of the lyrics because that because in the hour 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.510
 I pass I'll go back and I will not 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.510
 print out 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:55.360
 at that moment she gave she gave a 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:03:00.110
 and another layer of paint are the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:04.970
 one letter together in the other 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:09.860
 this also I can with yellow background and 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.660
 I want a black and yellow letter what? 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.080
 will happen 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:22.370
 the black letters they migrate between them 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:25.450
 are ineligible and reduce this 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.920
 second speed of the head depression 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.310
 making 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.120
 It's certain it will take a while to go 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.250
 and it will take time to finish your 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.430
 client shows him the advantage 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.750
 that he will have in this quality shows the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.100
 quality of a regular fast sect and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:56.240
 shows a quality and a directional 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:04:09.400
 here in print control use 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:14.560
 default settings is 12 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.560
 twice throwing double the ink 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.120
 No problem 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.970
 if you show your customer the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.800
 quality 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.740
 You want this quality, you just need it. 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.010
 make him understand why he is 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.560
 being charged more I came here and use 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.760
 How is she going to report this? 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.260
 tag 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.320
 I came here in other controls is the 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.780
 business is in Portuguese from Portugal 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.590
 other control 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.630
 here to use settings 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.650
 and increases the 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:03.840
 drying the pattern of time and zero ie 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:08.700
 when printing a little gives a 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:15.390
 quick stop back and begin the problem 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:19.710
 so ink more ink than those 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:22.050
 the roller may stain the impression that 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.770
 anyone already the problem 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.740
 some customers my cover for the machine 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.830
 do not print at that moment to wait 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.850
 some time for her to dry 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.550
 in that impression others give a 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:45.090
 paradinha understood sends pause 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:48.120
 the panel but you do not need to use you 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.800
 you can set this drying time to one 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.790
 60 minute 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.729
 we work around one to three 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:01.350
 minutes is enough in this one here 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:04.669
 I'm going to put in three minutes or so. 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.970
 finish printing and will stay three 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.600
 minutes 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:13.200
 heating up what was done by heating the 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:16.350
 vinyl so the paint will dry faster 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.560
 and that those guys had not come 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.260
 to stain the impression was made then I 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.660
 I try to help you so that 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.110
 you do the job well done 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.980

 people who still pay for the 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:37.700
