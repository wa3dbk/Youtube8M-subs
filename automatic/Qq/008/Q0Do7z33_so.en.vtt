00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.689 

he<00:04:43.550> has<00:04:43.729> attacked<00:04:44.000> me<00:04:44.270> before<00:04:44.389> with<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> spork

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
he stabbed up my arm very good I can

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.360 
he stabbed up my arm very good I can
report<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:48.979> as<00:04:49.189> a<00:04:49.219> salt<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:50.529> wanted<00:04:51.529> to<00:04:51.680> but

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
report that as a salt I wanted to but

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.040 
report that as a salt I wanted to but
then<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:52.550> don't<00:04:52.669> have<00:04:52.819> any<00:04:52.969> proof<00:04:53.330> except<00:04:53.900> a

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
then I don't have any proof except a

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.640 
then I don't have any proof except a
video<00:04:55.120> which<00:04:56.120> was<00:04:56.300> on<00:04:56.449> Charlie's<00:04:57.229> channel<00:04:57.560> I

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
video which was on Charlie's channel I

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.499 
video which was on Charlie's channel I
think<00:04:57.680> so<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.340> do<00:04:58.550> have<00:04:58.909> proof<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.300> Chris

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
think so I do have proof of Chris

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.429 
think so I do have proof of Chris
assaulting<00:04:59.990> me<00:05:01.210> by<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.539> would<00:05:02.990> definitely

that<00:05:51.139> stuff<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.770> first<00:05:51.889> rounds<00:05:52.370> go<00:05:52.610> by<00:05:52.939> a<00:05:52.969> lot

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
that stuff the first rounds go by a lot

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.659 
that stuff the first rounds go by a lot
faster<00:05:53.830> it<00:05:54.830> won't<00:05:54.979> be<00:05:55.069> fast<00:05:55.189> where<00:05:55.400> I<00:05:55.460> used<00:05:55.610> the

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
faster it won't be fast where I used the

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.260 
faster it won't be fast where I used the
bank<00:05:55.939> but<00:05:56.180> that's<00:05:57.400> defeating<00:05:58.400> some<00:05:58.909> of<00:05:59.150> the

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
purpose of the hard mode because the

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.610 
purpose of the hard mode because the
bank<00:06:02.240> is<00:06:02.389> broken<00:06:03.349> it<00:06:03.710> really<00:06:04.099> is<00:06:04.960> way<00:06:05.960> too<00:06:06.020> good

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.340 
beneficial to my course with all these
points<00:06:39.090> good<00:06:39.450> tell<00:06:39.630> about<00:06:39.780> the<00:06:39.870> Raygun<00:06:40.140> though

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
points good tell about the Raygun though

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.630 
points good tell about the Raygun though
because<00:06:40.500> if<00:06:40.710> I<00:06:40.770> didn't<00:06:41.040> and<00:06:41.190> those<00:06:41.280> I<00:06:41.430> would

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
because if I didn't and those I would

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.300 
because if I didn't and those I would
probably<00:06:41.820> have<00:06:42.030> died<00:06:42.210> already

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
probably have died already

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.900 
probably have died already
that's<00:06:44.450> for<00:06:45.450> lovely<00:06:45.600> gum<00:06:45.930> it<00:06:46.200> looks<00:06:46.460> nice

I<00:06:47.940> guess<00:06:48.260> alright<00:06:49.260> it's<00:06:49.800> not<00:06:49.950> brilliant<00:06:50.520> but

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
I guess alright it's not brilliant but

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.180 
I guess alright it's not brilliant but
it's<00:06:52.140> kind<00:06:52.350> of<00:06:52.440> brilliant<00:06:52.590> but<00:06:52.920> I<00:06:52.950> don't

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
it's kind of brilliant but I don't

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.580 
it's kind of brilliant but I don't
really<00:06:53.700> like<00:06:54.450> it<00:06:54.630> all<00:06:54.780> that<00:06:54.810> much<00:06:54.990> is<00:06:55.230> I<00:06:55.530> do

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
actually like it it's it's cool it's

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.160 
actually like it it's it's cool it's
different<00:06:58.950> they're<00:06:59.790> a<00:06:59.820> bit<00:07:00.090> too<00:07:00.270> powerful<00:07:00.870> and

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.170 
different they're a bit too powerful and

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.900 
different they're a bit too powerful and
it<00:07:01.590> has<00:07:01.710> a<00:07:01.740> special<00:07:02.160> use<00:07:02.400> which<00:07:02.580> no<00:07:02.760> one<00:07:02.880> knows
