00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi to all the gentlemen we are again 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.890
 at the salgari camp we have another here 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.790
 guest is another animator who does 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.500
 will test in a series of pitches for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.320
 the first time in his life he never has 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 got a compound in hand always has 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.789
 pulled with wooden bows with which it does 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.720
 pull the children to 5 meters and now yes 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.500
 will test a show at 25 meters with one 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 of the compounds 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.619
 here is the fastest monster one in the world 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.700
 of my bows are 25 balloons 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.930
 meters away we see if gabriele 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.379
 the last student acquired succeeds in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.379
 honor us 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.400
 below you see that you are still low increases 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.290
 even more with that little trick 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.700
 that I told you when you got when you 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.829
 seems to be just rising still 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.150
 in a bit 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.600
 now this should go on 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.600
 balloons 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.880
 on the left we see that you have moved in phase 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 release 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.039
 obviously guys it's not easy because 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.140
 even after a day of work 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:33.750
 grapple with a compound of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:36.659
 57 free is not something for every day a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.640
 in a bit left you throw the forgery 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.899
 purpose on the hours one as before aims is 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:49.399
 always as high as now 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:49.399
 here I would never recharge the zoom 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.820
 we are still a bit more miseryccia 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.610
 top by 5's still available 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.680
 they are the last ones then we have to 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 quit because also tired of course 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.430
 fatigue comes at the expense of 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.840
 precision 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:19.250
 remember to be higher and higher a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:22.850
 now it's a good ok we are there 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.430
 4 more balloons 6 4 arrows with some 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.700
 luck maybe he could manage to 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.440
 take 1 more as a theory also 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.440
 but all four is asking too much 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:48.430
 almost almost from that still three gabri 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:48.430
 go strong satisfied very well 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.370
 just below two more arrows 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.430
 remember to improve more and more in 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.430
 high 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.470
 you seem to be tall go even more 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.610
 up 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.489
 obviously you can cheer your fatigue 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:21.890
 drop the arm with the result that 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:24.910
 we saw this went wrong 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.140
 there are also where the last one went 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.330
 however, it went too well 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.670
 guys I'm ultra if I 'm over 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.200
 satisfied with him this is the last 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:42.440
 always aims at the point where I told you 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.600
 gabri went wrong this way anyway 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.140
 boy did he honor honor gabri 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.380
 maybe something to the public that you 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.489
 will see from all sides 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.980
 It is a satisfaction, however, we say 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.290
 which is a balloon at 25 meters you have it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.010
 taken and the others are all nearby 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.390
 however as a first lesson we say that 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.500
 it's enough 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.500
 ok see you all
