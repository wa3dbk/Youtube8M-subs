too<00:00:23.720> as<00:00:24.290> a<00:00:24.890> child<00:00:25.579> up<00:00:25.970> until<00:00:26.480> my<00:00:27.110> early<00:00:27.259> 20s

too as a child up until my early 20s

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.679 
too as a child up until my early 20s
when<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:28.279> would<00:00:28.550> talk<00:00:29.029> about<00:00:29.059> straightening

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
when I would talk about straightening

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.290 
when I would talk about straightening
hair<00:00:30.020> I<00:00:30.230> would<00:00:30.529> call<00:00:30.829> it<00:00:30.950> a<00:00:31.040> perm<00:00:31.340> but<00:00:31.849> as<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.180> got

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
hair I would call it a perm but as I got

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.850 
hair I would call it a perm but as I got
older<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:32.720> as<00:00:32.960> I<00:00:33.079> started<00:00:33.350> doing<00:00:33.440> hair<00:00:33.829> I

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
older and as I started doing hair I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.090 
older and as I started doing hair I
realized<00:00:34.520> a<00:00:34.790> perm<00:00:35.570> is<00:00:35.870> when<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:36.350> put<00:00:36.560> curls<00:00:36.920> in

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100

the hair without a relaxer or a touch-up

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.060 
the hair without a relaxer or a touch-up
a<00:00:53.360> touch-up<00:00:53.720> is<00:00:53.990> when<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:54.290> just<00:00:54.320> do<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.860> roots

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
because relaxer that's putting chemicals

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.139 
because relaxer that's putting chemicals
in<00:01:03.800> your<00:01:03.829> hair<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.159> sometimes<00:01:04.399> it<00:01:04.699> does<00:01:04.850> burn

since<00:01:42.950> we're<00:01:43.070> going<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.250> get<00:01:43.430> right<00:01:43.670> up<00:01:43.700> on<00:01:43.970> the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
since we're going to get right up on the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.210 
since we're going to get right up on the
root<00:01:44.360> we<00:01:44.690> don't<00:01:44.960> need<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.260> do<00:01:45.440> that<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:46.100> what

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
root we don't need to do that so what

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.950 
root we don't need to do that so what
you<00:01:46.340> do<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.760> section<00:01:47.210> out<00:01:47.360> whatever<00:01:47.689> hair

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
you do is you section out whatever hair

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.800 
you do is you section out whatever hair
you're<00:01:48.140> going<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.409> straight<00:01:48.710> in<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.360> then<00:01:50.360> I'd

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
you're going to straight in and then I'd

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.870 
you're going to straight in and then I'd
say<00:01:51.110> about<00:01:51.260> maybe<00:01:51.650> like<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:51.920> one-inch<00:01:52.340> section

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
say about maybe like a one-inch section

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.929 
say about maybe like a one-inch section
and<00:01:53.320> then<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.470> can<00:01:54.650> bring<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.100> as<00:01:55.310> close<00:01:55.700> to

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
and then you can bring this as close to

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.550 
and then you can bring this as close to
your<00:01:56.090> root<00:01:56.360> like<00:01:56.600> right<00:01:56.869> on<00:01:57.020> top<00:01:57.229> of<00:01:57.260> it

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
your root like right on top of it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.859 
your root like right on top of it
because<00:01:58.189> there's<00:01:58.790> no<00:01:58.970> opening<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.570> kind<00:01:59.810> of

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
because there's no opening that kind of

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.030 
because there's no opening that kind of
protects<00:02:00.259> it<00:02:00.470> from<00:02:00.710> getting<00:02:01.580> too<00:02:01.909> hot<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.979> you

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
protects it from getting too hot so you

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.679 
protects it from getting too hot so you
just<00:02:04.340> take<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.060> your<00:02:05.210> root

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
just take it to your root

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.999 
just take it to your root
hold<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.290> there<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:06.470> see<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.740> smoke<00:02:06.950> coming

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
hold it there you see the smoke coming

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.009 
hold it there you see the smoke coming
out<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:07.729> shows<00:02:07.939> you<00:02:08.119> how<00:02:08.239> hot<00:02:08.479> this<00:02:08.720> little

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
out that shows you how hot this little

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.140 
out that shows you how hot this little
thing<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:10.159> slide<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.580> up<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.849> since

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
thing is you can slide it up and since

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.550 
thing is you can slide it up and since
we're<00:02:11.299> just<00:02:11.330> talking<00:02:11.659> about<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.930> root<00:02:12.109> you

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
we're just talking about the root you

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.019 
we're just talking about the root you
don't<00:02:12.739> have<00:02:12.919> to<00:02:13.129> bring<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.459> all<00:02:13.579> the<00:02:13.639> way<00:02:13.730> down

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:14.029 
don't have to bring it all the way down

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.119 
don't have to bring it all the way down
to<00:02:14.269> your<00:02:14.389> ends<00:02:14.689> but<00:02:14.810> if<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.049> want<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.499> just<00:02:16.040> to

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
to your ends but if you want to just to

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.360 
to your ends but if you want to just to
smooth<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.519> out<00:02:16.609> you<00:02:16.849> can

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
smooth it out you can

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.860 
smooth it out you can
but<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.819> just<00:02:17.940> get<00:02:18.120> right<00:02:18.480> up<00:02:18.659> in<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
but you can just get right up in the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.270 
but you can just get right up in the
root<00:02:19.080> straight<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:22.620> nice<00:02:22.920> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
root straight in that and it's nice and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.610 
root straight in that and it's nice and
slick<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.390> lays<00:02:24.629> down<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.319> shiny

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
slick and it lays down and it's shiny

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.020 
slick and it lays down and it's shiny
I'm<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.069> going<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.280> do<00:02:26.400> one<00:02:26.610> more<00:02:26.760> section

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030

right next to it I'm just going to get
right<00:02:32.849> up<00:02:32.879> in<00:02:33.150> there<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.629> see<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.959> smoke

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
right up in there you see the smoke

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.649 
right up in there you see the smoke
coming<00:02:34.440> out<00:02:34.670> that's<00:02:35.670> how<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.879> know<00:02:36.150> honey<00:02:36.420> is

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
coming out that's how you know honey is

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.899 
coming out that's how you know honey is
hot<00:02:37.099> that's<00:02:38.099> what<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.370> need<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.579> straighten

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.940 
hot that's what you need to straighten
your<00:02:39.060> hair<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.420> perfectly<00:02:39.930> honest<00:02:40.319> but

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
your hair to be perfectly honest but

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.319 
your hair to be perfectly honest but
this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.430> also<00:02:41.610> why<00:02:41.819> we<00:02:41.849> need<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> heat

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
this is also why we need a heat

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.690 
this is also why we need a heat
protectant<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.920> take<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.159> little<00:02:44.430> baby

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
protectant so you take a little baby

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.699 
protectant so you take a little baby
straight<00:02:45.599> in<00:02:45.720> there<00:02:45.870> just<00:02:46.079> like<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.409> it<00:02:46.620> gets

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
straight in there just like this it gets

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.740 
straight in there just like this it gets
really<00:02:47.010> really<00:02:47.129> hot<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:48.150> make<00:02:48.299> sure<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.569> put

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
really really hot you make sure you put

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.210 
really really hot you make sure you put
some<00:02:48.780> heat<00:02:49.079> protectant<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:49.829> hair<00:02:50.040> and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
some heat protectant on your hair and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.740 
some heat protectant on your hair and
then<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.549> can<00:02:50.730> straighten<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.329> roots<00:02:51.569> of

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
then you can straighten the roots of

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.930 
then you can straighten the roots of
your<00:02:51.930> entire<00:02:52.230> head<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:52.829> tee<00:02:53.310> Cooper<00:02:53.730> and
