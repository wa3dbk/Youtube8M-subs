00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:12.639
 [music] 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.469
 welcome all respected subscribers 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.080
 Today we will analyze our channel 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.750
 such a topic as creating your own 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.550
 thematic mixes with fl studio 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.589
 many may think that the program 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.869
 Twisted oops not sharpened by such 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:29.579
 direction as a mix making 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:35.170
 between not direction namely method 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:37.539
 writing but music namely what is their 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.160
 create mixes you can create such 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:44.520
 programs from like tractor dj 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.000
 by mixing on turntables 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.199
 There are a lot of different types of pioneers 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.309
 companies in principle and various software as 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.350
 virtual DJ 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:03.960
 I've used programs before 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:07.540
 mixmeister fusion and other programs 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.050
 mixcraft as with and example can already 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.190
 noted politician dish but today I 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.280
 Iâ€™ll talk about fl studio and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.820
 how not to create a mix that u want 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.200
 note that I personally for ointment 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.940
 or do not put anything 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.900
 and do not advise because we initially 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.840
 already take high-quality material 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.880
 make a small boat and mix 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.950
 of course when you are alive and 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.500
 and the squares and the barrel principle 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.259
 us a similar way only here 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.539
 more visual and other and of course it 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.320
 much faster than other programs 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:58.659
 I assure you you can enjoy it 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.869
 In a way and in principle, I think this is for you 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.630
 will help the strongest but again I this 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.920
 The way I took is not out of my head and also learned from 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.069
 one of his acquaintance dj he 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.360
 laid out phoenix and everything and he said 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.540
 what i use 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.400
 Sit for me was certainly very 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.640
 amazing because I eat before that 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.400
 heard someone make them mixes and not 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.519
 less this is possible now I will show you 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.329
 your sword on here is my mix 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.090
 here as you can see on the master there is nothing 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:39.519
 This is not necessary because when you save 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.380
 we have compression and in principle it 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:46.950
 enough volume tracks already 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.620
 commercials are already pulling some 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.050
 cases you can work with volume 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.100
 somewhere to tweak something naturally 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:06.440
 we have volume automation 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:11.160
 automation filters i use vps and 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.850
 free computer is a demo on 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.250
 retirement free access lies 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.510
 for free you can use an example 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.510
 let's listen small 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.379
 [music] 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.810
 [music] 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.519
 I will not continue to further your 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:58.319
 copyright but we see that here 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:04.440
 very convenient and on the barrel squares and in 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:06.599
 Basically that's why this is not done here 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.090
 it will be difficult to be the main thing 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:13.760
 picked up more or less material similar in 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.880
 pace I have here 130 128 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.019
 102 all in a similar way 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.960
 what i'm showing you can be customized 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:28.729
 mixer film also not breaking 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.729
 zonal timbres nothing simple 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.960
 make such a selection principle on 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:41.659
 turntables can also do but here 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.430
 much easier and more convenient and of course 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:47.300
 this is the way to do who makes their own 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.729
 mix and spread the network but do not 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.220
 offensive though fl studio program 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:58.729
 buttocks lasted a speech I even know 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:00.800
 that people use and right already lips in 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.979
 In principle, everything here is also possible 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.349
 use the effects of different ging and 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.990
 insert convenient and everything else then 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.449
 eat completely 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.919
 have all the tools to create 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.530
 own thematic mix in 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.319
 Basically everything I wanted you today 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.160
 show subscribe to the channel put 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:31.779
 likes to meet again 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:31.779
