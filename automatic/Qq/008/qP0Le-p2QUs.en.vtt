00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250

and<00:02:08.340> yes<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.440> watch<00:02:10.890> looks<00:02:11.280> pretty

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and yes this this watch looks pretty

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.840 
and yes this this watch looks pretty
good<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.880> your<00:02:12.060> wrist<00:02:12.240> two<00:02:16.310> little<00:02:17.310> bits<00:02:17.460> small

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850

for<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.210> tastes<00:02:18.690> about<00:02:18.930> 39<00:02:20.060> millimeters<00:02:21.060> I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
for my tastes about 39 millimeters I

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.780 
for my tastes about 39 millimeters I
believe<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.790> very<00:02:24.000> thin<00:02:24.450> too<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.320> doesn't

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
believe it's very thin too so it doesn't

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.450 
believe it's very thin too so it doesn't
quite<00:02:26.790> stick<00:02:27.210> out<00:02:27.770> like<00:02:28.770> some<00:02:28.980> other<00:02:29.160> thirty

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
quite stick out like some other thirty

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.650 
quite stick out like some other thirty
nine<00:02:29.640> millimeter<00:02:30.000> watches<00:02:30.300> such<00:02:30.450> as<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
nine millimeter watches such as the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.000 
nine millimeter watches such as the
brightening<00:02:30.990> chrono<00:02:31.230> Matt<00:02:31.410> for<00:02:31.590> example

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
brightening chrono Matt for example

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.520 
brightening chrono Matt for example
which<00:02:32.100> has<00:02:32.450> quite<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> bit<00:02:33.630> more<00:02:33.780> thickness<00:02:34.110> so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
which has quite a bit more thickness so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.520 
which has quite a bit more thickness so
seems<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> larger<00:02:36.000> watch<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:37.140> neat<00:02:37.350> thing

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
seems like a larger watch the neat thing

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.340 
seems like a larger watch the neat thing
about<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.830> Versace<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.760> does<00:02:39.350> look

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
about the Versace is that it does look

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.470 
about the Versace is that it does look
almost<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> bracelet<00:02:41.430> because<00:02:41.880> because

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
almost like a bracelet because because

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.680 
almost like a bracelet because because
of<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> way<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.370> lugs<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:44.550> designed<00:02:44.910> so

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
of the way that the lugs are designed so

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.300 
of the way that the lugs are designed so
it<00:02:45.780> sits<00:02:45.959> on<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.290> hand<00:02:46.620> almost<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> thick
