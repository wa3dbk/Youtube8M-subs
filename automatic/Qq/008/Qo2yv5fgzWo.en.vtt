00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
developed onto this car as well one

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.880 
developed onto this car as well one
thing<00:01:04.580> that's<00:01:04.699> added<00:01:04.910> new<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.540> e<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:06.080> the

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
thing that's added new to the e is the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.859 
thing that's added new to the e is the
front<00:01:07.280> rear<00:01:07.430> shock<00:01:07.700> towers<00:01:08.060> have<00:01:08.270> new<00:01:08.479> camera

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
front rear shock towers have new camera

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.460 
front rear shock towers have new camera
link<00:01:09.050> positions<00:01:09.440> so<00:01:10.300> we<00:01:11.300> have<00:01:11.540> some<00:01:12.020> different

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
link positions so we have some different

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.200 
link positions so we have some different
adjustability<00:01:12.890> which<00:01:13.670> just<00:01:13.820> gives<00:01:13.970> you<00:01:14.060> some

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
adjustability which just gives you some

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.280 
adjustability which just gives you some
more<00:01:14.330> tuning<00:01:14.600> options<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:14.990> can<00:01:15.110> run<00:01:15.200> the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
more tuning options you can run the

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.050 
more tuning options you can run the
nitro<00:01:15.590> ones<00:01:15.770> or<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.280> electric<00:01:16.850> ones

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
nitro ones or the electric ones

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.690 
nitro ones or the electric ones
depending<00:01:17.930> on<00:01:18.020> what<00:01:18.140> your<00:01:18.320> need<00:01:18.649> is<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.130> what

a brand new chassis electric specific
it's<00:02:29.970> narrower<00:02:30.390> because<00:02:31.349> we<00:02:31.620> were<00:02:31.709> able<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
it's narrower because we were able to

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
it's narrower because we were able to
make<00:02:33.060> an<00:02:33.209> electric<00:02:33.810> only<00:02:34.080> chassis<00:02:34.650> we're<00:02:35.250> able

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
layout more ideal for electric the diffs

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.610 
layout more ideal for electric the diffs
moves<00:02:41.790> slightly<00:02:42.060> versus<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.900> Nitro<00:02:43.290> version

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
moves slightly versus the Nitro version

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.890 
moves slightly versus the Nitro version
and<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.640> has<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> new<00:02:44.970> rear<00:02:45.180> driveshaft<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.870> a

and it has a new rear driveshaft as a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.680 
and it has a new rear driveshaft as a
result<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:47.310> that's<00:02:47.579> a<00:02:47.730> little<00:02:47.879> quick<00:02:48.150> overview

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
result so that's a little quick overview
