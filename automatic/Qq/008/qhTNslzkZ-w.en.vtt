bass amp those are Randall cabinets then

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
bass amp those are Randall cabinets then
they'll<00:00:39.809> come<00:00:39.960> over<00:00:40.199> here<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:40.620> sanded

they'll come over here and get sanded

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.829 
they'll come over here and get sanded
before<00:00:41.580> they<00:00:41.699> go<00:00:41.879> through<00:00:42.089> the<00:00:42.210> wall<00:00:42.420> where

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
before they go through the wall where

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.329 
before they go through the wall where
they<00:00:42.960> start<00:00:43.260> applying<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> tolex<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
they start applying the tolex and

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.040 
they start applying the tolex and
loading<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> speakers<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> loading<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
loading the speakers and loading the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.770 
loading the speakers and loading the
electronics<00:00:46.650> into<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.979> amplifiers<00:00:47.600> this<00:00:48.600> is

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
electronics into the amplifiers this is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.960 
electronics into the amplifiers this is
right<00:00:49.019> after<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.580> cabinets<00:00:50.580> have<00:00:50.729> come

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
right after the cabinets have come

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.729 
right after the cabinets have come
through<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.360> wall<00:00:51.540> we<00:00:52.080> call<00:00:52.290> it<00:00:52.320> coming

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
through the wall we call it coming

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.570 
through the wall we call it coming
through<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.979> wall<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.430> there's

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
through the wall because there's

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.549 
through the wall because there's
actually<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.000> hole<00:00:54.150> cut<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.629> there<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.470> of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
actually a hole cut in there and one of

actually a hole cut in there and one of
the<00:00:55.620> first<00:00:55.830> things<00:00:55.920> they<00:00:56.220> do<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.519> they'll<00:00:56.699> come

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the first things they do is they'll come

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.579 
the first things they do is they'll come
in<00:00:56.909> and<00:00:57.089> black<00:00:57.330> out<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> insides<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.409> these

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
in and black out the insides of these

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.890 
in and black out the insides of these
things<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.220> then<00:00:59.699> they'll<00:00:59.909> start<00:01:00.180> laying

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
things and then they'll start laying

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.869 
things and then they'll start laying
glue<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.470> and<00:01:01.739> spreading<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.220> tolex<00:01:02.580> or

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
glue on it and spreading the tolex or

vinyl or carpet is going to be on that
particular<00:01:05.159> model<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.850> amplifier<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.720> then

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
particular model of amplifier and then

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140 
particular model of amplifier and then
they'll<00:01:07.530> keep<00:01:07.740> sliding<00:01:08.190> down<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.820> roller

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
they'll keep sliding down this roller

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
they'll keep sliding down this roller
chassis<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.049> subsequent<00:01:10.680> operations

they're ready to be boxed and shipped

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.720 
they're ready to be boxed and shipped
one<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.320> first<00:01:22.560> operations<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
one of the first operations we do to

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.700 
one of the first operations we do to
these<00:01:23.880> things<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.480> come<00:01:24.690> in<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.050> we'll

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
these things when they come in is we'll

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
these things when they come in is we'll
hit<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.160> with<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> vinyl<00:01:26.910> sealer<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.450> then

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
hit these with a vinyl sealer and then

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
hit these with a vinyl sealer and then
if<00:01:28.440> they<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.620> open<00:01:29.310> grain<00:01:29.550> would<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.120> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
if they have open grain would like a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.510 
if they have open grain would like a
mahogany<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:31.380> set<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.800> back<00:01:31.980> out<00:01:32.190> here<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
mahogany will set them back out here and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.310 
mahogany will set them back out here and
get<00:01:32.730> them<00:01:32.880> poor<00:01:33.150> filled<00:01:33.450> where<00:01:34.080> we<00:01:34.230> actually

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
get them poor filled where we actually

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.050 
get them poor filled where we actually
run<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> little<00:01:34.860> grain<00:01:35.160> filler<00:01:35.430> into<00:01:35.670> them<00:01:35.910> let

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
run a little grain filler into them let

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.520 
run a little grain filler into them let
them<00:01:36.090> sit<00:01:36.420> overnight<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.870> then<00:01:37.380> they<00:01:37.500> come

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
them sit overnight and then they come

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.890 
them sit overnight and then they come
back<00:01:37.770> through<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.400> poly<00:01:39.000> step<00:01:39.480> where<00:01:39.780> we

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
back through this poly step where we

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.870 
back through this poly step where we
actually<00:01:40.080> lay<00:01:40.470> down<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> hard<00:01:41.070> base<00:01:41.340> coat<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
actually lay down the hard base coat and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.060 
actually lay down the hard base coat and
it'll<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.540> three<00:01:42.810> shots<00:01:42.840> four<00:01:43.440> shots<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.950> this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it'll get three shots four shots of this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.560 
it'll get three shots four shots of this
base<00:01:44.340> coat<00:01:44.640> depending<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.270> wood<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
base coat depending on the wood that

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.600 
base coat depending on the wood that
it's<00:01:45.720> being<00:01:45.870> laid<00:01:46.140> over<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.370> chewy

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
it's being laid over this is chewy
