00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.910
 I'm also relaxed here 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.010
 We have a neurologist 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.120
 asked a pulmonologist dr 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:16.450
 mails hello what makes the salt in 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.849
 my breath caused sda salt 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.849
 is a historical substance that is 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:25.029
 It has the ability to moisture out 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.759
 attracting the environment and the effect 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.340
 in the respiratory tract is a fearful 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.680
 effect through the humidification can 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.290
 Acute irritating conditions like coughing or 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.690
 Sore throat therapy 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.300
 on the other hand, it has one 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.640
 liquefy effect through this 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.800
 Liquefaction can often be the mucus 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.199
 Very plans for infections 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.050
 upper respiratory tract to be better coughed off 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.659
 and therefore also bacteria 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.969
 that's essentially the main one 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.510
 main effect you can say it has one 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.859
 a nourishing effect on the respiratory tract 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.359
 Now I know that so actually 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.219
 you can do that in a saucepan 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.659
 Hangs over it and in hand too 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.450
 this does not take the steam so 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.830
 it also works quickly 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.530
 in principle , that works 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.910
 Of course, there is always one 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.320
 therefore a certain risk of burns 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.880
 children should never be alone 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.070
 leave unattended in all of them 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.250
 same older complaints older 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.200
 Patients may have circulatory problems 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.500
 Developing is working for the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.850
 mucus solution works very well 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 The disadvantage of the cooking pot is still 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.080
 can not be so nebulized 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.640
 tell me to see you here very briefly 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.000
 For example, this is how we do it 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.790
 one knows from the pure even where 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.130
 so that air moisture and salt 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.020
 that's much more subtle 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.430
 is the same as in the cooking pot or is there 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.180
 even a bit finer and 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.300
 better 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.060
 it is much finer the cooking pot 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.830
 has relatively coarse particles and thus 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.630
 these particles do not get into 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.200
 the very small respiratory tract through this 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.940
 Nebulisation can salt up the particles 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.680
 penetrate into the small pulmonary vesicles 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.340
 get in and also there their effect 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.380
 achieve 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.880
 Thank you so much the pulmonologist 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.440
 I would say I relax now 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.100
 sometimes three quarters of an hour would do me 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.560
 quite well 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.670
 Let's just take the boss out of it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.670
 and wish you a fire
