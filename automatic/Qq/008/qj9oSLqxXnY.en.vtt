00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.710 
you go across to until your tunnels meet
whenever<00:01:52.040> they<00:01:52.220> meet<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:53.210> just<00:01:53.420> keep<00:01:53.540> putting

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
whenever they meet you just keep putting

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.160 
whenever they meet you just keep putting
redstone<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.350> then<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:55.280> take<00:01:55.490> this<00:01:55.670> one<00:01:55.880> out

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
redstone and then you take this one out

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.600 
redstone and then you take this one out
that<00:01:57.170> way<00:01:57.259> I<00:01:57.289> drop<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.649> load<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.039> right<00:01:58.399> below

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
that way I drop the load the right below

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.859 
that way I drop the load the right below
your<00:01:58.700> liver<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.149> you<00:01:59.270> put<00:01:59.420> rest<00:01:59.600> on<00:01:59.720> right

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
your liver and you put rest on right

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.740 
your liver and you put rest on right
here<00:02:00.520> then<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.640> go<00:02:01.729> back<00:02:01.759> up<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:02.479> you're<00:02:02.600> done

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
here then you go back up so you're done

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.389 
here then you go back up so you're done
with<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:02.990> wiring<00:02:03.170> that's<00:02:03.560> that's<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.190> for<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
with the wiring that's that's it for the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.380 
with the wiring that's that's it for the
wiring<00:02:04.700> it's<00:02:04.789> really<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.240> basic<00:02:05.840> wiring<00:02:06.380> system

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
wiring it's really a basic wiring system

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.890 
wiring it's really a basic wiring system
into<00:02:08.390> eternal<00:02:09.259> lava<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:10.600> always<00:02:11.600> go<00:02:11.720> down

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
into eternal lava you always go down

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.449 
into eternal lava you always go down
three<00:02:12.319> just<00:02:12.739> because<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.040> really<00:02:13.250> simple

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
three just because it's really simple

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.550 
three just because it's really simple
when<00:02:13.670> it's<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.900> makes<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.290> think<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.530> looks

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
when it's it makes it I think it looks

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.530 
when it's it makes it I think it looks
better<00:02:15.739> when<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:16.610> when<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.060> only<00:02:17.239> get<00:02:17.420> on

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
better when you when you only get on

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.479 
better when you when you only get on
this<00:02:17.690> far<00:02:17.930> we<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.830> go<00:02:18.920> down<00:02:19.069> as<00:02:19.160> far<00:02:19.250> as<00:02:19.430> you

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
this far we can go down as far as you

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.759 
this far we can go down as far as you
want<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> don't<00:02:20.000> matter<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.440> always

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
want to don't matter and then I always

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.509 
want to don't matter and then I always
replace<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.489> with<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:24.100> always<00:02:25.100> replace<00:02:25.400> it

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
replace this with a I always replace it

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.759 
replace this with a I always replace it
with<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.700> whatever<00:02:25.940> material<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.660> used<00:02:27.170> just

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
with it whatever material I used just

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.949 
with it whatever material I used just
make<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.010> look<00:02:28.190> better<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.870> I'll<00:02:29.930> use

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
make it look better so I'll use

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.479 
make it look better so I'll use
cobblestone<00:02:30.530> i'll<00:02:30.680> just<00:02:30.799> put<00:02:30.950> cups<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.310> right

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
cobblestone i'll just put cups on right

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.050 
cobblestone i'll just put cups on right
here<00:02:31.670> right<00:02:32.450> here<00:02:32.510> right<00:02:32.900> here<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.970> then<00:02:34.970> you

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
here right here right here and then you

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.550 
here right here right here and then you
get<00:02:35.180> your<00:02:35.209> lava<00:02:36.640> put<00:02:37.640> your<00:02:37.760> lava<00:02:37.910> down<00:02:38.150> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
get your lava put your lava down and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.060 
get your lava put your lava down and
then<00:02:40.750> rockaway<00:02:41.750> whatever<00:02:42.079> and<00:02:42.350> there<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.040> go
