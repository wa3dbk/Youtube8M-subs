00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
don't know if the lighting is good

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.190 
don't know if the lighting is good
enough<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.850> trip<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.540> close<00:01:18.840> up

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so they are sling bags and I was a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.230 
so they are sling bags and I was a
little<00:01:24.869> bit<00:01:24.990> worried<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.090> will

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.370 
are a little bit uncomfortable to walk
in<00:02:47.580> not<00:02:48.330> because<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:50.450> song<00:02:51.450> area<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.080> front

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
in not because of the song area in front

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.920 
in not because of the song area in front
but<00:02:52.769> more<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.970> heel<00:02:54.299> at<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.720> back

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
but more because of the heel at the back

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.490 
but more because of the heel at the back
now<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.950> heel<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.519> back<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.849> very<00:02:57.260> heavy

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
now that heel at the back is very heavy

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.949 
now that heel at the back is very heavy
basically<00:02:59.010> my<00:02:59.310> heel<00:02:59.609> starts<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.299> ache<00:03:00.570> after

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
basically my heel starts to ache after

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.990 
basically my heel starts to ache after
wearing<00:03:01.680> these<00:03:01.950> sandals<00:03:02.280> for<00:03:02.519> about<00:03:02.700> three<00:03:02.910> to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
wearing these sandals for about three to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.560 
wearing these sandals for about three to
four<00:03:03.150> hours<00:03:03.380> I'm<00:03:04.380> hoping<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.340> new<00:03:06.269> pair

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
four hours I'm hoping that the new pair

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.170 
four hours I'm hoping that the new pair
of<00:03:06.600> sandals<00:03:07.010> will<00:03:08.010> be<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.519> little<00:03:08.880> bit<00:03:09.000> more

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
of sandals will be a little bit more

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.050 
of sandals will be a little bit more
