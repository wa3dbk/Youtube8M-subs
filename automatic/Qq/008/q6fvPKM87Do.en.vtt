is how it behaves when I break into the

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.770 
is how it behaves when I break into the
corner<00:00:56.250> yeah<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.489> mean<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:58.000> race<00:00:58.210> driving<00:00:58.510> its

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
corner yeah I mean in race driving its

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.709 
corner yeah I mean in race driving its
normal<00:00:59.200> break<00:00:59.860> into<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.219> corner<00:01:00.730> and<00:01:00.760> but<00:01:01.480> when

going to the side or even in the chicane

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.150 
going to the side or even in the chicane
are<00:01:34.990> like<00:01:35.170> over<00:01:35.560> there<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.950> damage

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
are like over there and the damage

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.640 
are like over there and the damage
chicane<00:01:36.700> it's<00:01:37.120> like<00:01:37.450> driving<00:01:37.720> with<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:38.140> go-kart

is in the car motor compartment down

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.580 
is in the car motor compartment down
here<00:02:13.040> lowest<00:02:13.760> point<00:02:14.120> yeah<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.780> because<00:02:15.380> these

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
here lowest point yeah and because these

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.350 
here lowest point yeah and because these
electrical<00:02:16.250> components<00:02:16.940> we've<00:02:17.090> got<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
electrical components we've got the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:35.500 
electrical components we've got the
underneath<00:02:17.810> cigar<00:02:23.440> there's<00:02:24.440> no

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.720 

which<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.690> actually<00:02:36.960> much<00:02:37.560> different<00:02:38.250> than

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
which is actually much different than

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.990 
which is actually much different than
the<00:02:38.910> Carrera<00:02:39.240> GT<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:39.750> end<00:02:39.990> lighter<00:02:41.000> that's

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
the Carrera GT one end lighter that's

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.070 
the Carrera GT one end lighter that's
the<00:02:42.270> reason<00:02:42.420> why<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.410> very<00:02:44.220> future

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
the reason why you have this very future

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.140 
the reason why you have this very future
in<00:02:46.080> balance<00:02:46.500> totally<00:02:47.040> when<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.820> go<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
in balance totally when you go on the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.190 
in balance totally when you go on the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.930 

we<00:03:09.850> see<00:03:10.030> electric<00:03:10.390> motors<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.890> bose<00:03:12.520> electric

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
we see electric motors the bose electric

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.040 
we see electric motors the bose electric
models<00:03:13.270> produced<00:03:13.950> 245<00:03:14.950> horsepower<00:03:15.090> at<00:03:16.090> 350

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050

newton<00:03:17.380> meter<00:03:17.530> taller<00:03:17.800> arrive<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.730> from<00:03:19.390> zero

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
newton meter taller arrive it from zero

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.790 
newton meter taller arrive it from zero
why<00:03:20.890> not<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.940> like<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.210> combined<00:03:23.020> of<00:03:23.620> the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
why not is that like the combined of the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.830 
why not is that like the combined of the
two<00:03:23.950> combined<00:03:24.400> yeah<00:03:24.610> yeah<00:03:25.060> yeah<00:03:25.330> this<00:03:25.630> is

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
two combined yeah yeah yeah this is

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.560 
two combined yeah yeah yeah this is
combined<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.790> means<00:03:28.000> when<00:03:28.180> i<00:03:28.210> press<00:03:28.540> it

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
combined so that means when i press it

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.510 
combined so that means when i press it
right<00:03:29.230> away<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.770> have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.170 

when<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.390> go<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:34.370> sport<00:03:35.370> or<00:03:35.520> race<00:03:35.640> license

engine is running all the time then the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.600 
engine is running all the time then the
electric<00:03:40.080> motors<00:03:40.410> work<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:40.800> dysfunction

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
electric motors work as a dysfunction

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.940 
electric motors work as a dysfunction
and<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.120> feel<00:03:42.420> that<00:03:42.450> if<00:03:43.350> they're<00:03:43.500> not<00:03:43.650> working

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
your field yeah because now I accelerate

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.580 
your field yeah because now I accelerate
and<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:47.730> helps<00:03:48.090> me<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.300> lot<00:03:48.390> for<00:03:49.170> example

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
and it helps me a lot for example

and it helps me a lot for example
accelerating<00:03:50.160> out<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:50.580> corner<00:03:50.910> yeah<00:03:51.680> girl

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
accelerating out of the corner yeah girl

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.990 
accelerating out of the corner yeah girl
yeah<00:03:53.100> because<00:03:54.770> yeah<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:55.950> accelerate<00:03:56.460> faster

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
yeah because yeah you accelerate faster

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.510 
yeah because yeah you accelerate faster
much<00:03:57.240> faster<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:58.830> can<00:03:59.010> handle<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.250> problem

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
much faster you can handle that problem

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.770 
much faster you can handle that problem
