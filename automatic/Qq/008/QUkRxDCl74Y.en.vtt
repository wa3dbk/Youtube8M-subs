00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
device and as you can see here I've

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.330 
device and as you can see here I've
already<00:00:32.219> plugged<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.930> ID<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:35.190> my

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
already plugged in the ID for my

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.010 
already plugged in the ID for my
computer<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.030> I've<00:00:36.149> set<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.809> password

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
computer that I've set up and a password

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.389 
computer that I've set up and a password
so<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.649> gonna<00:00:37.739> hit<00:00:37.950> connect<00:00:43.399> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
so now I'm just gonna hit connect and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.240 
so now I'm just gonna hit connect and
now<00:00:44.789> I'll<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.180> into<00:00:46.010> landscape<00:00:47.010> view

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
now I'll just get into landscape view

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.990 
now I'll just get into landscape view
real<00:00:47.489> quick<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.399> desktop

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
real quick and so here is my desktop

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
real quick and so here is my desktop
this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.300> exactly<00:00:57.840> what<00:00:58.140> my<00:00:58.230> desktop<00:00:58.590> looks

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
this is exactly what my desktop looks

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.430 
this is exactly what my desktop looks
like<00:00:59.149> on<00:01:00.149> my<00:01:00.270> computer<00:01:00.690> except<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> fact

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
like on my computer except for the fact

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.779 
like on my computer except for the fact
that<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> background<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.190> been<00:01:02.340> blacked<00:01:02.609> out

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that the background is been blacked out

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.369 
that the background is been blacked out
which<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.480> helps<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.780> run<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> little<00:01:04.170> bit

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
which just helps it run a little bit

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.910 
which just helps it run a little bit
faster<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.510> basically<00:01:06.840> scroll<00:01:07.710> around

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
faster and I can basically scroll around

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.969 
faster and I can basically scroll around
with<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:08.130> mouse<00:01:08.340> zoom<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:10.140> precise

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
with my mouse zoom in for more precise

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
with my mouse zoom in for more precise
control<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:12.119> anything<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> normally

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
control and do anything that I normally

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.830 
control and do anything that I normally
could<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:13.740> computer<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.509> go<00:01:15.630> into

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
could do on my computer so I can go into

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
could do on my computer so I can go into
the<00:01:16.590> Start<00:01:16.920> menu<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.229> I<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.350> launch<00:01:20.270> programs

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the Start menu and I can launch programs

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.210 
the Start menu and I can launch programs
that<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.659> obviously<00:01:21.810> don't<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.229> access<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.890> on

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that I obviously don't have access to on

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.039 
that I obviously don't have access to on
the<00:01:23.490> iPad<00:01:29.420> website<00:01:30.420> application<00:01:30.900> actually

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the iPad website application actually

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.210 
the iPad website application actually
launched<00:01:31.619> into<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.100> other<00:01:32.479> monitor<00:01:33.479> which<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
launched into my other monitor which is

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.170 
launched into my other monitor which is
fortunate<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.670> lets<00:01:35.790> me<00:01:35.939> show<00:01:36.119> you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
fortunate because that lets me show you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.899 
fortunate because that lets me show you
the<00:01:36.329> fact<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:37.590> application<00:01:38.280> supports

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the fact that this application supports

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.590 
the fact that this application supports
multiple<00:01:39.540> monitors<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> let's<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.329> go

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
multiple monitors so let's see if I go

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.910 
multiple monitors so let's see if I go
to<00:01:44.930> monitor<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.710> switch

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
to monitor right here I can switch

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.760 
to monitor right here I can switch
between<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.340> monitors<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.470> go<00:01:49.590> back

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
between my monitors and when we go back

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
between my monitors and when we go back
now<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> other<00:01:50.610> monitor<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.360> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
now we're on the other monitor and you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.850 
now we're on the other monitor and you
can<00:01:51.600> actually<00:01:51.720> there's<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> shortcut<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.740> that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
can actually there's a shortcut for that

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.209 
can actually there's a shortcut for that
which<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.579> shaking<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> device<00:01:55.219> so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
which is just shaking the device so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.819 
which is just shaking the device so
here's<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> those<00:01:57.090> moviemaker<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:58.320> mean<00:01:58.710> I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
here's one of those moviemaker I mean I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.069 
here's one of those moviemaker I mean I
could<00:01:58.979> edit<00:01:59.579> videos<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.840> which<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
could edit videos right on here which is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.230 
could edit videos right on here which is
pretty<00:02:01.290> cool<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.670> best<00:02:02.850> things<00:02:03.060> I

pretty cool one of the best things I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.469 
pretty cool one of the best things I
find<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.170> application<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:05.240> just<00:02:06.240> using
