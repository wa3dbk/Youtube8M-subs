00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.920
 really this call of duty and coming from this 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.210
 call of duty for me that was I did not 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.500
 to say one of the best because it did not 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.420
 not been my favorite but frankly he 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.850
 was really not bad and I thank 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.900
 strongly call of duty for that 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.070
 Besides, it makes me want to go there 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.210
 replay I hope you wanted 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.380
 to do that will you do the same thing 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.240
 unfortunately we do not have the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.920
 playstation 3 because I have them more 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.030
 I give them data and it really gives me 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.330
 want to play again but hey it's not 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.040
 serious 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.720
 maybe we would do that during 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.220
 great holidays i hope you like 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.390
 I say it through this gameplay that you 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.320
 give me the desire to replay because I 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.910
 know that come evening lighthouse he 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.470
 suffers a lot there are many who 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.330
 return to fifa a lot q returns 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.980
 even ghost because we know that in 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.090
 last they did not like and that's it 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.990
 I hope that game in any case I you 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.550
 advise if you want to return 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.960
 change the minds change and 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.820
 you ideas after school where the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.290
 work was going on this game so I 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.790
 forgot to specify but I cut you 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.780
 the boring moments in the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.040
 moments where would I do that - 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.120
 the moments where is what I'm doing 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.990
 chained that it was great for you 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.700
 make the gameplay more nervous 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.320
 possible so that you do not get bored and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.580
 besides with regard to the subject of 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.690
 video is really taking a subject 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.340
 friendly that has not been much 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.480
 tackled on youtube that's all 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.920
 simply success in the real 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.930
 in life in general and on youtube 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.030
 so for you it's going to be that question 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.800

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.000
 life or succeed on youtube we will you 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.580
 comment it's very important to

 world knows what subscribers thought that 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.130
 so it was so close everything starts from 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.210
 following we already will just start 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.500
 by youtube because it's a bit 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.610
 logical we are on youtube for you 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.080
 what is it succeeding on youtube 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.790
 speak for little youtuber and even 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.290
 for subscribers who would not want to 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.550
 the future open a youtube channel or 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.440
 same who watch youtube channels 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.670
 we for you is what succeed on 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.590
 youtube is having a lot of subscribers 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.150
 it's knowing how to do a lot of seeing 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.830
 by video or just do it 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.880
 what you like to do and continue to 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.050
 do that so tell us in the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.010
 comments us 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.350
 we will just tell you what is 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.510
 what we already think 6.1 youtuber it goes 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.560
 to tell you that he does not want to have 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.910
 a lot of subscribers really got it 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.830
 a big mytho because having subscribers 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.610
 frankly that's what I can say 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.720
 it's a dream that people they 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.310
 would like to have but it's really a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.730
 optical have consumed that one embarks on 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.230
 Youtube 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.760
 it's like having good grades at 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.900
 school so the guy says no I do not want to 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.030
 have good grades in a year 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.260
 it's a mytho like ladji to 6 so for 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.700
 what is coming back to the subject 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.440
 frankly I would combine the two 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.510
 why because frankly do 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.710
 youtube or sfr started an adventure 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.000
 youtube where I do not take pleasure 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.350
 is strictly for nothing because you're going 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.090
 do what you do not like so what if 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.520
 I do it by passion like not doing it 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.050
 after I passed for the most and this is the 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.890
 case for most youtuber but 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.870
 our customers did it by passion 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.670
 in quotation marks and also for me you 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.690
 I'm not hiding from you to try to break through 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.070
 in quotation marks on youtube try 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.090
 to have subscribers try to get 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.110
 to develop a maximum is also 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.580
 for that we try to pass on the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.960
 community channels if we nobody 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.130
 it allows us to grow and 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.660
 frankly I'm ready I could 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.710
 combine the two to say that the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.750
 success on youtube it is acquired 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.070
 so the perfect thing for youtube 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.020
 hours it would be to do a lot of 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.490
 view a lot of view Thursday compared 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.170
 to your number of subscribers located at fifteen 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.240
 thousand subscribers 15000 seen that would be 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.380
 really the top of the top see 16000 that's them 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.700
 this is the pinnacle of success 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.530
 but it's very very rare on youtube 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.060
 especially for the youtube hours gaming 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.350
 as we most did not do our 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.880
 lives ie we for example have 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.160
 twenty thousand subscribers have made 2000 3000 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.170
 4000 seen sometimes we go to 7000 view but 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.270
 rarely more so there is a little bit 13 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.890
 even fourteen thousand subscribers who are 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.820
 inactive it's a shame we get 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.930
 is questioning maybe it's us 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.160
 who do shit where it's 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.840
 maybe our content does not please 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.190
 but in any case to youtuber have 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.930
 successful is to do so at least so 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.459
 compared to subscribers after the guys 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.540
 tell you eh yeah but if you do not 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.530
 failed proof you do not stop 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.330
 youtube it's simple we take pleasure 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.430
 to comment videos to make 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.720
 gameplay to share our experience of 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.550
 youtube game so why are we going 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.480
 stop I ask you me me 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.620
 personally I tell myself moment I 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.390
 have fun and keep it going 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.780
 as it's going that just stopped all 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.970
 simply 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.930
 in addition it occupies part of our 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.860
 free time I mean a part 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.420
 since we do not do this all day 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.020
 yasni me I work signed there 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.760
 school etc 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.720
 we see football and everything but when we have 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.130
 little moments of free it's true 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.110
 that it allows us to take care of 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.370
 to occupy the mind instead of going 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.360
 hang out and do anything 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.830
 I think 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.690
 it's better to stay at home 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.280
 self commented even small videos 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.240
 if we do not see 50000 etc. 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.620
 it's really a good thing 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.790
 now guys will talk to you more 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.450
 usually real life for you 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.370
 the success 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.350
 she goes through what is success 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.910
 family professional at the level of 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.170
 health so all that in the 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.010
 comments too so me 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.420
 personally I will tell you the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.040
 truth guys what would I like 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.570
 to ensure maximum is not success 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.590
 professional because I want to 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.730
 to tell you we do not care a bit 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.960
 as long as we have the health we have 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.790
 family one is well surrounded low this is the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.530
 main for me i think that's fine 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.730
 surrounded to see health and after 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.080
 why not have a good risk 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.730
 professionals but that's more 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.020
 because what you need to know is that 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.250
 if you do not have family this pageantry health 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.320
 battle a certain to have a successful 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.580
 professional tap to health a dj me 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.169
 just tell me in the comments if 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.640
 for example you have cancer as soon as you 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.050
 you were a millionaire and a cancer 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.550
 will your money save you 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.080
 cancer fight no because if you have to 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.370
 die you have to die so precisely the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.110
 health is more important than anything with 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.490
 the family for me besides I know 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.930
 not if you're interested in 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.790
 people who live around you in 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.990
 other countries etc and people who 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.070
 are very very poor but when I 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.230
 you say very poor those who live 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.250
 with 100 euros a month and who are more 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.140
 happy that some billionaires 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.490
 why because they have health they 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.990
 have family and they spend good 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.270
 time with their family see what I 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.610
 so here's the success it can 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.050
 be financial level family level 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.120

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.450
 good behavior i think that's it 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.080
 success is what every man 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.120
 should wish 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.140

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.200
 different because everyone has tastes 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.750

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.770

 go back to the gameplay you saw that that 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.560
 is going great for me I took 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.730
 the Gironde a little while because 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.080
 there because the items had a little bit 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.220
 drunk and frankly I remember 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.380
 that evening I really had 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.150
 played well on this map that I love 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.890
 surkiffe by the way it's summer 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.300
 remastered in a call of the it's 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.230
 more than that, but frankly 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.190
 it's a map that I overkill and 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.870
 I hope that by the future 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.160
 oh well call of duty developers 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.990

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.460
 call of duty on the next who is 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.290

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.730
 world must have known that and videos 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.140
 that they appeared on that but hey it's 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.250
 not the subject so here we go 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.170
 leave there we hope that the video you 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.430
 will have pleased for the small precision I 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.740
 realized in more than 100 kg it was a 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.630
 114 to I know more how much less than 10 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.590
 in any case and so frankly 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.090

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.880

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.590
