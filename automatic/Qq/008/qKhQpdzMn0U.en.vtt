00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 and how are very good I am packard and today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.710
 we are in a new tutorial of this that 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.420
 I like to do to myself because it helps you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.540
 very much to the people who are a little 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 novices in minecraft and today we're going to do 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.150
 The first thing escalators 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.630
 we have to do is anywhere 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.970
 you want to put a block like that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.890
 and so it's good that that's where the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.130
 stairs and the stairs still here here 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.250
 so it's worth 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.530
 that is, peace is to make scales 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.079
 mechanical you need very little you need 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.489
 the material that you want sticky piston 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.920
 reston stairs and a lever worth what 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.360
 you can do it this way or 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.360
 first putting here like this 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.480
 OK 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.920
 doing also a staircase with 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.339
 pistons 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.490
 this is worth a scale with pistons 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.990
 a ladder here is not to fall here 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 and born well here 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.259
 ok how do we hide this 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.259
 well, we do like this 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.970
 and we make a square it disguises a 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.800
 little more but there is no way of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.800
 do this here 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.010
 and what do we do now? 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.640
 we do so 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.920
 hairston we climb like this 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.750
 is so 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.260
 pakapaka this yes 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.020
 and they open and close 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.470
 this is all the simple mechanism is very 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.100
 simple, what do you have to do? 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.100
 to remove this 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.140
 you have to do to see 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.200
 make a ladder with pistons like that 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.250
 put 1 2 and 3 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.480
 It's worth it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.050
 later you can so this can and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.500
 reign 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.630
 with remains and with remains with the rest of 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.740
 arrangement as if it were a square to 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.740
 disguise a little more 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.300
 well and we have to do the same 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.170
 staircase that you have made with the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.989
 pistons that you put this like this will fall us 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.650
 the staircase then we go back to do the 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.650
 same square 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:48.180
 well and you're already here behind 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.190
 a staircase is worth going behind the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.190
 pistons followed by two pistons 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.060
 as you see here here is worth a piston here 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.400
 for a gossip of these here with rest 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.400
 over here the same and here the same 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.970
 ok state I'm going to close and take the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.980
 rest you put it, drag it 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.310
 up to a lever you can open beech 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.370
 will close 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.090
 the mechanism for a house as this is 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.490
 very simple what you have to do is 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.310
 a wall 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.740
 what is a lever here more or 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.980
 unless you look at where the lever is 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.180
 it's worth the lever in this block 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.120
 I have to upload the subtraction here or 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.240
 be that the sumo I give to the lever and now 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.730
 to go up to the floor you have above 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.940
 what you have overhead up there in your 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.010
 home 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.890
 ok and this is all this is the mechanism 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.720
 of these escalators I hope that 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.210
 you liked to like 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.950
 favorites because they help a lot and we 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.180
 we see in the next video until the 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.180
 person kids goodbye
