00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
point this will run out but basically

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.650 
point this will run out but basically
what<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.639> landmarks<00:00:15.269> which<00:00:15.420> can

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
what this is this is landmarks which can

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.920 
what this is this is landmarks which can
be<00:00:15.809> found<00:00:16.049> around<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.560> map<00:00:17.060> and<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.570> easiest

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
be found around the map and the easiest

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.220 
be found around the map and the easiest
way<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.080> do<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.109> you're

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230

you get to exploration you don't have to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
you get to exploration you don't have to
press<00:00:35.160> anything<00:00:35.610> else<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.059> point<00:00:36.540> it

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
press anything else at that point it
