00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.410
 Speak class, beauty, I'm happy in life. 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.240
 I said that I want you to defend the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 central and yet went into management and 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.630
 do not put your foot in here, look, they're just 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.890
 See here the parameters of the system 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.400
 of car steering 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.949
 the car is 84 degrees're not hot 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.690
 You can already see this lambda probe 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.760
 bank one locked 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.440
 Here you see the open mesh that 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.850
 subject to think about the time because it is a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 probe defect is put 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:53.399
 it may only be that unfortunately in the case of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.739
 There we go in the stylus, there we go. 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.739
 in explosion style 2.4 sinister 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.690
 The bus stop is not working. 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.530
 Unfortunately, the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:17.230
 case of 2.4 here the hole is further down 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.200
 Show you the box of the piece 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:29.920
 search and then fiat code 55 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:32.980
 1844 255 thousand reais is 5 thousand reais this 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.430
 Part who wants to buy a fiat car 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:41.590
 name that noise there five thousand 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.770
 the control unit of the motor. 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.460
 energy is that this same problem 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.130
 one will be that if I switch center 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:59.530
 I'll actually be able to do the injection. 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:02.500
 this network to get back and closed 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.530
 working a glance at the chart 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.790
 show you the probe chart 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.040
 lambda né 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.970
 we will show that the probe graph 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.420
 where is it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.989
 Let's call the probe graph. 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.500
 the sale of this line 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:25.300
 in this continuous line, it means that it 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 died in the engine control unit 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.620
 who gave a dick because the waves are still 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.380
 sending information makes the central not 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.620
 plays the sign beauty 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.260
 Ok let's have a look at the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.260
 memory to check the fault memory 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.060
 sensor circuit lambda sensor one sensor 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.200
 bank a stage on the new plant there 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.310
 they are going to do in real time were 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.880
 turn off the camera, I will not show 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.220
 How do people solve the problem? 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.150
 turn off the car 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.360
 gabriel is turning off the bitch 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.650
 Let's wait a minute just to do it. 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.670
 the electronic shutdown of the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.380
 power supply 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.290
 fast thing while we go 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.670
 commenting with you 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.269
 happened the staff this car he is 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.680
 with the injection light constantly on 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.959
 indicating probe failure as you 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.569
 saw on the scanner only before 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.720
 change the sensor you need 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.890
 to test the sensors and what the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.560
 people did 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.859
 we have tools to do so did the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.139
 test we are seeing that the sensor sends 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.840
 information for the module and this 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.599
 information does not seem to reach the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.019
 module which was the second step is 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.790
 check continuity see if you did not have 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.480
 no wire, right? 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.269
 ruptured in the middle of the probe path 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.819
 for engine control unit 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.510
 everything perfect no problem i talked to 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.030
 the owner 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.109
 Unfortunately, its central office was pro 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.470
 space 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.669
 and it 's hard to believe is the guy stayed 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.989
 kind of like that but look 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.440
 see what happens with the 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.789
 car operation 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.570
 Let's put it here. 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:28.500
 here the other little pigs are here 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:34.860
 let's set up the new plant to run the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:36.500
 learning procedure 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.560
 motorcycle butterfly 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.250
 It's a center that costs 5 thousand 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.240
 real 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.010
 the flávio 5 power discount was how much 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.820
 He got a discount, she left. 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.800
 for 3 900 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.039
 so nothing at all saved us 1,100 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.330
 but three thousand dollars 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:04.729
 nine hundred reais for a steering part 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.729
 I think the car is absurd. 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.540
 let's leave the key in gear one 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:16.220
 minute for learning to listen in 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.220
 save link will make that gas 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.930
 This personal noise is the butterfly. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.210
 making the quotation high 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.889
 in a moment will start to move will 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.889
 make a splash klec different 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.360
 I'll show everything without turning off the camera. 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.360
 without anything 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.650
 O 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.840
 the adaptation is analyzing the adaptation 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.800
 finished match 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.800
 the pride of humiliating 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:18.050
 ok motor connected again 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:20.199
 will the probe now begin to 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.199
 to work 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.449
 come on gabriel first thing is to turn it off 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.910
 the fault memory 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.070
 the party has a fault memory of the 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.479
 probes she thinks she does not want the 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.790
 center was clean 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:35.650
 she was always clean beauty does not have 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.880
 no new central fault 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.620
 Let's take a look now at 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:44.720
 parameters and it is not just the 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.479
 Do you remember what I said? 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.010
 from open to closed mesh and 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:51.789
 I 'm already working, I do not need 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.320
 I do not really call the chart there. 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:58.310
 only calls from the main strip this action 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.440
 probe in the background that only the probe 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.930
 main I personally show the law 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.300
 Remember that continuous line of people 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.479
 now is not a solid line but not now 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:12.130
 probe working to touch the knife in the 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.130
 I went skull
