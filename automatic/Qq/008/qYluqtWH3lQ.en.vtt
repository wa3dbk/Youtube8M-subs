year<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:33.390> guess<00:02:34.390> I'd<00:02:34.540> characterize<00:02:34.780> myself<00:02:35.290> of

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
year I guess I'd characterize myself of

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.300 
year I guess I'd characterize myself of
my<00:02:35.769> sets<00:02:36.660> first<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.900> foremost<00:02:38.110> with<00:02:38.830> energy

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
my sets first and foremost with energy

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.580 
my sets first and foremost with energy
and<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.510> mix<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:40.930> blend<00:02:41.019> because<00:02:41.319> that's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
and the mix and blend because that's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.290 
and the mix and blend because that's
basically<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.040> style<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.730> I've<00:02:43.150> been

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
basically the style that I've been

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.090 
basically the style that I've been
holding<00:02:43.569> on<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:44.050> for<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.620> long<00:02:44.830> as<00:02:44.890> I've<00:02:45.069> been

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
holding on to for as long as I've been

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.050 
holding on to for as long as I've been
DJing<00:02:45.690> creating<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.840> flow<00:02:47.410> mix<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.250> blend<00:02:48.340> flow

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
DJing creating a flow mix and blend flow

00:02:49.060 --> 00:03:00.460 
DJing creating a flow mix and blend flow
and<00:02:49.420> energy

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.950 

but<00:03:01.250> my<00:03:01.370> favorite<00:03:01.730> scent<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.330> I've<00:03:02.450> ever

but my favorite scent is that I've ever
played<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.500> actually<00:03:04.070> my<00:03:04.190> answer<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.670> my<00:03:05.240> next

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
played and actually my answer is my next

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.840 
played and actually my answer is my next
