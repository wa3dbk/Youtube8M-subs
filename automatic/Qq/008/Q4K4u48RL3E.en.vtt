00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.250
 yes two helps we have very naive 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.259
 money only 1 match under control 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.849
 stacking tower was of course dangerous 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.310
 in the counter we now know peace 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.990
 we say to each other that that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.660
 is the only chance they have so we 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 must be frugal and build possession and 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.019
 reason remains no must be good and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.510
 actually give the bee the two bonuses 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.490
 we just left and and exactly what is what 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.599
 so they want because of our own mistakes 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.690
 we have lost this competition 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.719
 I think we only just as good 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.719
 play 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.770
 PC that very expectant youngest game that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.489
 Marken also think it's the 1st half right 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 have shown ghost 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.950
 nice game have shown good 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.510
 seen attacks I think and yes you see 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.800
 the second half that they are really lurking 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.230
 on the counter and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.079
 and waited for our mistake and well 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.879
 we warn ourselves then we do 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 for that before the game and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.170
 during the rest actually good but it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.300
 is perhaps still the de 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 eagerness that everyone is an under 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.450
 put you one or imagine that you will 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.270
 maybe too happy to those two norms 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.130
 want to go making you actually 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.510
 and ultimately they make mistakes 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.549
 punishing it back is one 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.990
 and we know that we too 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.509
 well we were in the game 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.710
 maybe better team 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.630
 had maybe two now have 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.420
 and additionally one is so easy 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.270
 so soon comes then of course one 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.329
 disappointment and and yes after that we went 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.369
 work ok for me play but then a2 and 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.570
 know it of course difficult and and yes 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.370
 it's so easy east road has one 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.020
 it becomes hard to win you saw 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.270
 the first mainly that we are at the moment 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.479
 that that nickel giver between the two 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.900
 Central came that the backs 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.580
 both me and boilers a little more to more 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.100
 and you saw the first one too 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.900
 half that it's since the fruits 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.280
 rejected 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.680
 play the green and the good through it 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.720
 could also end the sides 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.790
 good to see and to be with each other 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.710
 with schÃ¶ne I think one was just one 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.320
 few good depend on it maybe 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.100
 we need that you continue your alternate 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.929
 I think something more in it 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.239
 there are differences in tactics, I think 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.940
 him and well i think that now took the 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.660
 Second could have been better than I will be you 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.220
 changed 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.230
 boilers is changed is also because 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.780
 you there so many powers 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.040
 have wasted strength in the 1st half yes 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.650
 I don't know if it was me now 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.970
 maybe a few match days back 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.790
 I probably had it 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.500
 be able to hold up a whole competition 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.660
 well now of course it was my second 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.160
 match of the season but to 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.680
 played it for an hour last week 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.570
 with with young doctor and good and then brand 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.150
 you around you so you do not have to 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.530
 the netherlands is going to be able to hold on well and 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.510
 that comes to an end with competition 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.130
 egypt I think and I hope that 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.410
 good to build up in the coming weeks and 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.280
 I hope that I still long of 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.770
 to 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.510
 of course is identical 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.150
 say we have home is home we want 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.820
 never lose and our wms lies then is 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.770
 it hurts but on the side it is so 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.210
 just too ordinary is not much going on 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.070
 actually one of our best 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.580
 games played until 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.350
 say that the two one and there is so 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.180
 to distant lands there is not only it 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.100
 is a shame that we have such a nice game 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.840
 and what we totally didn't have 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.790
 have to lose because look then 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.140
 also positively approach you against 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.490
 perhaps the biggest competitor 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.320
 actually you want to be able to lay and 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.880
 that you might be better 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.420
 yes, we should not take that into account 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.950
 of this competition and pc is just one 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.800
 good team is definitely having offensive 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.690
 them many individual qualities but yes 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.860
 we what you what you said we take from 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.560
 these knew we were just the better ones 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.440
 and if we keep playing like that 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.150
 then it will certainly be fine only yes 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.670
 easy chose to give away that should now 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.090
 stop because in the beginning of a te 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.090
 often happens
