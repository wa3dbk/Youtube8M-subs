00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.730
 hi my name is yuri spivak and not 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.490
 only the school principal want to know but 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.200
 also a math teacher and I 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.150
 graduated from Moscow Physical and Technical 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.950
 institute faculty aero physics 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.360
 space research we together with 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.000
 I finish my Khabensky 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.560
 classmate and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 specialty we all application 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:37.260
 math applied physics like 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.140
 the load on the Physics and Technology Department was decreasing as 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.210
 student began to occur after 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 third year at the fourth from me 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.380
 began to appear additionally very 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 flexible it 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.340
 students and which went on the site 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.670
 epic yet somehow i typed 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.900
 I gradually had practice 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.910
 until the moment it appeared 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.300
 school at least it was not as ideas 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 I have about eight students 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.180
 somewhere so it was interesting here because 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.200
 that for pupils there were different pupils 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.960
 there is the smallest martyr by whom 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.960
 there was a girl in sixth grade studying 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.960
 If we talk here those principles on which 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.120
 we rely in preparation i question not 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.070
 called this technique well god be with him 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.130
 so in general understanding will come and so 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.630
 call it all in general is built on 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.790
 stories that are probably now too 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.729
 it is appropriate to tell though every time already 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.590
 telling in all the videos this one 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.880
 the story of how I'm just a complete PhD 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.400
 because really it's like me 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.690
 entered the Physical and Technical Institute and there is that method 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.060
 if I may say so now 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.619
 prepare our students 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.340
 the bottom line was that me was mine 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.570
 classmate drags on Olympiad 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.070
 Physics and Technology All who had two exams 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.140
 girl physics the problem was with physics 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.580
 Now that I never physics in 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.100
 the school did not teach at all a complete zero well 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.580
 there is well it is without there when u increase 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.290
 I got such a task that I have 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.030
 have three months and i need some 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.620
 way to understand physics and raise 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.810
 Physics is not just to raise physics 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.970
 level 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.950
 Ph.D. to the level of physic technical 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.920
 university 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.810
 it was at that time not turn out 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.480
 very challenging but all i did 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.269
 I took the very first workbook she 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.920
 Here it is, let's say a very mechanic 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.920
 some simple things well what did i do 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.269
 open the first page and start 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.110
 read where something is written in style 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.530
 dear friend and I consider this whole page 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.560
 I set myself the thought of a mark that I 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.080
 understood what is written there 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.519
 I turn the page read further 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.709
 in fact there is not much more difficult 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.390
 was than 1 page yes because 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.390
 about the same stories about what I am right now 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.130
 I'll do nothing there I did too 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.200
 got a mark that when wearing something 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.780
 pages let's say something entered 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.280
 variable but explained that it is 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.720
 they did not immediately give this form to the very 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.370
 In fact, there is no such thing in textbooks. 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.320
 You immediately open this formula there and 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.060
 what the hell is happening to her 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.780
 is that not a step forward 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.600
 until you understand what is happening 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.390
 Now if you realize that now is not 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.460
 quite clear you can not say well 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.150
 ok, then I understand 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.150
 I'll figure it out 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.790
 I still think young 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.299
 teachers 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.980
 this is the case of courses when 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:59.840
 already quick result is very good and 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.319
 still very important that young 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.799
 the teacher he burns he burns so that 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.139
 he does because well in general he is not 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.819
 just had time to go out imagine 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.389
 some very cool teachers him 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.579
 50 years 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.389
 honor the point then the 50 year old traitor 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.459
 super experience 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.049
 knows how to sort through any 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.449
 student and so on that's how you think 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.910
 how do you think when he started 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:29.360
 teach and passed there two or three years he 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.820
 bad was five years old he to bad on what 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.090
 gay follow groshev bad at 15 he 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.360
 become good it does not happen or you immediately 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:42.110
 good surcharge either immediately bad 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.870
 because how you teach experience 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.270
 comes 23 years old dad taught here 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.030
 come all the end you need repeats 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.620
 in terms of the student but what is in you 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.810
 ducks contributed 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.610
 what character do you like this 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.960
 imagine teaching she no longer 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.780
 will change in 10 years dramatically 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.220
 how can you someone like this 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.940
 say in three years already formed 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.440
 man here is someone and if you are good 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.090
 the teacher you after two or three 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.810
 years under our practice good here we are 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.810
 such we find 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:33.140
 no surface wishes have wishes 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.090
 first work on how you 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.130
 getting ready to do it right or not 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.960
 because if you ask all this 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.840
 the question is you spend a day or two 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.500
 a week then you will effectively spend 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.480
 its time 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.720
 And if you think about the first day 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.340
 to prepare for his need to decide option b 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.140
 part b part c this task 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.090
 hang you do not think that you 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.480
 you do you spend a lot of time 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.260
 unnecessary in vain therefore astana advice is not 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.260
 waste your time
