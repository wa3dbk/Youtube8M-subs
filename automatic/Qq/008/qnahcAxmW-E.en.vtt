the<00:04:19.900> chrome<00:04:20.200> does<00:04:20.410> not<00:04:20.620> come<00:04:20.860> off<00:04:20.980> okay<00:04:21.730> I'm

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
the chrome does not come off okay I'm

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.520 
the chrome does not come off okay I'm
going<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.450> try<00:04:22.630> scraping<00:04:23.230> this<00:04:23.320> with<00:04:23.440> my

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
going to try scraping this with my

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.920 
going to try scraping this with my
finger<00:04:23.890> I<00:04:24.130> did<00:04:24.880> not<00:04:25.060> put<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.330> I<00:04:25.510> put<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.720> little

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
finger I did not put it I put a little

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.900 
finger I did not put it I put a little
clear<00:04:26.200> coat<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:27.570> that's<00:04:28.570> coming<00:04:28.870> off<00:04:29.790> but<00:04:30.790> the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
clear coat in that's coming off but the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.220 
clear coat in that's coming off but the
reason<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.180> is<00:04:31.390> because<00:04:31.420> I<00:04:31.840> didn't<00:04:32.110> do

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
reason that is because I didn't do

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.600 
reason that is because I didn't do
proper<00:04:32.920> prepping<00:04:33.340> in<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.460> beginning<00:04:33.850> but<00:04:35.610> my

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
proper prepping in the beginning but my

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.580 
proper prepping in the beginning but my
recommendation<00:04:37.000> that's<00:04:37.870> why<00:04:38.080> you<00:04:38.140> need<00:04:38.470> to

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
recommendation that's why you need to

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.040 
recommendation that's why you need to
have<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.740> strong<00:04:39.130> clear<00:04:39.460> coat<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:39.970> top<00:04:40.030> of<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.930> so

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
have a strong clear coat on top of it so

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
have a strong clear coat on top of it so
the<00:04:41.170> paint<00:04:41.440> is<00:04:41.680> not<00:04:41.890> come<00:04:42.310> off<00:04:42.900> okay<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.230> what

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
the paint is not come off okay and what

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.150 
the paint is not come off okay and what
else<00:04:45.100> do<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.490> have<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.970> say<00:04:46.240> other<00:04:46.630> than<00:04:46.810> that

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
else do I have to say other than that

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.910 
else do I have to say other than that
that's<00:04:48.160> what<00:04:48.370> I'll<00:04:48.580> say<00:04:48.610> it<00:04:48.910> one<00:04:49.120> more<00:04:49.150> time

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
that's what I'll say it one more time

that's what I'll say it one more time
