for 12 to earn money and it's a cool way

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.680 
for 12 to earn money and it's a cool way
for<00:00:37.430> tournaments<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.460> example<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.300> grow<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690

hate to have something like like this

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.700 
hate to have something like like this
against<00:01:12.119> me<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:13.310> stop<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:15.710> competitive

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
against me an a stop it in a competitive

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.770 
against me an a stop it in a competitive
game<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.090> really

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
game because this is just really

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
game because this is just really
distracting<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.979> example<00:01:20.400> these

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
distracting and for example these

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.090 
distracting and for example these
weapons<00:01:21.090> might<00:01:21.810> blend<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
weapons might blend in with the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.070 
weapons might blend in with the
background<00:01:23.549> which<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:23.939> also<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> bad<00:01:24.630> thing<00:01:24.900> in

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
background which is also a bad thing in

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.140 
background which is also a bad thing in
a<00:01:25.409> public<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:25.950> all<00:01:26.100> fine<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> big

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
a public that's all fine it's not a big

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.819 
a public that's all fine it's not a big
problem<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> competitive<00:01:28.170> game<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
problem but in a competitive game in a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.380 
problem but in a competitive game in a
really<00:01:29.159> serious<00:01:29.430> game<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.939> wouldn't<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
really serious game you wouldn't want to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.380 
really serious game you wouldn't want to
miss<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.470> weapon<00:01:31.979> because<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.340> has<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.850> grayish

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
miss a weapon because it has a grayish

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.830 
miss a weapon because it has a grayish
color<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> gray<00:01:34.350> background<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> oh<00:01:36.090> no<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
color on a gray background so oh no I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.710 
color on a gray background so oh no I
really<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> weapons<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.460> buy

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
really like the weapons you can buy

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.609 
really like the weapons you can buy
probably<00:01:39.720> some<00:01:40.470> will<00:01:40.680> drop<00:01:41.220> randomly<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:41.939> well

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
probably some will drop randomly as well

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.740 
probably some will drop randomly as well
at<00:01:43.619> least<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> case<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.700> dota<00:01:45.000> 2<00:01:45.299> i'm

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
at least that's the case with dota 2 i'm

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.330 
at least that's the case with dota 2 i'm
not<00:01:46.049> sure<00:01:46.350> how<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.860> work<00:01:46.920> in

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
not sure how it will work in

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.630 
not sure how it will work in
counter-strike<00:01:48.210> yet<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:49.979> basically

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
counter-strike yet but this is basically

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.569 
counter-strike yet but this is basically
a<00:01:50.729> copy<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.149> dota<00:01:51.540> 2<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.079> Team<00:01:52.500> Fortress<00:01:52.770> 2<00:01:52.950> so

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
a copy of dota 2 and Team Fortress 2 so

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.850 
a copy of dota 2 and Team Fortress 2 so
they'll<00:01:54.570> drop<00:01:54.840> randomly<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.470> well<00:01:55.649> most

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
they'll drop randomly as well most

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.090 
they'll drop randomly as well most
likely<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.399> that's<00:01:57.270> fine<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.689> me<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.619> let's

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
likely and that's fine with me so let's

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.850 
likely and that's fine with me so let's
head<00:01:59.280> into<00:01:59.460> due<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> game<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:01.140> right<00:02:01.320> here

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
head into due to the game all right here

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.819 
head into due to the game all right here
are<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> two<00:02:02.310> new<00:02:02.460> weapons<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.600> USB<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.560> new

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
are the two new weapons the USB and new

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.770 
are the two new weapons the USB and new
starting<00:02:05.340> pistol<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.299> select<00:02:06.509> this

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
starting pistol if you select this

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.869 
starting pistol if you select this
weapon<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.259> means<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.649> cannot<00:02:08.069> look<00:02:08.340> kinda

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
weapon this means you cannot look kinda

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.270 
weapon this means you cannot look kinda
longer<00:02:09.179> by<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.330> p250<00:02:10.229> or<00:02:10.879> pp-2000<00:02:11.879> i<00:02:11.970> mean

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
longer by the p250 or pp-2000 i mean

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.040 
longer by the p250 or pp-2000 i mean
from<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.790> tell<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.510> weapon<00:02:15.960> is

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
from what I can tell this weapon is

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.680 
from what I can tell this weapon is
almost<00:02:16.410> exactly<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:17.100> same<00:02:17.390> accept<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.510> as<00:02:18.660> a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
almost exactly the same accept it as a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.290 
almost exactly the same accept it as a
silencer<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.380> one<00:02:19.680> bill<00:02:19.890> unless<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.610> says<00:02:21.090> in

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
silencer and one bill unless it says in

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.880 
silencer and one bill unless it says in
the<00:02:21.420> description<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.380> has<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> higher

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the description that it has a higher

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.150 
the description that it has a higher
accuracy<00:02:23.490> but<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.450> yet<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.260> notice<00:02:25.680> it

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
accuracy but I have yet to notice it

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
accuracy but I have yet to notice it
because<00:02:27.680> both<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.710> them<00:02:28.950> are<00:02:29.220> very<00:02:29.490> accurate<00:02:29.970> I

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
because both of them are very accurate I

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.200 
because both of them are very accurate I
mean<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.660> has<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.170> accuracy<00:02:31.800> ball<00:02:31.970> bar<00:02:32.970> all

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
mean this has the accuracy ball bar all

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.330 
mean this has the accuracy ball bar all
the<00:02:33.240> way<00:02:33.390> full<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.960> be<00:02:34.530> 2,000<00:02:35.100> tested<00:02:35.430> as<00:02:35.550> well

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the way full and be 2,000 tested as well

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.850 
the way full and be 2,000 tested as well
yeah<00:02:38.340> i'm<00:02:38.850> not<00:02:39.060> sure<00:02:39.210> i<00:02:39.480> also<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.740> this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
yeah i'm not sure i also have this

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.620 
yeah i'm not sure i also have this
weapon<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.730> only<00:02:46.100> 2,900<00:02:47.630> does

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
weapon and this one is only 2,900 does

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.960 
weapon and this one is only 2,900 does
it<00:02:48.780> cost<00:02:48.990> so<00:02:49.260> that's<00:02:49.680> 200<00:02:50.340> less<00:02:50.580> than<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
it cost so that's 200 less than the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.870 
it cost so that's 200 less than the
traditional<00:02:51.360> em<00:02:51.900> floor<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:52.920> only<00:02:53.340> has<00:02:53.490> 20

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
traditional em floor but only has 20

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.720 
traditional em floor but only has 20
bullet<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.300> its<00:02:54.420> clip<00:02:54.660> size<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.370> 60<00:02:56.370> bullets

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
bullet in its clip size and 60 bullets

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.610 
bullet in its clip size and 60 bullets
in<00:02:56.910> total<00:02:57.450> which<00:02:57.600> means<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.990> can<00:02:58.140> only<00:02:58.290> really

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
in total which means you can only really

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.020 
in total which means you can only really
load<00:02:58.830> two<00:02:59.160> times<00:02:59.570> with<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:01.020> m4<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:02.490> normal<00:03:02.880> em

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
load two times with the m4 the normal em

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.070 
load two times with the m4 the normal em
for<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:04.310> your<00:03:05.310> 90<00:03:05.640> bullets<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.210> that

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
for that is your 90 bullets and that

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.780 
for that is your 90 bullets and that
means<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.560> reload<00:03:07.860> three<00:03:08.100> times<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.610> this

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
means you can reload three times so this

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.660 
means you can reload three times so this
is<00:03:08.910> actually<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.330> big<00:03:09.570> difference<00:03:09.990> this<00:03:10.710> 60

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
is actually a big difference this 60

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.630 
is actually a big difference this 60
balloons<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.450> isn't<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.870> lot<00:03:13.050> for<00:03:13.290> around

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
balloons really isn't a lot for around

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.130 
balloons really isn't a lot for around
especially<00:03:14.640> if<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> round<00:03:15.240> goes<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.510> minutes

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
especially if the round goes to minutes

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.280 
especially if the round goes to minutes
and<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.560> have<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:17.150> scatter<00:03:18.150> people<00:03:18.630> off<00:03:18.810> you

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
and you have to scatter people off you

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.530 
and you have to scatter people off you
have<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.560> reload<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.400> pre-fire<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.330> bit

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
have to reload and you pre-fire a bit

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.020 
have to reload and you pre-fire a bit
then<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.080> run<00:03:22.410> out<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:22.890> bullets<00:03:23.220> really<00:03:23.760> fast

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
then you run out of bullets really fast

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.840 
then you run out of bullets really fast
on<00:03:24.210> you<00:03:24.360> if<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.960> have<00:03:25.200> like<00:03:25.500> 25<00:03:26.400> minutes

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
on you if you have like 25 minutes

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.000 
on you if you have like 25 minutes
remaining<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.570> already<00:03:27.960> have<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.440> feeling

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
remaining you already have the feeling

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.620 
remaining you already have the feeling
that<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.310> have<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.550> conserve<00:03:29.970> your<00:03:30.240> bullets

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
that you have to conserve your bullets

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.500 
that you have to conserve your bullets
so<00:03:31.470> that's<00:03:31.710> actually<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:32.130> big<00:03:32.310> thing<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:32.670> now

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
so that's actually a big thing and now

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.050 
so that's actually a big thing and now
let's<00:03:33.720> look<00:03:33.870> at<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.110> spray<00:03:34.290> pattern<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.940> of

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
let's look at the spray pattern so of

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.790 
let's look at the spray pattern so of
course<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.420> little<00:03:39.720> less<00:03:39.840> bullets<00:03:40.200> than<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.440> m4

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
course a little less bullets than the m4

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.250 
course a little less bullets than the m4
but<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:43.410> says<00:03:43.830> it's<00:03:44.130> more<00:03:44.340> accurate<00:03:44.550> but

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.839 

now<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.379> can<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.129> little<00:03:50.280> bit<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.579> goes

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
now you can see the little bit this goes

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.580 
now you can see the little bit this goes
a<00:03:50.879> little<00:03:51.120> bit<00:03:51.269> higher<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:52.200> that's<00:03:52.319> also

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
a little bit higher but that's also

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.390 
a little bit higher but that's also
because<00:03:52.799> they're<00:03:53.159> there<00:03:53.790> are<00:03:54.000> more<00:03:54.269> bullets

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.940 

so<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> little<00:03:59.640> bit<00:03:59.790> more<00:03:59.969> accurate<00:04:00.390> is<00:04:00.950> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
so a little bit more accurate is the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.670 
so a little bit more accurate is the
silence<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.579> also<00:04:03.000> think<00:04:03.420> that<00:04:03.599> more<00:04:04.319> bullets

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
silence I also think that more bullets

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.039 
silence I also think that more bullets
go<00:04:04.889> little<00:04:05.700> bit<00:04:05.790> better<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.329> this<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.780> the

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
go little bit better in this in the

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.520 
go little bit better in this in the
center<00:04:08.239> well<00:04:09.239> maybe<00:04:09.719> not<00:04:09.930> maybe<00:04:10.109> that's<00:04:10.409> just

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
center well maybe not maybe that's just

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:20.930 
center well maybe not maybe that's just
random<00:04:15.949> yeah<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:18.620> do<00:04:19.620> think<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.669> great

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
random yeah I do think this is a great

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.430 
random yeah I do think this is a great
weapon<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:22.440> use<00:04:22.470> in<00:04:23.070> publix<00:04:23.699> but<00:04:24.479> I've<00:04:24.990> tested

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
weapon to use in publix but I've tested

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.800 
weapon to use in publix but I've tested
it<00:04:25.560> with<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.800> mate<00:04:26.099> of<00:04:26.130> mine<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:27.330> can<00:04:27.509> still

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
it with a mate of mine you can still

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.450 
it with a mate of mine you can still
hear<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.259> webinar<00:04:28.680> if<00:04:28.889> there's<00:04:29.250> somebody

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
hear the webinar if there's somebody

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.870 
hear the webinar if there's somebody
standing<00:04:29.820> way<00:04:30.120> over<00:04:30.509> there<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.460> hear<00:04:32.729> me

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
standing way over there you can hear me

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.300 
standing way over there you can hear me
shoot<00:04:33.150> not<00:04:33.780> only<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.289> bullets<00:04:34.620> flying<00:04:34.860> by<00:04:35.099> but

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
shoot not only the bullets flying by but

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.629 
shoot not only the bullets flying by but
also<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.729> weapon<00:04:35.910> firing<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:38.370> doesn't

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
also the weapon firing so it doesn't

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.529 
also the weapon firing so it doesn't
really<00:04:38.880> suppressor<00:04:39.539> the<00:04:40.199> noise<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.650> lot<00:04:40.889> and

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
really suppressor the noise a lot and

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.330 
really suppressor the noise a lot and
the<00:04:42.539> big<00:04:42.720> problem<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.169> that<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.500> only<00:04:43.650> has<00:04:43.949> 20

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
the big problem is that it only has 20

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.749 
the big problem is that it only has 20
bullets<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.570> think<00:04:45.630> in<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.410> public<00:04:47.130> it<00:04:47.340> might

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
bullets so I think in a public it might

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.820 
bullets so I think in a public it might
also<00:04:48.030> be<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.300> good<00:04:48.360> thing<00:04:48.720> because<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.560> of

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
also be a good thing because it is of

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.420 
also be a good thing because it is of
course<00:04:50.039> a<00:04:50.190> little<00:04:50.430> bit<00:04:50.520> silent<00:04:51.949> in<00:04:52.949> a<00:04:53.070> public

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
course a little bit silent in a public

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.189 
course a little bit silent in a public
you<00:04:53.580> might<00:04:53.909> have<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.090> situation<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.750> somebody

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
you might have a situation that somebody

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.610 
you might have a situation that somebody
can<00:04:55.380> come<00:04:55.590> from<00:04:55.830> all<00:04:55.949> different<00:04:55.979> angles<00:04:56.610> and

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
can come from all different angles and

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.710 
can come from all different angles and
then<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.860> silencer<00:04:59.520> can<00:04:59.880> work<00:05:00.060> out<00:05:00.240> really<00:05:00.449> good

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
then a silencer can work out really good

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.230 
then a silencer can work out really good
for<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.050> but<00:05:01.710> in<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.220> competitive<00:05:02.639> game<00:05:03.030> you

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
for you but in a competitive game you

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.010 
for you but in a competitive game you
most<00:05:03.539> often<00:05:03.810> don't<00:05:04.289> have<00:05:04.409> that<00:05:04.770> situation<00:05:04.979> and

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
most often don't have that situation and

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.170 
most often don't have that situation and
therefore<00:05:07.020> i<00:05:07.050> think<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:07.919> weapon<00:05:08.310> won't<00:05:08.520> be

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
therefore i think this weapon won't be

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.800 
therefore i think this weapon won't be
used<00:05:09.510> in<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:10.830> competitive<00:05:11.370> scene<00:05:11.669> a<00:05:11.909> lot<00:05:12.150> or

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
used in the competitive scene a lot or

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.439 
used in the competitive scene a lot or
perhaps<00:05:13.139> not<00:05:13.590> at<00:05:13.710> all<00:05:13.860> because<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.909> downside

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
perhaps not at all because the downside

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.409 
perhaps not at all because the downside
of<00:05:15.690> having<00:05:15.720> few<00:05:16.530> less<00:05:17.340> butit's<00:05:17.699> is<00:05:17.880> quite

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
of having few less butit's is quite

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.490 
of having few less butit's is quite
quite<00:05:18.870> quite<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:19.289> big<00:05:19.590> downside<00:05:20.840> in<00:05:21.840> publix

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
quite quite a big downside in publix

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.800 
quite quite a big downside in publix
however<00:05:22.740> like<00:05:22.979> i<00:05:23.009> said<00:05:23.400> people<00:05:23.940> will<00:05:24.120> use<00:05:24.570> it<00:05:24.720> a

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
however like i said people will use it a

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.589 
however like i said people will use it a
lot<00:05:24.930> because<00:05:25.139> it's<00:05:25.470> just<00:05:25.940> way<00:05:26.940> cooler<00:05:27.330> than<00:05:27.360> a

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
lot because it's just way cooler than a

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.279 
lot because it's just way cooler than a
normal<00:05:28.560> web<00:05:29.419> also<00:05:30.419> you<00:05:30.479> can<00:05:30.570> remove<00:05:31.080> the

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
normal web also you can remove the

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.010 
normal web also you can remove the
silencer<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.070> we'll<00:05:32.699> do<00:05:32.849> that<00:05:32.970> one<00:05:33.180> time<00:05:36.020> so

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
silencer and we'll do that one time so

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.310 
silencer and we'll do that one time so
again<00:05:37.259> that<00:05:37.440> is<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.680> spay<00:05:37.919> prep<00:05:38.599> okay<00:05:39.599> pattern

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
again that is the spay prep okay pattern

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.590 
again that is the spay prep okay pattern
with<00:05:40.919> silencer<00:05:41.849> and<00:05:42.030> now<00:05:42.599> without

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.390 

and<00:05:47.600> as<00:05:47.720> you<00:05:47.840> can<00:05:47.990> see<00:05:48.020> it<00:05:48.230> goes<00:05:48.410> way<00:05:48.620> higher<00:05:48.650> so

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
and as you can see it goes way higher so

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.310 
and as you can see it goes way higher so
there<00:05:49.640> isn't<00:05:49.970> any<00:05:50.090> reason<00:05:50.360> I<00:05:50.720> think<00:05:50.870> why<00:05:51.170> you

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
there isn't any reason I think why you

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.290 
there isn't any reason I think why you
should<00:05:51.530> remove<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:52.010> silencer<00:05:52.490> then<00:05:53.150> they

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
should remove the silencer then they

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.300 
should remove the silencer then they
have<00:05:53.420> added<00:05:53.630> one<00:05:53.930> more<00:05:53.960> thing<00:05:54.470> and<00:05:54.680> it's<00:05:55.130> the

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
have added one more thing and it's the

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.210 
have added one more thing and it's the
last<00:05:55.340> thing<00:05:55.610> I'll<00:05:55.820> show<00:05:56.030> you<00:05:56.090> in<00:05:56.270> this<00:05:56.360> video

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
last thing I'll show you in this video

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.010 
last thing I'll show you in this video
with<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.400> Diigo<00:05:58.670> of<00:05:58.790> course<00:05:59.030> you<00:05:59.510> can<00:05:59.690> look<00:05:59.900> at

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
with the Diigo of course you can look at

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.560 
with the Diigo of course you can look at
your<00:06:00.170> weapon<00:06:00.530> in<00:06:00.680> spex<00:06:01.220> weapon<00:06:01.640> because<00:06:02.120> you

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
your weapon in spex weapon because you

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.330 
your weapon in spex weapon because you
have<00:06:02.600> all<00:06:02.840> those<00:06:02.960> cool<00:06:03.290> new<00:06:03.560> weapons<00:06:03.980> now<00:06:04.130> if

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
have all those cool new weapons now if

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.180 
have all those cool new weapons now if
you<00:06:04.580> press<00:06:04.850> f<00:06:05.030> you<00:06:05.930> can<00:06:06.110> expect<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.650> and<00:06:06.950> it

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
you press f you can expect it and it

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.000 
you press f you can expect it and it
just<00:06:07.220> does<00:06:07.760> little<00:06:08.090> animation<00:06:08.690> and<00:06:09.350> that's

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
just does little animation and that's

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.210 
just does little animation and that's
fine<00:06:10.190> but<00:06:11.180> if<00:06:11.390> you<00:06:11.660> press<00:06:12.140> f<00:06:12.410> and<00:06:12.650> you<00:06:12.740> hold<00:06:13.010> it

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
fine but if you press f and you hold it

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.310 
fine but if you press f and you hold it
you'll<00:06:13.940> see<00:06:14.180> that<00:06:14.390> you<00:06:14.570> can<00:06:14.600> hold<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.170> weapon

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
you'll see that you can hold the weapon

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.880 
you'll see that you can hold the weapon
in<00:06:15.620> a<00:06:15.710> certain<00:06:15.920> position<00:06:16.130> like<00:06:16.670> so<00:06:16.700> and<00:06:17.890> the

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
in a certain position like so and the

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.110 
in a certain position like so and the
good<00:06:19.070> thing<00:06:19.130> is<00:06:19.460> you<00:06:19.820> can<00:06:20.060> shoot<00:06:20.330> instantly<00:06:22.120> so

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
good thing is you can shoot instantly so

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.660 
good thing is you can shoot instantly so
I'm<00:06:23.540> not<00:06:23.810> sure<00:06:23.870> if<00:06:24.020> the<00:06:24.320> tell<00:06:24.560> if<00:06:24.770> your

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 
I'm not sure if the tell if your

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.270

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
updates I like the silencers I like the

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.530 
updates I like the silencers I like the
new<00:06:48.470> skins<00:06:48.890> for<00:06:49.070> weapons<00:06:49.430> I<00:06:49.640> mean<00:06:49.790> it's<00:06:50.210> really

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.540 
new skins for weapons I mean it's really

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.540 
new skins for weapons I mean it's really
cool<00:06:50.720> to<00:06:50.780> have<00:06:51.110> them<00:06:51.290> drop<00:06:51.470> randomly<00:06:52.040> and<00:06:52.220> also

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
cool to have them drop randomly and also

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.760 
cool to have them drop randomly and also
they<00:06:53.090> have<00:06:53.210> the<00:06:53.330> chance<00:06:53.600> to<00:06:53.690> buy<00:06:54.110> them<00:06:54.380> or<00:06:54.560> to

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
they have the chance to buy them or to

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.550 
they have the chance to buy them or to
open<00:06:55.160> a<00:06:55.220> few<00:06:55.400> crates<00:06:55.820> to<00:06:56.020> maybe<00:06:57.020> get<00:06:57.260> a<00:06:57.320> cool

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
open a few crates to maybe get a cool

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.220 
open a few crates to maybe get a cool
weapon<00:06:57.920> or<00:06:58.100> to<00:06:58.250> trade<00:06:58.730> weapons<00:06:59.210> weapons<00:07:00.140> you

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
weapon or to trade weapons weapons you

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.080 
weapon or to trade weapons weapons you
like<00:07:00.470> to<00:07:00.650> use<00:07:00.830> the<00:07:01.070> web<00:07:01.250> soup<00:07:01.430> don't<00:07:01.700> like<00:07:01.940> to

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
like to use the web soup don't like to

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.810 
like to use the web soup don't like to
use<00:07:02.120> I<00:07:02.500> like<00:07:03.500> all<00:07:03.680> those<00:07:03.800> aspects<00:07:04.310> however<00:07:04.700> I

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
use I like all those aspects however I

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.880 
use I like all those aspects however I
think<00:07:04.880> they<00:07:05.240> should<00:07:05.450> be<00:07:05.600> able<00:07:06.020> to<00:07:06.320> be<00:07:06.440> disabled

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:06.890 
think they should be able to be disabled

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.230 
think they should be able to be disabled
but<00:07:07.040> that<00:07:07.400> probably<00:07:07.730> is<00:07:08.090> the<00:07:08.240> case<00:07:08.450> and<00:07:10.240> sadly

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
but that probably is the case and sadly

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.990 
but that probably is the case and sadly
I<00:07:11.270> don't<00:07:11.450> think<00:07:11.660> the<00:07:12.080> m4<00:07:12.890> with<00:07:13.250> sinus<00:07:13.700> who<00:07:13.820> will

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
I don't think the m4 with sinus who will

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.300 
I don't think the m4 with sinus who will
be<00:07:14.150> used<00:07:14.330> in<00:07:14.480> competitive<00:07:14.960> games<00:07:15.169> but<00:07:16.100> the

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
be used in competitive games but the

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.790 
be used in competitive games but the
pistol<00:07:16.660> might<00:07:17.660> just<00:07:17.930> be<00:07:18.080> used<00:07:18.290> because<00:07:18.470> there

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
pistol might just be used because there

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.590 
pistol might just be used because there
isn't<00:07:19.160> really<00:07:19.280> a<00:07:19.460> downside<00:07:19.970> I<00:07:20.150> mean<00:07:20.300> it<00:07:20.419> has<00:07:20.570> a

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
isn't really a downside I mean it has a

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.620 
isn't really a downside I mean it has a
silencer<00:07:21.110> so<00:07:21.440> it's<00:07:21.950> a<00:07:22.130> little<00:07:22.640> bit<00:07:22.760> longer<00:07:23.090> so

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
silencer so it's a little bit longer so

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.170 
silencer so it's a little bit longer so
it<00:07:23.930> sticks<00:07:24.440> out<00:07:24.620> a<00:07:25.040> little<00:07:25.130> further<00:07:25.640> around

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180 
it sticks out a little further around

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.630 
it sticks out a little further around
the<00:07:26.300> corner<00:07:26.770> but<00:07:27.770> that's<00:07:27.950> the<00:07:28.130> only<00:07:28.250> thing<00:07:28.490> I

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
the corner but that's the only thing I

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.700 
the corner but that's the only thing I
can<00:07:28.700> think<00:07:28.850> of<00:07:29.180> and<00:07:29.390> it<00:07:29.720> has<00:07:29.900> one<00:07:30.169> Buddha<00:07:30.500> less

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
can think of and it has one Buddha less

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.960 
can think of and it has one Buddha less
which<00:07:31.520> isn't<00:07:32.000> really<00:07:32.030> a<00:07:32.270> problem<00:07:33.760> the<00:07:34.760> clip

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970 
which isn't really a problem the clip

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.180 
which isn't really a problem the clip
size<00:07:35.180> or<00:07:35.510> the<00:07:35.870> total<00:07:36.440> amount<00:07:36.500> of<00:07:36.740> bullets<00:07:37.070> is

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
size or the total amount of bullets is

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.570 
size or the total amount of bullets is
also<00:07:37.490> lower<00:07:37.760> but<00:07:38.590> with<00:07:39.590> a<00:07:39.620> pistol<00:07:40.070> you<00:07:40.220> won't

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580 
also lower but with a pistol you won't

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.450 
also lower but with a pistol you won't
run<00:07:41.270> into<00:07:41.480> a<00:07:41.720> problem<00:07:41.960> that<00:07:42.380> often<00:07:42.860> with<00:07:43.310> the

run into a problem that often with the
amount<00:07:43.610> of<00:07:43.790> bullets<00:07:44.090> you<00:07:44.210> have<00:07:44.360> so<00:07:44.870> yeah
