00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.519
 place everyone knows from all sides 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.379
 today we do not find ourselves on a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.420
 video game we find ourselves still on 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.730
 pc but we end up for a tutorial a 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.900
 pepa tutorial will run so glitch you pop 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.420
 and will go through what is this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.430
 software to download pep 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 pep are papers leaning all that swears 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.869
 a little scary kraft to make a cosplay 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 thereafter with the resin age with the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 fiberglass and all that but that 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.969
 I'll explain in another video so 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.930
 first i'm going to type on google payroll 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.629
 ape course 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.239
 ph karl mÃ¼ller 1 let's go first 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.350
 download viewer and go to the site 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.920
 here one presses on the other is not 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.260
 current viewer 3.0.4 install hours of 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.460
 megabytes me I already downloaded so 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 I will not redeliver it I will 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 go get players we will have little 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:13.229
 this is not credible players ok 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.330
 so then offered to download some of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 files to open on pulp acura because 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.020
 that it's not all alone 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.240
 there we go back on google 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.500
 and we will type for example me I am 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.189
 halo fan no longer make a cosplay to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.369
 water so what are they going to come 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.369
 and who 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.400
 and so here we all have pecs pep 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.340
 so files to download so if 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.370
 we have Malian naves bastard one or 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.760
 two to test it but if did not see the 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.870
 disaster halo dst 3 and short sisters 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.270
 we had a plan look he really 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.070
 a lot we can not do 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.840
 basically on halo we can do 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.280
 for example if we are a fan of iron man on 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.140
 can do that on fans of 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.000
 gears of war we want to do that and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.860
 if you want to delve if I want 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.420
 to pass without it is not that the problem 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.030
 so is I seen that I already have 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.910
 downloaded a good part because I 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.940
 am doing armor of du 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.110
 masterchief say it by tan 117 by 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.650
 example I 'm going to open the helmet and 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.780
 spartan 117 with the left click of the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.160
 mouse we can move to move 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.750
 in all directions with the left click 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.580
 of the mouse yet we can click on 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:38.480
 a piece and so we see it here and the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:41.480
 room that is there her here we can vassa 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.060
 pressing shift can take 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.209
 several pieces to find out which 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.380
 parts we have already done we still know 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.980
 thick it's simple so it's ok 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.380
 right click 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.540
 the right criq is for everything 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.739
 master a vice is and all that so if 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.840
 for example is like that do it a 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.269
 reset and will be like when I had it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.040
 open here it's going to be 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.959
 interesting even very interesting because 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.050
 that we will take care a little later 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.640
 here it's the 3d part here it's the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.480
 painting but there is none so we 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.800
 do not care 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.290
 tired of seeing how he will be more or 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.110
 less when it will be done 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.430
 this is the shadows personally I 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.769
 always leave the shadows my here at 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.800
 some stuff but not really useful 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.630
 there it is the printers the printer 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.830
 massa under the name that used is 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.730
 easy and that's the most important 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.870
 must click on these small numbers 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.790
 because in fact when we do not click 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.330
 on it here we are going to look 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.340
 there is nothing and when we click on it there is 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.959
 all enumerated otherwise they are associated with 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.960
 the same number actually 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.720
 let's admit here 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.750
 here I have 157 farther on another 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.190
 piece I would have 1,157 also when 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.980
 I rely on that I will impact on 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.940
 the room that here a little red net and 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.920
 if we follow the red net 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.990
 oh well we get the place where there is 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.570
 the other piece that goes with 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.500
 I 'm going to follow it's there with the 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.580
 piece that is there down 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.170
 this one so it's to help us 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.460
 and so we have to put the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.260
 numbers bottom is not really obligated 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.730
 but for that much simpler I 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.930
 advise you madam really strongly 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.000
 to put the numbers is good so so 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.760
 that was the little tutorial on pepa ran 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.950
 viewer then for some people 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.420
 it will be necessary to think of the sizes 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.520
 because when we download a toe 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.640
 so that's a fact we do not have 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.960
 necessarily the right sizes and must 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.700
 change the sizes not to change the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.070
 sizes what we're going to do is we're going 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.650
 download and pepa what designer and not 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.560
 viewer we're going to be a designer again 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:47.310
 antilles and underneath it's not for 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.310
 did not cut short to designer hockey 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.160
 dhr wait a little bit a yole 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.919
 ok so I spent the good site at worst 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:13.719
 if I can not find it I would put in 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.719
 the in the description yet to design 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.830
 good we can also download it here 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.560
 killer 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.120
 good me seen that I already downloaded I 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.439
 will open it 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.439
 everything is free 1 I tell you 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:37.210
 hockey viewer and it's amazing dr 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.350
 and so the cptaq will have designer 6 almost 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:52.320
 exactly the same as the other 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:55.170
 so here day it for example that there is 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:02.220
 informing them nice weather to open a 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:05.820
 other so here's this one this is 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.510
 the chest of caen it is called emile in 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:13.230
 halo reach I think it's safe 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.700
 and so are we going to do here 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.960
 also allow the numbers and where so 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.670
 me what I advise you these two 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.920
 open with viewer if it's not the 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.060
 good sizes you put in designer 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.200
 to change the sizes I'm going 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.840
 show right now and then you 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.720
 vaulted vault save you and then 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.190
 you go back the pec in viewer for the 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.960
 the print I get a lot simpler 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.669
 because here we know not changed good here 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.500
 at the figures because I have them 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.260
 put in viewer but sometimes he has them 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.290
 not and so you have to be careful so 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.430
 to find the right size for 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:46.160
 change the size we have to go in 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:50.100
 two of the menus in shine james paul 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.600
 scholes factor is here we can not wait 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.660
 the height 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.240
 weeds it's the width of the fc the 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.410
 depth and skol it's the ladder me 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.940
 I will not change too much because I 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.910
 will not do for now otherwise 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.360
 you change to your time and gold have made 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:09.479
 it's going to be 35 cm tall 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.800
 which you knew like that 38 cm wide 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.729
 like that and 23 cm deep and the 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.740
 depth 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:22.950
 it's going to be here so that to know that 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.390
 in designer to move the pet one has to 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.090
 do with the right click of the mouse goes 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:30.240
 left click I do not why is not it 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:33.000
 be serious it changes not sure designers 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.990
 can can customize 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.640
 leaves admit that take this 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.520
 form if I want to move her to a 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.600
 rotation of its degree and all the senses 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.710
 we want and I can move it by 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.150
 example puts it on this page of the 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.220
 put on this one it's for 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.910
 save paper suffocates a person I 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.080
 do it afterwards it's up to you to see 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.280
 there are others 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.840
 and we can make other modifications 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.310
 on the peps but I advise you 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.340
 not because it's not really 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.319
 really helpful and so that's it's a 

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.629
 little tutorial on ppac will have designer 

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:02.780
 players it was two taf taules and 

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:02.780
 each
