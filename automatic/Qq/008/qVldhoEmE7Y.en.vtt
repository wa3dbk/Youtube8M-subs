00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.460
 on this occasion of being a jelly 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.889
 transparent with fruits that I hope that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.660
 like them and the ingredients that we are going 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.490
 to occupy are the following will be a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.070
 cup and a half of water 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.010
 a large fruit cocktail can 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.220
 we are going to occupy the fruit syrup 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.130
 to my left me three cups of syrup 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.529
 and we are going to occupy a quarter cup of 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.239
 sugar and we will occupy a teaspoon 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.670
 of vanilla essence and we will occupy 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.559
 four envelopes of grenetina since I 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.329
 water rate what we are going to do is with 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.329
 add the four envelopes of grenetina 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.610
 and we are going to reserve them for a moment 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.650
 t 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.579
 let's take the fire 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.659
 the cup of water 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.659
 in sugar 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.520
 and the vanilla and let's wait until 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.720
 that melts well until it 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.850
 incorporate perfectly 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.100
 and we will wait until it is incorporated 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.290
 perfectly the sugar and it takes the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.320
 retina to the microwave of 5 in 5 seconds 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.730
 until it is liquid or we can 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 do bain-marie is about to 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.070
 boil let's add the grenetina already 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 liquid 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.830
 and we're going to incorporate the grenetine with the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.200
 water that we had in the fire what 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.280
 let's do is bring this mixture 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.280
 to the syrup 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.020
 and we are going to our good 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.970
 and we will leave it at that we will 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.190
 prepare the gelatin what we're going to 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.190
 to do is add the fruit in syrup 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.940
 and we're going to try to accommodate everything 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.940
 mold 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.580
 and once we have accommodated it to 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.770
 ours that we like the way we go 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.110
 to add the mixture we had 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.670
 reserved that is the mixture of the syrup 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.670
 with the gelatin mixture 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.190
 ah 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.290
 and we're going to bring the fruit to last 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.230
 about an hour or two so that 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.840
 is perfectly curdled well once 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.750
 that we already added the mixture we had 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.150
 of gelatin what we are going to do is 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.799
 call it refrigerate for about a 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.019
 hour or two so that it fits perfectly 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.849
 curd well past the time of in the 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.069
 that the only thing that remains 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.510
 is unmold and see how we look good 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.280
 since we unmold we are left with this 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.110
 way you see is a jelly 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.690
 transparent and you see all the fruit and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.209
 you take advantage of the syrup of the fruit in 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.370
 syrup and fruit in this way not 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.109
 waste if it's a recipe 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.640
 economic see you in the next 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.970
 tutorial that I hope is very 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.970
 soon
