of<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.320> different<00:00:31.349> strategy<00:00:31.800> regarding<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
of a different strategy regarding the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389 
of a different strategy regarding the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
tires whether that you know turns out to

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.620 
tires whether that you know turns out to
be<00:00:35.460> an<00:00:35.610> advantage<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.300> we'll<00:00:36.450> see

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
be an advantage or not we'll see

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.530 
be an advantage or not we'll see
tomorrow<00:00:36.809> but<00:00:37.430> still<00:00:38.430> even<00:00:38.670> though<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.149> start

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it's it's not a very long way to the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.549 
it's it's not a very long way to the
first<00:00:51.420> corner<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> first<00:00:52.140> two<00:00:52.350> then

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
first corner of the first two then

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.830 
first corner of the first two then
there's<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> long<00:00:53.489> straight<00:00:53.820> after<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
there's a long straight after that and a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.290 
there's a long straight after that and a
long<00:00:54.960> straight<00:00:55.289> after<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.180> could<00:00:57.180> be

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
long straight after that so could be

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.849 
long straight after that so could be
interesting<00:00:57.719> first<00:00:58.260> love<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> always

tires and you've got a nice big shiny
pile<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.040> prime<00:01:08.280> tire<00:01:08.520> sitting<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.000> yep

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
pile of prime tire sitting there yep

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.880 
pile of prime tire sitting there yep
sitting<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.590> waiting<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.100> us<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.890> see

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
sitting there waiting for us so we see

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.649 
sitting there waiting for us so we see
as<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.490> said<00:01:14.670> whether<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.119> turns<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> be

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
as I said whether that turns out to be

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.550 
as I said whether that turns out to be
an<00:01:15.810> advantage<00:01:16.670> we<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> have

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
an advantage we have to you know we have

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.039 
an advantage we have to you know we have
to<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.830> tomorrow<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:21.390> tried<00:01:21.630> something

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
to see tomorrow but we tried something

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.520 
to see tomorrow but we tried something
different<00:01:23.060> based<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> information<00:01:25.170> we

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
different based on the information we

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.320 
different based on the information we
had<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.979> morning<00:01:26.220> obviously<00:01:27.210> it's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
had this morning obviously it's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
had this morning obviously it's
difficult<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> can't<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
difficult if you if you can't have you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
difficult if you if you can't have you
know<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> practice<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.060> Friday<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
know the practice on Friday and then you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.770 
know the practice on Friday and then you
only<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:31.979> hour<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:33.420> circuit

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
only have really one hour the circuit

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.850 
only have really one hour the circuit
wasn't<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> best<00:01:34.350> shape<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
wasn't in the best shape in the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.819 
wasn't in the best shape in the
beginning<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.579> hard<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.710> know

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
beginning so hard to you know to know

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.160 
beginning so hard to you know to know
what<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.130> right<00:01:38.360> tomorrow<00:01:39.360> we'll<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:40.049> all

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
what is right tomorrow we'll we will all

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.010 
what is right tomorrow we'll we will all
know<00:01:40.380> after<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> race<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.720> think

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
know after the race but you know I think

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649 
know after the race but you know I think
we<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:44.189> good<00:01:44.340> shape<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:45.299> were<00:01:45.420> much

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
we are in a good shape we were much

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.179 
we are in a good shape we were much
closer<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> MacLaren's<00:01:46.710> than<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:46.979> thought

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
closer to the MacLaren's than we thought

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.880 
closer to the MacLaren's than we thought
in<00:01:47.399> qualifying<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:48.930> reason<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.320> be

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
in qualifying so we have reason to be

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.770 
in qualifying so we have reason to be
positive<00:01:50.100> you've<00:01:50.939> got<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> world<00:01:51.329> championship

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
positive you've got a world championship

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
positive you've got a world championship

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
with Jensen winning the last race and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.460 
with Jensen winning the last race and
Louis<00:01:54.180> getting<00:01:54.450> poor<00:01:54.659> position<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
Louis getting poor position here do you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.289 
Louis getting poor position here do you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
think that McLaren at the woman are the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.440 
think that McLaren at the woman are the
faster<00:01:57.630> car<00:01:58.430> well<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.610> always<00:01:59.850> hard<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.210> say

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
faster car well it's always hard to say

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
faster car well it's always hard to say
