decrease<00:01:51.810> pain<00:01:52.049> not<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.220> we're<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
decrease pain not that we're going to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.609 
decrease pain not that we're going to
refuse<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.119> give<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.450> pain<00:01:54.750> medicine<00:01:55.170> post-op

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
refuse to give you pain medicine post-op

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.389 
refuse to give you pain medicine post-op
but<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.520> add<00:01:56.700> these<00:01:56.969> drugs<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:58.399> studies

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
but if we add these drugs in studies

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.580 
but if we add these drugs in studies
have<00:01:59.610> shown<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.079> post-operative<00:02:01.079> needs<00:02:01.320> for

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
have shown that post-operative needs for

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.609 
have shown that post-operative needs for
narcotics<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.610> down<00:02:03.079> then<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.380> still

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
narcotics go down then you can still

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.770 
narcotics go down then you can still
have<00:02:04.860> narcotics<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> take<00:02:06.540> narcotics

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
have narcotics but if you take narcotics

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.380 
have narcotics but if you take narcotics
and<00:02:07.439> use<00:02:07.619> less<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.129> them<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.759> get<00:02:08.910> less<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and use less of them you get less of the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.370 
and use less of them you get less of the
side<00:02:09.599> effects<00:02:09.989> and

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
side effects and

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.170 
side effects and
they'll<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.680> adequate<00:02:11.010> or<00:02:11.430> excellent<00:02:11.940> pain

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
they'll get adequate or excellent pain

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.970 
they'll get adequate or excellent pain
control<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.200> three<00:02:13.410> people<00:02:13.560> we<00:02:13.770> have

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
control and the three people we have

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.810 
control and the three people we have
here<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.340> morning

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
here this morning

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.850 
here this morning
I<00:02:14.850> think<00:02:15.300> demonstrate<00:02:15.900> at<00:02:16.380> what<00:02:16.560> we're<00:02:16.710> doing

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
I think demonstrate at what we're doing

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.310 
I think demonstrate at what we're doing
is<00:02:17.220> working<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.420> way<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.720> works<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.170> we've

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
is working and the way it works is we've

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.690 
is working and the way it works is we've
added<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:20.120> two<00:02:21.120> classes<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.960> drugs<00:02:22.670> there<00:02:23.670> are

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
added in two classes of drugs there are

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.110 
added in two classes of drugs there are
spots<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> brain<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.410> drugs<00:02:25.830> can<00:02:26.160> act<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
spots in the brain that drugs can act to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.960 
spots in the brain that drugs can act to
decrease<00:02:27.570> pain<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:28.190> we're<00:02:29.190> going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.430> act<00:02:29.700> in

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
decrease pain and we're going to act in

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.040 
decrease pain and we're going to act in
those<00:02:30.180> areas<00:02:30.720> by<00:02:31.590> stimulating<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
those areas by stimulating the

three<00:03:29.120> times<00:03:29.360> I<00:03:29.480> didn't<00:03:29.720> really<00:03:29.900> do<00:03:30.020> that<00:03:30.050> just

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
three times I didn't really do that just

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.170 
three times I didn't really do that just
used<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.710> go<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.920> sleep<00:03:31.160> fast<00:03:31.460> that's<00:03:31.850> legal

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
used it to go to sleep fast that's legal

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.620 
used it to go to sleep fast that's legal
but<00:03:33.430> that's<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.700> beauty<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.090> what<00:03:35.270> we've<00:03:35.450> done

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
but that's the beauty of what we've done

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.530 
but that's the beauty of what we've done
we<00:03:35.900> have<00:03:36.140> transformed<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.070> surgery<00:03:37.610> by<00:03:38.180> using

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
we have transformed the surgery by using

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.840 
we have transformed the surgery by using
these<00:03:38.930> opioid<00:03:39.530> sparing<00:03:40.100> techniques<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.820> are

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
these opioid sparing techniques that are

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.090 
these opioid sparing techniques that are
a<00:03:41.120> really<00:03:41.510> hot<00:03:41.690> new<00:03:41.840> area<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.140> research<00:03:42.500> we've

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
a really hot new area of research we've

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.040 
a really hot new area of research we've
been<00:03:43.220> able<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.490> control<00:03:44.000> pain<00:03:44.270> have<00:03:44.720> people

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
been able to control pain have people

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.690 
been able to control pain have people
feel<00:03:45.230> comfortable<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.920> confident<00:03:46.340> they've

and we are focused on pain we don't want
you<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.250> have<00:04:04.430> pain<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.120> laparoscopic

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
you to have pain the laparoscopic

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.690 
you to have pain the laparoscopic
techniques<00:04:06.350> helped<00:04:06.710> you<00:04:06.770> avoid<00:04:06.890> pain<00:04:07.370> and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
techniques helped you avoid pain and

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.720 
techniques helped you avoid pain and
then<00:04:08.120> on<00:04:08.210> top<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.630> we<00:04:08.930> use<00:04:09.080> these<00:04:09.320> new

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
then on top of that we use these new

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.370 
then on top of that we use these new
opioid<00:04:10.730> sparing<00:04:11.210> techniques<00:04:11.660> affecting<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
opioid sparing techniques affecting the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.260 
opioid sparing techniques affecting the
two<00:04:12.560> areas<00:04:12.770> of<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.100> brain<00:04:13.250> that<00:04:13.640> are<00:04:13.970> pain

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
two areas of the brain that are pain

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.210 
two areas of the brain that are pain
relievers<00:04:14.840> without<00:04:15.530> using<00:04:15.920> narcotics<00:04:18.220> we're

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
relievers without using narcotics we're

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.330 
relievers without using narcotics we're
good<00:04:19.900> yeah<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.080> think<00:04:21.200> it's<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.620> really<00:04:21.830> neat<00:04:22.100> new

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
good yeah I think it's a really neat new

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.150 
good yeah I think it's a really neat new
area<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:23.030> we<00:04:23.840> actually<00:04:24.260> just<00:04:24.410> started<00:04:25.040> this

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
area and we actually just started this

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.400 
area and we actually just started this
new<00:04:25.400> technique<00:04:25.730> about<00:04:25.880> six<00:04:26.240> months<00:04:26.510> ago<00:04:26.630> and

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
new technique about six months ago and

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.080 
new technique about six months ago and
what<00:04:27.590> we<00:04:27.710> used<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.130> see<00:04:28.310> is<00:04:28.460> something<00:04:28.940> like

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
what we used to see is something like

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.430 
what we used to see is something like
this<00:04:29.920> prior<00:04:30.920> to<00:04:30.950> using<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.910> new<00:04:32.120> NMDA<00:04:32.990> and

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
this prior to using the new NMDA and

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.500 
this prior to using the new NMDA and
alpha<00:04:33.740> 2<00:04:33.920> receptor<00:04:34.640> blockers<00:04:37.390> patients<00:04:38.390> when

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
alpha 2 receptor blockers patients when

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.600 
alpha 2 receptor blockers patients when
we<00:04:38.600> ask<00:04:38.810> them<00:04:39.050> post-op<00:04:39.650> would<00:04:39.919> have<00:04:40.130> some<00:04:40.340> pain

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
we ask them post-op would have some pain

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.580 
we ask them post-op would have some pain
two-three-four<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.750> they<00:04:42.110> would<00:04:42.260> have<00:04:42.380> had

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
two-three-four and they would have had

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.730 
two-three-four and they would have had
three<00:04:43.580> four<00:04:43.970> five<00:04:44.419> or<00:04:44.750> six<00:04:44.990> doses<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.590> pain

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
three four five or six doses of pain

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.690 
three four five or six doses of pain

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
pain medicine in a week now we're seeing

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.870 
pain medicine in a week now we're seeing
out<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:00.530> every<00:05:00.740> ten<00:05:00.950> people<00:05:00.980> will<00:05:01.490> get<00:05:01.669> two

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
out of every ten people will get two

out of every ten people will get two
doses<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.520> huge<00:05:04.910> difference<00:05:05.360> with<00:05:05.510> this<00:05:05.720> new

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.300 
use of the NMDA receptor and the Alpha 2
receptors<00:05:09.740> in<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.919> brain<00:05:11.410> plus<00:05:12.410> those<00:05:12.860> drugs

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
receptors in the brain plus those drugs

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.890 
receptors in the brain plus those drugs
that<00:05:13.640> I'm<00:05:13.760> talking<00:05:14.090> about<00:05:14.150> that<00:05:14.510> do<00:05:14.660> such<00:05:14.870> a

that I'm talking about that do such a
good<00:05:15.110> job<00:05:15.169> in<00:05:15.440> opioid<00:05:15.710> sparing<00:05:16.250> also<00:05:16.910> made

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
good job in opioid sparing also made

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.210 
good job in opioid sparing also made
Michaels<00:05:17.720> intubation<00:05:18.169> yesterday<00:05:18.800> goes<00:05:18.980> so

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
Michaels intubation yesterday goes so

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.940
