00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.330 
your engine and the drivetrain that the
engine<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.129> attached<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.900> your<00:04:00.310> drive<00:04:01.310> shaft

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
engine is attached to your drive shaft

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.069 
engine is attached to your drive shaft

and the the drive wheels and whatnot the

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.330 
and the the drive wheels and whatnot the
stronger<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.980> field<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:09.290> more<00:04:09.500> drag<00:04:09.949> the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
stronger that field is the more drag the

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.849 
stronger that field is the more drag the
alternator<00:04:10.819> has<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:12.079> heart<00:04:12.349> of<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.560> engine

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
alternator has the heart of the engine

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.470 
alternator has the heart of the engine
has<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.190> work<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.699> the<00:04:13.819> more<00:04:13.940> fuel<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.449> is

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
has to work and the more fuel it is

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.740 
has to work and the more fuel it is
consume<00:04:15.789> so<00:04:17.590> this<00:04:18.590> idea<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:19.639> you<00:04:20.390> have<00:04:20.419> an

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
consume so this idea is you have an

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.350 
consume so this idea is you have an
alternator<00:04:21.079> that<00:04:21.349> has<00:04:21.829> more<00:04:22.400> than<00:04:22.460> one<00:04:22.729> field

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
alternator that has more than one field

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.500 
alternator that has more than one field
winding

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
winding

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.020 
winding
and<00:04:24.600> then<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.110> very<00:04:25.650> how<00:04:26.010> strong<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.490> field

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
and then you very how strong that field

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.580 
and then you very how strong that field
winding<00:04:27.480> is<00:04:28.100> with<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.130> controller<00:04:29.730> system<00:04:30.590> with

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
winding is with a controller system with

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.310 
winding is with a controller system with
a<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.160> strong<00:04:32.550> field<00:04:33.330> winding<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:34.080> get<00:04:34.290> a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
a very strong field winding you get a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.070 
a very strong field winding you get a
whole<00:04:34.800> lot<00:04:35.010> more<00:04:35.250> drag<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:36.240> your<00:04:36.270> engine<00:04:36.840> and

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
whole lot more drag on your engine and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.630 
whole lot more drag on your engine and
the<00:04:37.230> engine<00:04:38.900> slows<00:04:39.900> down<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.710> drivetrain<00:04:41.250> and

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
the engine slows down the drivetrain and

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.500 
the engine slows down the drivetrain and
the<00:04:41.730> vehicle<00:04:42.320> is<00:04:43.320> harder<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.510> push<00:04:45.620> or<00:04:46.620> pull

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
the vehicle is harder to push or pull

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.100 
the vehicle is harder to push or pull
but<00:04:48.510> if<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:48.720> have<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:49.340> smaller<00:04:50.340> field<00:04:51.120> or<00:04:51.660> up<00:04:51.900> on

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
but if you have a smaller field or up on

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.840 
but if you have a smaller field or up on
your<00:04:52.380> alternator<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:54.300> have<00:04:54.480> less<00:04:54.810> drag<00:04:55.290> again

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
your alternator you have less drag again

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.220 
your alternator you have less drag again
and<00:04:56.850> that's<00:04:57.060> where<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.570> beauty<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:58.110> the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
and that's where the beauty of the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.870 
and that's where the beauty of the
system<00:04:58.590> comes<00:04:58.830> in<00:04:59.010> you<00:04:59.160> have<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.340> controller

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
system comes in you have a controller

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.380 
system comes in you have a controller
that<00:05:00.870> controller<00:05:01.380> is<00:05:01.830> wired<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.460> your<00:05:02.970> brake

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
that controller is wired to your brake

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.350 
that controller is wired to your brake
lights<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.350> it<00:05:04.980> is<00:05:05.100> also<00:05:05.310> wired<00:05:05.760> to<00:05:06.120> your

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
lights and it is also wired to your

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.980 
lights and it is also wired to your
accelerator<00:05:07.230> pedal<00:05:08.480> so<00:05:09.480> when<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.840> are

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
accelerator pedal so when you are

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.160 
accelerator pedal so when you are
accelerating<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:11.730> want<00:05:11.940> less<00:05:12.270> drag<00:05:12.750> on<00:05:13.050> the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
accelerating you want less drag on the

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.250 
accelerating you want less drag on the
engine<00:05:13.470> so<00:05:13.890> you<00:05:14.070> have<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.060> very<00:05:15.660> light<00:05:16.310> field

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
engine so you have a very light field

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.380 
engine so you have a very light field
electromagnetic<00:05:19.260> field<00:05:19.620> on<00:05:19.860> your<00:05:19.980> alternator

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
electromagnetic field on your alternator

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.450 
electromagnetic field on your alternator
so<00:05:21.390> you<00:05:21.510> don't<00:05:21.660> get<00:05:21.810> as<00:05:22.020> much<00:05:22.200> drag<00:05:22.530> when

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
so you don't get as much drag when

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.660 
so you don't get as much drag when
you're<00:05:23.640> braking<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.660> want<00:05:25.500> a<00:05:25.740> very<00:05:26.040> strong

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
you're braking you want a very strong

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.140 
you're braking you want a very strong
field<00:05:27.300> on<00:05:27.900> your<00:05:28.290> alternator<00:05:28.890> so<00:05:29.700> that<00:05:29.910> the

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
field on your alternator so that the

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.580 
field on your alternator so that the
anthon<00:05:31.520> has<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.670> work<00:05:32.850> harder<00:05:33.360> and<00:05:34.350> since

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
anthon has to work harder and since

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.790 
anthon has to work harder and since
you're<00:05:34.740> not<00:05:34.860> accelerating<00:05:35.700> that<00:05:36.450> engine<00:05:36.960> will

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
you're not accelerating that engine will

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.260 
you're not accelerating that engine will
slow<00:05:38.250> down<00:05:39.110> rpm<00:05:40.110> will<00:05:41.330> decrease<00:05:42.380> because<00:05:43.380> the

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
slow down rpm will decrease because the

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.390 
slow down rpm will decrease because the
drive<00:05:45.270> system<00:05:45.740> with<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.890> test<00:05:47.130> of<00:05:47.310> the

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
drive system with the test of the

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.480 
drive system with the test of the
vehicle's<00:05:47.910> engine<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.630> course<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:50.280> get

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
vehicle's engine of course and you get

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.290 
vehicle's engine of course and you get
its<00:05:50.670> enormous<00:05:51.180> drag<00:05:51.630> when<00:05:52.530> you<00:05:52.620> have<00:05:52.740> a<00:05:52.770> huge

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
its enormous drag when you have a huge

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.220 
its enormous drag when you have a huge
electromagnetic<00:05:54.300> field<00:05:54.570> in<00:05:54.720> your<00:05:54.810> alternator

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
electromagnetic field in your alternator

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.860 
electromagnetic field in your alternator
that<00:05:55.470> is<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:56.240> idea<00:05:57.240> here<00:05:58.100> so<00:05:59.870> essentially

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
that is the idea here so essentially

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.340 
that is the idea here so essentially
instead<00:06:01.110> of<00:06:01.500> having<00:06:01.830> a<00:06:02.480> standard<00:06:03.480> braking

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
instead of having a standard braking

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.540 
instead of having a standard braking
system<00:06:05.450> you<00:06:06.450> have<00:06:06.720> let<00:06:07.440> this<00:06:07.590> clown<00:06:07.890> calls<00:06:08.250> a

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
system you have let this clown calls a

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.570 
system you have let this clown calls a
fifth<00:06:09.000> brake<00:06:09.570> and<00:06:10.290> that<00:06:10.440> this<00:06:10.770> brake<00:06:11.250> is<00:06:11.460> the

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
fifth brake and that this brake is the

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.710 
fifth brake and that this brake is the
alternator<00:06:13.340> how<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:14.670> saves<00:06:15.120> fuel<00:06:17.570> beats<00:06:18.570> the

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
alternator how this saves fuel beats the

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.530 
alternator how this saves fuel beats the
 out<00:06:19.140> of<00:06:19.170> me<00:06:19.470> how<00:06:20.370> this<00:06:20.610> converts<00:06:21.330> the

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
 out of me how this converts the

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.470 
 out of me how this converts the
vehicle<00:06:21.900> into<00:06:22.170> a<00:06:22.350> hybrid<00:06:24.930> if<00:06:25.140> I<00:06:25.260> can<00:06:25.500> tell

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
vehicle into a hybrid if I can tell

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.380 
vehicle into a hybrid if I can tell
but<00:06:27.480> it<00:06:27.660> only<00:06:27.780> cost<00:06:28.080> you<00:06:28.230> $2,000<00:06:29.160> so<00:06:29.520> hey<00:06:29.730> I

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
but it only cost you $2,000 so hey I

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.190 
but it only cost you $2,000 so hey I
think<00:06:30.780> that's<00:06:31.050> a<00:06:31.370> you<00:06:32.370> know<00:06:32.480> damn<00:06:33.480> great<00:06:33.780> idea

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
think that's a you know damn great idea

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.280 
think that's a you know damn great idea

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
while pain has the fuel prices we

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.410 
while pain has the fuel prices we
guarantee<00:06:46.200> it<00:06:46.380> unquote<00:06:46.890> so<00:06:47.850> hey<00:06:48.030> it's

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420
