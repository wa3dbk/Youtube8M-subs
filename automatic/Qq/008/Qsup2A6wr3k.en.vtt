00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139 
I am not actually going to put my card

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:48.929 
I am not actually going to put my card
because<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.529> do<00:01:47.859> need<00:01:48.219> the<00:01:48.399> pictures<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.759> are

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
because I do need the pictures that are

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.419 
because I do need the pictures that are
on<00:01:49.029> this<00:01:49.240> card<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:50.409> next<00:01:50.709> option<00:01:51.039> here<00:01:51.069> is<00:01:51.399> the

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
on this card the next option here is the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.639 
on this card the next option here is the
file<00:01:51.819> numbering<00:01:52.270> system<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.840> this<00:01:53.170> actually

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
file numbering system and this actually

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.349 
file numbering system and this actually
lets<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.069> choose<00:01:54.340> between<00:01:54.549> whether<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.149> want

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
lets you choose between whether you want

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:59.609 
lets you choose between whether you want
it<00:01:55.389> to<00:01:55.740> continuously<00:01:57.810> number<00:01:58.810> your<00:01:59.289> pictures

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
it to continuously number your pictures

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.339 
it to continuously number your pictures
so<00:01:59.889> if<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:00.639> shoot<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.329> thousand<00:02:01.869> pictures<00:02:02.200> with

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
so if you shoot a thousand pictures with

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.139 
so if you shoot a thousand pictures with
this<00:02:02.499> camera<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:03.099> will<00:02:03.219> actually<00:02:03.669> number<00:02:03.999> them

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
this camera it will actually number them

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.649 
this camera it will actually number them
one<00:02:05.109> through<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.349> thousand<00:02:05.969> even<00:02:06.969> if<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.359> stop

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
one through a thousand even if you stop

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.630 
one through a thousand even if you stop
and<00:02:07.899> you<00:02:07.929> take<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.289> card<00:02:08.530> out<00:02:08.679> in<00:02:08.800> your<00:02:08.890> erase

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
and you take the card out in your erase

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.520 
and you take the card out in your erase
the<00:02:09.880> card<00:02:10.209> or<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.479> change<00:02:10.780> cards<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.349> will

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
the card or you change cards it will

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.940 
the card or you change cards it will
continue<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:13.239> number<00:02:13.540> those<00:02:13.950> sequentially

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
continue to to number those sequentially

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.520 
continue to to number those sequentially
the<00:02:15.640> next<00:02:15.970> option<00:02:16.269> will<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.510> an<00:02:16.599> auto<00:02:16.780> reset

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
the next option will be an auto reset

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.770 
the next option will be an auto reset
you<00:02:17.680> can<00:02:17.920> let<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.550> reset<00:02:18.940> every<00:02:19.240> time<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.630> you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
you can let it reset every time that you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.170 
you can let it reset every time that you
you<00:02:20.650> clear<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.040> card<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.730> will<00:02:21.819> set<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
you clear the card and it will set it

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.870 
you clear the card and it will set it
back<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.330> one<00:02:22.690> on<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.380> counter<00:02:23.709> now<00:02:23.920> whenever

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
back to one on the counter now whenever

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.250 
back to one on the counter now whenever
you<00:02:25.150> do<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.420> if<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.690> do<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:25.870> with<00:02:26.110> your

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
you do this if you do this with your

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.860 
you do this if you do this with your
camera<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.650> you've<00:02:27.010> got<00:02:27.220> pictures<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:28.540> are

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
camera and you've got pictures that are

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.720 
camera and you've got pictures that are
from<00:02:29.380> different<00:02:29.530> events<00:02:30.100> but<00:02:30.130> they<00:02:30.370> have<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
from different events but they have the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.190 
from different events but they have the
same<00:02:30.910> numbers<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:31.630> whenever<00:02:31.810> you're<00:02:31.990> going

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
same numbers then whenever you're going

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.690 
same numbers then whenever you're going
through<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.680> editing<00:02:33.040> your<00:02:33.160> pictures<00:02:33.459> later

you may end up saving over the ones that
you've<00:02:36.670> already<00:02:36.880> saved<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:38.050> can<00:02:38.350> be

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
you've already saved and that can be

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.840 
you've already saved and that can be
dangerous<00:02:38.890> especially<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.400> want<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.640> keep

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850

all of your pictures so I usually leave
them<00:02:42.370> out<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.459> continuous<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.239> there's<00:02:43.630> also

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
them out on continuous but there's also

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.260 
them out on continuous but there's also
the<00:02:44.050> manual<00:02:44.290> reset<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.010> if<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.489> take<00:02:46.120> this

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
the manual reset so if you take this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.750 
the manual reset so if you take this
card<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:47.560> want<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.190> go<00:02:48.280> ahead<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.640> do

that<00:02:48.790> manual<00:02:49.330> reset<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.080> do<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.380> as

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
that manual reset you can do that as

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.380 
that manual reset you can do that as
well<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.070> I'm<00:02:51.880> going<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.060> leave<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.209> on
