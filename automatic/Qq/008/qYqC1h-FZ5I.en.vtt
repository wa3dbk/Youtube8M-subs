basically it's like a bar and a place to

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.070 
basically it's like a bar and a place to
eat<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.630> it<00:00:18.630> also<00:00:18.869> has<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.680> building<00:00:20.310> for

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
guests to sleep in this is kind of an

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.769 
guests to sleep in this is kind of an
awkward<00:00:25.920> spot<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.480> kind<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> thinking

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
awkward spot I was just kind of thinking

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.300 
awkward spot I was just kind of thinking
about<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.650> thinking<00:00:28.949> about<00:00:29.130> using

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
about it but I'm thinking about using

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.280 
about it but I'm thinking about using
more<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.390> than<00:00:31.160> this<00:00:33.020> I'll<00:00:34.020> take

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
more of this than this I'll take

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.569 
more of this than this I'll take
something<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.070> little<00:00:35.250> spot

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
something to do with that little spot

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.799 
something to do with that little spot
but<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:36.030> more<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.690> think<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.380> Jesus<00:00:37.649> so

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
but I'm more I think I'm really Jesus so

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.560 
but I'm more I think I'm really Jesus so
first<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:40.649> my<00:00:41.219> plans<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:41.940> building<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
first my my plans for this building is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.180 
first my my plans for this building is
to<00:00:43.559> actually<00:00:43.829> make<00:00:44.340> two<00:00:44.789> buildings<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.539> then

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
to actually make two buildings and then

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.080 
to actually make two buildings and then
go<00:00:47.190> from<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:48.860> what<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> mean<00:00:50.100> by<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
go from there what I mean by that is to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.510 
go from there what I mean by that is to
actually<00:00:51.570> make<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
actually make like I don't know like the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.680 
actually make like I don't know like the
bar<00:00:53.730> first<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.520> whenever<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.510> have

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
bar first and and then whenever I have

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.680 
bar first and and then whenever I have
that<00:00:57.930> built<00:00:58.280> then<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.640> start<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.449> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that built then I can start with the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
that built then I can start with the
sleeping<00:01:01.320> area<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:03.650> it<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.189> helps

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
sleeping area and it just kind of helps

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.000 
sleeping area and it just kind of helps
me<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.850> separate<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.720> way<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.170> also<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
me like separate it in a way and also it

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.500 
me like separate it in a way and also it
actually<00:01:08.570> is<00:01:09.770> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.890> cool<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.970> kind<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
actually is kind of cool like to kind of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.469 
actually is kind of cool like to kind of
fit<00:01:13.260> everything<00:01:14.100> together<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.030> it's

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
fit everything together it's like it's

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.690 
fit everything together it's like it's
kind<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> puzzle<00:01:16.110> really<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
kind of like a puzzle really it's a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.660 
kind of like a puzzle really it's a
little<00:01:17.759> difficult<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.220> actually<00:01:20.220> do

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
little difficult but I do actually do

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
little difficult but I do actually do
this<00:01:20.790> sometimes<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.450> buildings<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.280> kind<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this sometimes with buildings I kind of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.210 
this sometimes with buildings I kind of
just<00:01:23.520> fit<00:01:23.820> everything<00:01:24.119> together<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.100> if<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
just fit everything together so if you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.670 
just fit everything together so if you
haven't<00:01:26.400> watched<00:01:26.520> my<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.880> boats<00:01:27.000> before

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
haven't watched my little boats before

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.469 
haven't watched my little boats before
this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.979> my<00:01:29.340> own<00:01:29.460> little<00:01:29.520> design<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this is just my own little design that

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.090 
this is just my own little design that
thought<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:31.460> not<00:01:32.460> too<00:01:32.670> long<00:01:33.060> ago<00:01:34.100> basically

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
thought of not too long ago basically

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.850 
thought of not too long ago basically
it's<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.430> randomized<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.860> symmetrical

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it's all randomized it's not symmetrical

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.819 
it's all randomized it's not symmetrical
in<00:01:38.009> any<00:01:38.189> way<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> connect<00:01:43.590> this

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
in any way so I'm about to connect this

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.580 
in any way so I'm about to connect this
I<00:01:44.070> don't<00:01:44.130> want<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.610> T<00:01:44.790> huge<00:01:45.290> because<00:01:46.290> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
I don't want to be T huge because this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.420 
I don't want to be T huge because this
design<00:01:47.100> tends<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:49.200> large<00:01:49.740> at

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
design tends to get a little large at

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.330 
design tends to get a little large at
times<00:01:52.430> ok<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.590> let's<00:01:55.590> say<00:01:55.740> that's<00:01:55.890> my<00:01:56.100> life

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
times ok so let's say that's my life

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.480 
times ok so let's say that's my life
little<00:01:56.640> bar<00:01:56.969> area<00:01:57.270> ok<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.979> voice<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> little

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
little bar area ok my voice is a little

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.990 
little bar area ok my voice is a little
low<00:01:59.850> right<00:02:00.060> now<00:02:01.969> fill<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.390> walls<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.880> our

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
low right now fill in the walls and our

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.980 
low right now fill in the walls and our
window

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
window

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.480 
window
and<00:02:11.990> then<00:02:12.650> once<00:02:13.520> we<00:02:13.670> have<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:14.240> completed<00:02:15.490> we

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
and then once we have this completed we

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.290 
and then once we have this completed we
can<00:02:16.670> actually<00:02:16.819> start<00:02:17.420> with<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.590> actual<00:02:19.300> like

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
can actually start with the actual like

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.270 
can actually start with the actual like
sleeping<00:02:20.810> building<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.010> soup<00:02:22.190> and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
sleeping building on the soup and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.480 
sleeping building on the soup and
building<00:02:22.580> will<00:02:22.700> be<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:23.360> two<00:02:24.050> storey<00:02:24.490> this

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
building will be a two storey this

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.180 
building will be a two storey this
actual<00:02:26.450> like<00:02:26.900> bar<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.530> going<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.070> be<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
actual like bar is going to be a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.050 
actual like bar is going to be a
one-story<00:02:29.000> I'll<00:02:29.959> probably<00:02:30.440> actually<00:02:31.010> make<00:02:31.730> a
