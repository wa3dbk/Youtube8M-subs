00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.550
 no 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.550
 no 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.580
 m 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.010
 yacht is that today we are 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.050
 find for a small video a 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.510
 new hall breach on gta 5 yahoo 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 should chase the peaks actually 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.770
 since it will allow you to enter 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.070
 the building there is so there we see the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.989
 building there is on the map in fact so 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.309
 know that this is not the preaching that I 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.100
 found myself it's a maul breach 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.870
 that I found on an English channel 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.309
 frozen again so that's me playing 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.330
 in fact but I order after all 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.900
 simply because he is not very 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.760
 simple to do 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.430
 so you have to go to the place 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.010
 indicated and there in fact I'm going to stop 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.989
 in front of windows so in the middle 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 of your screen there you have to see four 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.930
 windows a little different from the others 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.370
 in fact in his tears to power to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.519
 through while others do not 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.470
 really so then you retreat with 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.700
 your helicopter your plane or what 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.860
 whether it is if you have a plane you 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 can also throw you from the top but 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.130
 I warn you it's going to be pretty 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.940
 complicated so you jump in parachute 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 and you have to go on that fact 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.070
 to be born precisely so I advise you 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.230
 to keep guys check for 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.550
 power of the idle idle 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.040
 like that and go much more 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.110
 easily I also did that in 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.370
 pulling on windows to break them 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230
 but I'm not sure whether it's 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.730
 necessary 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.090
 however I advise you to do it 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.250
 before you go in and if you come with 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 the angle bo you should fall as 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.680
 me in the video so the four 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.440
 windows are are possible to do this 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.670
 glitch longages see it I did not break 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.350
 the windows and yet I'm not so 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.150
 anyway so I do not know if it's 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.220
 totally necessary and there you see 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.070
 in fact that you go into the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.360
 room in which the mexican was in 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.490
 getting tortured so that's 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 for if he had played the story I 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.119
 guess you played the story there 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.590
 is a mission you have to go out a 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.300
 mexican who is doing himself 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.560
 to torture precisely of this building is in 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.330
 does this part there normally we do not 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.159
 can not access it but by doing this 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.110
 technique is feasible then as 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.330
 I said at the beginning of the video it's a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.160
 english or an anglophone anyway who 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.930
 found this technique on the breach 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.460
 know that I am in control of his chain in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.630
 the inscription of the least the string on 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:39.630
 which I found them and that I do not 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.660
 will absolutely not make this glitch but 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.490
 So here is the video only a little more 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.560
 of 4000 view so I told myself in the 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.850
 putting on that jack and do that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.020
 to make this guide known 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.480
 more people and more 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.800
 choose more interesting in fact white 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.000
 you see I'm walking a little upstairs 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 he are not many pieces 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.400
 but you can go pretty much 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.410
 all over 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.850
 so there are two three doors you can 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.190
 open as I did the elevators on 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.640
 can not and you will see by the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.020
 after 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.520
 so I'm going to do after a little 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.650
 accelerated you will see later in 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.709
 fact that I take great job and 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.000
 I will cross the ceiling in fact the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.500
 ceiling is not solid 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.650
 you can crossings if you 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.790
 take the great job know also 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.209
 something important is that this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.850
 glitch is feasible online actually 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.530
 by the way, the guy who found him 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.080
 show online but I do not have 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.670
 of helicopter so I could not do it but 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.620
 but that's it if you want to do it 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.510
 have one to mess with what you're taking 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.290
 your helicopter and visual and there is 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.250
 no problem is feasible 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.050
 so that's it then I'm going to you 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.650
 leave with a little passage in 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.350
 accelerated and and so you will see 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.209
 also that I cross the ceiling and that 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.220
 I also deduced that there was 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.540
 probably way to fall to the center 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.959
 of the building if you go through the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.730
 ceiling but but I have not really 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.060
 tried and I'm not even sure there is 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.430
 a solid floor at the bottom of the building 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.550
 so here I leave you with this little 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.380
 accelerated and well I tell you to the 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.400
 next a big thank you to the friend jack and 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.000
 fr if he takes me and so here is hi 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.000
 bye
