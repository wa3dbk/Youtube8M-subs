get<00:01:33.360> weeds<00:01:33.599> like<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.759> yeah<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.539> as

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
get weeds like this and yeah as much as

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.779 
get weeds like this and yeah as much as
we<00:01:36.810> tried<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.080> keep<00:01:37.200> weeds<00:01:37.440> down<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:38.459> really

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
we tried to keep weeds down it's really

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.460 
we tried to keep weeds down it's really
hard<00:01:39.000> especially<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.810> size<00:01:40.050> of<00:01:40.200> garden

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
hard especially with this size of garden

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.749 
hard especially with this size of garden
there's<00:01:40.649> always<00:01:40.920> weed<00:01:41.099> seeds<00:01:41.340> blowing<00:01:41.670> around

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
there's always weed seeds blowing around

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.449 
there's always weed seeds blowing around
and<00:01:42.149> so<00:01:42.720> you'd<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:43.020> weeds<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.800> that<00:01:44.039> and

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
and so you'd get weeds like that and

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.630 
and so you'd get weeds like that and
weeds<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:47.009> seems<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.280> picker

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
weeds like that and it seems like picker

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.359 
weeds like that and it seems like picker
but<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.690> Pickers<00:01:49.020> were<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> most<00:01:49.890> common

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
but the the Pickers were the most common

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.270 
but the the Pickers were the most common
type<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.550> weed<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.910> come<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:52.800> know<00:01:52.890> it's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
type of weed to come up you know it's

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.770 
type of weed to come up you know it's
just<00:01:53.429> some<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.149> those<00:01:54.239> things<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> can't

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
just some of those things you can't

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.260 
just some of those things you can't
really<00:01:54.989> you<00:01:55.920> can't<00:01:56.099> really<00:01:56.160> stop<00:01:56.580> being<00:01:57.119> out

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.889 
really you can't really stop being out
in<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.599> country<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.410> this<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.880> hard<00:02:00.090> but

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
in the country like this it's hard but

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.490 
in the country like this it's hard but
um<00:02:01.200> yeah<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.830> then<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.220> also<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.789> the<00:02:03.500> tons

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
um yeah and then you also have the tons

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.850 
um yeah and then you also have the tons
of<00:02:04.890> tomatoes<00:02:05.160> that<00:02:05.840> still<00:02:07.220> were<00:02:08.479> never

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
of tomatoes that still were never

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.900 
of tomatoes that still were never
ripened<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.009> they<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.340> kind<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> fell<00:02:11.879> off

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
ripened and they just kind of fell off

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.630 
ripened and they just kind of fell off
the<00:02:12.180> vine<00:02:12.800> we've<00:02:13.800> been<00:02:13.920> hoping<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.400> some<00:02:14.550> of

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
the vine we've been hoping that some of

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.770 
the vine we've been hoping that some of
the<00:02:14.700> animals<00:02:14.849> would<00:02:15.060> come<00:02:15.270> by<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.450> kind<00:02:15.720> of

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the animals would come by and kind of

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.479 
the animals would come by and kind of
pick<00:02:15.989> them<00:02:16.110> up<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.319> little<00:02:16.349> bit<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.370> would

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
pick them up a little bit so we would

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.450 
pick them up a little bit so we would
have<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:17.879> much<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.840> pick<00:02:19.020> up<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.380> walking<00:02:20.190> back

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
have so much to pick up but walking back

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.040 
have so much to pick up but walking back
here<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.920> actually

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
here is actually

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.949 
here is actually
the<00:02:25.050> probably<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.580> biggest<00:02:27.120> compost<00:02:27.750> pile

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
the probably the biggest compost pile

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.670 
the probably the biggest compost pile
I've<00:02:28.260> ever<00:02:28.620> made<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.380> large

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
I've ever made and this is like a large

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.350 
I've ever made and this is like a large
scale<00:02:32.040> version<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.580> what<00:02:32.700> i<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.030> my<00:02:33.120> house

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
scale version of what i have in my house

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.780 
scale version of what i have in my house
so<00:02:34.020> we<00:02:34.140> had<00:02:34.319> some<00:02:34.500> crazy<00:02:34.800> strong<00:02:35.340> winds<00:02:35.550> come

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
so we had some crazy strong winds come

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.220 
so we had some crazy strong winds come
in<00:02:35.910> during<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.800> hurricane<00:02:37.800> sandy<00:02:39.050> we<00:02:40.050> had

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
in during the hurricane sandy we had

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.559 
in during the hurricane sandy we had
probably<00:02:41.040> 60<00:02:41.910> 70<00:02:42.270> mile<00:02:42.390> an<00:02:42.420> hour<00:02:42.600> winds<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.310> it

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
probably 60 70 mile an hour winds and it

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.350 
probably 60 70 mile an hour winds and it
it<00:02:45.569> blew<00:02:45.840> down<00:02:46.020> part<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.500> this<00:02:46.620> fence<00:02:47.360> it

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
it blew down part of this fence it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.330 
it blew down part of this fence it
ripped<00:02:49.170> open<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:50.130> hole<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.239> fence<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:53.100> so

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
ripped open a hole in this fence and so

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.460 
ripped open a hole in this fence and so
next<00:02:53.580> year<00:02:53.790> when<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.209> we<00:02:54.930> do<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.200> we're<00:02:55.380> going

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
next year when we we do this we're going

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.310 
next year when we we do this we're going
to<00:02:55.880> we're<00:02:56.880> going<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.390> tip<00:02:57.959> all<00:02:58.140> these

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
to we're going to have to tip all these

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.180 
to we're going to have to tip all these
back<00:02:58.820> because<00:02:59.820> as<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.209> see<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:01.190> this

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
back because as you can see this this

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.259 
back because as you can see this this
fence<00:03:02.519> line<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.350> completely<00:03:04.350> broken<00:03:05.269> and

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
fence line is completely broken and

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.710 
fence line is completely broken and
that's<00:03:06.450> just<00:03:06.690> simply<00:03:06.989> because<00:03:08.420> we<00:03:09.420> had<00:03:09.569> some

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
that's just simply because we had some

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
that's just simply because we had some
crazy<00:03:10.019> crazy<00:03:10.500> strong<00:03:10.739> winds<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.160> we're<00:03:11.340> going

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
crazy crazy strong winds so we're going

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.240 
crazy crazy strong winds so we're going
to<00:03:11.550> have<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.840> fix<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.800> next<00:03:14.010> year

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
to have to fix that and for next year

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.780 
to have to fix that and for next year
and<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:16.350> then<00:03:16.860> we're<00:03:16.950> gonna<00:03:17.040> get<00:03:17.519> all<00:03:17.640> this
