00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.970
 good very good today I will explain 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:10.100
 well, a small function that leads to 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.100
 camera are the typical functions are 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.990
 obviously, they all come 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.920
 what is the shutter speed what 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.830
 good shutter is the time in the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.200
 that the mirror is raised and makes 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.720
 between the light and the speed of 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.789
 shutter is slower is to say this 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.789
 more I got ahead of the mirror and arrived at 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.870
 this lifted a mirror time 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.070
 so that they arrive more during more time 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.980
 crosses the sensor therefore with 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.129
 we will obtain in photographs where the light 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.769
 be low or scarce we can compensate that 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.540
 lack of brightness with time 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.909
 You can use the camera to get more 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.909
 health information for doing it 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.100
 the range in this camera goes from him 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.559
 30 seconds 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 up to him 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.050
 it would be this 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.119
 30 seconds 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.119
 until the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.119
 one 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.869
 1 402 forgave 4,000 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.740
 is the fastest prayer is the least 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 how long will you be able to have your camera 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.450
 with the mirror with the fermented mirror 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 This is of 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.360
 usually it usually 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.460
 usually carry it out be alone 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.780
 and handle it better the camera than us 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.120
 same because we never know exactly 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.860
 at what speed should we put it 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.170
 depending on the luminosity 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.090
 then clear what we have to do 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.090
 I personally 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.900
 to learn, you will get what 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.390
 you put the manual and you go playing with 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.720
 different situations of light that you see 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.910
 playing with shutter speed 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.670
 and another element is called the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.810
 diaphragm the opening of the diaphragm that 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.200
 well this we will talk about 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.510
 we'll talk in another time 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.769
 but well let's talk now about the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.900
 shutter to see anything is very basic to 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.900
 very low speeds you can get 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 photos that if you do not have a good pulse 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.430
 it may be unfolded 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:44.060
 at high speeds normally for 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.849
 people that is not their thing and for whatever 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.319
 in the situation where it is they can not 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.530
 put a foot mono tripod 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.500
 or some kind of element or even 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.840
 and have a goal with a good 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.690
 Image Stabilizer 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.739
 that many times for whatever it is not 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.739
 can be used at that time there are things 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.739
 so 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.510
 we would raise the speed to obtain that 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.819
 improvement in stability 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.090
 and 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.750
 normally also 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.830
 Speed ​​up to get images 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.190
 fixed for example 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.810
 They do not know the typical image of a girl with 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.160
 that woman but in the pool water 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.190
 makes the head movement back 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.950
 and everything comes out of the arch of the arch 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.590
 endured at high speed is you would get 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.300
 that picture for a very nice effect 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.769
 at low speeds for example another 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.280
 type of photographs would be the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.020
 typical of the exhibition 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.450
 so you can understand 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.110
 because you do not have this term yet 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.660
 for example photos in which 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.430
 and without moving the camera the object that 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.710
 gives off a light for example a 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.990
 person with 'the internal one thus makes a 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.520
 drawing then the camera would get that 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.430
 drawing 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.770
 You can start good even though I'm a 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.600
 explain in the future 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.070
 with our name and so on and then 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.160
 go trying things a bit more 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.140
 advanced 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.320
 also to make sweeps to low 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.030
 speed then what you get is 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.210
 forgive the object 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.460
 sharp and the background out of focus from the 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.130
 sign moved to the direction in which you 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.570
 have you moved the camera then so 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.760
 you will get a pretty pretty picture with 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.249
 very nice hit that will give a look 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.369
 of quite important speed 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:47.209
 and also good for example is usually 

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.209
 use for racing 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.449
 it does not look like the judges are 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.819
 still or the people or whatever 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.249
 and then they also have an option that 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.449
 they call bull 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.449
 sir the united 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.129
 is 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.169
 I'm here 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:10.840
 which is the same that is the one that goes 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.260
 30 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:20.240
 that reflects us 30 seconds and returns 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.949
 with this the only thing that works is for 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.180
 the subject that I have here the other 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:29.919
 trigger that is this 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.680
 and nothing this is a complement 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.260
 documentaries to this merit here is a 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.460
 Jack 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.460
 40 days like this 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.280
 in my case it has a good cable used 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.290
 also for automatic triggers 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.150
 forgiveness for self-portraits and others 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.150
 It also has a good option 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.060
 At the same time it focuses and if you go up at all 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.370
 towards photography during the time 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.610
 that right now I would be doing a 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.610
 Photo 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.729
 on the black screen here the time 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.250
 that you have it in the case already takes 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.040
 15 seconds you have until now if I do not 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.790
 I'm wrong half an hour with this with this 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:23.310
 you can get for example also 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.310
 pictures of the sky 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.500
 and capture the movement of the stars 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.030
 of action 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:34.430
 They are also photos or photos in which 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.290
 everything you can think of that has come down 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.910
 in brightness but there is something that can 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.580
 stand out with light 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.250
 lowering the shutter speed not 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.000
 you will have a pretty pretty picture in the 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.870
 following 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.870
 in the next chapter 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.220
 thank you very much
