00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
that's quite a bit of a horsepower

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.819 
that's quite a bit of a horsepower
change<00:00:38.489> there<00:00:38.760> yeah<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> capable<00:00:40.140> possibly

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
change there yeah it is capable possibly

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.459 
change there yeah it is capable possibly
going<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.280> around<00:00:41.460> 400<00:00:41.760> 450<00:00:42.659> with<00:00:43.199> a<00:00:43.260> few

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
going up to around 400 450 with a few

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.590 
going up to around 400 450 with a few
extra<00:00:44.010> modifications<00:00:44.699> on<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:44.940> engine<00:00:45.269> has

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
extra modifications on the engine has

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
extra modifications on the engine has
been<00:00:45.749> run<00:00:45.929> in<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.769> obviously<00:00:47.069> someone

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
been run in but obviously someone

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
been run in but obviously someone
feasible<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.719> until<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.530> done

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
feasible to do that until it's done

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.309 
feasible to do that until it's done
quite<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.859> few<00:00:49.949> miles<00:00:50.339> yeah<00:00:51.120> tell<00:00:51.989> us<00:00:52.019> what<00:00:52.199> you

quite a few miles yeah tell us what you

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:54.739 
quite a few miles yeah tell us what you
got<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.589> on<00:00:52.710> yours<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.729> very<00:00:54.449> somewhat

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
got here on yours it's very somewhat

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.329 
got here on yours it's very somewhat
appalled<00:00:55.079> engine<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.979> four-wheel

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
appalled engine but this is a four-wheel

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.090 
appalled engine but this is a four-wheel
drive<00:00:56.370> car<00:00:56.879> oh<00:00:57.149> okay<00:00:57.809> well<00:00:58.589> there's<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
drive car oh okay well there's got a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.299 
drive car oh okay well there's got a
slightly<00:00:59.879> higher<00:01:00.629> boost<00:01:01.079> pressure<00:01:01.319> larger

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
slightly higher boost pressure larger

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.180 
slightly higher boost pressure larger
injectors<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.620> runs<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.860> bit<00:01:05.010> more

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
injectors and so it runs a bit more

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.639 
injectors and so it runs a bit more
boost<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.759> bit<00:01:06.119> more<00:01:06.299> fuel<00:01:06.540> available<00:01:07.020> right

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
boost a bit more fuel available right

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:08.959 
boost a bit more fuel available right
the<00:01:07.829> same<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.100> Paul's<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.610> still<00:01:08.820> been

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
the same as Paul's it's still been

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.359 
the same as Paul's it's still been
running<00:01:09.329> but<00:01:10.200> once<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.560> running<00:01:10.829> a<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
running but once it's running a bit of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.789 
running but once it's running a bit of
have<00:01:11.759> a<00:01:11.790> boost<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.329> to<00:01:12.360> around<00:01:12.750> 24<00:01:13.200> psi<00:01:13.649> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
have a boost up to around 24 psi and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.700 
have a boost up to around 24 psi and
that'll<00:01:14.009> be<00:01:14.130> around<00:01:14.250> 330<00:01:15.060> brick<00:01:15.360> 24<00:01:16.200> pounds<00:01:16.649> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that'll be around 330 brick 24 pounds of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.080 
that'll be around 330 brick 24 pounds of
boost<00:01:16.860> yeah<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.399> what<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.640> come<00:01:17.789> with<00:01:17.820> on

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
boost yeah and what do they come with on

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.660 
boost yeah and what do they come with on
stock<00:01:18.329> form<00:01:18.600> seven<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:19.590> eight<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.340> yeah

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
