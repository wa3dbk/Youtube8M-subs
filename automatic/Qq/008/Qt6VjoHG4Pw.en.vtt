00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.740
 and good of this had to talk before or 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.109
 then nintendo and e3 of course 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.850
 are all the few posts in 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.680
 nintendo and especially in your console 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.110
 desktop in will you which is the one 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.449
 you need that push not the one you need 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.189
 make known what should be presented 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.429
 many novelties and play all your 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.439
 letters in this e3 2014 well then 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.319
 attentive because I think this is very 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.119
 good news is worth very little 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:30.189
 for the celebration of e3 in the 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.690
 angels we only have one month left 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.180
 it's worth a few days less but since 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.320
 then we are all nervous and we have to 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.630
 talk you have to talk for example about 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.880
 nintendo and its position in the e3 nintendo 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.560
 it's not going to hold a classic conference 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.720
 it's the second year that he would not make his 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.940
 classic conference at the fair itself 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.830
 since you already know that now nintendo what 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.540
 what it does is that they retransmit an event 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.150
 digital for everyone presenting 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.110
 your great news for the next 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.200
 months 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.420
 the owners of supermario will have 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.280
 a great presence at the fair given that 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.680
 well only the company with the greatest 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.990
 rented space 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.810
 and they are, of course, microsoft and 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.430
 sony but has shocked this data a lot 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.730
 Although they do not lecture in the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.700
 own e3 despite that is nintendo is 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.610
 the one that has more space rented is 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.250
 curious because they are up to three spaces 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.590
 reserved in the west hall three offers 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.740
 well differentiated that they intend to teach 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.760
 to the public while two of them 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.440
 they seem destined to wii and nintendo 3ds 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.320
 eye the third space could be 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.229
 related to that stamp quality of 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.210
 light that could have representation in 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.710
 the show we'll see 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.259
 what do they put in the third space 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.020
 will you I think it's going to take the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.660
 focus of attention I think you need 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.040
 have a lot of presence you need to teach 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.750
 many games especially that many people 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.180
 try it for it maybe they have 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.910
 rented so much space we'll see what 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.119
 is what there is we will check in the e3 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.479
 in those retransmissions until then to 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.479
 wait
