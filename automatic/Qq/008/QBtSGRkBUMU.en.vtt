00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
made I mean here in California it comes

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.460 
made I mean here in California it comes
up<00:00:30.570> when<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.840> really<00:00:30.960> hot<00:00:31.170> because<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
up when it's really hot because the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
up when it's really hot because the
weather<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.399> gets<00:00:32.460> really<00:00:32.730> hot<00:00:32.880> so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
weather like this it gets really hot so

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660 
weather like this it gets really hot so
engineers<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> cool<00:00:33.780> down<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.399> what<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.550> call

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
engineers to cool down so what we call

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.700 
engineers to cool down so what we call
the<00:00:35.850> batwing<00:00:36.090> comes<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> little<00:00:37.350> bit<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the batwing comes up a little bit so

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.709 
the batwing comes up a little bit so
they<00:00:37.829> set<00:00:38.370> some<00:00:38.489> more<00:00:38.640> air<00:00:38.790> into<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.149> cools<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
they set some more air into it cools the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.450 
they set some more air into it cools the
engine<00:00:39.840> down<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.710> gonna<00:00:40.829> ask<00:00:41.010> about<00:00:41.219> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
done with a lot of carbon fiber parts

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.670 
done with a lot of carbon fiber parts
and<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> top<00:01:08.460> intake<00:01:09.350> mounting<00:01:10.350> machines

everything else if you look at the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.300 
everything else if you look at the

inside of the engine bay and also the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
inside of the engine bay and also the
the<00:01:14.450> cockpit<00:01:15.450> also<00:01:15.930> has<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> lot<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> carbon

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the cockpit also has a lot of carbon

the cockpit also has a lot of carbon
fibers<00:01:17.040> tell<00:01:17.670> me<00:01:17.759> how<00:01:17.850> fast<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.270> car<00:01:18.479> go

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
fibers tell me how fast is this car go

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.870 
fibers tell me how fast is this car go
too<00:01:19.049> fast<00:01:21.770> 0-60<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> believe<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> goes<00:01:23.580> about

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
too fast 0-60 I believe this goes about

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.770 
too fast 0-60 I believe this goes about
a<00:01:24.540> little<00:01:24.869> under<00:01:25.080> four<00:01:25.380> seconds<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:27.600> goes

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
a little under four seconds and it goes

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.789 
a little under four seconds and it goes
up<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> 220<00:01:28.500> miles<00:01:28.770> per<00:01:28.920> hour<00:01:29.100> top<00:01:29.250> speed<00:01:30.799> it's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
up to 220 miles per hour top speed it's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.460 
up to 220 miles per hour top speed it's
feeling<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> lot<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.780> magazines<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.140> also<00:01:34.290> a
