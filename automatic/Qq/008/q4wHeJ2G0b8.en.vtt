taking and putting utensils down and
picking<00:02:06.719> them<00:02:06.869> up<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.649> time<00:02:08.009> efficient

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
picking them up is not time efficient

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.609 
picking them up is not time efficient
and<00:02:08.819> once<00:02:09.479> you've<00:02:09.660> stirred<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:10.170> hair<00:02:10.349> color

time before it process

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.370 
time before it process
