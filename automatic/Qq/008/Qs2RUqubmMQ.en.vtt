00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:15.490
 Yes I would like to miss everyone today 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:21.820
 Finally the most important part of English grammar that started from today 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.779
 In this book to another until now, not that it's knowledge of the important English grammar start 5 sentence patterns 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.650
 At least 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.620
 It's the beginning say I still essential I'm Well is the lesson story of roughly 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.620
 What kind of 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:39.160
 It may be the same even if related to knowledge thing 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:42.160
 After this , literary knowledge is, in fact, in the preparatory school in the first grader class or in the second grader class 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.190
 And after all in the class of the exam student 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.610
 Why do you start from here ? 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:57.080
 The guy is good never learned in the first place 5 sentence pattern but I'm there to take care So Tteyuu 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 Each but the number of Yes guy kill sad to remember properly this is the actual suture star is is why 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.150
 It is a start from the place saying whether you really remember this with you first of all in the school year 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.250
 Ne 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.630
 So this from the remaining 11 days firmly fictional grammar Unit 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.189
 Even today to get it right 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.380
 Let's check the revenge point firmly So then two points 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.409
 Try to start from the first one eye 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:27.009
 The first point is that 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.780
 The relationship between each element and the hinge I want you to review the chitin far while conscious of this a little 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.840
 thing I said 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.370
 You are usually in various parts 4 a 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:43.520
 At that time, for example, the word “protected area” will appear or have the word “scale” 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:48.410
 I'm studying , but in English I have a face to say that it is a protection or an object 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.700
 It doesn't mean it's coming out, so it's not like there's something next to sv 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.010
 Mere adjective 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.390
 Or it's just a business card. The problem is that sometimes there is a business card right after the sv. 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.380
 This is the purpose when this is made in a square 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.790
 It is not the difference in the work of 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.679
 First of all, the elements of your menu as varieties 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:17.010
 And that's what the cat said as the work of the breed is the purpose word 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.380
 I only know the words are big if I can not understand the relationship in my head . 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.240
 Well then 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.470
 This virtuoso is very students who become wind Tteyuu when I heard Which of work 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:31.480
 It is a lot 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:37.450
 It is necessary to interpret this in the form and the mind that is reflected in the eye 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:40.690
 Link two of the elements firmly in the sense that everything starts here 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:46.629
 Well this point is large and and two eyes 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.690
 Well this is the most important point in today's lesson or talk, but the fifth sentence pattern 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.470
 I'm writing about something pretty in 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.500
 That sd 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:03.590
 A little pattern Summary What in your head to one of us now pattern which of c of c only 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:09.680
 For thin content, for example, we will do it later at non-stop or molecule 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.490
 I'm supposed to be, but I've talked to you now, but I still read English every day 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.600
 It is quite difficult 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:22.890
 Teru's also Rashi read the English there is c kind of what kind of shape of the fifth sentence pattern since that time 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.210
 And I don't know for sure what kind of features each one has 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.930
 I think Fu say is bad is to and say, 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:37.030
 If you are studying grammar for the first time or learning English for the first time , it is true that in the five sentences of the commentary 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:42.850
 I think I'm going to explain up to this pattern that becomes a semi-verb of c 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:45.200
 Every day the Tteyuu also be important most you are reading this in here way after all I do not'm so in the 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.730
 In high school everyday 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.420
 It always seems like I want you to be in touch with something like this point 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.790
 I am 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:01.610
 A detailed understanding is required for the remaining 11 days 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:04.819
 Is there any features and patterns trying to just frame that's go to version up 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.220
 I just want to review it firmly today 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.510
 Oh yes 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:13.840
 I think so 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:20.320
 First of all, please pay attention to this point well and read it again 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.010
 And the start of the lesson of the Well named lesson across to more and more 11 days long time from tomorrow 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.750
 To go 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.530
 First of all, the intransitive transitive verb, which is not excuse for those who dislike English grammar 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.110
 Likely to become even more hate Date 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.760
 It is probably because of having you read well what you want to give 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.160
 Many have 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:43.280
 What did you say about the words "Jiro" and "one another" ? 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.430
 I do not understand well or something like a feeling of discomfort 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.520
 I think I can wipe it out to some extent and in fact 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.030
 Lined up with 5 sentences 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:57.659
 Learn You know now a lot of English grammar matters that distinguish identification of this intransitive transitive verb 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.229
 If you understand that you can't avoid going through it 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.849
 think 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:05.849
 Still a high English grammar at the beginning one step start of foothold 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.510
 Mochotto this but but go on a 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:14.100
 Let's work hard 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:14.100
 It was in turn tomorrow and see you after the end of the intransitive verb transitive verb Sukkama'
