00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 welcome to kiss 12 today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.500
 see us again a rc 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.750
 quadrocopter at this time the schiersand 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.820
 630 w this is not a tiny one but also 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.980
 no big a pretty cheap drone 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.059
 I would say for only 58 euros 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.890
 winery point com 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.690
 besides, this drone is supposedly too 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.910
 equipped with a hd camera 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.490
 at least that's on the box 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 Thanks to Bank.com for being that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.130
 of this product for the test report only 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.510
 Let's take a look at the content 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.149
 the box of course the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.219
 quadrocopter itself the transmitter with 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.829
 the smartphone holder the usb 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.660
 Charging cables and spare parts for the case 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.079
 that broke on the quadrocopter 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.399
 go 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.590
 a screwdriver again too 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.570
 supplied and last but not least one 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.879
 instructions for use to happiness 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.710
 English at goal.com has me the green 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.260
 Variant of this quadrocopter sent 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.059
 but it also exists in blue or too 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.379
 already in yellow I have to say on the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.449
 At first glance, the drone does not even look 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.370
 bad for the low price what 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.989
 I noticed immediately that is 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 this drone with propeller wings 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.520
 protective equipment is equipped and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.590
 these are screwed on with these 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.570
 do not fall off as easily as mine 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.150
 last quadrocopter that no eagles 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.130
 galaxy visitor 2 Unfortunately, the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.840
 protection but not just tough 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.330
 on the bottom we have four here 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.670
 red rubber feet the great work 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.049
 just make this my opinion 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.150
 too easily taken down 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.189
 are now located here in front 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.229
 the so-called hd camera but what I 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.030
 strongly doubt that i check one 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.220
 little later with this camera 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 you can take photos and videos 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 but is nowhere here a 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.729
 microsd slot or similar on this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.560
 instead, the data gets over 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.720
 a wifi module to the smartphone 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.790
 Transfer and this is the antenna 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.500
 for this purpose with the camera one becomes 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.130
 to be able to do everything real time 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.840
 monitor 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.659
 Here is the Akkkudeckel 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.939
 Inside is a 700 million per hour 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.979
 Lithium polymer battery of one flight duration 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.380
 guarantee from five to six minutes 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.520
 should remove the battery cover is very 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.950
 easy then this again 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
 It is almost impossible for me to install 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.750
 I wish I had better ones here 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.800
 work done because this is one 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.920
 great expense 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.810
 apart from that seems the quadrocopter 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 order and once you have the battery 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.640
 The drone lights up in blue 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.080
 and red colors exist on therefore ends 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.190
 has the possibility also in the dark 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.750
 to fly around with it 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.280
 a very interesting thing for me 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.560
 emphasize is the volume 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.030
 I know that's kind of pointless after all 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.140
 I do not necessarily want to show how much 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.140
 Noise can be produced 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.100
 Well, now let's have a look 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.230
 transmitter as expected 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.780
 it is this one is very simple, the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.790
 means four channels and 2.4 gigahertz 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.400
 above is a smartphone 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.210
 Holder 1 4 5 inch mobile phone fits straight 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.310
 so pure 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.140
 therefore, your cellphone should not be 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.000
 greater than 4.5 inches to be 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.770
 apart from that, the bracket worked 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.550
 very good you can change the angle yourself 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.470
 regulate 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.480
 And there is also soft padding here 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.670
 to scratch or something similar on the phone 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.740
 to avoid the throttle is located 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.020
 on the left side of the transmitter 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.310
 needs four double but in there but 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.840
 not included 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.120
 Well, I think it would be time 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.580
 to prepare the flight first bring you 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.340
 your smartphone and suffers the cx2 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.350
 iphone app then closes the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.540
 Quadrocopter battery connects to the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.700
 battery cover if you can and 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.860
 switches the transmitter on 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.900
 you know that the throttle first at the bottom 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.760
 is then on your phone goes to the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.709
 attitudes and leave with the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.860
 wifi signal using the drone 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.019
 then the cx2 vu starts before and 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.250
 press on play now you can choose 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.680
 if you have the quadrocopter with the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.040
 transmitter or with the mobile phone 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.810
 want 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.750
 unfortunately for some reason in android 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.580
 4.4 the quadrocopter responds to none 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.140
 control information on the phone 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.760
 Therefore I hold this function too 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.530
 right back as she felt 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.230
 the camera works and it is 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.760
 a real-time image transfer, so to speak 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.800
 it would not be this delay 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.200
 sometimes there are almost none and then in 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.630
 some situations where the signal 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.769
 weaker there is then a very 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.480
 big delay 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.400
 so I would not dare that 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.989
 Drone only through the camera to control 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.030
 the quadrocopter itself seems very 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.780
 to work well only there is one 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.850
 problem 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.010
 I do not know how to fly it but 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.780
 if you only me but we look 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.790
 us fast then the camera quality then 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.669
 unfortunately, as I suspected 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.450
 the quality falls far from hd hd 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:38.810
 stands for a resolution of 1280 x 720 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.390
 However, this camera provides only 320 x 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.220
 I know 240 pixels at this point 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.960
 not quite what i should think for one 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.570
 Quadrocopter is advertised that this 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.800
 it has a hd camera but it is 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.510
 not available 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.090
 Of course for such a price would be 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.529
 that was a miracle but it is so 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.639
 just not right 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.799
 the camera on the box 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.049
 still imposing for the price of 

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:02.629
 58 euros if I'm marketing in 

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:04.339
 disregard the get is still a 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.139
 good value but i am a little bit 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.789
 then disappointed as a manufacturer should 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.439
 you do not lie to your customers 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.749
 fortunately, the flight time is right 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:13.399
 with the promised five to six 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:14.269
 minutes over, maybe even one 

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.829
 little bit more 

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:17.419
 Nevertheless, I have this product so 

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:19.369
 as objective as possible 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.489
 there are some weaknesses through 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:24.829
 still I could shoot this 630 

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:26.149
 wrc quadrocopter for this small 

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:27.919
 recommend price 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:30.109
 it is simply a strong one 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.539
 crown again a big thank you 

00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:34.339
 bank.com for seeing this drone 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.199
 for the test report I had fun 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.539
 to try these thank you for 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.179
 do not forget to subscribe and watch 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.529
 visited the class of sex.com and there 

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:44.599
 to see videos mulled to youtube 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.089
 also said no to red blogger me 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.719
 support and to future videos too 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:50.319
 enable 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.319
 Thank you very much
