00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
interesting like feel to it like with

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.890 
interesting like feel to it like with
the<00:03:36.970> aluminum<00:03:37.450> handle<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.300> like<00:03:40.570> I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
the aluminum handle it's just like I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.259 
the aluminum handle it's just like I
don't<00:03:41.769> know<00:03:41.890> it's<00:03:42.010> very<00:03:42.190> mechanical<00:03:42.970> listen

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
don't know it's very mechanical listen

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.770 
don't know it's very mechanical listen
to<00:03:43.330> that<00:03:44.160> clink<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:46.060> then<00:03:46.209> it's<00:03:46.360> also<00:03:46.510> got

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
to that clink and then it's also got

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.990 
to that clink and then it's also got
this<00:03:48.060> very<00:03:49.060> kind<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.420> revolutionary<00:03:50.700> lock<00:03:51.700> bar

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
this very kind of revolutionary lock bar

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.280 
this very kind of revolutionary lock bar
in<00:03:52.209> there<00:03:52.360> so<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.630> know<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:52.959> course<00:03:52.989> it's

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
in there so you know of course it's

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.160 
in there so you know of course it's
brand<00:03:53.530> new<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:53.950> it's<00:03:54.100> dirty<00:03:54.370> but<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:57.400> got<00:03:58.170> no

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
brand new so it's dirty but it's got no

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.990 
brand new so it's dirty but it's got no
this<00:03:59.350> is<00:03:59.440> just<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.739> single<00:04:00.070> insert<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:00.790> then<00:04:00.880> it

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
this is just a single insert and then it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.020 
this is just a single insert and then it
uses<00:04:01.330> a<00:04:01.360> secondary<00:04:01.900> spring<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.560> provide

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
uses a secondary spring to provide

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.370 
uses a secondary spring to provide
tension<00:04:04.030> on<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:05.680> believe<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.820> is

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
tension on it and I believe that it is

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.610 
tension on it and I believe that it is
titanium<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.940> feels<00:04:10.330> like<00:04:10.540> it's<00:04:10.690> titanium

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
titanium it feels like it's titanium

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.309 
titanium it feels like it's titanium
but<00:04:12.610> it's<00:04:12.730> just<00:04:12.819> super<00:04:13.299> super<00:04:13.599> smooth<00:04:14.080> and

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
but it's just super super smooth and

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.990 
but it's just super super smooth and
from<00:04:14.680> what<00:04:14.769> I<00:04:14.799> understand<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.549> does<00:04:15.790> not

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
from what I understand this does not

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.159 
from what I understand this does not
have<00:04:16.389> any<00:04:16.810> washers<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.620> just<00:04:19.079> grinding<00:04:20.079> on

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
have any washers it's just grinding on

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.479 
have any washers it's just grinding on
aluminum<00:04:20.590> which<00:04:20.709> makes<00:04:20.919> sense<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.310> mean<00:04:21.340> you

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
aluminum which makes sense I mean you

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.270 
aluminum which makes sense I mean you
don't<00:04:21.639> really<00:04:21.790> need<00:04:22.090> washers<00:04:23.020> if<00:04:23.290> it's<00:04:23.620> riding

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
don't really need washers if it's riding

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.439 
don't really need washers if it's riding
on<00:04:24.460> aluminum<00:04:24.910> like<00:04:25.060> that

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
on aluminum like that

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.260 
on aluminum like that
