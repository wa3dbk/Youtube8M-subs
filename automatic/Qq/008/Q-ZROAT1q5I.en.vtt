00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
see it happen we'll do it in slow motion

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.039 
see it happen we'll do it in slow motion
so<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.560> slow<00:01:59.130> motion<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.689> see

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so in slow motion that way you can see

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.470 
so in slow motion that way you can see
it<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.710> fast<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.159> why

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
it because it's so fast I why

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.600 
it because it's so fast I why
you<00:02:02.540> will<00:02:02.690> be<00:02:02.810> able<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:03.080> see<00:02:03.230> so<00:02:03.830> Louie<00:02:04.190> will

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
you will be able to see so Louie will

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.780 
you will be able to see so Louie will
travel<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.500> looky<00:02:06.500> there<00:02:06.550> he's<00:02:07.550> already
