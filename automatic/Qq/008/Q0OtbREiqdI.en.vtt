00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:35.731
Poha - 1 cup (thick granules).

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:49.555
Raw coconut - 2-3 inch thin pieces

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.787
Oil - to fry poha

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.988
Let’s start with the procedure of making namkeen.

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:06.930
When oil gets heated, add poha into it.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:18.298
Add little poha at a time.

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:27.997
Reduce the flame.

00:01:31.617 --> 00:01:36.938
The moment poha becomes puffy take it out.

00:01:37.057 --> 00:01:39.740
There is no need to make it brown.

00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:47.099
Take it out in a sieve so that excess oil drains out.

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:58.222
Fry coconut until it turns little brown.

00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:19.148
Fry peanuts as well until they get crusty.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:24.797
Keep the flame low.

00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:47.221
Take out the peanuts when they get little brown.

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.511
Now we will mix masala into it.

00:03:05.692 --> 00:03:08.374
Take out the mixture in a big bowl.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.043

00:03:24.594 --> 00:03:27.610
and chaat masala

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.816
If you don’t have chaat masala then add salt and black pepper powder.

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:53.405
For tarty flavor add salt, black pepper powder, red chilly powder, mango powder and roasted cumin powder.

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:03.256
