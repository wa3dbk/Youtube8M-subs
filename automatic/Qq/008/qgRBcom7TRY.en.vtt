00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.660 

so<00:01:49.899> we've<00:01:50.079> loaded<00:01:50.350> our<00:01:50.500> screen<00:01:50.920> up<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.250> with

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
so we've loaded our screen up in with

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.669 
so we've loaded our screen up in with
this<00:01:51.789> large<00:01:52.060> design<00:01:52.420> I'm<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.020> pull<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.500> I

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
this large design I'm going to pull it I

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.950 
this large design I'm going to pull it I
want<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.009> have<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.399> push<00:01:54.579> really<00:01:55.060> hard<00:01:55.509> and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
want to have to push really hard and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.719 
want to have to push really hard and
it's<00:01:56.350> going<00:01:56.439> to<00:01:56.500> be<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.649> struggle<00:01:56.950> however<00:01:57.490> if<00:01:57.640> i

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
it's going to be a struggle however if i

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.219 
it's going to be a struggle however if i
push<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.030> i<00:01:58.240> think<00:01:58.299> my<00:01:58.539> body<00:01:58.780> weight<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.020> push

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
push it i think my body weight to push

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.600 
push it i think my body weight to push
into<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.619> design<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.649> can<00:02:02.799> go<00:02:02.950> slow<00:02:03.310> I

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
into the design and I can go slow I

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.510 
into the design and I can go slow I
don't<00:02:04.569> have<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.840> press<00:02:05.020> too<00:02:05.259> hard

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.970 

and<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.480> much<00:02:09.780> larger<00:02:10.170> design<00:02:10.320> like<00:02:10.740> that

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
and with a much larger design like that

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.540 
and with a much larger design like that
that's<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:12.000> pass<00:02:12.300> using<00:02:13.230> round<00:02:13.410> at<00:02:13.530> white<00:02:13.740> you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
that's one pass using round at white you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.700 
that's one pass using round at white you
got<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.030> good<00:02:15.150> coverage<00:02:15.720> without<00:02:16.320> even

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
got a really good coverage without even

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.020 
got a really good coverage without even
a<00:02:16.770> flash<00:02:17.040> now<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.490> using<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.790> hi-fi

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
a flash now this is using the hi-fi

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.760 
a flash now this is using the hi-fi
emulsion<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.840> got<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.960> thicker<00:02:19.230> stencil

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
emulsion so it's got a thicker stencil

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.710 
emulsion so it's got a thicker stencil
but<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.460> didn't<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.000> work<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.330> hard<00:02:21.510> it's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
but I didn't have to work that hard it's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.840 
but I didn't have to work that hard it's
