00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:09.630
 in this 5 song video online in this 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.950
 normal holiday day and good in this 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.580
 video I'll show you a secret a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.800
 extra and good this secret is this 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.300
 curiosity is a place is something there is medium 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.029
 weird, I'll explain it but, well, 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.670
 this secret is to find a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.619
 ladder to me I know that many said 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.269
 my ladder 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.920
 maybe it does not make much sense 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.390
 staircase because there are many in the world and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.880
 anyone can see a ladder but 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.890
 view this staircase is special you know 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.040
 why should we say it's a 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.340
 stairway that goes towards another reality is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.650
 the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.320
 clear definition that I have this 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.330
 ladder is in one place and good 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.200
 Obviously this ladder you can not pass 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.060
 you can not touch that ladder 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.950
 but good the truth I found this and 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.860
 it's quite interesting so good 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.660
 before all this we open this map and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.940
 Well, since we open it, we're going to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.310
 go to this location where the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.350
 place where it is inside a good pipe 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.670
 is inside the pipe in fact to one of 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.770
 the many that there are in the saints we 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.440
 let's go there right there in the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.260
 map and you can see the drain pipe 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.150
 there is exactly another exit and then 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.370
 We will see that but good as we 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.830
 there 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.780
 Well, since we arrived at this station we 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.369
 we got off our car obviously and we 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.720
 let's go up these stairs are not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.160
 these stairs to which I referred 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 because if not many will say and not 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.210
 really these stairs are not 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 were these would you say of salem that 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.160
 are those and it was a joke but no and you're 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.960
 stairs are really good because 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.240
 we are swimming in the drainage nothing 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.640
 I suppose that of flying very badly and drinking 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 poop floating there but it does not matter 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.240
 we have to swim until the end of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 tunnel we have to swim we have to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.020
 follow the light we must reach the light at 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.260
 end of the tunnel to find this 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.420
 secret and good to be able to obviously see 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.900
 think and well then finally we arrived 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.700
 after swimming a good time here they are 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.980
 the stairs are ready as you see there 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.620
 are these stairs here as with shapes 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.110
 of DNA we are going to go a little bit 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.450
 beds this more thoroughly I'm not going to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.150
 say the things that makes her very 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.830
 mysterious but good can at first 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.880
 view and how they come to install them at the end 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.150
 of the tunnel 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.250
 well here you can see how simply 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.590
 it's like a roof with bars, you're not 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.780
 they will not be able to enter or they are not going to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.340
 to be able to pass there in fact those bars and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.830
 can pull as well here obviously 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.670
 comes well prepared with this explosives 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.350
 with c4 and well there we spent a few 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.760
 there are three 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.770
 us the fourth that picture does not 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.570
 can break by the way but there are 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.390
 two ways this is how they see the bars 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.550
 flying if you throw a lot c4 and it explodes and 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.800
 all that but you do not want to lose no 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.880
 he lamented a lot and generated one more nothing 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.340
 he did not tell me you do not know that he did not want 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.980
 He did not want to loosen up and stayed there despite 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.900
 of all the dynamite that the cast or the c4 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.950
 the explosive good as you see we are not going 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.620
 to be able to climb out there 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.200
 they are fences and well in fact we only 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.450
 let's get in here but see how 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.530
 an invisible barrier if they walk here and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.980
 well there I fell hey guys the plan but 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.540
 where are the bars there are not only 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.269
 a few four points where if you can 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.209
 climb but almost this usually does not 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.370
 you will crash and as you can see here are the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.010
 stairs and then you can not access 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.840
 no you can not access they are simply 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.549
 there are these stairs but the strange thing is 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.680
 this see up there thing if we 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.080
 we look up there old as I eat 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.980
 you are to that is the glow not this 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.660
 reflection that brings us as to think to me 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.390
 it leads me to think that there is something there 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.280
 up not obviously its time and that's how it 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.620
 It made it very strange that when I got to 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.650
 these stairs when I was standing there 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.510
 in front he did not let me pass and I said it was 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.700
 very strange because I say they are simply 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.900
 as stairs did not say it was 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.329
 they can break the bars and the panorama 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.790
 because it's open it really made me 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.830
 I miss that you tried to walk and not 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.680
 could go 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.690
 what is strange is that heaven does not 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.930
 I know if you look out you see that glow 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.460
 you see there's something up there but 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.269
 really not because good now 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.150
 I'm going to show what's outside 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.729
 which does not give any logical sense 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.599
 neither physical foundation nor anything bone no no 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.639
 it can be completely impossible but 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.409
 good see but good first of all 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.060
 chic on the map 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.979
 I want you to check this map well as 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.300
 see in this line is not gray line 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.190
 gray is a street that is out here the 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.250
 map looks this obviously obviously very 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.139
 big and observe this rectangle this 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.909
 Black rectangle is important for 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.129
 have a good map location 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:47.810
 after we are out of this 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.810
 place and good now you have to check the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.430
 map outside is not this to be located 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.199
 well here is the gray line that is 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.180
 I saw that big this inside is what 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.560
 that obviously inside the tunnel that 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.810
 see closer here is the rectangle 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.060
 how they see in that black box the 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.190
 rectangle so this would be 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.740
 exactly place around here pretty much 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.830
 would be where that staircase is where 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.599
 should be that staircase that is supposed 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.069
 which is also open, not because 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.039
 if you can see how that light from heaven 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.960
 reflecting means that there is something there 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.690
 and well also that glow is half 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.190
 weird because they remember that it shone if 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.170
 one 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.750
 of a very white glow would not be very 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.490
 white and well I did it with was 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.130
 raining not the sky looks very grayish 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.080
 and in fact it does not shine there is no sun and good 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.880
 practically what contrasts with that of 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.810
 now it's not as close as you can 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.420
 find 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.420
 it is simply a colander I think 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.160
 it has nothing to do with the strain 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.020
 try to throw it there a few drops 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.840
 explosives to see if it's visa silver and something 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.670
 magical and unicorns came out but no no 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.060
 nothing of that happens and as you see it is a 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.410
 lonely and empty parking in 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.180
 middle of nowhere 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.610
 in fact in the middle of a fair and in the 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.400
 beach and various things but in these 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.520
 terms this nest out of nothing since not 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.950
 there are holes that have stairs down like this 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.960
 that is not really being very 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.100
 strange and I did not find it logical and 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.450
 actually I do not think anyone can 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.130
 find them and so you find him 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.050
 something they found that hole would be 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.780
 cool though I really think there's no 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.090
 nothing because they look well and then I did not see 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.920
 nothing but well that's fine but good 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.020
 of two this staircase has something hidden 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.000
 really that's why they do not let you through 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.980
 that's as close as why the rays are not 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.200
 they let you pass that staircase 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.410
 completely normal that you could climb 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.960
 but obviously if you can not go there 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.720
 it's because obviously the rockstar 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.070
 they did not let it happen there was not that it's all 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.020
 this is programmed or is everything is 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.790
 programmed step by step I do not think that 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.510
 just do not let you go because 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.940
 but suddenly you can not do it or 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.590
 they just forgot and they already had 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.170
 that staircase had not been textured 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.020
 everything and they did not put the floor on top and 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.090
 they really forgot that hole but 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.920
 I do not believe or it did not see logic because it 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.860
 I would forget them, it 's just a ladder 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.440
 that goes down to the drain there is not even 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.910
 many things there so well then that 

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.790
 it would be all for this is quality that makes 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.800
 be in the drainage here I went with the boat 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.150
 by the way if you exploit those bars and 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.110
 you come back after a while they come back to 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.540
 appear or be the bars 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.200
 they regenerate so they reappear 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.820
 they are put back there and if you do not get there 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.970
 a lot of dynamite and see what happened 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:29.600
 and obviously nothing happens not everything is like that 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.920
 as made of stone but good for that 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.770
 it would be all you have of ladder is 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.180
 very rare again this mysterious and if 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.430
 we became a hiatus I hope that I have 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.610
 liked grass for this video and even the 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.610
 next 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.030
 ah 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.780
 Y
