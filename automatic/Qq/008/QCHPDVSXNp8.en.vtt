as<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.190> can<00:00:26.280> see<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.150> bright<00:00:27.570> and

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
as you can see here it's very bright and

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.370 
as you can see here it's very bright and
vivid<00:00:28.640> you<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.790> move<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.360> film<00:00:30.750> back<00:00:31.050> by

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
vivid you can move the film back by

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740 
vivid you can move the film back by
about<00:00:31.440> two<00:00:31.890> meters<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.550> which<00:00:33.120> point<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
about two meters at which point the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.870 
about two meters at which point the
backs<00:00:34.080> display<00:00:34.590> when<00:00:34.770> he<00:00:39.500> yeah<00:00:40.500> yeah<00:00:40.740> I<00:00:41.160> think

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
backs display when he yeah yeah I think

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.920 
backs display when he yeah yeah I think
this<00:00:41.970> maybe<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.390> like

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.139 

20%<00:00:46.930> there<00:00:47.079> yeah<00:00:47.379> yeah<00:00:47.710> yeah<00:00:47.950> and<00:00:48.879> you<00:00:48.970> don't

said there are two other kind of
features<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.000> enhance<00:01:16.720> this<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.670> called<00:01:18.850> a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
features to enhance this one is called a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.180 
features to enhance this one is called a
visual<00:01:19.420> or<00:01:19.509> Center<00:01:20.020> which<00:01:20.619> type<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:20.920> terms

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
visual or Center which type of terms

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.210 
visual or Center which type of terms
phone<00:01:21.550> into<00:01:22.000> an<00:01:22.149> overhead<00:01:22.479> remember<00:01:23.220> that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
phone into an overhead remember that

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.389 
phone into an overhead remember that
means<00:01:24.399> it'll<00:01:24.820> use<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.270> rear<00:01:25.509> camera<00:01:26.399> project

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
means it'll use the rear camera project

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.560 
means it'll use the rear camera project
on<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.820> projector<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.649> historical

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
on a projector so historical

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.590 
on a projector so historical
flash<00:01:32.230> on<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:33.160> as<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:33.370> can<00:01:33.550> see<00:01:33.610> where<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
flash on and as you can see where the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.140 
flash on and as you can see where the
campuses<00:01:35.110> here<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:36.070> will<00:01:36.280> show<00:01:36.700> on<00:01:37.000> the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
campuses here it will show on the

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.500 
campuses here it will show on the
projector<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.290> it's<00:01:38.440> good<00:01:38.620> for<00:01:39.120> product<00:01:40.120> demos

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
projector so it's good for product demos

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.170 
projector so it's good for product demos
or<00:01:41.260> simply<00:01:41.710> showing<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.100> photos<00:01:42.430> documents

can use is called the quick path and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.580 
can use is called the quick path and
this<00:01:51.490> is<00:01:51.729> kind<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.120> an<00:01:52.330> entertaining<00:01:53.229> tool

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
this is kind of an entertaining tool
