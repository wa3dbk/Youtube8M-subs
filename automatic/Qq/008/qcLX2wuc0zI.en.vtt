00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
shows all four of them at once and just

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.920 
shows all four of them at once and just
choose<00:00:31.529> individual<00:00:32.160> items<00:00:32.550> such<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.360> CPU

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
choose individual items such as the CPU

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.160 
choose individual items such as the CPU
or<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:35.579> memory<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.840> here's<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
or the memory and you can see here's the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.069

RAM<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:45.539> there's<00:00:45.719> another<00:00:46.460> list<00:00:47.460> down

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.060 
RAM and then there's another list down
here<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> shows<00:00:48.270> us<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> RAM<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.829> being

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
here that shows us what the RAM is being

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
here that shows us what the RAM is being
used<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> operating<00:00:51.660> system<00:00:52.079> if

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
used if it's the operating system if

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.180 
used if it's the operating system if
it's<00:00:53.600> something<00:00:54.600> that's<00:00:54.750> modifying<00:00:55.379> files<00:00:55.770> if

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's something that's modifying files if

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.889 
it's something that's modifying files if
it's<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.460> standby<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.420> free<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it's in standby or if it's free so you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.680 
it's in standby or if it's free so you
can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.320> 675<00:00:59.250> makes<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.300> free<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
can see we have 675 makes it free the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.920 
can see we have 675 makes it free the
rest<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.530> use<00:01:02.300> we<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.420> go<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> disk

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
rest is all in use we can go to the disk

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.390 
rest is all in use we can go to the disk
and<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:06.470> what<00:01:07.470> each<00:01:07.650> process<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and we can see what each process is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
and we can see what each process is
doing<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> disk<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.750> where<00:01:09.900> our

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
doing on the disk to see where our

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
doing on the disk to see where our
bottlenecks<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.060> just

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
bottlenecks are if we want we can just

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.320 
bottlenecks are if we want we can just
take<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> look<00:01:13.080> at<00:01:13.229> particular<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:14.210> click<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
take a look at particular one click on

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.350 
take a look at particular one click on
that<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:20.430> will<00:01:20.580> give<00:01:20.700> us<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:20.970> idea<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that and it will give us an idea of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
that and it will give us an idea of
what's<00:01:21.659> happening<00:01:23.509> over<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> can
