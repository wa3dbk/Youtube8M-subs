00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:10.569
 Here and our porsche activated 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:12.360
 you make such a small room 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.099
 inside the room roll back garbage 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.680
 sheer 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:21.420
 so the garden put the lever 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:27.280
 then we carry red dust to the doctor 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:36.870

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:58.889
 Helen is your one-two-three skull here it is 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:02.950
 will need to bend the helmet 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:05.980
 as a fold member is necessary so that no one 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.090
 fell on us because of this wool killer 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.840
 but in the center 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:18.069
 pushing the lever the plan falls here it is 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:23.519
 spends a lot of damage hanging over you 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.519
 no camera so 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:40.800

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.030
 see rally give in here 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.050
 after all, on the helmet the cher broke but for some reason 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:55.110
 they even took his whole cheek 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.110
 how much is left to go so goes here 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:05.320
 helmet we lay down here with the cat by the way and 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:08.950
 you can't throw it out and hold it 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.300
 at the same time open arcs need to take 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.850
 or generally any block 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:21.459

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.550

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.300
 butt and helmet that can not be worn and 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.520

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.870

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.560

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.040
