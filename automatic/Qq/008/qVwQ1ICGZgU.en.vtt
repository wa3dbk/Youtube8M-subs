00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
the fort you're going to raise your

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.180 
the fort you're going to raise your
opposite<00:00:49.190> i<00:00:49.460> just<00:00:50.090> broke<00:00:50.210> my<00:00:50.269> nail<00:00:50.510> great

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
opposite i just broke my nail great

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.080

you're going to raise your opposite leg
your<00:00:53.960> opposite<00:00:54.379> arm<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:55.850> do<00:00:56.089> one<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.930> then

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
your opposite arm so you do one and then

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.160 
your opposite arm so you do one and then
you<00:00:57.650> fly<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.300> I<00:00:59.300> can't<00:00:59.540> do<00:00:59.660> that<00:00:59.780> because<00:00:59.839> it's

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
you fly and I can't do that because it's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.390 
you fly and I can't do that because it's
way<00:01:00.260> too<00:01:00.320> heavy<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:00.800> maybe<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.070> should<00:01:01.250> use

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
way too heavy so maybe you should use

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.840 
way too heavy so maybe you should use
five<00:01:01.580> but<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.690> just<00:01:02.839> go<00:01:03.050> up<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.119> then<00:01:05.119> out<00:01:05.800> up

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
five but you just go up and then out up

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:16.109 
five but you just go up and then out up
and<00:01:08.020> aunt<00:01:09.220> ok<00:01:10.960> next<00:01:11.960> one<00:01:12.250> is<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:14.509> bent<00:01:15.080> over<00:01:15.259> row

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
and aunt ok next one is a bent over row

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.930 
and aunt ok next one is a bent over row
this<00:01:17.119> is<00:01:17.270> pretty<00:01:17.509> easy<00:01:18.580> you're<00:01:19.580> going<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.759> bend

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
this is pretty easy you're going to bend

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.590 
this is pretty easy you're going to bend
over<00:01:20.619> keep<00:01:21.619> your<00:01:21.770> back<00:01:21.890> flat<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:23.390> you're<00:01:23.509> just

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
over keep your back flat and you're just

over keep your back flat and you're just
going<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.840> row<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:25.369> could<00:01:25.550> probably<00:01:25.789> go<00:01:26.149> up<00:01:26.180> to

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
going to row you could probably go up to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.190 
going to row you could probably go up to
some<00:01:27.259> tens<00:01:27.560> for<00:01:27.860> this<00:01:28.270> not<00:01:29.270> five<00:01:29.539> spies<00:01:30.020> are

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
some tens for this not five spies are

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.580 
some tens for this not five spies are
going<00:01:30.320> to<00:01:30.380> be<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.649> like<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:32.479> next<00:01:32.630> move<00:01:32.929> is<00:01:33.289> a

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
going to be to like the next move is a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.719 
going to be to like the next move is a
rear<00:01:33.830> delt<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:35.630> you're<00:01:36.140> kind<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.440> bent<00:01:36.590> over<00:01:36.830> up

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
rear delt so you're kind of bent over up

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.310 
rear delt so you're kind of bent over up
a<00:01:37.880> little<00:01:38.119> bit<00:01:38.270> you're<00:01:38.930> going<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.110> squeeze

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
a little bit you're going to squeeze

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:49.149 
a little bit you're going to squeeze
your<00:01:39.470> shoulder<00:01:39.740> blades<00:01:39.770> together

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.039 

don't<00:01:49.759> swing<00:01:50.090> your<00:01:50.119> arms<00:01:50.509> really<00:01:50.689> think<00:01:50.990> about

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
don't swing your arms really think about

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.830 
don't swing your arms really think about
squeezing<00:01:51.469> your<00:01:51.740> shoulder<00:01:51.770> blades<00:01:52.039> and<00:01:52.840> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
squeezing your shoulder blades and the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.660 
squeezing your shoulder blades and the
last<00:01:54.049> move<00:01:54.319> is<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:56.259> decline<00:01:57.259> plank<00:01:58.009> with<00:01:58.399> an<00:01:58.520> arm

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
last move is a decline plank with an arm

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.919 
last move is a decline plank with an arm
raised<00:01:59.229> so<00:02:00.229> you're<00:02:00.710> just<00:02:00.770> going<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.009> get<00:02:01.159> a

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
raised so you're just going to get a

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.080 
raised so you're just going to get a
little<00:02:02.929> step<00:02:03.259> stool<00:02:03.530> or<00:02:03.679> something<00:02:04.090> and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
little step stool or something and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.919 
little step stool or something and

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
you're going to use your weights and

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:17.380 
you're going to use your weights and
you're<00:02:09.049> going<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.229> raise

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.440 

that's<00:02:18.050> what<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.230> got
