begin to attack you from there so you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.880 
begin to attack you from there so you
get<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> lot<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.120> situations<00:02:33.600> where<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.530> can

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.320 
get a lot of situations where you can
start<00:02:35.160> freestyling<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.850> little<00:02:36.030> bit<00:02:36.150> it's<00:02:36.300> a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
start freestyling a little bit it's a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.790 
start freestyling a little bit it's a
little<00:02:36.360> more<00:02:36.630> kind<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:36.959> like<00:02:37.110> open-ended<00:02:37.530> or

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
little more kind of like open-ended or

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.250 
little more kind of like open-ended or
kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.069> improvisational<00:02:38.819> combo<00:02:39.690> situations

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
kind of improvisational combo situations

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.570 
kind of improvisational combo situations
so<00:02:40.470> you're<00:02:40.920> not<00:02:40.980> kind<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.220> show<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.489> that
