00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
it's an old people's home and it's in

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.980 
it's an old people's home and it's in
our<00:00:07.140> village<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.560> Sunnyside<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.400> Tyneside<00:00:09.360> and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
our village of Sunnyside on Tyneside and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.480 
our village of Sunnyside on Tyneside and
it's<00:00:10.290> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.620> demolished<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.280> fact

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
it's going to be demolished in fact

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.070 
it's going to be demolished in fact
they're<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> middle<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.150> demolishing<00:00:12.960> it

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
they're in the middle of demolishing it

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.440 
they're in the middle of demolishing it
now<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.889> reason<00:00:14.160> why<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.580> going<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.089> because

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
now the reason why it's going is because

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.870 
now the reason why it's going is because
they<00:00:15.599> built<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.870> brand<00:00:16.170> new<00:00:16.310> Sun<00:00:17.310> hill<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.760> old

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
they built a brand new Sun hill and old

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.820 
they built a brand new Sun hill and old
people's<00:00:18.180> home<00:00:18.359> right<00:00:18.840> next<00:00:19.140> door<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.380> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
people's home right next door to it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.480 
people's home right next door to it
so<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.760> old<00:00:21.150> building<00:00:21.449> needs<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.439> come<00:00:22.920> down

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
so this old building needs to come down

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.589 
so this old building needs to come down
but<00:00:24.050> there<00:00:25.050> are<00:00:25.310> some<00:00:26.310> bees<00:00:26.580> living<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
but there are some bees living in the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.110 
but there are some bees living in the
building<00:00:27.779> now<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:29.119> initially<00:00:30.119> knew<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:31.050> one

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
building now we initially knew about one

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
building now we initially knew about one
feral<00:00:33.120> honey<00:00:33.750> bee<00:00:34.020> colony<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> building

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
feral honey bee colony in the building

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
feral honey bee colony in the building
and<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.910> has<00:00:36.030> been<00:00:36.210> there<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:36.780> seven<00:00:37.350> or

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
and it has been there for about seven or

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.450 
and it has been there for about seven or
eight<00:00:37.620> years<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:39.020> I've<00:00:40.020> agreed<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.829> go<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
eight years and I've agreed to go in and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
eight years and I've agreed to go in and
rescue<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:43.200> bees<00:00:43.590> rescue<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.340> colony<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.870> we

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
rescue the bees rescue the colony but we

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.090 
rescue the bees rescue the colony but we
have<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.289> discovered<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.890> there<00:00:47.070> are

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
have now discovered that there are

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.319 
have now discovered that there are
actually<00:00:47.610> three<00:00:49.190> hives<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.520> three<00:00:50.820> colonies

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
actually three hives or three colonies

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.709 
actually three hives or three colonies
in<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.260> building<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:54.000> means<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.570> our

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
in the building and that means that our

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.500 
in the building and that means that our
workload<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.590> has<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.250> traveled<00:00:56.699> but

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
workload for that has now traveled but

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.959 
workload for that has now traveled but
if<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.320> able<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.949> rescue<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> able

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
if we are able to rescue them and able

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.930 
if we are able to rescue them and able
to<00:01:00.059> save<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.870> gonna<00:01:00.960> start<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
to save them we're gonna start up a

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.060 
to save them we're gonna start up a
community<00:01:03.260> beekeeping<00:01:04.260> project<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.949> get

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
community beekeeping project and get

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.670 
community beekeeping project and get
lots<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> other<00:01:05.760> people<00:01:06.060> involved<00:01:06.680> in

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
lots of other people involved in

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.310 
lots of other people involved in
beekeeping<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.990> those

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
beekeeping this is one of those

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.000 
beekeeping this is one of those
colonies<00:01:12.130> we<00:01:12.310> weren't<00:01:12.550> aware<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.650> it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
colonies we weren't aware of and it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.280 
colonies we weren't aware of and it
looks<00:01:15.250> quite<00:01:15.610> recent<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:17.110> comb<00:01:17.560> is

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
looks quite recent the comb is

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.460 
looks quite recent the comb is
light-colored

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.440 

and<00:01:23.340> looks<00:01:23.790> very<00:01:23.880> busy<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:26.370> next<00:01:26.670> door<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and looks very busy the next door is

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.470 
and looks very busy the next door is
what<00:01:27.810> looks<00:01:28.110> like

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
what looks like

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.410 
what looks like
wasps<00:01:30.290> nest

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
wasps nest

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:39.450 
wasps nest
I<00:01:31.450> know<00:01:31.870> what<00:01:32.170> is<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.470> again

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.280 

this<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.270> one<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.570> we<00:01:40.720> knew<00:01:40.900> about

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.210 

and<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:44.490> looks<00:01:44.700> quite<00:01:45.030> old<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.900> it's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and it looks quite old and it's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.780 
and it looks quite old and it's
it's<00:01:47.610> quite<00:01:47.850> messy<00:01:48.120> inside<00:01:48.510> and<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it's quite messy inside and this is the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.280 
it's quite messy inside and this is the
second<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.660> we<00:01:51.840> didn't<00:01:52.080> know<00:01:52.170> about

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
second one we didn't know about

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.160 
second one we didn't know about
beforehand<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.470> very<00:01:56.460> big<00:01:57.170> certainly

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
beforehand and it is very big certainly

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.880 
beforehand and it is very big certainly
lots<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.440> comb

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.670 

must<00:02:01.430> be<00:02:01.610> filled<00:02:01.940> bees<00:02:02.840> that's<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.290> amperage

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
must be filled bees that's the amperage

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.340 
must be filled bees that's the amperage
that<00:02:03.740> one<00:02:04.010> of<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.160> colony<00:02:04.550> uses<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.540> get

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
that one of the colony uses to get

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.809 
that one of the colony uses to get
access<00:02:06.560> to

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.559 

it's<00:02:10.650> nest

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
it's nest

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's nest
I'd<00:02:13.930> assume<00:02:14.319> out

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.190 

you<00:02:16.849> can<00:02:17.030> see

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you can see

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.190 
you can see
on<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
on the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.490 
on the
first<00:02:21.650> floor

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.690 

or<00:02:28.500> two<00:02:28.680> days<00:02:28.890> ago<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.670> checked<00:02:30.300> out<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:31.700> three

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
or two days ago we checked out the three

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.260 
or two days ago we checked out the three
foul<00:02:33.240> honeybee<00:02:33.810> colonies<00:02:34.320> here<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:35.000> Sun<00:02:36.000> Hill

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
foul honeybee colonies here in Sun Hill

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.660 
foul honeybee colonies here in Sun Hill
and<00:02:38.000> decided<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.990> could<00:02:40.260> move<00:02:41.160> them<00:02:41.460> and

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
and decided that we could move them and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.900 
and decided that we could move them and
two<00:02:42.630> days<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.350> we're<00:02:44.100> here<00:02:44.340> early<00:02:44.520> in<00:02:44.790> the

with<00:02:54.390> all<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> bees<00:02:55.280> into<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:57.080> brood<00:02:58.080> box

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
with all the bees into this brood box

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
with all the bees into this brood box
and<00:02:59.300> then<00:03:00.300> close<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:00.960> up<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.440> leave<00:03:02.310> it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
and then close it up and leave it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.700 
and then close it up and leave it
standing<00:03:02.640> for<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> few<00:03:03.900> days<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.320> hopefully

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
standing for a few days and hopefully

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.040 
standing for a few days and hopefully
the<00:03:04.830> bees<00:03:05.010> will<00:03:05.250> settle<00:03:05.520> down<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.210> then<00:03:06.870> we'll

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
the bees will settle down and then we'll

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.420 
the bees will settle down and then we'll
take<00:03:07.260> them<00:03:07.470> away<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.390> new<00:03:10.640> site<00:03:11.640> temporarily

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
take them away to a new site temporarily

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.630 
take them away to a new site temporarily
as<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.610> can<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:14.940> they<00:03:15.150> seem<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.900> quite

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
as you can see they seem to be quite

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.300 
as you can see they seem to be quite
Placid<00:03:17.640> at<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.030> moment<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.920> hopefully

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
Placid at the moment so hopefully

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:37.120 
Placid at the moment so hopefully
they'll<00:03:20.490> stay<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.770> during<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.920> move

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.220 

I<00:03:37.220> was<00:03:37.730> hoping<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.210> was<00:03:38.300> all<00:03:38.630> going<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.930> come<00:03:39.050> up

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
I was hoping it was all going to come up

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.960 
I was hoping it was all going to come up
one<00:03:39.470> big<00:03:39.770> lump<00:03:40.070> but<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.400> don't<00:03:40.640> think<00:03:40.790> I'm<00:03:40.880> gonna

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
one big lump but I don't think I'm gonna

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.070 
one big lump but I don't think I'm gonna
be<00:03:41.060> able<00:03:41.210> to<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:42.500> do<00:03:42.650> that

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.100 

well<00:03:48.560> of

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
well of

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.110 
well of
I<00:03:50.200> managed<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.860> capture<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.610> whole<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
I managed to capture the whole of the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.570 
I managed to capture the whole of the
comedy<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:56.110> now<00:03:56.350> in<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.590> box<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.400> it

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
comedy and it's now in the box and it

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.550 
comedy and it's now in the box and it
went<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.970> lot<00:03:58.090> easier<00:03:58.510> than<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:58.750> expected

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
went in a lot easier than I expected

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.490 
went in a lot easier than I expected
and<00:03:59.910> we<00:04:00.910> think<00:04:01.210> we've<00:04:01.690> caught<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.050> Queen<00:04:02.290> as

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
and we think we've caught the Queen as

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.800 
and we think we've caught the Queen as
well<00:04:02.760> which<00:04:03.760> is<00:04:03.790> why<00:04:04.030> all<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.330> bees<00:04:04.540> are

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
well which is why all the bees are

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.450 
well which is why all the bees are
staying<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.440> box<00:04:05.650> because<00:04:06.070> they<00:04:06.280> will

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
staying in the box because they will

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.200 
staying in the box because they will
stay<00:04:06.730> with<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.090> Queen<00:04:07.330> so<00:04:07.830> we're<00:04:08.830> gonna<00:04:09.210> close

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
stay with the Queen so we're gonna close

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.920 
stay with the Queen so we're gonna close
this<00:04:10.450> off<00:04:10.690> now<00:04:10.990> and<00:04:11.590> we<00:04:11.830> should<00:04:12.100> leave<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.520> a

it's going to be a complete mess now
normally<00:05:18.970> you<00:05:19.060> would<00:05:19.180> try<00:05:19.450> and<00:05:19.510> cut<00:05:20.320> it<00:05:20.440> out

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
normally you would try and cut it out

normally you would try and cut it out
and<00:05:20.830> put<00:05:21.490> it<00:05:21.580> into<00:05:21.850> frames<00:05:22.210> but<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.960> know

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
and put it into frames but you know

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.270 
and put it into frames but you know
frankly<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.560> just<00:05:23.740> wasn't<00:05:24.070> going<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.220> happen

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
frankly it just wasn't going to happen

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.760 
frankly it just wasn't going to happen
because<00:05:24.940> one<00:05:25.390> we<00:05:26.050> just<00:05:26.080> don't<00:05:26.380> have<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.530> time

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
because one we just don't have the time

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.230 
because one we just don't have the time
to<00:05:26.919> do<00:05:27.040> it<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.310> secondly<00:05:27.669> if<00:05:27.790> we<00:05:27.850> had

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
to do it and secondly if we had

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.010 
to do it and secondly if we had
it<00:05:28.870> was<00:05:28.990> just<00:05:29.199> too<00:05:29.470> messy<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:30.190> be<00:05:30.789> able<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.150> cut

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
it was just too messy to be able to cut

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.070 
it was just too messy to be able to cut
it<00:05:32.050> neatly<00:05:32.410> into<00:05:33.130> frames<00:05:33.490> so<00:05:34.030> we<00:05:34.419> are<00:05:34.750> stuck

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
it neatly into frames so we are stuck

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.600 
it neatly into frames so we are stuck
with<00:05:35.110> putting<00:05:35.530> it<00:05:35.680> into<00:05:35.800> here<00:05:36.130> so<00:05:36.340> what<00:05:36.460> we've

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
with putting it into here so what we've

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.990 
with putting it into here so what we've
done<00:05:36.789> it<00:05:37.000> is<00:05:37.150> put<00:05:37.599> a<00:05:38.160> super<00:05:39.160> on<00:05:39.310> top<00:05:39.699> with<00:05:39.970> some

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
done it is put a super on top with some

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.080 
done it is put a super on top with some
frames<00:05:40.539> in<00:05:40.900> they<00:05:41.500> will<00:05:41.650> end<00:05:41.800> up<00:05:41.949> hanging<00:05:42.729> a<00:05:42.970> lot

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
frames in they will end up hanging a lot

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.080 
frames in they will end up hanging a lot
of<00:05:43.240> comb<00:05:43.780> from<00:05:44.110> underneath<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.919> super<00:05:45.280> but

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
of comb from underneath the super but

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.089 
of comb from underneath the super but
it'll<00:05:46.479> give<00:05:46.660> us<00:05:46.690> some<00:05:46.930> degree<00:05:47.259> of<00:05:47.380> control<00:05:47.830> and

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
it'll give us some degree of control and

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.820 
it'll give us some degree of control and
management<00:05:48.400> on<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.509> top<00:05:49.810> of<00:05:50.110> the<00:05:50.289> hive<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.770> be

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
management on the top of the hive to be

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.129 
management on the top of the hive to be
able<00:05:50.949> to<00:05:51.069> have<00:05:51.250> frames<00:05:51.639> that<00:05:51.940> we<00:05:52.090> can<00:05:52.240> take<00:05:52.930> out

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
able to have frames that we can take out

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.040 
able to have frames that we can take out
and<00:05:53.380> it<00:05:53.470> stops<00:05:53.740> them<00:05:53.979> hanging<00:05:54.729> one<00:05:55.300> comb<00:05:55.690> from

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
and it stops them hanging one comb from

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.730 
and it stops them hanging one comb from
the<00:05:56.229> roof<00:05:56.380> of<00:05:57.069> the<00:05:57.460> hive<00:05:57.669> as<00:05:58.000> well<00:05:58.690> so<00:05:59.110> there<00:05:59.530> we

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
the roof of the hive as well so there we

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.080 
the roof of the hive as well so there we
are

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090

three<00:06:23.349> days<00:06:23.380> after<00:06:23.889> we<00:06:24.220> first<00:06:24.490> got<00:06:24.849> the

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
three days after we first got the

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.600 
three days after we first got the
colonies<00:06:25.960> into<00:06:26.169> the<00:06:26.289> hives<00:06:26.590> we've<00:06:27.130> got<00:06:27.280> one<00:06:27.520> of

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
colonies into the hives we've got one of

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.820 
colonies into the hives we've got one of
them<00:06:27.729> here<00:06:29.909> it's<00:06:30.909> not<00:06:31.090> entirely<00:06:31.870> as<00:06:32.199> we<00:06:32.500> wanted

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
them here it's not entirely as we wanted

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.110 
them here it's not entirely as we wanted
it<00:06:32.979> because<00:06:34.500> where<00:06:35.500> the<00:06:35.770> each<00:06:36.190> colony

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
it because where the each colony

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.779 
it because where the each colony
originally<00:06:37.750> was<00:06:37.990> the<00:06:38.830> bees<00:06:39.039> had<00:06:39.250> started<00:06:39.669> to

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 
originally was the bees had started to

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:43.110 
originally was the bees had started to
cluster<00:06:40.270> there<00:06:40.479> as<00:06:41.050> well<00:06:41.349> but<00:06:41.889> each<00:06:42.039> hive<00:06:42.340> had

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
cluster there as well but each hive had

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.140 
cluster there as well but each hive had
bees<00:06:43.509> in<00:06:43.840> as<00:06:44.680> well<00:06:45.039> so<00:06:45.370> what<00:06:45.729> we've<00:06:45.880> tried<00:06:45.909> to

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
bees in as well so what we've tried to

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.110 
bees in as well so what we've tried to
do<00:06:46.389> is<00:06:46.690> collect<00:06:47.050> the<00:06:47.289> bees<00:06:47.789> from<00:06:48.789> where

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
do is collect the bees from where

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.580 
do is collect the bees from where
they're<00:06:49.270> being<00:06:49.419> clustering<00:06:49.990> and<00:06:50.169> then<00:06:50.289> drop

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
they're being clustering and then drop

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.990 
they're being clustering and then drop
them<00:06:50.740> into<00:06:50.919> the<00:06:51.539> respective<00:06:52.539> hives<00:06:52.870> and<00:06:54.000> these

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
them into the respective hives and these

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.619 
them into the respective hives and these
are<00:06:55.240> now<00:06:56.190> ready<00:06:57.190> to<00:06:57.520> go<00:06:57.880> down<00:06:58.180> to<00:06:58.780> our<00:06:58.810> Acree
