we've<00:00:07.150> got<00:00:07.330> a<00:00:07.360> number<00:00:07.480> of<00:00:07.600> soldiers<00:00:07.900> out<00:00:08.320> here

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
we've got a number of soldiers out here

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.730 
we've got a number of soldiers out here
on<00:00:08.770> this<00:00:08.889> exercise<00:00:09.160> that<00:00:09.580> have<00:00:10.210> not<00:00:10.420> had<00:00:10.740> any

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
on this exercise that have not had any

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.160 
on this exercise that have not had any
winter<00:00:12.250> warfare<00:00:12.549> training<00:00:13.180> experience<00:00:13.719> our

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
winter warfare training experience our

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.100 
winter warfare training experience our
basic<00:00:14.650> winter<00:00:14.920> warfare<00:00:15.129> training<00:00:16.110> hasn't

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
basic winter warfare training hasn't

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.040 
basic winter warfare training hasn't
been<00:00:17.500> done<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.010> same<00:00:18.190> degree<00:00:18.460> that<00:00:18.490> it<00:00:18.699> was

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
been done to the same degree that it was

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.470 
been done to the same degree that it was
ten<00:00:20.050> years<00:00:20.289> ago<00:00:20.640> five<00:00:21.640> years<00:00:21.940> ago<00:00:22.150> for<00:00:22.390> example

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
ten years ago five years ago for example

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.929 
ten years ago five years ago for example
so<00:00:23.259> this<00:00:23.740> is<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:23.920> tremendous<00:00:24.400> opportunity<00:00:24.550> for

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
so this is a tremendous opportunity for

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.240 
so this is a tremendous opportunity for
the<00:00:25.089> soldiers<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:25.689> reacquire<00:00:26.169> those<00:00:26.529> winter

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
the soldiers to reacquire those winter

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.349 
the soldiers to reacquire those winter
warfare<00:00:27.519> skills<00:00:28.419> at<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.470> unit<00:00:29.769> level<00:00:30.089> so<00:00:31.089> for

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
warfare skills at the unit level so for

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.840 
warfare skills at the unit level so for
example<00:00:31.810> what<00:00:31.990> it<00:00:32.079> takes<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.529> shoot<00:00:33.490> move<00:00:33.730> and

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
example what it takes to shoot move and

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.520 
example what it takes to shoot move and
communicate<00:00:33.940> in<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.780> harsh<00:00:34.960> environment<00:00:35.140> of

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
communicate in the harsh environment of

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.770 
communicate in the harsh environment of
the<00:00:35.650> north<00:00:35.860> something<00:00:36.430> like<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:37.600> this

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
the north something like in this

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.590 
the north something like in this
environment<00:00:38.079> our<00:00:38.680> normal<00:00:39.129> tent<00:00:39.640> routine<00:00:40.059> how

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
environment our normal tent routine how

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.510 
environment our normal tent routine how
that<00:00:40.840> is<00:00:41.020> how<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:41.860> is<00:00:42.010> done<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.340> how<00:00:42.460> to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
that is how that is done and how to

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.790 
that is how that is done and how to
basically<00:00:42.969> survive<00:00:43.629> in<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.170> harsh<00:00:44.320> climate

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
basically survive in the harsh climate

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.860 
basically survive in the harsh climate
that<00:00:45.460> exists<00:00:45.879> in<00:00:45.969> Canada's<00:00:46.329> north<00:00:46.570> so<00:00:46.750> it's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
that exists in Canada's north so it's

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.560 
that exists in Canada's north so it's
been<00:00:47.020> tremendous<00:00:47.440> for<00:00:47.559> that<00:00:47.680> point<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:47.949> view

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
been tremendous for that point of view

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.099 
been tremendous for that point of view
so<00:00:49.570> that's<00:00:49.960> one<00:00:50.140> aspect<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.620> other<00:00:50.649> aspect<00:00:51.100> is

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
so that's one aspect the other aspect is

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.569 
so that's one aspect the other aspect is
using<00:00:53.109> our<00:00:53.199> equipment<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:53.769> determining<00:00:54.460> how

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
using our equipment and determining how

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.869 
using our equipment and determining how
reliable<00:00:55.149> it<00:00:55.329> really<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:57.640> harsh

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
reliable it really is in this harsh

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.880 
reliable it really is in this harsh
environment<00:00:57.969> so<00:00:58.480> it's<00:00:58.660> been<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:58.899> very<00:00:59.050> good

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
environment so it's been a very good

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.279 
environment so it's been a very good
opportunity<00:01:00.489> for<00:01:00.519> the<00:01:00.670> soldiers<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.289> gain

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
opportunity for the soldiers to gain

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.220 
opportunity for the soldiers to gain
more<00:01:03.160> awareness<00:01:03.429> of<00:01:03.699> their<00:01:03.820> equipment<00:01:04.230> and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
more awareness of their equipment and

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.710 
more awareness of their equipment and
and<00:01:05.920> gain<00:01:06.160> more<00:01:06.400> trust<00:01:06.790> quite<00:01:07.060> frankly<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.600> our

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
and gain more trust quite frankly in our

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.630 
and gain more trust quite frankly in our
in<00:01:07.990> our<00:01:08.140> procedures<00:01:08.650> and<00:01:08.860> our<00:01:09.310> ability<00:01:09.610> to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
in our procedures and our ability to

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.980 
in our procedures and our ability to
operate<00:01:09.730> in<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.120> north<00:01:15.540> we're<00:01:16.540> finding<00:01:16.870> that

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
operate in the north we're finding that

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.800 
operate in the north we're finding that
a<00:01:17.050> lot<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.650> more<00:01:17.950> senior<00:01:18.370> soldiers<00:01:18.810> are

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
a lot of the more senior soldiers are

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.590 
a lot of the more senior soldiers are
very<00:01:19.870> aware<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:21.340> Arctic<00:01:21.820> operations<00:01:22.300> because

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
very aware of Arctic operations because

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.150 
very aware of Arctic operations because
they<00:01:22.720> have<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:23.080> experience<00:01:23.440> it's<00:01:24.070> the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
they have that experience it's the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.590 
they have that experience it's the
younger<00:01:24.520> soldiers<00:01:24.760> that<00:01:25.090> are<00:01:25.180> learning<00:01:25.390> it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
younger soldiers that are learning it

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.420 
younger soldiers that are learning it
for<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.840> first<00:01:26.050> time<00:01:26.290> but<00:01:26.770> all<00:01:26.890> those<00:01:27.010> lessons

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
for the first time but all those lessons

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.850 
for the first time but all those lessons
are<00:01:27.580> being<00:01:27.790> passed<00:01:27.970> on<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:28.810> we're<00:01:29.230> we're<00:01:29.740> able

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
are being passed on so we're we're able

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.240 
are being passed on so we're we're able
to<00:01:30.040> regenerate<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:31.240> experience<00:01:32.230> on<00:01:32.410> winter

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
to regenerate that experience on winter

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.150 
to regenerate that experience on winter
warfare<00:01:33.480> training<00:01:34.480> and<00:01:35.320> operations<00:01:35.950> and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
warfare training and operations and

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.640 
warfare training and operations and
we'll<00:01:37.120> be<00:01:37.180> much<00:01:37.360> better<00:01:37.660> off<00:01:37.780> as<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.170> result<00:01:38.530> of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
we'll be much better off as a result of

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.620 
we'll be much better off as a result of
that<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:38.980> our<00:01:39.340> intent<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.970> continue<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.420> do

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
that and our intent is to continue to do

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.290 
that and our intent is to continue to do
exercises<00:01:41.230> like<00:01:41.440> this<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:42.130> other<00:01:42.640> locations

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
exercises like this in other locations

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.780 
exercises like this in other locations
in<00:01:43.480> order<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.170> continue<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.620> build<00:01:44.830> upon<00:01:45.220> that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
in order to continue to build upon that

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.150 
in order to continue to build upon that
winter<00:01:46.690> warfare<00:01:46.900> experience<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.040> we

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
winter warfare experience so that we

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.800 
winter warfare experience so that we
don't<00:01:48.310> lose<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:49.510> awareness<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
don't lose that awareness and that that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.280 
don't lose that awareness and that that
professionalism<00:01:52.810> for<00:01:53.230> for<00:01:53.650> Canada's<00:01:54.040> north
