 the marshlands then I have here already the 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.720
 ingredients the tomato as my said 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.500
 partner in the palaces is called the 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.870

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.240
 tomato in a main thing that we have 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.260
 the palaces the rice of the mudflats 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.260
 the affect 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:40.289
 let's mark what is the duck first 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.289
 here I have it sliced 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.000
 we mark it I put the salt 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 and pepper once this we mark by 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.219
 one side and another and take the color 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.040
 we remove it and I put the two 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.760
 types of wine 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.540
 one is the oloroso and the other is the wine 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.130
 White 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.430
 When this happens we will let 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.090
 evaporate and when it is ready we will 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.460
 give the touch now of the sofrito this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 sofrito is done once this is what 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.170
 incorporated the duck 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.330
 and once we leave it adds a bit of 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.750
 background that based on vegetables based 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.060
 veal bone and also a duck it 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.450
 we bake in the oven we cook it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.880
 for 10 or 12 hours later we had it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.430
 for a Chinese and then we leave again 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.010
 to reduce so that it is done as a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.230
 cream a cream that will give flavor in 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.960
 instead of adding water we are going to add this 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.810
 home made product to empower 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.660
 more good rice once 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.480
 we already have all this removed the duck and 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.860
 the sauce that I have there crushes it 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.230
 I pass by a Chinese 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.800
 the duck has 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.140
 one thing you have to leave it like an hour 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.630
 hour and a half at the time of cooking 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.630
 because it might be a bit hard and 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.730
 Not all dishes equal the same 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.220
 you can be half an hour an hour in your 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.860
 cooking and what you try now is 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.650
 put rice have already made 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.190
 a moment ago and we put by 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.310
 serving 80 grams is very important that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.460
 the rice has the exact dosage of 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.100
 water so that so that it leaves mellow or 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.960
 cardoso I quit I tried ago 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.610
 a sweet rice I feel has been added 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.310
 one part of rice with six in the background 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.340
 about 14 or 15 minutes this type of rice 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.560
 it's a fat rice from the marsh 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.630

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.600
 privilege to have as many products as 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.760

 marshes of the countryside that stream is 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.819

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.909

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.870

 the marshes have four colors on 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:28.629
 brown is when you silver 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:32.769

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.159
