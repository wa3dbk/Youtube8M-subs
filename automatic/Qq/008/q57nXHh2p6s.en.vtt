00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 cinnamon the most environmental television that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.519
 never thank you my dear still see nothing 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.250
 more what a beautiful thing today is with 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.380
 us this handsome and mariam that is going 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.260
 to explain that I would call welcome as 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
 is that we can walk with our 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.460
 pet next to our dog at 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.010
 side and that feels and well as well as that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.080
 make a parent communication today is very 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.359
 The question is simple patience 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.189
 and that we know that whoever is in charge 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.810
 are we behind because if you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.140
 we leave the dog that we 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.610
 send the already valimos understand me how you 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.860
 we have to do because I always see 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.520
 to those ladies who suddenly even without 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.040
 belt 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 puppy walks beside them them 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.899
 they say sit you feel that you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.000
 condition if forgiveness is a 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.800
 custom titles to conditions to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.809
 sit down when they get to the corners 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 for example the dog will reach the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.309
 corner and he's going to sit alone but that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.469
 it's with conditioning and work 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.450
 repetitive because then if I what 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.750
 I want to teach to walk next to Boris 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.050
 look look nice look here 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.810
 I live it I put it next to me and what 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.869
 I feel 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.610
 but with you it looks very easy but if I 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.790
 I try to do that with my dog 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.540
 what to do have boris eleven here in 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.540
 brisbane 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.980
 but values that you have to finish 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.960
 always on the left side has always 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.060
 always the vision is that that's why I'm the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.310
 donkey here what you feel did not give 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.970
 fear of the camera I fall in love I feel that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.640
 my life 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.190
 sit, sit, sit, sit, no, 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.600
 the camera does not make you feel good 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.090
 which is different come out in a park that 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.229
 he does not even know what's happening 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.320
 to Castro for ism in tourism come here the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.020
 days guides him after looking at the camera 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.640
 to the camera that happens that's a 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.160
 distractor for him and it's good to work 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.110
 with distractors always touch before the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.150
 camera is distracting I care 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.150
 Of course it tastes very well 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.020
 the camera and so we're going let's go let's go 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.490
 sitting boris very well 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.489
 It is very important that you always have a 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.349
 award that always kind of caress 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.540
 that I'm giving for example sitting 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.970
 You will focus hip to lay it 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.970
 he thought the caress or you give him sausage 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.840
 where he brought hidden Mary the prize 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.970
 so you have to come long long nothing 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.370
 then I will serve you die here see 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.070
 here here the laps the laps the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.280
 you turn the laps here here and you 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.290
 Stop and feel it not good to see you 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.390
 then I have a puppy is more 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.210
 easy to start training to do 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.180
 totally that you saw yourself smaller is 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.680
 better a belt and a strap a prize 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.660
 especially the little ones are never going 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.310
 to support of punishment because he to be 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.470
 pure encouragement already of punishment that 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.360
 means I'm going to hand out I 'm a myth 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.370
 it's a myth is a day that decorates itself 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.020
 hang up you have to know how to use it tevez is 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.970
 another topic what we talked about the other day 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.830
 not the negative necklace if you know how to be 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.810
 It can be a very good tool if you do not 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.670
 you know how to use the abuse, obviously 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.050
 to mistreat and you do not have to do that 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.970
 with them is not what happens that of 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.100
 soon we take our pets with 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.810
 coaches that I know like that is already 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.920
 I have had to see that they step on 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.870
 little feet so that health hits them not for 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.580
 that you feel if that puts you this 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.170
 necklace cited for punishment but they put them 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.700
 up here if they were only here until 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.590
 up and right now 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.239
 because so they do not feel passion 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:50.110
 then they are nothing else is a guy 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:52.510
 So, here here if it goes away 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.830
 forwards come here come here here 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.690
 here as sitting but not good 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.400
 I imagine when a container take I have 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.290
 long time training has three 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.540
 weeks that from that mobile or later and 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.069
 classes nothing more three times a week not 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.650
 it's both dogs are extremely 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.480
 smart and it's half an hour the class 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.640
 it's just nothing more than dedicating them and you 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.209
 most importantly I tell the boss you're 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.670
 you 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.799
 if you do not feel the first you feel 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.720
 the second see in summary give us the 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.360
 five most important tips so that 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.550
 learn our dogs to do what 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.400
 Boris knows how to make the government his collar 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.200
 a leash and collar his prize and what 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.870
 take a walk you can go 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.370
 working in the park on the streets is 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.500
 very important that if you want me not to 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.000
 get off the sidewalk at each corner 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.760
 I'm sorry that's what I was telling you 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.290
 when it comes to sales, I do not know how 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.720
 they knocking over them with one 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.680
 I just tell you if you get the dog 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.380
 it's a little bit here 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.410
 come here for example longer highly 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.789
 doris payne here you go talking soft 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.560
 mind please the soul to science 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.870
 because that's where they start to pull 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.430
 mistreat when the dog does not want to 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.800
 I would love to have two hours here 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.990

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.660
 really little time and this but already 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.600
 is not worked but please the 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.310
 patience is the most important thing there 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.650
 hear if we in a little while do not 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.020
 we understand this is a puppy - but that 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.419
 they are very intelligent then they know that 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.030
 it's amazing a love to brennan a 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.440
 puppy to another puppy and another a lot if 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.539
 I have a great Dane who trains my 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.220
 dogs and gives them control of sidewalks and 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.190
 teaches them to sit still outside the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.620
 super me my favorite that is a golden 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.110

 He died and knows how to do everything and I never know 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.370

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.039
