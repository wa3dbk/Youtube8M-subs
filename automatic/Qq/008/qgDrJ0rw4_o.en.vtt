hello world this is jamison rubik guy
I've<00:00:03.449> had<00:00:03.720> many<00:00:03.929> requests<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.560> solve<00:00:04.799> a

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
I've had many requests to solve a

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.430 
I've had many requests to solve a
Rubik's<00:00:05.580> Cube<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.000> youtube<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.319> what

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
Rubik's Cube on youtube so that is what

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.709 
Rubik's Cube on youtube so that is what
i<00:00:07.500> plan<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.710> do<00:00:07.890> right<00:00:08.069> now<00:00:08.480> I'm<00:00:09.480> just<00:00:09.570> gonna

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
i plan to do right now I'm just gonna

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.839 
i plan to do right now I'm just gonna
move<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.960> camera<00:00:10.139> down<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.559> so<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> can<00:00:10.980> mix

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
move the camera down here so I can mix

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:26.509 
move the camera down here so I can mix
it<00:00:11.969> up<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:24.260> I'll<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.289> toss<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
it up for you I'll just toss it in the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.310 
it up for you I'll just toss it in the
air<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.470> can't<00:00:28.740> keep<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.039> planner<00:00:33.170> all<00:00:34.170> right

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
air so I can't keep a planner all right

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.310 
air so I can't keep a planner all right
I<00:00:34.640> think<00:00:35.640> that's<00:00:35.760> pretty<00:00:35.910> mixed<00:00:36.239> up<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.780> yeah

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I think that's pretty mixed up so yeah

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.720 
I think that's pretty mixed up so yeah
I'm<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.739> start<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.430> should<00:00:41.579> take<00:00:41.700> me

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I'm going to start it should take me

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.180 
I'm going to start it should take me
about<00:00:41.850> 40<00:00:42.300> seconds<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:45.980> see<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.100> can

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
about 40 seconds I think see if I can

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.870 
about 40 seconds I think see if I can
get<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> camera<00:00:47.700> align<00:00:47.850> correctly

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.340 

just<00:00:54.450> have<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.050> it'll<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.290> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
just have to do like that it'll be a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.770 
just have to do like that it'll be a
little<00:00:55.500> awkward<00:00:55.650> but<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.190> it

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.570 

so<00:01:00.379> here<00:01:00.559> I'm<00:01:00.680> using<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.039> X<00:01:01.219> method<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:04.309> found

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
so here I'm using the X method and found

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:24.940 
so here I'm using the X method and found
on<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.729> website<00:01:12.729> camera<00:01:13.729> can't<00:01:13.909> keep<00:01:14.060> up<00:01:23.950> this

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
on a website camera can't keep up this

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.109 
on a website camera can't keep up this
cube<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:25.610> when<00:01:25.729> I<00:01:25.759> bought<00:01:25.940> off<00:01:26.090> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
cube is just when I bought off the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.999 
cube is just when I bought off the
rubik's<00:01:26.450> back<00:01:26.600> home<00:01:26.810> in<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.020> pad<00:01:27.350> for<00:01:27.680> years

there is the salt so I'll post this and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.930 
there is the salt so I'll post this and
let<00:01:57.350> me<00:01:57.409> know<00:01:57.500> what<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.710> think<00:01:57.800> also<00:01:58.369> I'm

really<00:01:59.509> watching<00:01:59.929> a<00:02:00.229> tutorial<00:02:00.830> on<00:02:01.220> how<00:02:01.280> to

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
really watching a tutorial on how to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.420 
really watching a tutorial on how to
solve<00:02:01.759> with<00:02:02.000> five<00:02:02.179> by<00:02:02.390> five<00:02:02.539> edges<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:03.430> can

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
solve with five by five edges I can

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.340 
solve with five by five edges I can
already<00:02:04.579> me<00:02:04.880> solve<00:02:05.210> I've<00:02:05.780> already<00:02:05.990> solved

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
already me solve I've already solved

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.740 
already me solve I've already solved
them<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:07.070> is<00:02:07.219> e<00:02:07.250> xin<00:02:07.579> this<00:02:07.729> is<00:02:07.820> Rubik's<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.299> can

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
them this is e xin this is Rubik's I can

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.359 
them this is e xin this is Rubik's I can
already<00:02:08.899> saw<00:02:09.140> solve<00:02:09.590> them<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:09.860> just<00:02:10.009> not<00:02:10.100> very

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
already saw solve them but just not very

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.039 
already saw solve them but just not very
fast<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:10.880> want<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> learn<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.329> two<00:02:11.510> pair<00:02:11.750> method

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
fast I want to learn the two pair method

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.110 
fast I want to learn the two pair method
like<00:02:13.040> where<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.340> solve<00:02:13.579> one<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.910> then<00:02:14.000> when

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
like where you solve one and then when

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.630 
like where you solve one and then when
you<00:02:14.180> pull<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.480> back<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:15.709> solves<00:02:16.220> another<00:02:16.280> pair

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
you pull it back it solves another pair

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.020 
you pull it back it solves another pair
so<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.910> get<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.480> done<00:02:17.690> at<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.900> same<00:02:18.049> time

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
so you get to done at the same time

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.370 
so you get to done at the same time
please<00:02:20.030> post<00:02:20.329> a<00:02:20.420> video<00:02:20.600> response<00:02:20.690> if<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.230> can

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.770 
youtube for it right now are either the
cubes<00:02:26.360> too<00:02:26.510> far<00:02:26.720> away<00:02:26.810> or<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:28.430> can't<00:02:29.329> understand

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
cubes too far away or I can't understand

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.940 
cubes too far away or I can't understand
the<00:02:29.840> people<00:02:29.989> whether<00:02:30.320> it's<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.799> bad
