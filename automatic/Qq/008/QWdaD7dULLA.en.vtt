the phone is totally discharged so it

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.400 
the phone is totally discharged so it
means<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:04.799> there<00:00:05.130> are<00:00:05.299> different

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
devastated for example

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.900 
devastated for example
let's<00:00:09.260> say<00:00:09.410> you<00:00:09.470> have<00:00:09.770> a<00:00:09.800> Banach<00:00:10.220> was<00:00:10.430> received

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
let's say you have a Banach was received

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.590 
let's say you have a Banach was received
from<00:00:11.000> your<00:00:11.300> magic<00:00:11.570> you

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.180 

your<00:00:15.600> place<00:00:15.750> here

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
your place here

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
your place here
so<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.610> can<00:00:17.940> use<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.120> alone<00:00:18.840> without<00:00:19.050> any

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
so you can use it alone without any

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.310 
so you can use it alone without any
possible

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
possible

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.200 
possible
and<00:00:21.770> you<00:00:21.890> can<00:00:22.039> even<00:00:22.160> add<00:00:22.460> turn<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.850> screen<00:00:23.060> off

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
and you can even add turn the screen off

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.560 
and you can even add turn the screen off
it<00:00:23.990> was<00:00:24.199> test<00:00:24.470> here<00:00:24.760> by<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:25.820> way<00:00:26.000> big<00:00:26.300> screen

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
Main Street see the similar stream but

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.950 
Main Street see the similar stream but
here<00:00:32.900> we<00:00:33.110> never<00:00:33.350> basically<00:00:33.530> mayor

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 

which<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.829> used<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.399> change<00:00:38.969> their<00:00:39.210> between

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
which we used to change their between

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.770 
which we used to change their between
applications<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.320> back<00:00:40.469> side

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
applications on the back side

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.830 
applications on the back side
very<00:00:42.260> different<00:00:43.010> complications

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.650 

where<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> rincon<00:00:47.010> del<00:00:47.160> Sol

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
where the rincon del Sol

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.750 
where the rincon del Sol
forward<00:00:49.410> from<00:00:49.590> A<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.710> B

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 

on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> back<00:00:54.269> side<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.719> well<00:00:54.929> so<00:00:55.769> you<00:00:55.920> can

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
on the back side as well so you can

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
on the back side as well so you can
always<00:00:56.309> reach<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.789> final<00:00:57.000> destination

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.319 

and<00:01:00.989> by<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.920> are<00:01:01.949> remove<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.820> soft

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
and by the way we are remove the soft

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.680 
and by the way we are remove the soft
android<00:01:03.750> buttons<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.420> introduce<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
android buttons and we introduce the

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.590 
android buttons and we introduce the
system<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.409> gesture<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.979> well<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.490> can

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
system of gesture as well so you can

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.020 
system of gesture as well so you can
swipe<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.840> different<00:01:10.200> gesture<00:01:10.700> this<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
swipe a different gesture this is like a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.749 
swipe a different gesture this is like a
back<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.930> oh<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.490> much<00:01:14.729> more

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759
