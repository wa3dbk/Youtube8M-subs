website they've released a tool to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.620 
website they've released a tool to
create<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
create a

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.710 
create a
removable<00:02:13.900> media<00:02:14.260> device<00:02:15.220> with<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> DVD<00:02:16.150> or<00:02:16.180> CD

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
removable media device with a DVD or CD

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.110 
removable media device with a DVD or CD
that<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.140> can<00:02:17.260> install<00:02:18.100> Windows<00:02:18.520> 10<00:02:18.550> through

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
that you can install Windows 10 through

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.330 
that you can install Windows 10 through
and<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.230> better<00:02:20.620> method<00:02:20.950> in<00:02:21.250> my

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
and this is a better method in my

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.700 
and this is a better method in my
opinion<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.000> upgrading<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.470> event

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
opinion to upgrading so in the event

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.320 
opinion to upgrading so in the event
that<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.010> cannot<00:02:24.310> upgrade<00:02:24.550> through<00:02:25.000> Windows

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
that you cannot upgrade through Windows

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.240 
that you cannot upgrade through Windows
Update<00:02:25.480> don't<00:02:26.020> worry<00:02:26.290> about<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:26.920> go

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
Update don't worry about it you can go

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.650
