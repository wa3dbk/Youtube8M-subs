kind of taken that and ran with it too

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.670 
kind of taken that and ran with it too
it<00:00:14.610> seems<00:00:14.820> fitting<00:00:15.240> because<00:00:16.139> essentially

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
see right here the me again the AI

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
see right here the me again the AI
drives<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.750> animation<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.460> player

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
drives the animation so the player

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.060 
drives the animation so the player
position<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.509> irrelevant<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.770> fact

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
position is irrelevant here the fact

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.149 
position is irrelevant here the fact

at this point in front of limas has no

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
position they're both in the air to make

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.850 
position they're both in the air to make
a<00:01:35.400> tackle<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:36.780> again<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
a tackle but then again you get this you

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.249 
a tackle but then again you get this you
know<00:01:37.950> warping<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:39.000> again<00:01:39.450> regardless

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
know warping you know again regardless

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.440 
know warping you know again regardless
of<00:01:40.380> their<00:01:40.500> position<00:01:41.070> their<00:01:41.280> body<00:01:41.790> position<00:01:42.329> on

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
of their position their body position on

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
of their position their body position on
the<00:01:42.570> field<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.500> animation<00:01:44.189> has<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.640> come

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the field the animation has to come

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.179 
the field the animation has to come
through<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.899> means<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> class<00:01:46.680> ends<00:01:47.100> up

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
through so this means the class ends up

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.719 
through so this means the class ends up

know where the animation can work and

know where the animation can work and
you<00:02:32.579> end<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:32.879> with<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.269> goofy<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.739> know<00:02:34.859> I'll

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
you end up with just goofy you know I'll

you end up with just goofy you know I'll
even<00:02:35.700> call<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.030> dirty<00:02:36.450> looking<00:02:36.930> plays<00:02:37.260> like

even call it dirty looking plays like

this<00:02:37.920> another<00:02:38.730> good<00:02:38.939> example<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.599> something

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
this another good example of something

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.229 
this another good example of something

that needs to be fixed from Mad moving
forward<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.290> really<00:02:43.560> inhibits

forward that really inhibits

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.940 
forward that really inhibits
realistic-looking<00:02:45.109> gameplay<00:02:46.109> more<00:02:46.769> than

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
realistic-looking gameplay more than

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.459 
realistic-looking gameplay more than
anything<00:02:47.159> else
