becomes important is that when we're in

becomes important is that when we're in
a<00:00:32.430> pathological<00:00:33.239> situation<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.350> always

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
a pathological situation it's we always

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.810 
a pathological situation it's we always
tend<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> blame<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> body<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.730> know

tend to blame the body you know
something's<00:00:36.180> wrong<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.540> body<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> turns

something's wrong with the body it turns

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.500 
something's wrong with the body it turns
out<00:00:37.230> no<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.920> body<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> reflection<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
out no the body is just a reflection of

out no the body is just a reflection of
what's<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.680> your<00:00:40.800> mind<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:42.000> we

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
what's going on in your mind and as we

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.150 
what's going on in your mind and as we
change<00:00:42.840> our<00:00:43.050> beliefs<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.559> our<00:00:43.710> attitudes

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
change our beliefs and our attitudes

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
change our beliefs and our attitudes
about<00:00:44.280> life<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.760> change<00:00:45.059> our<00:00:45.210> biology<00:00:45.750> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
about life we change our biology and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
about life we change our biology and
this<00:00:45.960> allows<00:00:46.230> people<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.649> heal<00:00:46.890> themselves<00:00:47.520> so

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
this allows people to heal themselves so

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.790 
this allows people to heal themselves so
for<00:00:48.300> example<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.660> talked<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.200> placebo

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
for example we talked about the placebo

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
for example we talked about the placebo
effect<00:00:49.829> we're<00:00:50.760> good<00:00:51.059> thoughts<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.809> actually

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
effect we're good thoughts can actually

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.200 
effect we're good thoughts can actually
heal<00:00:52.649> yourself<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> presence<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.940> sugar

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
heal yourself in the presence of a sugar

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.290 
heal yourself in the presence of a sugar
pill<00:00:54.680> but<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> also<00:00:56.010> brings<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.030> something

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
pill but it also brings it something

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.400 
pill but it also brings it something
that<00:00:57.420> most<00:00:57.539> people<00:00:57.629> aren't<00:00:57.960> familiar<00:00:58.170> with

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that most people aren't familiar with

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
that most people aren't familiar with
called<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> nocebo<00:00:59.460> effect<00:00:59.609> it's<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
called the nocebo effect it's just the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.049 
called the nocebo effect it's just the
opposite<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.379> says<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> negative<00:01:02.520> thought<00:01:02.699> can

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
opposite it says a negative thought can

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.920 
opposite it says a negative thought can
actually<00:01:03.660> cause<00:01:03.899> illness<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.650> even<00:01:04.799> kill<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
actually cause illness and even kill you

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.030 
actually cause illness and even kill you
just<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.380> belief<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.860> while

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
just because of the belief so while

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
just because of the belief so while
beliefs<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.580> heal<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.119> negative<00:01:10.020> beliefs

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
beliefs can heal you negative beliefs

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
beliefs can heal you negative beliefs
can<00:01:10.619> kill<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.580> positive<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.180> negative

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
can kill you so positive and negative

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.990 
can kill you so positive and negative
beliefs<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.110> equally<00:01:13.650> powerful<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.880> in

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
beliefs are equally powerful but in

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
beliefs are equally powerful but in
opposite<00:01:15.450> directions<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.500> actually

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
opposite directions we can actually

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.499 
opposite directions we can actually
scare<00:01:17.070> ourselves<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.640> death<00:01:17.759> count<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.330> an

the<00:01:52.170> new<00:01:52.380> biology<00:01:52.740> takes<00:01:53.250> us<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.579> that

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the new biology takes us out of that

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
the new biology takes us out of that
says<00:01:54.060> no<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.960> very<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.430> responsible<00:01:56.430> for

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.940 
says no we are very much responsible for
this<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.119> without<00:01:57.630> being<00:01:57.990> programmed<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this and without being programmed and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.700 
this and without being programmed and
taught<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.969> responsibility<00:02:00.710> we

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
taught that that responsibility we

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.560 
taught that that responsibility we
blindly<00:02:02.130> walk<00:02:02.369> through<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> world<00:02:02.820> feeling

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
blindly walk through the world feeling

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.660 
blindly walk through the world feeling
ourselves<00:02:04.170> victims<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.130> turns<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.460> if

ourselves victims and it turns out if

ourselves victims and it turns out if
we're<00:02:05.820> victims<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.329> only<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.659> our<00:02:06.840> own
