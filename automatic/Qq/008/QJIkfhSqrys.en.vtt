00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.730
 and good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.170
 new race for adriÃ¡n f1 esp and about 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.720
 the great prize of japan 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.670
 well I before the race had 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.820
 thought to speak today especially in this 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.590
 race then on the signings and other 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.529
 but of course after what happened 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.779
 is that it gives that relegated a second plane 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.160
 and most importantly, as all 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.980
 you know is the state of health of jules 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.989
 bianchi who has had that accident to 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.570
 lack of few laps to finish the 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.570
 I race a very serious accident and that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.640
 long time not lived in the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.890
 Formula 1 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.680
 in what is formula 1 in the race 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.809
 because as you all remember Maria de 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.200
 villota then also had an accident 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.240
 that reminded me of bianchi 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.930
 this was in 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.630
 a career sources but that by 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.030
 images that I have seen and so on 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.400
 pretty similar result and the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.600
 images are pretty strong you can 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.810
 see how unfortunately it has come out 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.660
 and the taste has gone to him but 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.430
 site at the least appropriate time and it's 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.830
 that I was just towing the tow 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.230
 subtle car that had crashed 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.850
 against the protections and there was just 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.310
 here then it has come out at that same point 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.850
 with such bad luck to end up 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.950
 direct against the witch and so 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.340
 that the images are seen so listen 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.240
 being quite destroyed and on its 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.180
 state of health 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.360
 I've been waiting until now that they're 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 1 and 10 to see if there was something 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.900
 something 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.159
 official and good it seems that his father 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.650
 has confirmed on French television 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.590
 that you are being operated and that you are in 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.560
 critical state 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.219
 and it seems that it has been traumatism 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.060
 quite important in the head so 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:08.440
 we hope that it can recover in the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.530
 next few hours you will already know something about 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.120
 safer but good so far the 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.310
 true that there has been very little 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.970
 information and especially in the race 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.220
 It has been pretty messy because I do not know 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.720
 He knew exactly what was going on was 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.470
 I knew he had left Bianchi and 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.020
 subtle but you could see 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.000
 does not know anything in particular you saw the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.830
 Subtle car image with the crane but 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.350
 not seen the Bianchi also said 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.530
 in ambulance on track the medical car 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.250
 and there was nothing in particular house that 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 he has known about the accident and good and 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.090
 focusing on what has been a bit 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.190
 great prize because with so much rain that has 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.710
 asked the beginning and the exit after 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.020
 of the security car it looked like it was going to 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.930
 last little the race at the end has given 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.130
 a little meteorology a truce and 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.070
 we have seen some laps 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.780
 interesting and the fight between hamilton and 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.050
 rosberg that in the end has won a 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.390
 hamilton and that is now more leader and 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.980
 In addition , the total points have been added to 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.990
 despite not having completed the total 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.140
 the race since it had exceeded the 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.360
 75 percent of this one so as I have 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.190
 said in hamilton is now more leader and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.200
 robert has been the second vettel 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.880
 third since despite not having 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.190
 passed in third position in that last 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.460
 come back like richard or he had not 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.120
 advanced up 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.130
 just return a previous one of the accident 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.230
 because how two laps are counted 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.870
 before the red flag on that turn 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.180
 was vettel in third position and has 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.510
 been where the end in the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.040
 podium a vettel that has already confirmed that 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.970
 is going to go redbull and already assured 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.420
 practically one hundred percent that is going 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.220
 to go to ferrari and alonso and this from where 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.340
 that vettel is going to ferrari is because 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.260
 consequence that alonso has decided 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.480
 some time ago and it was coming 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.690
 rumored in the last weeks of that 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.070
 has decided to abandon ferrari ferrari 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.500
 certainly it has been disastrous 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.740
 with the abandonment of alonso due to problems 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.470
 electronic and raikkonen that has not 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.640
 got scoring and that the path of 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.250
 alonso is probably the wave as 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.410
 I've seen tweets 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.050
 wave with a car image 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.840
 classics and they said that if they knew something about 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.300
 that car with the number 14 and obviously 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.410
 is the dorsal that has alonso and if 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.360
 have put is because he has some 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.630
 relationship despite not being confirmed 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.580
 can officially be taken for granted 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.660
 that alonso next year is going to fly 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.510
 honda mclaren and we'll see how that 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.100
 second chance it seems that 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.500
 alonso is going to give mclaren 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.320
 and the power of the engines 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.870
 bands and especially the reliability 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.810
 it is risky because it is already the first year 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.130
 after the wave return to formula1 and 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.140
 we will see and hope above all that it 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.940
 comes to fruition and well here ends 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.800
 the video but that you liked the 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.720
 gameplay because the news the truth 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.330
 that are not very nice but let's hope 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.710
 that in the end yes they are so that nothing 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.710
 come to the next greeting
