yeah yeah so the total switch switch to
the<00:00:40.129> nvidia<00:00:41.129> graphics<00:00:41.190> whenever<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.940> require

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the nvidia graphics whenever you require

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.670 
the nvidia graphics whenever you require
it<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:43.010> a<00:00:44.780> Wi-Fi<00:00:45.780> switch<00:00:45.840> wherever<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.469> want

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it is a Wi-Fi switch wherever you want

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.610 
it is a Wi-Fi switch wherever you want
it<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.160> there's<00:00:47.399> our<00:00:47.550> SD<00:00:48.059> slot<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:49.440> can
