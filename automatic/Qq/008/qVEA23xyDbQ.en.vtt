nowadays<00:01:21.470> what<00:01:21.979> do<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.130> think<00:01:22.189> of<00:01:22.460> them<00:01:23.049> they're

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
nowadays what do I think of them they're

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.390 
nowadays what do I think of them they're
not<00:01:24.170> too<00:01:24.320> bad<00:01:24.470> but<00:01:24.740> I'm<00:01:24.860> fortunate<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.310> this

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
not too bad but I'm fortunate in this

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.300 
not too bad but I'm fortunate in this
mode<00:01:25.640> they're<00:01:25.880> very<00:01:26.150> very<00:01:26.360> blocky<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.310> it's

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
mode they're very very blocky and it's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.130 
mode they're very very blocky and it's
not<00:01:28.400> about<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:28.820> can<00:01:29.060> using<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.780> ramps

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
not about you can using the ramps

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.780 
not about you can using the ramps
connect<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.680> lot<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:31.040> them<00:01:31.130> together<00:01:31.310> with<00:01:31.640> the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
connect a lot of them together with the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.700 
connect a lot of them together with the
bigger<00:01:32.150> battle<00:01:32.540> stations<00:01:32.960> like<00:01:33.079> countdown

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
bigger battle stations like countdown

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.120 
bigger battle stations like countdown
and<00:01:34.810> icon<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.049> battlefield<00:01:36.530> headquarters

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
and icon the battlefield headquarters

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.039

and<00:01:37.250> stuff<00:01:37.460> like<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.540> suppose<00:01:38.780> once

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
and stuff like that and I suppose once

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.210 
and stuff like that and I suppose once
you<00:01:39.170> get<00:01:39.350> them<00:01:39.470> all<00:01:39.590> together<00:01:39.710> with

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
you get them all together with

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.710 
you get them all together with
connectors<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:40.970> everything<00:01:41.360> like<00:01:41.420> it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
connectors and everything like it

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.359 
connectors and everything like it
doesn't<00:01:41.869> too<00:01:42.170> bad<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:42.649> just<00:01:42.680> on<00:01:43.130> their<00:01:43.250> own

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
doesn't too bad but just on their own

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.969 
doesn't too bad but just on their own
they're<00:01:43.759> very<00:01:44.000> very<00:01:44.149> blocky<00:01:44.799> anyway<00:01:45.799> right

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
they're very very blocky anyway right

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.399 
they're very very blocky anyway right
let's<00:01:46.159> just<00:01:46.310> start<00:01:46.490> with<00:01:46.579> ironworks<00:01:47.030> he<00:01:47.409> is

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
let's just start with ironworks he is

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.230 
let's just start with ironworks he is
obviously<00:01:48.860> some<00:01:49.040> sort<00:01:49.159> of<00:01:49.250> construction<00:01:49.939> site

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
obviously some sort of construction site

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.969 
obviously some sort of construction site
or<00:01:50.479> something<00:01:51.850> just<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:53.060> exactly<00:01:53.710> who<00:01:54.710> knows

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
or something just what exactly who knows

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.230 
or something just what exactly who knows
he<00:01:55.189> doesn't<00:01:55.340> really<00:01:55.549> matter<00:01:55.759> does<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.000> really

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
he doesn't really matter does it really

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.030 
he doesn't really matter does it really
comes<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.899> little<00:01:56.990> crane<00:01:57.469> and<00:01:57.710> everything<00:01:58.009> a

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
comes a little crane and everything a

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.800 
comes a little crane and everything a
red<00:01:58.369> one<00:01:58.640> there<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.180> then<00:01:59.299> from<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.600> does

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
red one there and then from that does

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.039 
red one there and then from that does
turn<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.430> that's<00:02:02.329> about<00:02:02.540> it<00:02:02.600> for<00:02:02.960> the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
turn like that that's about it for the

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.600 
turn like that that's about it for the
actual<00:02:03.350> gimmicks<00:02:04.009> that<00:02:04.130> you're<00:02:04.310> going<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.490> get

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
actual gimmicks that you're going to get

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.190 
actual gimmicks that you're going to get
on<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.850> actual<00:02:05.119> set<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.719> does<00:02:05.869> come<00:02:06.049> with<00:02:06.110> this

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
on the actual set it does come with this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.539 
on the actual set it does come with this
little<00:02:06.469> micro<00:02:06.829> master<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.219> course<00:02:07.399> this

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
little micro master of course this

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:08.319 
little micro master of course this
design<00:02:07.909> works

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
design works

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.920 
design works
here's<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.840> repaint<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.799> a<00:02:10.600> common<00:02:11.600> breeze<00:02:11.750> name

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
here's a repaint of a common breeze name

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.800 
here's a repaint of a common breeze name
but<00:02:12.079> he's<00:02:12.170> off<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.380> off-road<00:02:12.980> Patrol<00:02:13.810> that's

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
but he's off the off-road Patrol that's

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.479 
but he's off the off-road Patrol that's
bad<00:02:14.959> we<00:02:15.140> all<00:02:15.260> power<00:02:15.560> train<00:02:15.920> that's<00:02:16.130> it

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
bad we all power train that's it

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.449 
bad we all power train that's it
ah<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.230> he's<00:02:18.380> always<00:02:18.530> where<00:02:19.040> he's<00:02:19.190> alright

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
ah so he's always where he's alright

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.129 
ah so he's always where he's alright
readies<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:19.940> some<00:02:20.150> sort<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.390> light<00:02:20.540> tractor

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:21.139 
readies like some sort of light tractor

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.650 
readies like some sort of light tractor
trailer<00:02:21.500> isn't<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.799> long-nosed<00:02:22.280> one<00:02:22.660> to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
trailer isn't a long-nosed one to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.810 
trailer isn't a long-nosed one to
transform<00:02:24.109> it<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:24.380> very<00:02:25.010> simple<00:02:25.459> really<00:02:25.669> you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
transform it it's very simple really you

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.670 
transform it it's very simple really you
just<00:02:26.120> open<00:02:26.449> up

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
just open up

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.160 
just open up
fate<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.159> then<00:02:28.150> we<00:02:28.329> have<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.629> oh<00:02:28.689> you<00:02:28.870> spin

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
fate and then we have it oh you spin

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.819 
fate and then we have it oh you spin
this<00:02:29.349> round<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.849> way<00:02:31.090> why<00:02:32.049> probably<00:02:32.469> just<00:02:32.739> to

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
this round that way why probably just to

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.319 
this round that way why probably just to
make<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.219> transformation<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.939> little<00:02:34.209> bit

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
make the transformation a little bit

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.970 
make the transformation a little bit
more<00:02:34.540> complex<00:02:35.079> really<00:02:35.439> otherwise<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.859> is<00:02:35.950> a

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
more complex really otherwise it is a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.399 
more complex really otherwise it is a
bit<00:02:36.159> silly<00:02:36.540> he<00:02:37.540> does<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.019> old<00:02:38.140> problem

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
bit silly he does have the old problem

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.319 
bit silly he does have the old problem
where<00:02:38.560> his<00:02:38.650> arms<00:02:38.890> way<00:02:39.310> way<00:02:39.640> way<00:02:39.909> higher<00:02:40.299> than

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
where his arms way way way higher than

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.300 
where his arms way way way higher than
his<00:02:40.689> actual<00:02:40.840> body<00:02:41.189> ah

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
his actual body ah

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.759 
his actual body ah
but<00:02:42.939> as<00:02:43.120> micro<00:02:43.480> Moses<00:02:43.810> goes<00:02:43.989> white<00:02:44.260> tall<00:02:44.560> one

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
but as micro Moses goes white tall one

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.550 
but as micro Moses goes white tall one
but<00:02:45.329> not<00:02:46.329> one<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.480> my<00:02:46.599> favorites<00:02:47.079> he<00:02:47.290> was<00:02:47.379> never

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
but not one of my favorites he was never

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.569 
but not one of my favorites he was never
a<00:02:47.620> favorite<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.069> mine<00:02:48.189> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.400> off-road

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
a favorite of mine in the off-road

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.509 
a favorite of mine in the off-road
patrol<00:02:49.379> right<00:02:50.379> so<00:02:50.739> then<00:02:50.889> we<00:02:50.980> get<00:02:51.099> onto<00:02:51.280> this

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
patrol right so then we get onto this

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.569 
patrol right so then we get onto this
now<00:02:51.939> then<00:02:52.120> we<00:02:52.239> do<00:02:52.420> try<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.840> transform<00:02:53.829> this<00:02:54.129> in

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
now then we do try to transform this in

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.699 
now then we do try to transform this in
I<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.389> never<00:02:55.510> remember<00:02:55.689> how<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:55.959> do<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.409> so<00:02:56.620> you

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
I can never remember how to do it so you

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.550 
I can never remember how to do it so you
take<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:57.010> crane<00:02:57.280> off<00:02:58.290> now<00:02:59.290> we're<00:02:59.409> going<00:02:59.500> to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
take the crane off now we're going to

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.099 
take the crane off now we're going to
take<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.859> little<00:03:00.069> ramp<00:03:00.280> off<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.720> what<00:03:01.989> do<00:03:02.049> we

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
take the little ramp off then what do we

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.879 
take the little ramp off then what do we
do<00:03:02.260> we<00:03:02.730> take<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:04.000> off<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.269> balloon<00:03:04.629> nice<00:03:05.349> and

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
do we take this off a balloon nice and

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.289 
do we take this off a balloon nice and
then<00:03:05.980> we<00:03:06.040> open<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.400> whole<00:03:06.579> thing<00:03:06.819> out<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.180> is

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
then we open the whole thing out this is

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.409 
then we open the whole thing out this is
going<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.540> come<00:03:07.720> around<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.989> that<00:03:09.389> then<00:03:10.389> I

it's very torn fortunately this tool all

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.589 
it's very torn fortunately this tool all
right<00:03:18.129> this<00:03:18.400> comes<00:03:18.609> out<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:18.939> top<00:03:19.150> here<00:03:19.359> which

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
right this comes out the top here which

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.099 
right this comes out the top here which
is<00:03:19.750> gonna<00:03:19.930> come<00:03:20.230> here<00:03:20.500> white<00:03:20.950> laser

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
is gonna come here white laser

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.589 
is gonna come here white laser
communications<00:03:23.109> device<00:03:23.560> or<00:03:23.889> something

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
communications device or something

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.240 
communications device or something
here<00:03:25.599> we<00:03:25.719> go<00:03:26.049> just<00:03:26.650> looks<00:03:26.829> like<00:03:26.889> that<00:03:27.099> really

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
here we go just looks like that really

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.699 
here we go just looks like that really
ah<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:28.750> what<00:03:28.900> we<00:03:29.019> gonna<00:03:29.139> do<00:03:29.409> I<00:03:29.620> can't

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
ah then what we gonna do I can't

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.629 
ah then what we gonna do I can't
remember<00:03:30.219> where<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.699> from<00:03:31.239> here<00:03:32.370> I'm<00:03:33.370> sure

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
remember where to go from here I'm sure

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.219 
remember where to go from here I'm sure
we<00:03:33.729> had<00:03:33.849> some<00:03:34.030> more<00:03:34.120> elements<00:03:34.389> around<00:03:35.019> him

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.229 
we had some more elements around him

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.680 
we had some more elements around him
really<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:35.769> there<00:03:35.889> you<00:03:35.919> go<00:03:36.069> ah<00:03:36.569> that's<00:03:37.569> it

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
really then there you go ah that's it

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.670 
really then there you go ah that's it
strange<00:03:39.000> that's<00:03:40.000> what<00:03:40.239> there<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:40.989> thought<00:03:41.620> he

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
strange that's what there is thought he

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.409 
strange that's what there is thought he
had<00:03:41.769> something<00:03:41.919> else<00:03:42.099> there<00:03:42.370> is<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:43.239> then<00:03:43.329> we

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
had something else there is and then we

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.619 
had something else there is and then we
pull<00:03:43.629> that<00:03:43.750> down<00:03:43.959> man<00:03:44.439> clicks<00:03:45.159> into<00:03:45.459> place<00:03:45.629> and

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
pull that down man clicks into place and

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.199 
pull that down man clicks into place and
there<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.739> have<00:03:47.949> it<00:03:48.099> though<00:03:48.310> no<00:03:48.489> no<00:03:48.669> no<00:03:48.819> done

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
there we have it though no no no done

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.059 
there we have it though no no no done
yet<00:03:49.389> he's<00:03:49.989> got<00:03:50.169> a<00:03:50.199> couple<00:03:50.439> little<00:03:50.620> connectors

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
yet he's got a couple little connectors

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.849 
yet he's got a couple little connectors
there<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.459> will<00:03:51.579> fit<00:03:51.819> in<00:03:51.939> just<00:03:51.970> two<00:03:52.419> they're

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
there that will fit in just two they're

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.610 
there that will fit in just two they're
all<00:03:53.859> out<00:03:54.540> iron<00:03:55.540> works<00:03:55.870> just<00:03:56.169> to<00:03:56.259> stand<00:03:56.470> up

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
all out iron works just to stand up

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.749 
all out iron works just to stand up
there<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:56.859> take<00:03:57.189> control<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.579> everything

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:57.759 
there and take control of everything

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.740 
there and take control of everything
this<00:03:58.599> will<00:03:58.810> then<00:03:59.759> rotate<00:04:00.759> round<00:04:00.939> two<00:04:01.150> there<00:04:01.359> we

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
this will then rotate round two there we

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.929 
this will then rotate round two there we
take<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.079> missile<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.889> we<00:04:03.129> had<00:04:03.459> nowhere<00:04:03.669> to

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
take the missile that we had nowhere to

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.990 
take the missile that we had nowhere to
put<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.829> construction<00:04:05.829> site<00:04:06.040> mode<00:04:06.250> that

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
put it in construction site mode that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.999 
put it in construction site mode that
all<00:04:07.120> then<00:04:07.269> just<00:04:07.449> fit<00:04:07.629> onto<00:04:07.750> there<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.259> we<00:04:08.889> can

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
all then just fit onto there and we can

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.499 
all then just fit onto there and we can
push<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.430> back<00:04:09.759> onto<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.299> then<00:04:10.419> it

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
push that back onto that and then it

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.080 
push that back onto that and then it
becomes<00:04:10.750> like<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.049> missile<00:04:11.379> emplacement<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
becomes like a missile emplacement the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.479 
becomes like a missile emplacement the
little<00:04:13.419> ramp<00:04:13.659> doesn't<00:04:14.620> go<00:04:14.859> anywhere<00:04:15.220> in<00:04:15.430> this

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
little ramp doesn't go anywhere in this

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.699 
little ramp doesn't go anywhere in this
mode<00:04:15.699> I<00:04:15.729> don't<00:04:16.000> believe<00:04:16.320> maybe<00:04:17.320> because<00:04:17.620> the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
mode I don't believe maybe because the

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.879 
mode I don't believe maybe because the
only<00:04:17.859> port<00:04:18.130> for<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.459> was<00:04:18.609> up<00:04:18.789> there<00:04:19.060> so<00:04:19.829> it<00:04:20.829> just

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
only port for it was up there so it just

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.879 
only port for it was up there so it just
hangs<00:04:21.370> around<00:04:21.519> unfortunately<00:04:22.110> as<00:04:23.110> one's<00:04:23.560> go

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
hangs around unfortunately as one's go

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.899 
hangs around unfortunately as one's go
of<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.190> one<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.820> not<00:04:25.060> bad<00:04:25.330> um<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:27.520> it's

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
of this one it's not bad um it's it's

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.520 
of this one it's not bad um it's it's
alright<00:04:28.539> you<00:04:28.690> can<00:04:28.720> do<00:04:28.960> a<00:04:28.990> lot<00:04:29.139> really<00:04:29.259> women

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
of fire station um comes with a little

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.280 
of fire station um comes with a little
micro<00:04:46.650> master<00:04:46.980> aeroplane<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:48.210> repaint<00:04:48.930> from

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
micro master aeroplane a repaint from

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.140 
micro master aeroplane a repaint from
the<00:04:49.440> airstrike<00:04:49.980> Patrol<00:04:50.430> ah<00:04:52.220> yes<00:04:53.220> now<00:04:53.580> then<00:04:53.880> I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
the airstrike Patrol ah yes now then I

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.610 
the airstrike Patrol ah yes now then I
believe<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.440> there<00:04:55.620> was<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.740> repaint<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.580> the

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
believe that there was a repaint of the

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.910 
believe that there was a repaint of the
universe<00:04:59.900> mold<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:01.110> this<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:01.500> think<00:05:01.710> was<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
universe mold of this I think was the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.000 
universe mold of this I think was the
Japanese<00:05:02.640> version<00:05:03.180> one<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.170> them<00:05:04.350> was<00:05:04.830> white

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
Japanese version one of them was white

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.260 
Japanese version one of them was white
and<00:05:05.280> you<00:05:05.400> could<00:05:05.580> get<00:05:05.730> some<00:05:05.880> stickers<00:05:06.120> off

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
and you could get some stickers off

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.360 
and you could get some stickers off
reptiles<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.840> turn<00:05:07.050> into<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.560> homage<00:05:08.340> to

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
reptiles to turn into a homage to

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.690 
reptiles to turn into a homage to
micromaster<00:05:09.320> hothouse<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.680> never<00:05:11.100> did<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.520> never

coming back open out the arms and there
we<00:05:34.380> have<00:05:34.560> hot<00:05:34.800> house<00:05:35.010> in<00:05:35.370> rope<00:05:35.550> mode<00:05:35.700> can't

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
we have hot house in rope mode can't

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.420 
we have hot house in rope mode can't
turn<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.810> arms<00:05:37.110> in<00:05:37.290> this<00:05:37.440> mode<00:05:37.650> unfortunately

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
turn the arms in this mode unfortunately

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.450 
turn the arms in this mode unfortunately
which<00:05:39.210> is<00:05:39.480> a<00:05:39.510> big<00:05:40.050> big<00:05:40.350> letdown<00:05:40.860> if<00:05:41.220> you<00:05:41.340> want

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
which is a big big letdown if you want

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.570 
which is a big big letdown if you want
my<00:05:41.580> opinion<00:05:42.350> but<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.440> does<00:05:43.590> stand<00:05:43.800> remarkably

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
my opinion but it does stand remarkably

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.510 
my opinion but it does stand remarkably
well<00:05:44.970> saying<00:05:45.540> that<00:05:45.660> it<00:05:45.780> just<00:05:45.960> falls<00:05:46.200> over<00:05:46.520> once

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
well saying that it just falls over once

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.310 
well saying that it just falls over once
you<00:05:47.640> put<00:05:47.790> the<00:05:47.910> legs<00:05:48.270> out<00:05:48.540> just<00:05:48.840> falls<00:05:49.170> over

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
you put the legs out just falls over

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.920 
you put the legs out just falls over
sort<00:05:49.680> it<00:05:49.880> right<00:05:50.880> so<00:05:51.090> anyway<00:05:51.270> we<00:05:51.420> can<00:05:51.570> move<00:05:51.810> on

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
sort it right so anyway we can move on

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.340 
sort it right so anyway we can move on
to<00:05:51.960> this<00:05:52.200> now<00:05:52.440> this<00:05:53.250> is<00:05:53.550> is<00:05:54.120> fire<00:05:54.690> station<00:05:55.170> mode

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
to this now this is is fire station mode

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.140 
to this now this is is fire station mode
but<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.460> does<00:05:56.580> have<00:05:56.730> a<00:05:56.760> quite<00:05:56.970> cool

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
but it does have a quite cool

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.570 
but it does have a quite cool
transformation<00:05:57.870> take<00:05:58.320> that<00:05:58.500> off<00:05:58.620> there<00:05:58.950> the

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
transformation take that off there the

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.790 
transformation take that off there the
good<00:05:59.730> thing<00:05:59.880> about<00:05:59.910> these<00:06:00.500> ramps<00:06:01.500> is<00:06:01.620> that

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
good thing about these ramps is that

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.530 
good thing about these ramps is that
they<00:06:01.920> will<00:06:02.160> fit<00:06:02.490> onto<00:06:02.730> both<00:06:03.090> onto<00:06:03.390> two

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
they will fit onto both onto two

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.390 
they will fit onto both onto two
portions<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.320> you<00:06:04.380> can't<00:06:04.620> connect<00:06:04.950> them<00:06:05.130> up<00:06:05.190> I

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
portions so you can't connect them up I

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.500 
portions so you can't connect them up I
should<00:06:05.550> have<00:06:05.640> done<00:06:05.760> that<00:06:05.820> before<00:06:05.970> transform

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
should have done that before transform

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.350 
should have done that before transform
them<00:06:06.660> but<00:06:07.670> not<00:06:08.670> really<00:06:08.850> that<00:06:08.940> important

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
them but not really that important

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.320 
them but not really that important
really<00:06:09.500> alright<00:06:10.500> anyway<00:06:10.800> so<00:06:10.860> we've<00:06:11.400> then<00:06:11.640> open

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
really alright anyway so we've then open

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.450 
really alright anyway so we've then open
out<00:06:12.450> this<00:06:12.630> section<00:06:12.930> that<00:06:13.140> will<00:06:13.500> flip<00:06:14.160> a<00:06:14.220> light

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
out this section that will flip a light

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.760 
out this section that will flip a light
of<00:06:14.640> a<00:06:14.730> leaf<00:06:14.970> that<00:06:15.420> comes<00:06:16.290> around

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
of a leaf that comes around

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.740 
of a leaf that comes around
so<00:06:17.070> here<00:06:17.840> ah<00:06:18.840> then<00:06:19.410> what<00:06:19.590> do<00:06:19.680> we<00:06:19.740> do<00:06:19.890> this<00:06:20.190> then

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
so here ah then what do we do this then

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.930 
so here ah then what do we do this then
moves<00:06:21.750> nothing<00:06:22.590> yep<00:06:23.280> there<00:06:23.490> we<00:06:23.580> go

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
moves nothing yep there we go

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.450 
moves nothing yep there we go
this<00:06:24.450> opens<00:06:24.990> out<00:06:25.200> it's<00:06:25.470> become<00:06:25.860> some<00:06:26.130> sort<00:06:26.160> of

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
this opens out it's become some sort of

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.360 
this opens out it's become some sort of
tractor<00:06:27.390> tractor<00:06:28.020> but<00:06:28.410> it's<00:06:28.560> like<00:06:28.710> a<00:06:28.740> tank

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
tractor tractor but it's like a tank

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.350 
tractor tractor but it's like a tank
sort<00:06:29.700> of<00:06:29.760> thing<00:06:29.880> because<00:06:29.940> you've<00:06:30.150> got<00:06:30.270> the

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
sort of thing because you've got the

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.180 
sort of thing because you've got the
treads<00:06:30.630> down<00:06:30.840> elephant<00:06:31.260> being<00:06:31.950> caught<00:06:32.160> with

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
treads down elephant being caught with

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.230 
treads down elephant being caught with
out<00:06:32.490> of<00:06:32.640> giving<00:06:32.850> those<00:06:33.620> some<00:06:34.620> sort<00:06:34.950> of<00:06:35.240> unknown

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
out of giving those some sort of unknown

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.060 
out of giving those some sort of unknown
paint<00:06:36.810> applications<00:06:37.410> that<00:06:37.620> have<00:06:37.770> been<00:06:37.860> pretty

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
paint applications that have been pretty

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.030 
paint applications that have been pretty
cool<00:06:38.280> anyway<00:06:38.480> we<00:06:39.480> then<00:06:39.630> rotate<00:06:40.470> the<00:06:40.500> gun<00:06:40.800> back

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
cool anyway we then rotate the gun back

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.930 
cool anyway we then rotate the gun back
down<00:06:41.960> this<00:06:42.960> can<00:06:43.290> actually<00:06:43.860> come<00:06:44.070> off<00:06:44.100> in<00:06:44.760> this

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
down this can actually come off in this

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.450 
down this can actually come off in this
mode<00:06:45.210> if<00:06:45.600> you<00:06:45.840> wanted<00:06:46.110> it<00:06:46.230> to<00:06:46.260> but<00:06:46.740> you<00:06:47.220> can

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
mode if you wanted it to but you can

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
mode if you wanted it to but you can
just<00:06:47.580> leave<00:06:47.760> with<00:06:47.880> everyone

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
just leave with everyone

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.300 
just leave with everyone
don't<00:06:49.050> believe<00:06:49.380> there's<00:06:49.710> anyone<00:06:50.010> else<00:06:50.100> it

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
don't believe there's anyone else it

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.030 
don't believe there's anyone else it
goes<00:06:50.750> but<00:06:51.750> that<00:06:51.870> is<00:06:52.020> it<00:06:52.290> for<00:06:52.320> this<00:06:52.710> mode<00:06:52.890> you

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
goes but that is it for this mode you

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.440 
goes but that is it for this mode you
can<00:06:53.190> actually<00:06:53.220> then<00:06:53.640> put<00:06:53.850> this<00:06:53.940> back<00:06:54.150> up<00:06:54.330> if

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
can actually then put this back up if

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.270 
can actually then put this back up if
you<00:06:54.510> wanted<00:06:54.690> to<00:06:54.840> and<00:06:55.110> have<00:06:55.380> a<00:06:55.650> little<00:06:55.950> hot

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
you wanted to and have a little hot

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.730 
you wanted to and have a little hot
house<00:06:56.490> in<00:06:56.790> there<00:06:56.970> controlling<00:06:57.360> the<00:06:58.170> tank

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
house in there controlling the tank

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.770 
house in there controlling the tank
thing<00:06:59.010> this<00:06:59.610> is<00:06:59.730> a<00:06:59.760> company's<00:07:00.120> got<00:07:00.210> a<00:07:00.270> main<00:07:00.480> gun

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
thing this is a company's got a main gun

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.040 
thing this is a company's got a main gun
and<00:07:01.340> as<00:07:02.340> it<00:07:02.550> goes<00:07:02.670> it<00:07:03.000> don't<00:07:03.270> look<00:07:03.480> that<00:07:03.540> bad

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
and as it goes it don't look that bad

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.650 
and as it goes it don't look that bad
it's<00:07:04.410> it's<00:07:04.800> not<00:07:04.920> the<00:07:05.040> best<00:07:05.310> um<00:07:06.110> but<00:07:07.110> definitely

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
it's it's not the best um but definitely

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.910 
it's it's not the best um but definitely
yeah<00:07:09.660> it's<00:07:09.810> not<00:07:09.960> go<00:07:10.080> hard<00:07:10.380> so<00:07:10.590> it's<00:07:10.740> not<00:07:10.800> the

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:10.920 
yeah it's not go hard so it's not the

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.620 
yeah it's not go hard so it's not the
worst<00:07:11.040> it's<00:07:11.340> not<00:07:11.430> particularly<00:07:11.670> great<00:07:12.090> to<00:07:12.540> be

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
worst it's not particularly great to be

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.470 
worst it's not particularly great to be
honest<00:07:12.810> so<00:07:13.050> maybe<00:07:13.260> is<00:07:13.500> ahhh

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480 
honest so maybe is ahhh

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.700 
honest so maybe is ahhh
yeah<00:07:15.480> not<00:07:15.720> much<00:07:15.780> else<00:07:15.930> I<00:07:16.080> can<00:07:16.230> say<00:07:16.410> way<00:07:16.560> really

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
yeah not much else I can say way really

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.410 
yeah not much else I can say way really
bit<00:07:16.920> of<00:07:16.980> a<00:07:17.010> letdown<00:07:17.220> this<00:07:17.610> one<00:07:17.790> the<00:07:18.000> Decepticon

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.420 
bit of a letdown this one the Decepticon

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.000 
bit of a letdown this one the Decepticon
ones<00:07:18.570> are<00:07:18.660> much<00:07:18.780> better<00:07:18.990> whereas<00:07:19.650> this<00:07:19.770> one

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
ones are much better whereas this one

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.960 
ones are much better whereas this one
isn't<00:07:20.640> that's<00:07:21.630> a<00:07:21.780> shame<00:07:22.520> but<00:07:23.520> when<00:07:23.760> you<00:07:23.820> put
