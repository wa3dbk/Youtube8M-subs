00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.470 
gonna hump down onto the smaller ledge
down<00:00:17.070> below<00:00:17.310> me<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.580> once<00:00:18.150> you're<00:00:18.240> here

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
down below me and once you're here

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.880 
down below me and once you're here
you're<00:00:18.630> basically<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> map<00:00:19.619> you're

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
you're basically out of the map you're

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
you're basically out of the map you're
behind<00:00:20.460> all<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.090> barriers<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
behind all of the barriers like all the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.990 
behind all of the barriers like all the
sky<00:00:22.470> barriers<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.920> stuff<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.490> technically

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
sky barriers and stuff so technically

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400 
sky barriers and stuff so technically
from<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.630> get<00:00:25.019> out<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.289> map

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
from here you can get out of the map

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
from here you can get out of the map
although<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.550> difficult<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
although it is very difficult in the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.339 
although it is very difficult in the
only<00:00:27.269> place<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.810> how<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.199> you

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
only place that I know how to do you

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.839 
only place that I know how to do you
should<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.590> prone<00:00:28.859> I'm<00:00:29.279> sure<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:29.640> care

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
should be prone I'm sure with care

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.910 
should be prone I'm sure with care
packages<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:31.140> lot<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> luck<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.800> can

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
packages and a lot of luck you can

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.410 
packages and a lot of luck you can
probably<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.399> out<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> map<00:00:32.820> completely

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
probably get out of the map completely

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240 
probably get out of the map completely
from<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.380> anyway<00:00:34.590> guys<00:00:34.710> once<00:00:35.010> you're<00:00:35.130> up
