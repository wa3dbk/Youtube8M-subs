plug<00:00:45.040> so<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.280> cylinder<00:00:46.820> cylinder<00:00:47.480> to<00:00:47.660> side<00:00:48.820> so

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
plug so the cylinder cylinder to side so

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.370 
plug so the cylinder cylinder to side so
now<00:00:50.120> we're<00:00:50.300> going<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.450> go<00:00:50.630> ahead<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:50.930> get<00:00:51.110> the

get<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.020> particular<00:02:24.380> here<00:02:24.860> it's<00:02:25.270> clean<00:02:26.270> enough

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
get to particular here it's clean enough

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.150 
get to particular here it's clean enough
so<00:02:28.250> now<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:29.320> reassembly<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.350> this<00:02:30.560> side<00:02:30.770> here

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
so now it's reassembly of this side here

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.520 
so now it's reassembly of this side here
and<00:02:31.660> then<00:02:32.660> i'm<00:02:32.750> going<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.960> move<00:02:33.050> on<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
and then i'm going to move on to the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.640 
and then i'm going to move on to the
next<00:02:33.560> side<00:02:33.980> do<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:35.290> it's<00:02:36.290> going<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.470> be<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
next side do that it's going to be the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.500 
next side do that it's going to be the
same<00:02:36.800> as<00:02:36.950> this<00:02:37.100> side<00:02:37.370> not<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> big<00:02:38.060> deal<00:02:38.240> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
same as this side not a big deal and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.660 
same as this side not a big deal and
then<00:02:39.470> i'm<00:02:39.650> going<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.830> get<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.220> carburetor

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
then i'm going to get to the carburetor

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.090 
then i'm going to get to the carburetor
and<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.330> intake<00:02:41.690> already<00:02:42.590> know<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:42.860> i<00:02:42.950> got

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
and the intake already know that i got

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.960 
and the intake already know that i got
bulls<00:02:43.370> cylinder<00:02:43.820> heads<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:44.960> torque<00:02:45.470> spec

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
bulls cylinder heads on and torque spec

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.050 
bulls cylinder heads on and torque spec
now<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.150> time<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.660> put<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.960> intake<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.500> i

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
now it's time to put the intake on i

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.320 
now it's time to put the intake on i
pulled<00:02:50.060> my<00:02:50.120> gaskets<00:02:50.600> out<00:02:51.310> got<00:02:52.310> one<00:02:52.880> gasket

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
going to be using all right really quick

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.900 
going to be using all right really quick
i<00:04:55.850> think<00:04:56.060> i<00:04:56.120> may<00:04:56.240> have<00:04:56.270> discovered<00:04:56.570> my<00:04:56.900> problem

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
here's the old gasket you're going to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.750 
here's the old gasket you're going to
notice<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.440> three<00:05:00.680> holes<00:05:00.890> and<00:05:01.250> there<00:05:01.610> are<00:05:01.670> all

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
notice the three holes and there are all

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.490 
notice the three holes and there are all
three<00:05:02.180> small<00:05:02.600> holes<00:05:02.840> as<00:05:03.280> is<00:05:04.280> this<00:05:04.520> one<00:05:04.760> here<00:05:05.500> if

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
three small holes as is this one here if

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.950 
three small holes as is this one here if
you<00:05:06.620> can<00:05:06.770> see<00:05:06.980> that<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:08.270> if<00:05:08.540> you<00:05:08.660> look<00:05:08.810> at<00:05:08.930> the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
you can see that and if you look at the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.480 
you can see that and if you look at the
gasket<00:05:09.410> that<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:09.620> put<00:05:09.830> on<00:05:09.980> here<00:05:10.220> you're<00:05:10.370> going

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
gasket that I put on here you're going

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.800 
gasket that I put on here you're going
to<00:05:10.580> notice<00:05:10.730> that<00:05:11.060> that<00:05:11.210> hole<00:05:11.450> there<00:05:11.660> is<00:05:11.780> a

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
to notice that that hole there is a

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.780 
to notice that that hole there is a
little<00:05:12.020> bit<00:05:12.200> bigger<00:05:12.380> matching<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.310> the

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
little bit bigger matching the the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.550 
little bit bigger matching the the
outline<00:05:14.180> there<00:05:14.419> and<00:05:14.600> so<00:05:14.870> is<00:05:14.990> this<00:05:15.169> whole<00:05:15.380> that

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
outline there and so is this whole that

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.040 
outline there and so is this whole that
whole<00:05:15.590> there<00:05:15.950> is<00:05:16.040> bigger<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:17.660> may<00:05:17.960> have

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
whole there is bigger so that may have

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.440 
whole there is bigger so that may have
been<00:05:18.140> my<00:05:18.290> problem<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.710> whole<00:05:18.860> time<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.450> just

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
been my problem the whole time I just

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.970 
been my problem the whole time I just
put<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.870> wrong<00:05:20.990> gasket<00:05:21.440> on<00:05:21.530> here<00:05:21.710> because<00:05:21.950> I

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
put the wrong gasket on here because I

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.860 
put the wrong gasket on here because I
was<00:05:22.250> also<00:05:22.400> confused<00:05:22.580> by<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.270> amount<00:05:23.660> of

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
was also confused by the amount of

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.470 
was also confused by the amount of
different<00:05:24.350> gaskets<00:05:24.830> so<00:05:25.550> we're<00:05:26.150> going<00:05:26.240> to<00:05:26.330> find

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
different gaskets so we're going to find

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.750 
different gaskets so we're going to find
out<00:05:26.660> if<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:26.780> may<00:05:27.250> change<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.490> way<00:05:28.610> this

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
out if that may change the way this

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.670 
out if that may change the way this
thing<00:05:29.000> runs<00:05:29.180> alright<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.930> carburetors<00:05:30.440> back

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
thing runs alright the carburetors back

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.570 
thing runs alright the carburetors back
together<00:05:31.040> after<00:05:32.030> discovering<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:32.990> problem

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
together after discovering the problem

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.800 
together after discovering the problem
that<00:05:34.580> i<00:05:34.610> think<00:05:34.730> i<00:05:35.000> believe<00:05:35.060> i<00:05:35.300> had<00:05:35.540> with<00:05:35.690> the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
that i think i believe i had with the

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.219 
that i think i believe i had with the
gasket<00:05:37.060> having<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.120> wrong<00:05:38.270> gasket<00:05:38.900> on<00:05:39.020> there

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
gasket having the wrong gasket on there

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.800 
gasket having the wrong gasket on there
I<00:05:39.380> bet<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.919> I'm<00:05:40.640> almost<00:05:40.910> willing<00:05:41.300> to<00:05:41.510> bet<00:05:41.630> any

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
I bet you I'm almost willing to bet any

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.170 
I bet you I'm almost willing to bet any
amount<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:42.169> money<00:05:42.229> that<00:05:42.620> that<00:05:43.490> was<00:05:43.669> the<00:05:43.820> entire

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
amount of money that that was the entire

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.469 
amount of money that that was the entire
problem<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.780> whole<00:05:44.900> time<00:05:45.169> so<00:05:46.130> I<00:05:46.490> did<00:05:47.060> not<00:05:47.270> go

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
problem the whole time so I did not go

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.140 
problem the whole time so I did not go
ahead<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:48.140> rebuild<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.070> fuel<00:05:49.340> pump<00:05:49.900> not<00:05:50.900> yet

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
ahead and rebuild the fuel pump not yet

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.409 
ahead and rebuild the fuel pump not yet
the<00:05:53.150> fuel<00:05:53.360> pump<00:05:53.630> is<00:05:53.810> an<00:05:53.930> easy<00:05:54.140> thing<00:05:54.410> to<00:05:54.530> do<00:05:55.419> so

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
the fuel pump is an easy thing to do so

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.420 
the fuel pump is an easy thing to do so
if<00:05:56.810> it<00:05:57.020> turns<00:05:57.350> out<00:05:57.530> that<00:05:57.590> i<00:05:57.830> need<00:05:58.070> to<00:05:58.100> rebuild

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
if it turns out that i need to rebuild

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.250 
if it turns out that i need to rebuild
the<00:05:58.580> fuel<00:05:58.790> pump<00:05:58.910> i<00:05:59.090> will<00:05:59.360> but<00:05:59.900> i'm<00:06:00.050> not<00:06:00.200> going

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
the fuel pump i will but i'm not going

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.200 
the fuel pump i will but i'm not going
to<00:06:00.440> tackle<00:06:00.890> it<00:06:00.950> at<00:06:01.100> this<00:06:01.250> time<00:06:01.520> because<00:06:01.700> i

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
to tackle it at this time because i

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.920 
to tackle it at this time because i
don't<00:06:02.930> really<00:06:03.080> feel<00:06:03.380> it's<00:06:03.560> necessary<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:04.930> think

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
don't really feel it's necessary I think

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.219 
don't really feel it's necessary I think
I<00:06:06.200> discovered<00:06:07.010> my<00:06:07.040> original<00:06:07.610> mistake<00:06:08.140> so<00:06:09.140> what

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
I discovered my original mistake so what

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:10.330 
I discovered my original mistake so what
I'm<00:06:09.320> going<00:06:09.410> to<00:06:09.470> do<00:06:09.590> now<00:06:09.860> is<00:06:10.040> I'm<00:06:10.130> going<00:06:10.250> to

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
I'm going to do now is I'm going to

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.300 
I'm going to do now is I'm going to
mount<00:06:10.460> the<00:06:10.729> carburetor<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.660> their<00:06:12.160> make<00:06:13.160> sure

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
mount the carburetor to their make sure

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.030 
mount the carburetor to their make sure
all<00:06:13.430> the<00:06:13.580> linkage<00:06:13.910> is<00:06:14.060> hooked<00:06:14.300> up<00:06:14.479> right<00:06:15.040> all

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
all the linkage is hooked up right all

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.780 
all the linkage is hooked up right all
right<00:06:16.190> and<00:06:16.460> then<00:06:17.830> get<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:18.950> spark<00:06:19.220> plugs<00:06:19.520> back

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
right and then get the spark plugs back

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.030 
right and then get the spark plugs back
in<00:06:20.030> here<00:06:20.419> that<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:20.960> fuel<00:06:21.169> line<00:06:21.440> all<00:06:21.620> hooked<00:06:21.890> up

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
in here that the fuel line all hooked up

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.620 
in here that the fuel line all hooked up
and<00:06:22.220> then<00:06:22.880> I'm<00:06:22.970> just<00:06:23.000> going<00:06:23.240> to<00:06:23.300> give<00:06:23.479> her<00:06:23.570> a

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
and then I'm just going to give her a

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.770 
and then I'm just going to give her a
temper<00:06:23.990> a<00:06:24.050> quick<00:06:24.680> start<00:06:25.210> just<00:06:26.210> to<00:06:26.270> verify<00:06:26.450> that

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
temper a quick start just to verify that

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.490 
temper a quick start just to verify that
she<00:06:26.810> runs<00:06:27.169> I<00:06:27.560> dumped<00:06:28.310> a<00:06:28.370> lot<00:06:28.520> of<00:06:28.700> MMO<00:06:29.150> in<00:06:29.500> the

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
she runs I dumped a lot of MMO in the

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.339 
she runs I dumped a lot of MMO in the
gas<00:06:30.680> tank<00:06:30.890> so<00:06:31.310> that's<00:06:31.580> why<00:06:31.960> if<00:06:32.960> you<00:06:33.050> look<00:06:33.229> down

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
gas tank so that's why if you look down

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.659 
gas tank so that's why if you look down
there<00:06:33.560> by<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:33.680> fuel<00:06:34.010> filter<00:06:34.280> you're<00:06:34.490> going<00:06:34.610> to
