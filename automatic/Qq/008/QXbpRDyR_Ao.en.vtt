00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.550
 the box what we are going to do is move 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.909
 all this and remove the plastic from the 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.909
 boiler 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.729

 gentlemen is to turn it on but first 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.830
 Let's talk a little bit about their 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.810
 characteristics 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.940
 in the fourth generation comes which 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.250
 operating system there is a 6 the screen 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.150
 is 9.7 inches in and in shape 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.170
 diagonal is retina with a resolution of 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:54.320
 2048 x 1536 with 264 pp and pixels by 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.260
 inch back lighting on ld and it's 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.680
 ips the processor is the new processor 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.080
 is the a6 x is a dual 4 with a 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.900
 graphic processor word the camera 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.899
 frontal has also been changed is 1.2 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.470
 megapixels capable of recording video at 720p 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.660
 and the rear camera is five 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.650
 megapixels capable of recording video in 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.360
 1080p and has autofocus recognizer 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.030
 of face stabilizing image between 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.190
 other things the battery provides 10 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.209
 hours of use as soon as what is the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.540
 web browsing the connector is a 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.939
 connector 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.670
 lightning in this case I bought the 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:39.420
 Wi-Fi version as you can see me 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:45.420
 I was without silver the weight is 600 52 grams 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.519
 and the thickness is 9 points 4 millimeters 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.349
 in the extremes here you can see 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.390
 we have the button dependent off 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.359
 here the minute 2 button and the control to 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.909
 rotation of the volume screen around here 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.430
 we have what is the new connector 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.980
 lightning here you can see the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.829
 speaker on this side we have nothing 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.230
 I had forgotten the headset what 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.069
 the camera must make the microphone 5 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.680
 megapixels and the 1.2 camera 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.139
 megapixels and it also comes with what 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.040
 is bluetooth 4.0 what are the 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.439
 differences between this palette and the ipad 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.290
 third generation are three poplars 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:26.909
 first the 1.2 megapixel camera the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.639
 ipad third generation or that of the 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.980
 third generation forgiveness is from gea the 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.620
 processor 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.629
 the new device is the 6x while 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.510
 that in the ipad third generation was the 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:43.610
 to 5x and the other is the connector now of 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.810
 more than 30 pins and do not talk about what 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.370
 is the lightning 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.670
 said these gentlemen will turn the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.670
 Tablet 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.230
 and let's do this a little faster 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.970
 since you have seen several processes 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.120
 at the time of activating the tablet so 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.080
 once it takes me to the steps 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.570
 following what I'm going to do 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.490
 it is simply to advance what they 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.480
 It seems 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.480
 so that you do not get bored 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.310
 now we are going to move forward so that 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.600
 I have already activated the tablet 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.600
 unfortunately I wanted to do more 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.150
 things and teach them more this activity 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.550
 with the tablet but still downloading the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.650
 most applications that I have in my 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.300
 other tablets what we are going to 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.949
 show you is what is the part of 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.590
 the navigation has fallen open and my 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.790
 page what we are going to do is embroider the 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.320
 We were going to put it here again 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.600
 I have a fan 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.040
 dotcom and what I have here too 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.270
 is in the third generation that 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.960
 we inhabit to teach you also 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.860
 some differences we are going to enter 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.860
 let's place we're going to 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.840
 let's erase this here we are going to put 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:11.440
 here 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.440
 sorry 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.500
 dotcom and let's see let's see how 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.500
 reacts at 2 1 2 and 3 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.900
 there it is and what it is downloading 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.900
 any number of applications 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.099
 can not browse yet keep reading 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.529
 in both is this and here is still 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:39.399
 downloading and it's later we're going to 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:40.619
 make a comparison of both tablets 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.939
 as to what navigation is 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:45.189
 Video camera applications among 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.770
 other things so that you can see 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:49.449
 here we have the third generation 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.649
 that I have with what is your guard of 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.270
 connectivity 4g forgiveness and lte and 3g maybe 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:57.249
 it's just wifi and the difference 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.619
 it is also in what is to be the 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:03.039
 connector you can we are going to close 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:05.169
 here we are going to close here the connector here 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.559
 you can see here is 30 pin 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:11.830
 back line and the other difference 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:16.659
 big here is the camera that we're going 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:18.849
 to see in a video call we have to 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.619
 The new fourth generation iPad is 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.689
 1.2 megapixels while in the 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:24.099
 third generation is bg so let's go to 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.709
 see the difference later in the 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:29.769
 comparative but that's all with 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:31.869
 regarding we are going to withdraw the third 

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:33.849
 generation is this with respect to this 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.590
 new product that many of you 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.050

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.760
 and I bought it so here I have it for 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.350
 all those who are with the 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.640

 generating this more information with 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.850
