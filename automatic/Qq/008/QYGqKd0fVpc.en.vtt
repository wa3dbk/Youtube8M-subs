00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:17.250 

changer<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:11.020> so<00:01:11.380> she<00:01:12.070> really<00:01:12.190> have<00:01:12.460> bugs<00:01:16.260> okay

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.840 
so I think I've always changed if not I
think<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.820> should<00:01:22.060> write<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:22.930> back<00:01:23.049> now<00:01:23.760> if<00:01:24.760> you

think it should write it back now if you

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.610 
think it should write it back now if you
think<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.510> thing<00:01:25.720> might<00:01:25.870> not<00:01:26.020> fit<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:26.440> what
