00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
gonna refer back to my programming book

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.970 
gonna refer back to my programming book
because<00:02:29.810> they<00:02:29.959> have<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.410> been<00:02:30.530> reading<00:02:30.739> it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
because they have just been reading it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.220 
because they have just been reading it
recently<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.700> lot<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.150> they<00:02:32.420> made<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.050> really

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
recently a lot and they made up a really

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.290 
recently a lot and they made up a really
good<00:02:33.319> point<00:02:33.470> here<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.730> know<00:02:34.850> when<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.090> have<00:02:35.270> a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
good point here you know when you have a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.270 
good point here you know when you have a
problem<00:02:35.660> when<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.350> program<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:37.160> know

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
problem when you program you know

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.680 
problem when you program you know
usually<00:02:37.520> when<00:02:37.820> programmers<00:02:38.270> they<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.660> a

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
usually when programmers they have a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.910 
usually when programmers they have a
problem<00:02:38.930> they<00:02:39.140> can't<00:02:39.380> really<00:02:39.590> think<00:02:39.770> of

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
problem they can't really think of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
problem they can't really think of
something<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.400> they're<00:02:40.519> just<00:02:40.670> sitting<00:02:40.910> there

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
something and they're just sitting there

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.670 
something and they're just sitting there
because<00:02:41.300> us<00:02:41.510> programmers<00:02:42.140> we<00:02:42.470> usually

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
because us programmers we usually

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.710 
because us programmers we usually
program<00:02:43.220> alone<00:02:43.550> that's<00:02:43.850> why<00:02:43.970> these<00:02:44.360> days

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
program alone that's why these days

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.030 
program alone that's why these days
we're<00:02:44.959> really<00:02:45.170> trying<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.470> work<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:45.800> pairs

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
we're really trying to work with pairs

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.920 
we're really trying to work with pairs
or<00:02:46.250> couples<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.730> know<00:02:46.760> trying<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.450> get<00:02:47.600> into

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
or couples you know trying to get into

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.600 
or couples you know trying to get into
this<00:02:48.050> group<00:02:48.350> project<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.070> you<00:02:49.220> can<00:02:49.370> talk

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
this group project so that you can talk

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.640 
this group project so that you can talk
about<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:50.750> when<00:02:50.930> they<00:02:51.050> said<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.500> when

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
about it but when they said that when

about it but when they said that when
you<00:02:51.739> have<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.920> problem<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.610> best<00:02:52.820> thing<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.180> do

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
you have a problem the best thing to do

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.780 
you have a problem the best thing to do
is<00:02:53.630> just<00:02:53.870> talk<00:02:54.320> about<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.860> out<00:02:54.980> loud<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.700> know

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
even though if no one is there to listen

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.620 
even though if no one is there to listen
to<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.709> just<00:02:58.160> talk<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.640> your<00:02:58.760> hand<00:02:59.090> talk<00:02:59.450> to

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
to you just talk to your hand talk to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.540 
to you just talk to your hand talk to
something<00:02:59.989> you<00:03:00.620> know<00:03:00.739> when<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.010> say<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.459> out

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
something you know when you say it out

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.970 
something you know when you say it out
loud<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:02.000> kind<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.450> makes<00:03:02.630> more<00:03:02.900> sense<00:03:03.290> because

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
loud it kind of makes more sense because

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.440 
loud it kind of makes more sense because
when<00:03:04.160> you're<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.459> thinking<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.940> inside<00:03:05.269> your

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
when you're just thinking it inside your

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.509 
when you're just thinking it inside your
head<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.170> got<00:03:06.350> really<00:03:06.680> clouded<00:03:07.100> thoughts<00:03:07.310> a

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
head you got really clouded thoughts a

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.680 
head you got really clouded thoughts a
lot<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.760> different<00:03:07.790> thoughts<00:03:08.209> are<00:03:08.420> kind<00:03:08.630> of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
lot of different thoughts are kind of

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.970 
lot of different thoughts are kind of
mingling<00:03:08.989> with<00:03:09.110> it<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.590> clouding<00:03:09.950> your

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
mingling with it and clouding your

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.800 
mingling with it and clouding your
judgment<00:03:10.579> but<00:03:10.910> when<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.120> say<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.450> out<00:03:11.510> loud<00:03:11.570> it

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
judgment but when you say it out loud it

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.330 
judgment but when you say it out loud it
makes<00:03:12.140> a<00:03:12.230> lot<00:03:12.350> more<00:03:12.380> sense<00:03:12.709> things<00:03:13.040> start<00:03:13.280> to

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
makes a lot more sense things start to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.250 
makes a lot more sense things start to
go<00:03:13.519> into<00:03:13.549> order<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.390> really<00:03:14.959> know<00:03:15.230> what

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
go into order and you really know what

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.440 
go into order and you really know what
you<00:03:15.620> want<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.250> with<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.519> problem<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.120> I

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
you want to do with the problem and I

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.090 
you want to do with the problem and I
really<00:03:17.870> think<00:03:18.079> we<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.320> relate<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.860> our

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
really think we can relate this to our

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.680 
really think we can relate this to our
real<00:03:19.310> life<00:03:19.519> stuff<00:03:19.760> as<00:03:19.940> well<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.420> know<00:03:20.540> when

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
real life stuff as well you know when

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.000 
real life stuff as well you know when
you<00:03:20.750> have<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.959> problem<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:21.709> it's<00:03:21.799> sitting

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
you have a problem and it's sitting

you have a problem and it's sitting
inside<00:03:22.220> your<00:03:22.489> head<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:22.940> don't<00:03:23.090> talk

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
inside your head and you don't talk

start really overthinking things you
start<00:03:30.680> really<00:03:31.209> complicating<00:03:32.209> things<00:03:32.239> and

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
start really complicating things and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.750 
start really complicating things and
really<00:03:32.959> making<00:03:33.320> things<00:03:33.680> more<00:03:33.980> unnecessary

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
really making things more unnecessary

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.240 
really making things more unnecessary
than<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.420> has<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.630> be<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.290> when<00:03:36.829> you<00:03:36.950> just<00:03:37.040> say

than it has to be and when you just say
it<00:03:37.370> out<00:03:37.519> loud<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:38.209> maybe<00:03:38.540> even<00:03:38.630> will<00:03:38.989> sound

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
it out loud it maybe even will sound

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.810

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
think it's so important to talk about it

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.340 
think it's so important to talk about it
with<00:03:47.030> someone<00:03:47.060> else<00:03:47.510> especially<00:03:47.870> with<00:03:48.230> either

with someone else especially with either

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.500 
with someone else especially with either
a<00:03:48.470> family<00:03:48.829> member<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.130> close<00:03:49.430> friend<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:50.030> mean

listening<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.120> your<00:04:08.209> poem<00:04:08.450> from<00:04:08.720> outside<00:04:09.230> of

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
listening to your poem from outside of

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.860 
listening to your poem from outside of
the<00:04:09.500> problem<00:04:09.920> because<00:04:10.519> they<00:04:10.670> are<00:04:10.970> not<00:04:11.300> clouded

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
the problem because they are not clouded

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
the problem because they are not clouded
and<00:04:12.170> they're<00:04:12.319> not<00:04:12.500> real

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
and they're not real

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.010 
and they're not real
biased<00:04:13.250> by<00:04:13.430> what<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.880> are<00:04:14.030> thinking<00:04:14.300> so<00:04:14.930> they

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
biased by what you are thinking so they

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.770 
biased by what you are thinking so they
can<00:04:15.200> really<00:04:15.410> give<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.280> clean<00:04:16.730> thought<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.570> what

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
can really give a clean thought to what

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.170 
can really give a clean thought to what
your<00:04:17.959> problem<00:04:18.320> is<00:04:18.470> or<00:04:18.920> even<00:04:18.980> a<00:04:19.310> solution<00:04:19.880> now<00:04:20.150> I

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
your problem is or even a solution now I

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.000 
your problem is or even a solution now I
think<00:04:20.329> as<00:04:20.630> people<00:04:20.900> we<00:04:21.320> should<00:04:21.500> really<00:04:21.680> bond

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010
