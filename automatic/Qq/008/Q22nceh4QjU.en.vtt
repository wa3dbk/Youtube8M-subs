00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.380
 My name is Alexey for managers 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.650
 and the company alliance 21 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.960
 the store 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.700
 fisherman on may day 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.710
 all you need to talk to you 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.590
 about the terrain 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.580
 Klose actually think that us 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.070
 Ian started the price of the catch 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.760
 the British 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.880
 very modernized 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.810
 space 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.970
 they did it for them to be 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.010
 first catch comfortable 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.140
 because 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.390
 when 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.330
 with her 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.270
 early 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.320
 ordinary 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.540
 snacks 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.980
 laid out sharply 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.710
 when cast, she is often confused by the elite 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.660
 cents he uploaded 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 produced by no point 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.320
 the British are more vulgar than that 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.060
 came up with actually 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.570
 rods whom vertical 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 that go 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 what is it Fedotov rods 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.040
 it all represents 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.160
 Vodka Refuge Center 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 equipped with rings Ph.D. 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.410
 but it is his concern, unlike the usual 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.370
 Eligible rods have a signaling device 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.280
 bite in this case was in black 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.300
 as a signaling device pokvke earlier 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.540
 this tip when biting 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.450
 it 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.890
 starting from the center 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.070
 twitch 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.700
 with figure fishing 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.350
 Rod is located on 1 2 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.310
 true attacks 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.520
 and practical located 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.540
 right 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.769
 percent 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.220
 coastline 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.589
 Egypt and Nicolas 1 respectively 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:13.520
 sharp 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.000
 abandoned water 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.729
 what else good way to catch 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.599
 at the concert tackle data is anti 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.079
 spin the july 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.419
 in this case he is angry inside 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.689
 the manger is fastened to it by 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.549
 carbine 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.739
 Kiev directly 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.169
 hook itself 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.789
 which are located 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.219
 near Yakutsk feeders 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.569
 which one sits on a hook 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.680
 this bait is cast 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.779
 means anti spinning 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.649
 is needed so that when you cast 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.329
 leash no caught on 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:53.789
 feeder 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.699
 and if this house is caught on the feeder 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.150
 and if the fish bite on such tackle 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.729
 who may well be 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.729
 broken by hooks why because 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.549
 trough can be to the north 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.409
 edged 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.329
 investors cues will just be 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.699
 transfer to them is very easy 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.649
 in order to avoid this 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:15.969
 and came up 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.859
 such an anti-law dash 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.919
 abandoned our gear 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.189
 tackle lay on the ground 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:24.619
 now it is necessary 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.589
 using to point tighten 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:27.589
 fishing line 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:30.329
 that is, choose slack 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.359
 with in order to be sharp anyway 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.999
 chief and no 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.709
 bite would be visible 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.319
 with this rod tip 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.019
 a little bit and bend 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.519
 only in such cases rod will it 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.539
 show 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:45.659
 the fact that 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.129
 the fish came up and started pulling 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.069
 bait 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.799
 here actually signals that 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:51.929
 what 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:53.799
 explosions came 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.609
 there is a bite 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.239
 these rods right now 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.239
 produces many companies including t 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.339
 shamans firm 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:03.819
 in this case 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.199
 me in the hands of it 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.199
 part of this rod of this company 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.949
 reel holder 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.949
 in this case is not fundamental 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.090
 he may be with this type he may be 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.510
 as on usual doses 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.229
 in the backside 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.900
 what matters is that god 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.479
 pretty securely reel who 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.710
 what holders 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.820
 hand doesnâ€™t have catch feeder 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.919
 of fundamental importance 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.650
 but in terms of how she is 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.050
 is made 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.620
 Means coil for fitness Nastya 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.520
 what requirements should it meet 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.029
 apartments she should be 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.919
 quite capacious field to 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.379
 to wind 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.129
 quite a lot of fishing line 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.679
 because about to throw about can be whose in 100 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:54.800
 meter 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.509
 in this case there is an adjustment 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.309
 precision 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:00.240
 a brake 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.169
 but they should be pretty tall 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.039
 gear ratios 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.740
 that is, for 1 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.330
 turnover 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.640
 at 3 6 degrees handle coil woods 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.840
 stack them should turn like 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.400
 at least five times 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.320
 the higher greece gear ratio 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.350
 relationship for this game we are with Nastya themes 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.839
 better for what it's done 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.729
 as long castings in Kiev 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.460
 often have to do 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.789
 feathers cast 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.520
 small fish may well 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.460
 it's a hundred to knock down 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.319
 vodka to make it all happen 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.150
 faster to do with just more 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.569
 gear ratio 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.710
 the coil should be pretty 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.930
 with a large body 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.270
 at least should not be 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.050
 four buds never 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.629
 and enough 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.110
 great or doctor 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.879
 otherwise, the coil should be powerful 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.369
 st shchedrunov rod 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:57.909
 there is 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:00.770
 quite a few rings 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.360
 they are made of various materials 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.189
 and 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.349
 but the main requirement for them 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.289
 to 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.400
 ring itself 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.249
 was equipped with an insert 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:12.869
 from solid material in this case 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:14.449
 material 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:15.379
 running gear 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.309
 more expensive rods are equipped 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:21.740
 percent of the committee sick 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.030
 the hardest stakes are the most 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.969
 mean what is it 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:28.039
 this bet even 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.289
 but moreover it hangs over a long one 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.099
 time 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.520
 rings remains pretty powerful on 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.120
 short legs 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.850
 The crucial point is 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.580
 that they have enough 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.909
 quantity 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.809
 probably all I wanted to say about 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:43.849
 feeder 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.079
 at the meeting on the channel hunting and fishing
