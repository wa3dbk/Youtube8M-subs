 all this later 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.310
 like the media some 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.050
 so-called scientists 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.530
 make of citizens of Russia fools 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.250
 unable to take right 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.570
 life and political decisions 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.380
 as one of thousands of examples 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.949
 such a fool 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.840
 But in this film we will consider a scam with 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.150
 supposedly landing the Americans on the moon 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.760
 and the world culture culture sphere 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.810
 the empire lays huge maps 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.420
 the background is 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.580
 early fifties soviet union 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.229

 the vast majority of countries in the world 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.490
 judge for yourself in the second world war the ussr 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.200
 under the leadership of Stalin 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.040
 fought almost all of europe and 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.250
 destroyed 75 percent of the armed forces 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.410

 The Great Patriotic War 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.440
 carried away the meetings of those riches 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.350
 that all our ancestors have accumulated from 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.240
 attracting 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.600
 and yet 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.960
 it made canceled cards on products 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.560
 in 1947 two years after the war 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.340
 and less torn france in 1949

 england early fifties 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.909
 and even while Putin countries 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.700
 the product is so expensive 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.729
 that it was impossible to buy them 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.299
 and you Oscar five years after the cancellation 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.149
 cards meat meat butter already 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.429
 staged two and a half times 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:23.480
 cheaper 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.489
 than the dates of cards 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.569
 sugar is two times cheaper 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.349
 failing in recent years 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.539
 fifth time 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:35.009
 bread prices reduced by 12 15 percent 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.679

 meat prices reduced by 15 20 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.479
 percent 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.789
 the reason for the decline in prices for vital 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:50.989
 products 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.760
 further raises the purchasing 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.959
 abilities of the Soviet ruble 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.249
 increases welfare 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.909
 every Soviet family is no way 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.519
 five years in the usa the price of bread rose by a third 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.980
 in england twice in france more than 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.389
 twice all this water was reported through on 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.540
 a quarter could by a third in france 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.729
 twice 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:11.359
 in terms of economic growth 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.429
 Stalinist Soviet Union no one has ever been ahead 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.869
 and this predetermined the movements of the USSR in 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.569
 period appears a couple more decades 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.219
 even after killing stalin 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.340
 the west still had childrenâ€™s homes 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.129
 free enterprise 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.499
 provides west 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.409
 greater progress in science and 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.219
 machinery rather than a planned farm 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.909
 association 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.179
 but in what 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.009
 you have every citizen's chance 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.569
 children though we support 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.559
 car 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.159
 Wonderful, but Osoar every citizen 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.219
 know perfectly wherever on 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.109
 public transport you 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.999
 think that a war tournament is war 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.869
 planes here are soviet planes 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.449
 you bully the whole world with an atomic bomb 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.370
 Year of the Soviet Atomic Bomb 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.999
 you dream to create a hydrogen bomb 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.559
 but astara it already created 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.579
 in 1950 turan year not only in the capital 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.239
 cities of the USSR but also in regional centers 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.039
 the beginnings of television in Europe 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.129
 let's say in Italy and the day still not dreaming 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.739
 if the korean war us supported 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.840
 many categorically capitalistic 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.530
 country 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.660
 ambassador to Korea his cannon fodder quartet 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.370
 Namskaya war us fought 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.820
 almost alone and in the end 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.409
 lost the war 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.189
 because of the like that did not help 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.539
 after the second world war rehabilitation 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.769
 arrested and taken out of their occupation 

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:34.700
 germany 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.440
 German rocket designers 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.720
 under whose leadership brown 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.130
 I hope with the help of the German mind to achieve 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.509
 wins in space 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.710
 but assorted without German 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.240
 constructors by running 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.650
 space first satellite first 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.759
 sent a man into space first 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.090
 reached the moon first photographed and 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.520
 back side 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.620
 it turned out that this is extremely 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.949
 profitable in terms of prestige 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.240
 questions 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
 in the eyes of the whole world 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.900
 it came to the point that in the 60s he 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.720
 collection passed any resolution of the Soviet 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.790
 union since the vast majority 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.650
 spending voted for them only because 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.009
 worth pushing expensive leader it 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:18.339
 complex
