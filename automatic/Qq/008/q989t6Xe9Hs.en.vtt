00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.010
 Hello, everyone is not answering 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.320
 Ivan on the deadlift 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.230
 there are certain difficulties with 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.590
 using combo squats 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.920
 becomes and 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.130
 but usually they are divided into two 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.800
 the first is impossible to sit down to reach it 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.890
 there is before the fingerboard and the second difficulty is already 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.989
 directly working then there is a breakdown 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.260
 carried to the knees held out 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.660
 I can not straighten up as with him 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.480
 fight in options there 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.460
 first theory then practice if 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.220
 touch theory is the simplest and most reliable 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.980
 but an expensive way to buy traction gear 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.540
 which is softer 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:01:00.020
 wider straps deep bosoms of 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 here there are no reinforced seams which 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.530
 hamper movement on the hips 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.570
 and it's impossible to sit down here but there is 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.120
 affordable options with 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.040
 squat combo on some 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.830
 disguise questions backwards 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.490
 front side remains on back 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.910
 I honestly tried a lot of difference 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.009
 I did not feel it, but it helps someone 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.259
 that is, if there are any difficulties 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.180
 nothing 's experimenting duck 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.930
 put it on in the hall try it suddenly 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.190
 your options 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:38.270
 so and the third option directly 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.880
 concerning the exercise now 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.860
 I will show here I would like to return to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.510
 features haunt his combo 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.570
 literally a few words on the squat 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.900
 squat after the straps are pulled and 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.280
 forward the athlete climbs under the barbell and 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.010
 presses the straps 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.500
 vulture and they do not have their location 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.260
 lose provide stiff back 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.950
 top to bottom position on 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.190
 the barbell us shoulders does not lie and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.120
 there is a moment leaning vulture 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.810
 the strap slides off 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.299
 that's where we go accordingly 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.110
 begin to pull and reach the knees almost 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.590
 straightening 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.370
 we need the body already under this strap 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.440
 slip and this is theoretically well 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.049
 difficult almost almost impossible 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.420
 you can often see people all in 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.000
 press 2 gears perform all 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.530
 the trajectory of movement is stuck here 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.990
 can't get shoulders behind the neck 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.180
 there is no such moment with him 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.550
 do either it comes exactly 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.620
 buy for traction 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.760
 either look for trapeze options with 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.680
 strap position 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.340
 maybe even with dressing set 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.750
 period now how to crawl under the bar 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.440
 showed and so proposed again 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.319
 sagging 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.200
 I personally did not buy and traction 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.600
 kombez for traction used his time 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.050
 titanium superior ordinary itself soft 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.040
 Titans how many without which get hooked 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.519
 less but for those who still love 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.459
 tougher and then cope with these 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.470
 Difficulties heroically show option 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.930
 which I personally like may have 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.850
 someone will get better someone 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.280
 knows some methods of action from me 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.959
 turned out 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.600
 hard to enrages give us not to reach 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.580
 no way i was going out 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.130
 with a crooked back seryoga question how is she 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.530
 It turned out as far as possible as I explained 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.110
 that feeling controlling so they don't 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.970
 swim on your shoulders reach out to him 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.520
 either hand 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.960
 then second hand well, either differently grip 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.780
 for show bear like mine sometimes 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.790
 even with a hump like that back and then 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.340
 pushes yourself there starts 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.500
 let the pelvis down before pounding it 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.580
 eyes 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.460
 Thoracic department to try to raise 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.390
 up as much as possible to be reborn 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:20.690
 back is the movement of the pelvis position 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.750
 quick just so i climbed personally here 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.340
 only in this way 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.650
 and I reached for the back or even the meaning of 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.980
 and pushed himself a little bit 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.000
 noticed 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.250
 preferably in this nonsense about the use 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.010
 there is no hell abundantly apply magnesia 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.430
 because you drag yourself first 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:47.190
 down there and then stand up with the barbell 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:51.540
 top two times the hands work down on 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.280
 writing and lifting in your palms sweat 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.350
 rod breaks out in the most responsible 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.710
 moment on passing knees or on 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.370
 experiment at the very top 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.810
 turn out 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.610
 experiment with equipment with 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.210
 options and dressing with different 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.379
 stamps 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.509
 with different devices reach their 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:16.090
 health goals 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.090
 sporting success in this meeting so far
