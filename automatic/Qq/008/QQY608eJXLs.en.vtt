to panorama shots which makes it

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.450 
to panorama shots which makes it
essentially<00:01:29.380> brain<00:01:29.650> dead<00:01:29.860> simple<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.220> take<00:01:30.430> a

two horizons there one dotted one solid

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.270 
two horizons there one dotted one solid
and<00:01:35.500> when<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:36.370> snap<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.910> photo<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:38.100> fill<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
circle then you can rotate the phone

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.010 
circle then you can rotate the phone
over<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.250> next<00:01:42.400> circle<00:01:43.150> oh<00:01:43.510> cool
