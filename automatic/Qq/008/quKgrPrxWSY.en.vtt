00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Greetings!

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.590
I'm Michelle.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.000
I'd like to ask all vloggers this question...

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.900
I wonder about your home space living right next doors,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
have you ever faced a situation like this? Let me show you.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Does this alarm you? You bet!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.800
Actually I was checking out the fenced area

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800
True business!

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.300
There his head popped on my face! ( GULP ! )

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.500
Gotta think really fast!

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.900
I gotta make sure if that dog was safe or not?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.960
How do you determine if your neighbor's dog is good,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.790
friendly or

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.600
nasty?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.460
First, you need to observe the dog thoroughly.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.990
What did I do? I had to observe that dog

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.460
The body, good coat?

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.900
Its mouth, ears

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.900
How did his ears react? Normal? Stressed?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.370
Just looking fine, friendly, curious?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.960
Check out its tail, how does the wagging tail look like?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.960
I did analyze it deeply.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.560
I got it. I'll show you how it look.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.200
(chuckling)

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.900
I love my neighbor's dog!

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.900
His one ear titled that way!

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.500
Apparently looking floppy?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Love it! I love looking at him like that!

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.400
Seemed young and sweet one. The tail was wagging as if

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.900
he was curious.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.000
I wanted to go ahead and do this. I was brave!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
My husband chickened out! Forget him! I moved on,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
approached and said to that dog, "Come here, come here."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.200
Yeah, he did came up to the fence! The first thing he must know the scent by

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.000
placing my hand to his nose. Go slowly, not too fast.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Always use the voice, whisper and make some kind of exchanging messages like communication.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Next, I slowly touched his chest and neck areas.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.800
as I indicated trying to be a submission to that dog.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.800
Gradually, it accepted me. I continued patting and placing my hands upward to his head area.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.200
We are OK! Doing fine!

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.300
Again, let me show you how.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.400
My neighbor's dog and I became friends! Everyday, I came home from work.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.300
I see him there standing up by our fence just to say hello! All righty.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.800
I come and give him my "hello" pattings. Everyday.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.100
We are still OK! We are bonded!

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.000
If you want to develop a friendship with your neighbor's dog, then try it slowly.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Ask someone you trust and help you, remember go slowly..

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.800
Do not be afraid, dogs can read your fear.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.200
Or the dog would go fiesty at you. You need to be really careful.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.800
Use your observation of its behaviors. Ask someone to assist you.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.900
You can have a good relationship with the dogs. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.900
Hope you do enjoy this! So long! =D
