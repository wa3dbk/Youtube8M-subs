00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.889
 the formation of a multicellular organism requires a process of 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.629
 Cell differentiation 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.849
 in which each group of cells 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.669
 specializes in specific functions 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.949
 cell differentiation 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.849
 should be mentioned with the expression of genes that are activated in a 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.849
 uneven in the cells of the different tissues that reaches a hand 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.250
 multicellular organism 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.040
 already does something bad but of course 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.200
 Each cell treviño requires another step in an agreement 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.360
 I wanted to source the individual 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.530
 contains the same information 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.890
 However, not all the information contained in ilave in the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.210
 that express a single cell 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.180
 if you did not speak those genes that encode the information 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.590
 for the proteins that are required 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.500
 in each cell type 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.990
 When the Caesar Honorary Doctor Fertilization happens the cell phone game 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.590
 from which 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.710
 all embryo cells are derived 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.420
 and later that of the adult 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.620
 and 5th 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.270
 six days later 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.740
 of a few hours 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.230
 and results in two identical cells 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.729
 later a second application occurs 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.700
 and so 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.829
 successively until a cell phone number called noble is formed 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.789
 the state 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.799
 because of its appearance similar to that of almonacid this 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.100
 the apple and cell phones just formed susana the three changes in its form 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.860
 it is gaining hollow inside and greased in a part 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.800
 what gives rise to the asturias gala 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.070
 the adventure group of this the call of the rates of this stage of successive 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.150
 cell divisions until arriving at the formation of long tula 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.580
 it's known as segmentation 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.939
 once the scale is formed 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.979
 certain movements are produced without it 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.209
 get to the place 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.659
 alabaster ula 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.369
 these movements 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:22.019
 he was deluded when you speak to him tula begins to speak inwards 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.779
 as if it were a deflated balloon 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.709
 tilman trash inside himself 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.099
 the western area of ​​minors is called the golden astor 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.609
 and thus an internal letter is generated in calling aldo bernucci an external 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.189
 called héctor huergo between these two boxes 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.060
 is arming and sovereign 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.560
 and subsequently from each one of them will be developed in the organs 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.199
 of the body 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:53.260
 from the benefits 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.200
 It was constituted in the digits 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.999
 and so 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.669
 the long non-genesis begins 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.669
 everything is the formation of the organs of the body 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.770
 in a few weeks each cell type 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.470
 but have their place inside the embryo 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.750
 and the difference in two so that he a nerve cell here in appearance 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.549
 it's totally different 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.760
 to the meeting of the epidermis Juan Manzur the heart muscle 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:25.619
 the case of vertebrates 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:29.039
 during embryonic development 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:34.039
 It also constituted some structures that have as fiction 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.229
 protects nourish the developing embryo 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:41.529
 these ashes are dependent on the germ layers of the embryo 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.619
 this entity is right in Granada 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.569
 coalition 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.059
 which is not the first nor in summer and the most external 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:54.649
 Its function is to protect the embryo 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.439
 they are to the placenta 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.849
 that are not merely moved in a train of salcedo and that facilitates their 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.149
 gas exchange 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.249
 years also a war entirely to the embryo 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.959
 the road that connects Alicante 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.209
 that is the space between brian a years 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.629
 a unique match analysis was made that acts as a stimulant in any 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:17.629
 part 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:21.079
 and it denies the freedom of world movement 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.469
 to the authorities 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:26.680
 in the vision of who is a structure that stores waste 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.379
 in the human being 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.539
 is small 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.089
 and your blood vessels contribute to the formation of the vessels 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.249
 of the umbilical cord the contest of the isolation of the embryo with the 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:39.659
 placenta 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:40.740
 by last 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.090
 Saturday and Sunday 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.990
 contains necessary nutrients to the world 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.140
 in some vertebrates like mammals is a sack practically 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.050
 empty 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.050
 which is part of the digestive system 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:57.040
 in its initial stages 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.040
 the embryonic cells are capable of forming 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.889
 a new full title 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.110
 it has been observed as follows from the 5th 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.419
 two cells 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.639
 be place 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.770
 to training should be sent means 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.699
 that is to say 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.689
 an individual sitting each of them 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.110
 these cells 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.870
 they are called potential tati 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.770
 because they have the power 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.400
 so that from them a new complete individual was developed 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:37.879
 during the event the fourth to the tenth day of development in the case of being 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.630
 human 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.810
 the cells are but if yours official 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.999
 this 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.050
 I mean 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.050
 that can become any type 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.289
 of something cellular will no longer be able to regenerate an individual with SMEs 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:56.669
 but nevertheless 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:02.159
 There are some cells that maintain the ability to regenerate tissue 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.110
 that belongs 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.110
 to this type of cells t calls them multitude of incidents 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.280
 clear example of it are the cells of the marrow 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:16.219
 and heart cells 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:21.589
 all these cells are known as stem cells we can move more 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:22.469
 common 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.169
 as stem cells 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.169
 olano extensions 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.479
 He made the proposal its use for the regeneration of damaged tissues 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:37.039
 for example in those of heart infarcts in case of tissue deterioration 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.099
 nervous 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:42.899
 no doubt of successful experiences placing these cells 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.510
 multipotential 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.720
 obtained from the bone marrow to regenerate the heart tissue after 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.889
 of a heart attack 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:56.509
 also a great potential of the coming cells has been discovered 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:58.479
 of the umbilical cord 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.770
 to regenerate 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.419
 likewise a woven san ginés 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:03.870
 this results 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.800
 have a very wide range of future possibilities of cell use 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.149
 mother will cure diseases such as 

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:13.469
 Until now 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:14.560
 cancer 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.990
 the year of spinal cord multiple sclerosis in victims 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.720
 increased Jun 15 among others
