00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
they cut your line if we're competing in

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.520 
they cut your line if we're competing in
anything<00:03:32.480> we<00:03:32.689> want<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:32.930> be<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.079> one<00:03:33.200> who<00:03:33.260> wins

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
anything we want to be the one who wins

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.280 
anything we want to be the one who wins
so<00:03:34.129> I<00:03:34.430> guess<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.269> competitive<00:03:35.870> nature<00:03:35.900> does

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
so I guess that competitive nature does

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.860 
so I guess that competitive nature does
