00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.140 
it's been quite a while once again since
I've<00:00:03.060> made<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.810> just<00:00:04.020> got<00:00:04.380> back<00:00:04.620> from

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
I've made a video I just got back from

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.909 
I've made a video I just got back from
winter<00:00:06.150> vacation<00:00:06.899> during<00:00:07.140> which<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.529> had<00:00:07.560> some

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
winter vacation during which I had some

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.680 
winter vacation during which I had some
time<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.160> actually<00:00:08.429> play<00:00:08.760> battlefield<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
time to actually play battlefield and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.629 
time to actually play battlefield and
record<00:00:10.440> some<00:00:10.620> gameplay<00:00:11.040> so<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.280> thought<00:00:11.550> it

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
record some gameplay so I thought it

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.249 
record some gameplay so I thought it
would<00:00:11.730> make<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.940> video<00:00:12.269> kind<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.780> updating<00:00:13.200> you

you<00:03:15.489> should<00:03:15.700> probably<00:03:15.970> get<00:03:16.239> it

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
you should probably get it

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.430 
you should probably get it
but<00:03:17.650> if<00:03:17.799> you're<00:03:17.980> somebody<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:19.349> didn't<00:03:20.349> play

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
but if you're somebody that didn't play

but if you're somebody that didn't play
dayz<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.579> haven't<00:03:21.819> played<00:03:22.030> any<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.329> the

dayz and you haven't played any of the

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.360 
dayz and you haven't played any of the
ARMA<00:03:22.720> games<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.349> you're<00:03:23.440> more<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.310> know

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
ARMA games and you're more of a you know

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.879 
ARMA games and you're more of a you know
fast-paced<00:03:25.030> battlefield<00:03:25.690> player<00:03:25.900> maybe<00:03:26.590> for

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
fast-paced battlefield player maybe for

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.710 
fast-paced battlefield player maybe for
example<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.760> might<00:03:28.450> want<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.599> think

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
example then you might want to think

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.059 
example then you might want to think
twice<00:03:28.810> about<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.260> at<00:03:29.440> least<00:03:29.560> right<00:03:29.829> now<00:03:29.859> you

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
twice about it at least right now you

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.500 
twice about it at least right now you
might<00:03:30.280> want<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.430> wait<00:03:30.639> till<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.000> game<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.450> a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
might want to wait till the game is a

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.659 
might want to wait till the game is a
little<00:03:32.349> bit<00:03:32.530> farther<00:03:32.799> in<00:03:33.069> its<00:03:33.190> development

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
little bit farther in its development

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.250 
little bit farther in its development
cycle<00:03:34.120> or<00:03:34.209> once<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.510> game<00:03:34.660> has<00:03:34.690> actually<00:03:35.079> been

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
cycle or once the game has actually been

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.500 
cycle or once the game has actually been
really<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:36.340> know<00:03:36.400> fully<00:03:36.669> released<00:03:37.090> cuz<00:03:37.329> it's

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
really you know fully released cuz it's

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.170 
really you know fully released cuz it's
still<00:03:37.750> pre-alpha<00:03:38.200> or<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:38.650> guess<00:03:38.799> it's<00:03:38.950> alpha<00:03:39.310> at

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
still pre-alpha or I guess it's alpha at

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.839 
still pre-alpha or I guess it's alpha at
this<00:03:40.329> point<00:03:40.599> so<00:03:41.109> do<00:03:41.919> watch<00:03:42.069> some<00:03:42.099> reviews<00:03:42.730> on

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
this point so do watch some reviews on

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.190 
this point so do watch some reviews on
the<00:03:42.940> game<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.239> stuff<00:03:43.359> before<00:03:43.510> just<00:03:43.870> jumping

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the game and stuff before just jumping

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.539 
the game and stuff before just jumping
out<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.410> buying<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.769> because<00:03:44.889> there's<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.310> lot

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
out and buying it because there's a lot

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.220 
out and buying it because there's a lot
of<00:03:45.579> differences<00:03:46.569> between<00:03:46.630> something<00:03:47.139> like

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
of differences between something like

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.400 
of differences between something like
dayz<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.799> battlefield<00:03:48.400> in<00:03:48.519> battlefields

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
dayz and battlefield in battlefields

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.199 
dayz and battlefield in battlefields
completely<00:03:50.410> different<00:03:50.680> genre<00:03:50.709> but<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.519> know<00:03:52.180> a

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
completely different genre but I know a

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.759 
completely different genre but I know a
lot<00:03:52.389> of<00:03:52.419> my<00:03:52.540> my<00:03:52.900> viewers<00:03:53.260> are<00:03:53.290> battlefield

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
lot of my my viewers are battlefield

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.979 
lot of my my viewers are battlefield
players<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.190> it's<00:03:54.819> definitely<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.720> game<00:03:55.840> that

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
players so it's definitely a game that

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.210 
players so it's definitely a game that
you<00:03:56.079> want<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.319> learn<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> little<00:03:56.799> bit<00:03:56.919> about

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
you want to learn a little bit about

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.129 
you want to learn a little bit about
because<00:03:57.459> it's<00:03:57.760> very<00:03:58.239> steep<00:03:58.569> learning<00:03:58.599> curve

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
because it's very steep learning curve

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.110 
because it's very steep learning curve
and<00:03:59.380> the<00:04:00.040> completely<00:04:00.579> different<00:04:00.790> playstyle

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
and the completely different playstyle

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.479 
and the completely different playstyle
but<00:04:01.150> anyway<00:04:01.569> moving<00:04:02.290> on<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.709> battlefield

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
but anyway moving on to battlefield

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.979 
but anyway moving on to battlefield
seems<00:04:04.120> like<00:04:04.209> there's<00:04:04.329> been<00:04:04.389> a<00:04:04.510> lot<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.810> issues

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
seems like there's been a lot of issues

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.440 
seems like there's been a lot of issues
with<00:04:06.900> patches<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.549> glitches<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:09.879> stuff<00:04:10.150> I

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
with patches and glitches and stuff I

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.690 
with patches and glitches and stuff I
haven't<00:04:10.870> really<00:04:11.400> experienced<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.459> lot<00:04:12.609> of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
haven't really experienced a lot of

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.990 
haven't really experienced a lot of
issues<00:04:12.879> with<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.510> game<00:04:13.720> myself<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:15.430> know<00:04:15.910> that

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
issues with the game myself I know that

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.670 
issues with the game myself I know that

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
I hope that future DLC where we actually

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.670 
I hope that future DLC where we actually
get<00:04:40.639> new<00:04:40.910> content<00:04:41.480> to<00:04:41.540> play<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.930> is<00:04:42.080> gonna<00:04:42.290> be<00:04:42.470> a

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.400 
get new content to play on is gonna be a
little<00:04:42.889> bit<00:04:43.040> more<00:04:43.220> exciting<00:04:43.700> for<00:04:43.850> me<00:04:43.940> but

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
little bit more exciting for me but

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.720 
little bit more exciting for me but
battlefield<00:04:45.410> right<00:04:45.560> now<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.919> kind<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.220> taking

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
battlefield right now is kind of taking

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.000 
battlefield right now is kind of taking
a<00:04:47.080> backseat<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.650> other<00:04:49.040> games<00:04:50.830> even<00:04:51.830> though

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
a backseat to other games even though

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.950 
a backseat to other games even though
it's<00:04:52.220> you<00:04:52.460> know<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.640> fairly<00:04:52.910> recent<00:04:53.390> release

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
it's you know a fairly recent release

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.659 
it's you know a fairly recent release
I'm<00:04:54.350> still<00:04:54.590> playing<00:04:54.770> every<00:04:55.160> once<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.430> a<00:04:55.520> while

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
I'm still playing every once in a while

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.810 
I'm still playing every once in a while
but<00:04:56.050> with<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.200> last<00:04:57.380> DLC<00:04:58.190> it<00:04:58.400> wasn't<00:04:58.730> too

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
but with the last DLC it wasn't too

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.600 
but with the last DLC it wasn't too
exciting<00:04:59.360> and<00:05:00.080> with<00:05:00.290> this<00:05:00.500> upcoming<00:05:00.860> next<00:05:01.370> DLC

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610

supports an Xbox 360 controller which is

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.230 
supports an Xbox 360 controller which is
a<00:06:00.380> lot<00:06:00.590> of<00:06:00.740> games<00:06:00.919> I<00:06:01.039> think<00:06:01.100> like<00:06:01.310> 50%<00:06:01.789> of<00:06:02.090> my

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
a lot of games I think like 50% of my

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.210 
a lot of games I think like 50% of my
games<00:06:02.510> and<00:06:02.690> steam<00:06:03.050> support<00:06:03.560> an<00:06:03.650> Xbox<00:06:04.010> 360

controller<00:06:04.900> I'm<00:06:05.900> moving<00:06:06.229> forward<00:06:06.680> only<00:06:07.640> more

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
controller I'm moving forward only more

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.279 
controller I'm moving forward only more
and<00:06:07.910> more<00:06:08.060> and<00:06:08.419> I<00:06:08.450> start<00:06:08.870> supporting

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
and more and I start supporting

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.690 
and more and I start supporting
controllers<00:06:09.890> especially<00:06:10.280> with<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.490> steam

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
controllers especially with the steam

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.360 
controllers especially with the steam
box<00:06:10.940> imminent<00:06:11.539> release<00:06:11.720> and<00:06:12.169> that<00:06:12.310> being<00:06:13.310> a

box imminent release and that being a
pretty<00:06:13.580> viable<00:06:13.910> platform<00:06:14.590> obviously<00:06:15.590> the

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
pretty viable platform obviously the

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.080 
pretty viable platform obviously the
steam<00:06:16.100> controllers<00:06:16.490> another<00:06:16.700> controller

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
steam controllers another controller

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.430 
steam controllers another controller
people<00:06:17.390> are<00:06:17.479> looking<00:06:17.750> at<00:06:17.900> for<00:06:18.110> you<00:06:18.380> know

people are looking at for you know

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.560 
people are looking at for you know
trying<00:06:18.860> to<00:06:18.890> play<00:06:19.130> a<00:06:19.160> PC<00:06:19.669> game<00:06:19.970> with<00:06:20.180> controller

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
trying to play a PC game with controller

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.060 
trying to play a PC game with controller
and<00:06:20.810> there<00:06:21.350> actually<00:06:21.620> are<00:06:21.710> some<00:06:21.860> really

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
and there actually are some really

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.320 
and there actually are some really
viable<00:06:23.260> options<00:06:24.260> and<00:06:24.669> scenarios<00:06:25.669> where<00:06:26.300> a

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
viable options and scenarios where a

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.480 
viable options and scenarios where a
controller<00:06:26.720> makes<00:06:26.990> sense<00:06:27.229> you<00:06:27.830> know<00:06:27.919> racing

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
controller makes sense you know racing

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.749 
controller makes sense you know racing
game<00:06:28.729> a<00:06:28.760> sports<00:06:29.330> game

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
game a sports game

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.270 
game a sports game
even<00:06:31.300> third<00:06:31.509> person<00:06:31.900> games<00:06:32.139> or<00:06:32.440> slasher<00:06:33.039> games

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
even third person games or slasher games

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.129 
even third person games or slasher games
I<00:06:33.610> think<00:06:33.669> work<00:06:34.539> really<00:06:34.569> well<00:06:34.900> with<00:06:35.050> a

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
I think work really well with a

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.360 
I think work really well with a
controller<00:06:35.530> you<00:06:35.650> know<00:06:35.740> it<00:06:36.009> comes<00:06:36.190> down<00:06:36.310> to

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
controller you know it comes down to

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.610 
controller you know it comes down to
first-person<00:06:36.669> shooters<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.389> accuracy<00:06:37.840> yes

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
first-person shooters and accuracy yes

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.240 
first-person shooters and accuracy yes
you<00:06:38.949> know<00:06:39.039> keyboard<00:06:39.430> mouse<00:06:39.580> is<00:06:39.880> superior

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
you know keyboard mouse is superior

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.700 
you know keyboard mouse is superior
every<00:06:42.250> day<00:06:42.400> but<00:06:43.210> I<00:06:43.479> found<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:44.050> lot<00:06:44.199> of<00:06:44.229> scenarios

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
every day but I found a lot of scenarios

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.640 
every day but I found a lot of scenarios
where<00:06:45.009> a<00:06:45.039> controller<00:06:45.940> actually<00:06:46.440> makes<00:06:47.440> more

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
where a controller actually makes more

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.650 
where a controller actually makes more
sense<00:06:47.949> and<00:06:48.130> in<00:06:48.340> some<00:06:48.580> games<00:06:48.819> there<00:06:49.240> for

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
sense and in some games there for

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.180 
sense and in some games there for
example<00:06:49.960> Dark<00:06:50.169> Souls<00:06:50.410> you<00:06:50.530> really<00:06:50.830> have<00:06:51.009> to

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
example Dark Souls you really have to

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.189 
example Dark Souls you really have to
have<00:06:51.280> a<00:06:51.310> controller<00:06:51.819> because<00:06:52.690> it's<00:06:52.930> such<00:06:53.169> a

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
have a controller because it's such a

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.670 
have a controller because it's such a
poor<00:06:53.560> port<00:06:53.949> from<00:06:54.220> a<00:06:54.940> console<00:06:55.599> platform<00:06:56.050> so<00:06:56.650> I
