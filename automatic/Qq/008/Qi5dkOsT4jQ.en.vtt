think the best films or family films are
the<00:00:42.180> ones<00:00:42.390> where<00:00:42.600> i'm<00:00:43.350> watching<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.190> my

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the ones where i'm watching it and my

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.740 
the ones where i'm watching it and my
son's<00:00:44.640> watching<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.510> both

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
son's watching it and we're both

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.650

enjoying<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.559> as<00:00:46.800> much<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.789> each<00:00:48.059> other<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.539> on

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
enjoying it as much as each other but on

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.290 
enjoying it as much as each other but on
completely<00:00:49.140> different<00:00:49.520> levels<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.940> think

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
completely different levels and I think

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.660 
innovate and come up with new ideas and
not<00:01:58.420> really<00:01:58.600> do<00:01:58.870> sequels<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.530> toy<00:02:00.160> story<00:02:00.190> was

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
not really do sequels and toy story was

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.100 
not really do sequels and toy story was
the<00:02:00.760> first<00:02:01.000> film<00:02:01.180> where<00:02:01.360> they<00:02:01.450> started<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:01.960> do

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
the first film where they started to do

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.440 
the first film where they started to do
that<00:02:02.290> but<00:02:02.770> i<00:02:03.010> think<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.490> toy<00:02:03.640> story<00:02:03.910> 3<00:02:04.180> you

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
that but i think the toy story 3 you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.240 
that but i think the toy story 3 you
have<00:02:04.630> three<00:02:04.960> films<00:02:05.260> which<00:02:05.380> are<00:02:05.500> utterly<00:02:05.860> valid

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
have three films which are utterly valid

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.700 
have three films which are utterly valid
in<00:02:06.400> their<00:02:06.610> existence<00:02:06.760> they<00:02:07.270> exist<00:02:08.200> by

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
in their existence they exist by

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.760 
in their existence they exist by
themselves<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.400> together<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.540> if<00:02:11.320> you're<00:02:11.740> a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
themselves and together and if you're a

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.620 
themselves and together and if you're a
kid<00:02:12.070> or<00:02:12.100> an<00:02:12.250> adult<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.790> gotta<00:02:13.030> love<00:02:13.180> toy<00:02:13.390> story

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
kid or an adult you gotta love toy story

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:23.490 
kid or an adult you gotta love toy story
three<00:02:18.750> new<00:02:19.750> toys<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:21.990> genuinely<00:02:22.990> think<00:02:23.320> it's

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
three new toys I genuinely think it's

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.140 
three new toys I genuinely think it's
the<00:02:23.560> best<00:02:23.710> trilogy<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.310> film<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.760> think<00:02:25.030> it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the best trilogy in film I think it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.420 
the best trilogy in film I think it
beats<00:02:25.330> Star<00:02:25.660> Wars<00:02:25.900> Lord<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.950> Rings<00:02:27.160> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
beats Star Wars Lord of the Rings and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.000 
beats Star Wars Lord of the Rings and
The<00:02:27.490> Godfather<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.810> really<00:02:29.200> do<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.650> think<00:02:29.860> it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
The Godfather I really do I think it's

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.400 
The Godfather I really do I think it's
absolutely<00:02:30.280> perfect<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.690> know<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.260> people

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
absolutely perfect I know that people

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.930 
absolutely perfect I know that people
would<00:02:32.590> go<00:02:32.710> what<00:02:33.070> time<00:02:33.370> can<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.520> say<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.730> but

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
would go what time can you say that but

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.210 
would go what time can you say that but
I<00:02:34.000> think<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.570> if<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.020> dissect<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.770> you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
I think if you if you dissect it and you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.620 
I think if you if you dissect it and you
look<00:02:36.370> at<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.580> story<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.090> runs<00:02:37.300> through<00:02:37.570> it

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
look at the story that runs through it

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.360 
look at the story that runs through it
and<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.140> heart<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> jokes

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
and that the heart in it and the jokes

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.250 
and that the heart in it and the jokes
in<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.150> way<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.450> characters<00:02:40.630> move<00:02:41.050> on

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
in it and the way the characters move on

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.480 
in it and the way the characters move on
it's<00:02:41.830> completely<00:02:42.900> perfect

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
it's completely perfect

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:55.380 
it's completely perfect
