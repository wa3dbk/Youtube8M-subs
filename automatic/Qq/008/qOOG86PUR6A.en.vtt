00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.720
 this is a very good and very important question 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.100
 first strength training for men only 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.989
 or is it also for women 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.169
 absolutely for men 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.949
 and for women 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.800
 why the muscles are actually being and then secretly who have a certain 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.230
 power needed to function 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.650
 A woman who can sometimes be scared when it becomes ears 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.100
 that they do in muscle building what do you do muscle building is also worth not 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.800
 muscle growth in the sense of bodybuilding 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.460
 men also have more testosterone, much more testosterone 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 you should get good muscle 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.740
 women have a cito lower order 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.500
 Testosterone OSN has muscle gain if you like having fun 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.710
 from whole muscular women he has always been used all 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 why doing strength training is also important so for women that if you do 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.590
 don't give all your muscles the right place to develop 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.470
 you don't want to go forward either 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.570
 I have the story from the gym very much that the top there 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.450
 with his hard work, they are doing really well, but especially on the cart 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.900
 equipment are busy until the boarding house cycle and row 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.250
 what do you get to the muscles have a certain amount of combustion 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.850
 one and if that is quite low because the muscles are not so strong you will too 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.080
 burn a lot again 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.940
 moreover, your body also uses that pattern again 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.090
 tainio 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.340
 and burgundy easier again 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.380
 in your body it is economical, so you ultimately want it 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.220
 burn less even if you don't do it anymore 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.300
 bruno a strength training then you make sure that the muscles become stronger that 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.940
 they burn more until you keep the cardio full longer that's it 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.940
 to achieve the higher speed 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.650
 It is simply extremely important that the muscles have enough strength on it 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.730
 allowing the body to do what it is made for, so strength training 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.010
 absolutely essential for men and women
