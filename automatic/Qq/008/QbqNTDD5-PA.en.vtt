just<00:05:59.110> generally<00:05:59.620> without<00:05:59.740> pin<00:06:00.010> system<00:06:00.160> look

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
just generally without pin system look

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.760 
just generally without pin system look
like<00:06:00.610> and<00:06:00.850> how<00:06:00.970> quick<00:06:01.630> or<00:06:01.930> or<00:06:02.140> not<00:06:02.290> quick<00:06:02.560> was

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
like and how quick or or not quick was

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.740 
like and how quick or or not quick was
an<00:06:03.220> overall<00:06:03.640> it<00:06:03.760> seems<00:06:04.030> to<00:06:04.150> have<00:06:04.270> pretty

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
an overall it seems to have pretty

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.630 
an overall it seems to have pretty
decent<00:06:04.900> performance<00:06:05.800> certainly<00:06:06.310> it's<00:06:06.520> not

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
decent performance certainly it's not

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.900 
decent performance certainly it's not
gonna<00:06:06.790> compare<00:06:07.180> with<00:06:07.420> the<00:06:07.510> core<00:06:07.750> i3<00:06:07.870> i5<00:06:08.500> or<00:06:08.560> i7

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
gonna compare with the core i3 i5 or i7

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.030 
gonna compare with the core i3 i5 or i7

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
but it's just a either secondary or a
