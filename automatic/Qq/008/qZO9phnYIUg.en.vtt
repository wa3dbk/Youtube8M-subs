so<00:00:01.920> what<00:00:02.070> are<00:00:02.159> we<00:00:02.220> up<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:05.060> trying<00:00:06.060> or<00:00:06.330> doing<00:00:06.569> it

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.350 

I<00:00:09.870> figure<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.710> since<00:00:11.639> we<00:00:11.820> had<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.000> difficult

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
I figure that since we had a difficult

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.789 
I figure that since we had a difficult
time<00:00:12.389> there's<00:00:12.780> probably<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.349> lot<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.620> other

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
time there's probably a lot of other

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.730 
time there's probably a lot of other
people<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> difficult<00:00:15.540> time<00:00:15.690> with<00:00:15.990> this

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.609 

right<00:00:19.740> now<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.760> fandangled<00:00:21.619> pocket

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
right now what is this fandangled pocket

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.429 
right now what is this fandangled pocket
watch<00:00:22.830> gold<00:00:23.340> watch<00:00:23.689> nonsense<00:00:24.689> going<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.260> on

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
watch gold watch nonsense going on on

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.009 
watch gold watch nonsense going on on
this<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:27.150> break<00:00:27.420> arm<00:00:29.689> normally<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.929> don't

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
this you break arm normally you don't

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.690 
this you break arm normally you don't
have<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.710> contraption<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
have all of this contraption and the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.190 
have all of this contraption and the
spring<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.120> comes<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.020> just

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
spring that comes with it this just

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.780 
spring that comes with it this just
enables<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> double<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> price<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.700> your

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
enables them to double the price of your

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.750 
enables them to double the price of your
stupid<00:00:36.149> brake<00:00:36.360> shoes<00:00:37.160> but<00:00:38.160> basically<00:00:38.610> it's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
stupid brake shoes but basically it's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.310 
stupid brake shoes but basically it's
got<00:00:38.820> all<00:00:38.940> these<00:00:39.059> clips<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.570> things<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.050> there

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
got all these clips and things in there

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
got all these clips and things in there
and<00:00:41.010> when<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.910> you've<00:00:42.270> got

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
and when you go to put it on you've got

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
and when you go to put it on you've got
aerodynamic<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:45.030> pointed<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.079> little

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
aerodynamic you know pointed a little

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.799 
aerodynamic you know pointed a little
button<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.039> instead<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.309> being<00:00:47.550> square<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
button on it instead of being square so

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.740 
button on it instead of being square so
that<00:00:48.840> has<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.590> into<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:51.390> really

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that has to go into here and it's really

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.069 
that has to go into here and it's really
a<00:00:51.960> pain<00:00:52.230> getting<00:00:53.030> old<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.270> out<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.870> one

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a pain getting old one out and this one

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.979 
a pain getting old one out and this one
in<00:00:55.350> unless<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> secret<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:57.180> what's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
in unless you know the secret now what's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.790 
in unless you know the secret now what's
the<00:00:58.109> secret<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.620> getting<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.980> old<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.370> off

the secret to getting the old one off

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.369 
the secret to getting the old one off
muscle<00:01:02.510> where'd<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> put<00:01:03.809> where<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> put

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
muscle where'd you put where do you put

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.770 
muscle where'd you put where do you put
the<00:01:04.500> screwdriver<00:01:07.670> right<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.270> kind

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the screwdriver right here this is kind

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
the screwdriver right here this is kind
of<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.960> springy<00:01:10.409> clip<00:01:10.770> right<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.729> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
of a springy clip right here and so you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.859 
of a springy clip right here and so you
push<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.299> down<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.979> push<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.460> end<00:01:17.869> out

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
push that down you push the end out

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
push that down you push the end out
through<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:20.490> happens<00:01:20.850> when

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
through out there now what happens when

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
through out there now what happens when
you<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> new<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.110> well<00:01:23.070> then

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
you go to put the new one on well then

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
you go to put the new one on well then
you<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> put<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> new<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.150> on

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you go to put the new one on

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.770 
you go to put the new one on
it<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.259> won't<00:01:25.439> reach<00:01:25.860> you've<00:01:26.250> got<00:01:26.460> this

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it just won't reach you've got this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.319 
it just won't reach you've got this
shoved<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.140> there<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.329> contracted

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
shoved up in there and it's contracted

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.230 
shoved up in there and it's contracted
as<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:31.939> go<00:01:34.460> it'll<00:01:35.460> only<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> about

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
as it can be go it'll only go to about

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109 
as it can be go it'll only go to about
here<00:01:36.710> or<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.610> pull<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
here or and then if you pull it out a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880 
here or and then if you pull it out a
little<00:01:39.420> bit<00:01:39.630> it'll<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.710> needs

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
little bit it'll go to here but it needs

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.230 
little bit it'll go to here but it needs
to<00:01:40.950> come<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:41.369> over<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.670> can't<00:01:42.150> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to come all the way over here can't you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.139 
to come all the way over here can't you
just<00:01:42.509> grab<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.159> housing<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.310> pliers<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
just grab this housing with pliers and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.340 
just grab this housing with pliers and
just<00:01:45.360> pull<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:47.420> because<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.600> housing<00:01:49.110> around

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
just pull it because that housing around

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.139 
just pull it because that housing around
the<00:01:49.530> cable<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.009> prevents<00:01:50.490> corrosion<00:01:50.670> will

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the cable that prevents corrosion will

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.520 
the cable that prevents corrosion will
make<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> bind<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.170> won't<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
make it bind and then you won't have a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.889 
make it bind and then you won't have a
smooth<00:01:52.860> cable<00:01:53.280> operation<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.540> what's<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
smooth cable operation so what's the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.120 
smooth cable operation so what's the
solution

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.310 

there's<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.210> bit<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> slack<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
there's a little bit of slack but it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.090 
there's a little bit of slack but it
kept<00:02:01.530> disappearing<00:02:06.409> if<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.590> undo<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
kept disappearing if you undo the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.130 
kept disappearing if you undo the
emergency<00:02:08.640> brake<00:02:08.850> cable<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.509> an<00:02:09.810> easier

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
emergency brake cable this is an easier

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.840 
emergency brake cable this is an easier
end<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.530> work<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.640> in

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
end to work with to get this in

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.910 
end to work with to get this in
afterward<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.470> pull<00:02:13.680> all<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
afterward because you can pull all the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
afterward because you can pull all the
slack<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.700> while<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> brakes<00:02:15.209> are

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
slack out of it while the brakes are

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.750 
slack out of it while the brakes are
taken<00:02:15.720> apart<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.130> taken<00:02:17.430> apart

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
taken apart and with them taken apart

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.030 
taken apart and with them taken apart
you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.090> get<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> way<00:02:18.690> up<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:19.140> through

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
you can get it all the way up in through

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.500 
you can get it all the way up in through
the<00:02:20.190> little<00:02:20.370> tab<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.030> then<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.209> don't<00:02:21.390> have

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the little tab and then you don't have

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.630 
the little tab and then you don't have
to<00:02:21.569> wrestle<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.800> lot<00:02:23.040> easier<00:02:23.250> process

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
to wrestle and it's a lot easier process

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.430 
to wrestle and it's a lot easier process
so<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:24.120> we<00:02:24.239> do<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.540> push<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.989> cable<00:02:25.319> all

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
so what we do is we push the cable all

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:38.390 
so what we do is we push the cable all
the<00:02:25.590> way<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.370> then<00:02:26.819> how<00:02:27.030> easy<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:37.400> okay

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the way in and then how easy is it okay

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.240 
the way in and then how easy is it okay
just<00:02:39.360> bring<00:02:39.569> down<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.390> coach<00:02:42.810> it

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
just bring down and then just coach it

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.850 
just bring down and then just coach it
through<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:45.450> then<00:02:45.810> once<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.260> release<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
through and then once you release the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.740 
through and then once you release the
spring<00:02:47.220> it'll<00:02:47.519> just<00:02:47.760> put<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.090> back<00:02:48.300> up<00:02:48.540> into

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
spring it'll just put it back up into

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.470 
spring it'll just put it back up into
spot<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:50.220> harder<00:02:50.519> with<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> camera<00:02:51.120> running

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.080 

you<00:03:13.500> get<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> kick<00:03:13.920> out<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
you get a kick out of that so this is

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.789 
you get a kick out of that so this is
the<00:03:15.209> way<00:03:15.329> it<00:03:15.450> looks<00:03:15.480> close-up<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.410> can<00:03:16.650> see

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
the way it looks close-up you can see

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.720 
the way it looks close-up you can see
that<00:03:17.130> little<00:03:17.310> spring<00:03:17.730> underneath<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
that little spring underneath of it and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.640 
that little spring underneath of it and
that's<00:03:20.730> how<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.090> goes<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:22.200> that's<00:03:22.470> all

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
that's how it goes and that's all

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.590 
that's how it goes and that's all
riveted<00:03:23.160> in<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.670> can't<00:03:23.880> take<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.359> off<00:03:24.570> and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
riveted in you can't take that off and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.020 
riveted in you can't take that off and
do<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.410> old<00:03:25.590> school<00:03:25.680> ways<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.459> suppose<00:03:26.760> you

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
do it old school ways I suppose you

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.000 
do it old school ways I suppose you
could<00:03:27.299> but<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.900> don't<00:03:28.530> know<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.769> you'd<00:03:28.859> have

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
could but I don't know that you'd have

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.979 
could but I don't know that you'd have
great<00:03:29.280> luck<00:03:29.489> having<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.910> stay<00:03:30.090> together<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
great luck having it stay together the

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.569 
great luck having it stay together the
reason<00:03:31.260> why<00:03:31.350> they<00:03:31.500> went<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:32.070> kind<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.519> a

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
reason why they went with this kind of a

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.340 
reason why they went with this kind of a
deal<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.970> because<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.390> hold<00:03:33.600> down<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.049> return

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
deal is because the hold down and return

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.920 
deal is because the hold down and return
