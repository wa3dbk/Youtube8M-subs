00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.370

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.869
 hello youtube friends, I'm your tomato 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.970
 point anime as you are I hope that well 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.890
 good I bring you some tricks of windows 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.890
 7 I hope you like it and let's start 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.710
 if we have an open window and the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.710
 we want to remove press windows + m 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.070
 there is also another way in case 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.410
 we want the screen to disappear 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.329
 full press windows + space and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.570
 only what is behind the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.570
 desk 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.170
 if we want to change the size of a 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.090
 window either maximize or minimize or 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.370
 move to the right or left we oppress 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.370
 windows + any arrow on the keyboard 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.840
 to activate an approach as for 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.820
 a tutorial we click on windows + the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.170
 sign of more and an approach to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.170
 where we move the cursor 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.840
 or if we want to decrease the approach 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.840
 we press windows + the minus sign 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.180
 if we have a projector or if we want 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.400
 connect a screen to the computer 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.280
 we click on windows + page will open 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.560
 a small window with four options 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.810
 single team duplicate extend alone 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.470
 projector there we choose the option that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.470
 we need 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.420
 good in the next and last trick that 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.460
 for me it is one of the best to them 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.680
 I will teach that the windows that have 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.820
 open they are put in 3-d to choose 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.820
 in a faster way 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.320
 I 'll give you an example we have facebook and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.689
 google and open what we do is 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.460
 press windows + tab and the screens will 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.630
 will put in vertical form for a 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.630
 window selection 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.550
 As you can see, each of the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.550
 windows that we open 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.440
 So far the tutorial I hope you have 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.650
