00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello friends of youtube subscribers 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.480
 in this video I will show you a little 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.519
 trick or card game for it 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.580
 we show our cards to the viewer 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.430
 so you see that there is nothing weird 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.719
 well already shown will be delivered to 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.719
 spectator to mix them 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.580
 well once mixed we will ask the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.850
 viewer who takes the amount of 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.290
 letters lower than 15 suppose that the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.290
 spectator takes 13 cards 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.570
 and that I put them aside to go back to 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.310
 take the same number of letters that you have 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.310
 taken out that is 13 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.609
 and that they observe the letter that is 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.760
 at the end we have the jack of spades 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.769
 all right 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.739
 Once this is done we will tell the 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.710
 viewer that we will find your letter 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.129
 spelling names 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.119
 for this we have to keep in mind that 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.200
 we must gather at least 15 the amount 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.310
 of 15 letters by names 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.290
 First of all we can ask him his 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.470
 name the viewer suppose that it 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.119
 llama jesús jesús has 5 letters yes 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.130
 we have more viewers we can 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.520
 ask them or us the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.180
 we can invent there is no problem 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.220
 suppose there is a woman who 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.220
 called guadeloupe and a man called 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.700
 Adriana Guadeloupe nine letters and Adrián 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.890
 6 having a total of 20 letters with the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.900
 Spectator's name 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.390
 once having this and adding 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.610
 mentally we will ask the viewer 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.760
 to place the second pile that has 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.580
 removed from the cards and we will indicate 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.870
 that goes letter as follows 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:58.640
 first his name and his name 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.750
 of the woman or the light 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.750
 and the last name 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.470
 Adrián 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.149
 well the viewer will think that 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.569
 we have only given him indications 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.760
 but in reality what we have done is 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.230
 reverse the order of the letters 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.910
 we raise the letters and place it by 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.520
 over 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.830
 already placed on top 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.320
 we will give the deck to the spectator and 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.890
 we will ask you to place the first pile 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.560
 that has taken over and that of the e3 of 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.890
 the way we have taught him is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.640
 will bring his name that his name the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.170
 woman was the light 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.170
 and the last name 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.750
 adrián already spelled the names him 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.380
 We will ask that you observe carefully the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.960
 letter that follows 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.750
 and we get that it's the letter from 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.000
 good friend viewer this has been 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.490
