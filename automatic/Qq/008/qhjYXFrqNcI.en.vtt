yourself<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:37.320> which<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.070> once<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
yourself to which I think once in a

yourself to which I think once in a
while<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.329> okay<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.890> looks

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
while that is okay to do but it looks

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.830 
while that is okay to do but it looks
like<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> cap<00:01:42.119> comes<00:01:42.420> off<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
like this and then the cap comes off and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.410 
like this and then the cap comes off and
you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.380> miss<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.340> over<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.909> it

you can just miss this all over and it
is<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.470> fine<00:01:46.979> mist<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.970> really

is a really fine mist which I really

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.359 
is a really fine mist which I really
like<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.290> doesn't<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.829> move<00:01:50.340> your

in<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.680> at<00:02:15.830> all<00:02:16.069> because<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.790> was<00:02:17.030> kind<00:02:17.150> of

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
in this at all because I was kind of

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.940 
in this at all because I was kind of
mistaken<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.110> thought<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:18.740> was

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
mistaken I thought that this was

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.559 
mistaken I thought that this was
supposed<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.730> really<00:02:20.060> shimmery

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
supposed to be like a really shimmery

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.199 
supposed to be like a really shimmery
glowing<00:02:21.050> kind<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.380> mist<00:02:21.709> but<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.340> not<00:02:22.670> the

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
glowing kind of mist but it's not the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.390 
glowing kind of mist but it's not the
actual<00:02:23.540> liquid<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.680> milky<00:02:25.160> white

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
actual liquid in this is a milky white

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040 
actual liquid in this is a milky white
color<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.030> when<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.209> sprayed<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.630> on<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.930> back

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
color and when I sprayed it on the back

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.410 
color and when I sprayed it on the back
of<00:02:27.230> my<00:02:27.410> hand<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:28.220> was<00:02:28.370> more<00:02:28.580> like<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.060> light

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
of my hand it was more like a light

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.240 
of my hand it was more like a light
lavender<00:02:29.750> color<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.620> think<00:02:30.709> there's<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.010> very

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
lavender color so I think there's a very

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.270 
lavender color so I think there's a very
soft<00:02:31.700> iridescent<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.930> this<00:02:33.110> mist<00:02:33.560> but<00:02:34.070> there's

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
soft iridescent to this mist but there's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.699 
soft iridescent to this mist but there's
no<00:02:34.670> shimmer<00:02:35.030> or<00:02:35.270> anything<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.440> just

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
no shimmer or anything like that so just

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.590 
no shimmer or anything like that so just
keep<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.070> mind<00:02:37.430> it's<00:02:37.700> not<00:02:37.910> supposed<00:02:38.420> to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
keep that in mind it's not supposed to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.260 
keep that in mind it's not supposed to
be<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.810> very<00:02:39.410> heavily<00:02:39.800> shimmery<00:02:40.550> glowing<00:02:41.060> kind

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
be a very heavily shimmery glowing kind

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.400 
be a very heavily shimmery glowing kind
of<00:02:41.420> mist<00:02:41.690> if<00:02:41.900> that's<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.260> you're<00:02:42.380> looking

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
of mist if that's what you're looking

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.740 
of mist if that's what you're looking
for<00:02:43.010> but<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.550> did<00:02:43.790> try<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.030> use<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.690> a

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
cheeks here and it's not like a shimmery

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.190 
cheeks here and it's not like a shimmery
kind<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.340> glow<00:04:34.670> it's<00:04:34.970> very<00:04:35.390> subtle<00:04:35.990> and

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
kind of glow it's very subtle and

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.410 
kind of glow it's very subtle and
natural-looking<00:04:37.070> which<00:04:37.430> is<00:04:37.610> why<00:04:37.940> I<00:04:37.970> love<00:04:38.360> it

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
natural-looking which is why I love it

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.200 
natural-looking which is why I love it
so<00:04:38.540> much<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:39.380> this<00:04:39.590> will<00:04:39.830> continue<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.400> set<00:04:40.880> and

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
so much so this will continue to set and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.240 
so much so this will continue to set and
it'll<00:04:41.660> be<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.900> little<00:04:42.170> bit<00:04:42.380> more<00:04:42.620> subtle<00:04:42.920> than

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
it'll be a little bit more subtle than

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.430 
it'll be a little bit more subtle than
this<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:43.970> honestly<00:04:44.150> your<00:04:44.780> face<00:04:45.080> will<00:04:45.410> look

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
this but honestly your face will look

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.700

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
but it's not something I plan on using

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.470 
but it's not something I plan on using
every<00:05:03.980> single<00:05:04.010> day<00:05:04.580> so<00:05:04.820> if<00:05:04.880> you<00:05:04.940> are<00:05:05.180> looking

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
probably wouldn't recommend this to

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.930 
probably wouldn't recommend this to
anyone<00:05:15.440> who<00:05:15.560> has<00:05:15.710> really<00:05:16.160> oily<00:05:16.490> skin<00:05:16.790> just
