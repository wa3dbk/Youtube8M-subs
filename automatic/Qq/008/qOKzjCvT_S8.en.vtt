believe that if he boxes manny pacquiao

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.750 
believe that if he boxes manny pacquiao
and<00:00:18.240> uses<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.380> movement<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.160> his<00:00:20.279> feet<00:00:20.580> and

land<00:00:23.789> some<00:00:24.630> shots<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.140> think<00:00:25.560> he<00:00:25.680> could<00:00:25.859> win

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920

like<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.010> believe<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> Manny<00:00:45.329> Pacquio

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
like that I believe that Manny Pacquio

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.869 
like that I believe that Manny Pacquio
will<00:00:46.110> fight<00:00:46.410> smart<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.579> he's<00:00:47.700> also

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
will fight smart but I think he's also

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.299 
will fight smart but I think he's also
trying<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.690> back<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.590> ferociousness

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
trying to get back that ferociousness

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.549 
trying to get back that ferociousness
that<00:00:50.760> killer<00:00:51.120> instinct<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.899> think<00:00:52.170> he's<00:00:52.320> got<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that killer instinct I think he's got a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.260 
that killer instinct I think he's got a
lot<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.010> prove<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.789> he<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.180> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
lot to prove and I think he is going to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.860 
lot to prove and I think he is going to
be<00:00:54.449> trying<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.160> fight<00:00:56.399> viciously

one of those sneaking suspicions

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.310 
one of those sneaking suspicions
something<00:04:34.580> this<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.390> boxing<00:04:35.630> right<00:04:36.140> where
