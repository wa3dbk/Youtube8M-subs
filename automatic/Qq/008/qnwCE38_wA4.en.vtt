00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 The PSV returns around noon 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.750
 Croatia from business where it was yesterday with 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.319
 zero zero against dinamo 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.179
 zagreb 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.450
 how was the feeling with the cookie the d 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.250
 behind yes fine 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 restore short recovery training a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
 some players do something more 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.380
 not too much after a trip and then 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.590
 tomorrow completely focus on the manner of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.970
 Sunday no injuries, no pains 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.250
 to pains and always that she 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.359
 don't have any injuries so everyone 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.070
 is fine 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.930
 it came the match and the focus 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.910
 is now the away game on Sunday afternoon 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.010
 at half past one against roda jc 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.530
 and they play Jan detail Wednesday night 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.489
 psv roda against each other again than for the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.950
 cup 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.469
 It is usually strange that you have three 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.450
 plays the same team twice 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.989
 but the difference is off and on 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.180
 home 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 so that gives something different to the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.640
 contest 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.879
 so we will agree on the competition 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.969
 need to focus and then we go 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.680
 see if full round of the cup can 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.239
 and you know for example 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 from experience that the result of one 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.369
 competition therefore affects the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 another match 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.280
 well the course of the first 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.350
 if i can affect the following 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 contest 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 she has an intention and pressure anyway 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.400
 midweek program the coming weeks me 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 have looked 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 now europe league better than weather 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.009
 Europa League then this week is blowing from 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.439
 international weekend 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.650
 yes it continues like this until the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.049
 I think winter break is very intensive 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 program with many competitions 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.110
 which means more for trading 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.680
 Occupational therapy then very seriously 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.119
 train 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.530
 wire is almost only restore 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.270
 from the last match and 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.640
 yes prepare for the day later 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.770
 match who will come and that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.570
 rhythm we have actually been around for a while 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.310
 Sometimes that's a shame you don't have anything 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.270
 get more time to name quietly 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.750
 is ratu 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.400
 to work on what is specific 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.600
 if you end it not for but 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.159
 You know how to play football 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.540
 sweetest competitions 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.820
 yes you can not enough games 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.560
 play as a player and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.869
 but as a staff we sometimes look 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.060
 other than for that matter taste cookie 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.369
 trainer now other considerations than 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.470
 not as a footballer at the time 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.360
 pst has not been successful recently 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.040
 in away games last weekend 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.110
 lost it out at groningen 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.400
 last night 0 0 draw against dinamo 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.350
 zagreb and then follows now 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.140
 roda school of truth revealed 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.140
 every out of the fight is pretty tricky 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.569
 so what's next is that again 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.350
 we show so we must we must 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.030
 at the bucket 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.709
 we also take care of the bulldog on her behalf 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.239
 sunday we stand and gaastra for that one 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.560
 positive state then I will be the only one 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.550
 way to make it not a theme 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.920
 away games 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.380
 yes we also don't have to become a theme later 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.579
 it's crazy is I got that as often 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.150
 it is busy though one in it 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.799
 football 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.180
 that is not only the case in the Netherlands 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.590
 all competitions 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.870
 in out and home is out shit 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.150
 a difference if it is right with you 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.440
 stronger at home than looking forward to 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.790
 possible who are not satisfied with the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.230
 bald point that we have taken out 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.230
 there strive to go that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.010
 improve what do you expect Sunday afternoon 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.620
 well i have to say its one 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.660
 soccer team expected 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.760
 roda from backwards want to play football 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.200
 lots of movement around midfield 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.120
 so but i think so 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.359
 is similar to how we want 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.260
 players whether it will be an open game 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.690
 or that she 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.459
 collapsed yes that we must wait 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.459
 how do you prepare everything
