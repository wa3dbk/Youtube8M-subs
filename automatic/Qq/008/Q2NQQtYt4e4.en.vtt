00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:13.360
 well as materials we need 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.070
 a plant outbreak of preference 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.459
 delegated and lengthened so that it leaves the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.459
 focus 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.439
 the filament focus of preference that 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.580
 it was melted so that we looked like a 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.580
 functional focus 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.020
 in this case we will make a cup as support 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.280
 for the focus a little water 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.280
 land to plant 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.909
 some tweezers 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.579
 of delegated tip preferably and by 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.289
 security 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.539
 let's use a cloth in this case a 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.530
 bandage in case something went wrong with the 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:56.409
 focus glass 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:59.360
 let's not cut our hands and 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.540
 let's start taking our focus 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.810
 we wrap it with the cloth with our 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.810
 hand 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.930
 the idea is that if all the 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.870
 focus the videos do not have them 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.060
 and well, they will take it with the side 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.750
 screw up and they'll see that at 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.300
 final the thread is this kind of 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.520
 little black thing that is going to be just cause 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.520
 remove take their tweezers 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.579
 and they start to apply it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.530
 you have to cut it a couple of tips for 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.799
 it will be easier as they have 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.140
 hit a bit with the clamp they take a 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.240
 small piece of metal that is in the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.270
 tip of this black part that we were 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.740
 hitting and they should tear it with the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.060
 clamp after a couple of beats can be 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.720
 do and since they have done that 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.119
 hit with the tip a little to continue 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.150
 weakening and then grasp with the clamp 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.510
 the entire black piece and squeeze the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.910
 tighten the texture is how is how 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.190
 squeezing a candy ends up yielding and 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.150
 it ends up breaking and finally we have 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.819
 this now something important has a lot 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.860
 be careful when throwing away all the waste 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.300
 because within the young focus all that 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.709
 we broke is practically inside the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.060
 focus 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.540
 take care of your eyes but you can do it 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.239
 little away from the face 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.290
 We were sent a bag to fly 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.290
 get everything 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.610
 it would be 18 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.540
 here this filament 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.140
 It was broken as I said it's a bit 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.140
 it was melted 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.880
 try to cheat as little as possible in the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.880
 top part 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.130
 since we did this 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.910
 we take our land but do 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.910
 basic in the bag 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.050
 with these clamps that are also razor 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.480
 but 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.600
 with doing it even with your hands 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.310
 cut 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.310
 the tip of your bag 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.750
 grows to the tip 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.750
 from opening it 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.110
 and goal on earth is easy 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.010
 good since it goes like this on earth inside 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.320
 of your focus, put the calculation more 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.320
 or less account clean it well 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.680
 a good advice is to do it within a 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.010
 bag so that the earth that comes out does not 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.380
 soil your work floor 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.380
 they take their plant out of the water 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:34.380
 now to give a curious touch all 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.240
 the glasses with the will be inside 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.930
 we put our focus 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.930
 that float 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.190
 and ready 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.980
 well that would be our little one 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.990
 handicraft today finished 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.680
 they can try to give it a spin by doing 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.590
 a wire base is not very difficult 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.040
 neither 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.720
 the touch of the cup and the water of the cup 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.610
 and the water pleased me because it gives a 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.110
 touch more homemade and good I'm pretty 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.210
 curious 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.240
 in this case now we give ourselves a flower 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.450
 dry because of availability but 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.550
 a good outbreak of any plant one 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.790
 leaf above all without problem survive 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.180
 in a little flower like that 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.460
 or in a little house like that and well it's not 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.890
 all for today's craft I reiterate be 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.340
 very cautious the black part of the focus 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.520
 cut a little if the pieces fall and 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.400
 usually fly away be very careful 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.600
 try not to do it with children or make it 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.600
 helping them not to get hurt
