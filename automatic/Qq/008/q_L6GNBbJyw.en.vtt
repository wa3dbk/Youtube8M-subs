00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.220
 a manicure I will start since I 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.020
 I unmask the nails like good ones and I do not know 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.150
 If you know it or not, if you follow me through networks 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.880
 you will know that I have nails 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.070
 Acrylics and I wear enameled semi 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.410
 transparent gel permanent under 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.100
 then I to remove makeup what 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.010
 use is a make-up remover without acetone 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.739
 so that I do not remove the gel and I hope 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.040
 bought in produced a week store 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.680
 product is important that not that not 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.140
 I have acetone so that I do not remove the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.510
 enameled from below I'll show you the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.149
 glazes that I will use and the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.280
 tools and we put to it like 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.880
 black i'm going to use this golden rose 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.420
 is number 35 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.190
 target I will use the one that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.190
 it's the white tone 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.530
 the orange that I'm going to use is this one 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.119
 kiko and is the 356 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.760
 the pink that I'm going to use is what 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.299
 I'm wearing right now it's also the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.299
 381 warp 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.899
 as blue of kiko you are also at 340 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.140
 for base of the nails used this 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.079
 bell I like a lot gives me hardness though 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.210
 in this case as I carry the acrylics what 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.859
 The only thing he does is give me a good coat 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.310
 so that then my fingernail will not stick 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:42.759
 stained or anything let's say it protects me 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.689
 the acrylic of the enamels 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.759
 later and as top coat is avoided 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:54.200
 for me it's my favorite, it dries my nails 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.170
 super fast and good they last me a lot 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.000
 plus 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.000
 cotton is 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.820
 local chapita mint league I do not get the 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.730
 name now but good I'll do it 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.520
 the mixtures is goat I bought it in 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.030
 burlesque and finally the punches 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.280
 These are garin coins that you see 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.040
 They have different sizes of 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.500
 pointer so without more 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.750
 I start is a decoration that I have more 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.270
 or less designed that has left me for 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.310
 here the fact drawings 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.080
 - done before applying my nails 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.080
 so let's go there 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.609
 yes 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.900
 yes 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.230
 As you can see, that's how they would look like, 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:08:01.370
 as a design as well as very summery 

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:03.320
 pretty daring, nothing discreet, I've gone 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.030
 taking enough ideas that I have gone 

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.010
 watching over the internet and I wanted to do 

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.010
 something like that a little scandalous so 

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:12.050
 this is the result I hope that I have 

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.590
 liked and see you in the next video 

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.590
