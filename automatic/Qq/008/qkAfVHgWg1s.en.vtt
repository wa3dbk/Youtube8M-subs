with the the heat problems you get with

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.920 
with the the heat problems you get with
these<00:02:22.930> cars<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.430> car<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.269> interior<00:02:25.540> was

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
these cars so this car the interior was

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.710 
these cars so this car the interior was
updated<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.500> an<00:02:26.709> 84<00:02:27.190> style<00:02:27.549> we<00:02:28.150> used<00:02:28.360> our<00:02:28.540> new

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
updated to an 84 style we used our new

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.740 
updated to an 84 style we used our new
fiber<00:02:29.049> glass<00:02:29.290> replacement<00:02:29.799> dashboard<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
fiber glass replacement dashboard and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.600 
fiber glass replacement dashboard and
center<00:02:31.750> consoles<00:02:36.329> so<00:02:37.329> we<00:02:37.540> converted<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:39.129> 81

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
center consoles so we converted the 81

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.930 
center consoles so we converted the 81
style<00:02:39.909> dash<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.390> an<00:02:40.510> 84<00:02:40.930> style<00:02:41.200> -<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.940> with

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
style dash to an 84 style - and with

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.670 
style dash to an 84 style - and with
this<00:02:43.120> car<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:45.250> devised<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:46.090> custom<00:02:46.660> AC<00:02:46.930> system

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
this car we devised a custom AC system

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.900 
this car we devised a custom AC system
and<00:02:47.940> now<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.000> two<00:02:49.390> fresh<00:02:49.780> air<00:02:49.989> ducts<00:02:50.260> are<00:02:50.910> AC

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
and now the two fresh air ducts are AC

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.210 
and now the two fresh air ducts are AC
outlets<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.170> originally<00:02:53.590> when<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:53.829> car<00:02:54.040> had

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
outlets so originally when this car had

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.650 
outlets so originally when this car had
air<00:02:54.370> conditioning<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:54.970> whole<00:02:55.120> unit<00:02:55.480> hung

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
air conditioning the whole unit hung

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.210 
air conditioning the whole unit hung
underneath<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.290> passenger<00:02:56.829> side<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.160> the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
underneath the passenger side of the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.369 
underneath the passenger side of the
dash<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.359> really<00:02:58.599> compromised<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
dash and it really compromised the

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.520 
dash and it really compromised the
legroom<00:02:59.829> for<00:03:00.099> any<00:03:00.790> passengers<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:01.989> our<00:03:02.170> unit

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
legroom for any passengers so our unit

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.920 
legroom for any passengers so our unit
fits<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:02.920> place<00:03:03.069> at<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.430> stock<00:03:03.640> heater<00:03:03.879> box<00:03:04.120> and

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
fits in place at a stock heater box and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.020 
fits in place at a stock heater box and
like<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.230> said<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.620> uses<00:03:05.920> these<00:03:06.099> two<00:03:06.310> outlets<00:03:06.670> as

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
like I said it uses these two outlets as

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.839 
like I said it uses these two outlets as
AC<00:03:07.510> outlets<00:03:08.019> as<00:03:08.230> well<00:03:08.650> as<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.159> outlet<00:03:09.489> next<00:03:09.790> to

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
AC outlets as well as the outlet next to

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.030 
AC outlets as well as the outlet next to
the<00:03:09.940> controls<00:03:10.299> now<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.200> system<00:03:11.590> works<00:03:11.769> really

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
the controls now the system works really

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.069 
the controls now the system works really
well<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.700> what<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.209> outlets<00:03:13.569> at<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.840> height

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
well and what the outlets at that height

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.660 
well and what the outlets at that height
you<00:03:14.319> can<00:03:14.470> actually<00:03:14.620> feel<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:14.950> blowing<00:03:15.370> on<00:03:15.519> you

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
you can actually feel it blowing on you

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.610 
you can actually feel it blowing on you
rather<00:03:15.819> than<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.120> your<00:03:16.150> legs<00:03:16.510> like<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.349> under

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
rather than on your legs like the under

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.449 
rather than on your legs like the under
dash<00:03:17.799> unit<00:03:18.160> did<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.310> we<00:03:21.459> installed<00:03:21.849> a<00:03:22.060> Sony

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
dash unit did so we installed a Sony

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.280 
dash unit did so we installed a Sony
stereo<00:03:24.459> system<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.359> will<00:03:25.599> play<00:03:25.810> an<00:03:25.930> iPod

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
stereo system that will play an iPod

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
stereo system that will play an iPod
inside<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:26.919> a<00:03:26.950> dock<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.639> we<00:03:28.359> used<00:03:28.599> Pyle<00:03:29.310> marine

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
inside on a dock and we used Pyle marine

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.009 
inside on a dock and we used Pyle marine
speakers<00:03:30.609> so<00:03:31.030> they're<00:03:31.150> waterproof<00:03:31.480> up<00:03:31.840> in<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
speakers so they're waterproof up in the

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.619 
speakers so they're waterproof up in the
kick<00:03:32.169> panels<00:03:32.609> just<00:03:33.609> in<00:03:33.760> case<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.180> car<00:03:34.419> does

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
kick panels just in case this car does

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.589 
kick panels just in case this car does
get<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.639> sudden<00:03:36.910> rainstorm<00:03:37.090> or<00:03:37.419> anything

the<00:03:38.560> other<00:03:38.709> conversion<00:03:39.519> we<00:03:39.760> did<00:03:39.970> on<00:03:40.120> the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
the other conversion we did on the

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.949 
the other conversion we did on the
interior<00:03:40.829> was<00:03:41.829> on<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.160> rear<00:03:42.310> seat<00:03:42.810> we<00:03:43.810> took

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
interior was on the rear seat we took

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.770

out<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.290> rear<00:03:44.500> seat<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:44.980> we<00:03:45.220> used<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.780> package

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
out the rear seat and we used a package

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.860 
out the rear seat and we used a package
shelf<00:03:47.049> from<00:03:47.319> an<00:03:47.470> 84<00:03:48.010> style<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:49.209> we<00:03:49.449> have<00:03:49.480> done<00:03:49.840> a
