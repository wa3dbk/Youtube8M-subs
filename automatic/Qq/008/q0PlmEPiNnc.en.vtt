00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.350

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.510
 the blog 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.210
 I never thought I would do 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.009
 that for over four years and I 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.170
 still a lot to say so 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.780
 that's good I still have mostly 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.690
 a lot of things to write a lot 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.490
