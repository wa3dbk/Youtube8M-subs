good feeling the only one that I didn't

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.910 
good feeling the only one that I didn't
play<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.760> Patrick<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.829> decided<00:00:52.829> not

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
play with Patrick because we decided not

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560
