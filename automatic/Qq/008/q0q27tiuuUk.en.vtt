fetchlands<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.750> three<00:00:55.020> racer<00:00:55.320> verge

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
fetchlands and we have three racer verge

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
fetchlands and we have three racer verge
ticket<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.329> four<00:00:58.170> shock

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
ticket so I think we have four shock

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.279 
ticket so I think we have four shock
lands<00:00:58.739> five<00:00:59.309> basic<00:00:59.760> lands<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.870> windswept

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
Township and I think that about covers

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.100 
Township and I think that about covers
that<00:01:07.350> no<00:01:07.530> other<00:01:07.680> non<00:01:08.580> basics<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.810> deck<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that no other non basics the deck is

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.990
