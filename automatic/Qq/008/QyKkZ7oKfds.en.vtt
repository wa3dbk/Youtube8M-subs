00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
to add some linen thread so I'm going to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.500 
to add some linen thread so I'm going to
go<00:02:57.040> ahead<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.370> add<00:02:57.490> a<00:02:57.520> key<00:02:57.850> step<00:02:58.120> around<00:02:58.360> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
go ahead and add a key step around the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
go ahead and add a key step around the
edges<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.880> I'm<00:03:00.970> going<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.270> push<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.200> around

edges so I'm going to push this around

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.120 
edges so I'm going to push this around
the<00:03:02.680> back<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:04.600> it's<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.020> adhesive<00:03:05.590> and

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
the back so it's in the adhesive and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.100 
the back so it's in the adhesive and
then<00:03:06.820> I'm<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.090> going<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.480> wrap<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:08.050> a

then I'm just going to wrap this a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.200 
then I'm just going to wrap this a
couple<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.590> times<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:09.730> gonna<00:03:10.000> go

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
couple of times and this is gonna go

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.510 
couple of times and this is gonna go
right<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.900> back<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.500> do<00:03:11.980> like<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.280> add<00:03:12.490> a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520

little<00:03:12.760> more<00:03:12.910> tape<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:15.220> on<00:03:15.460> top<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.910> make

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
little more tape just on top to make

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.220 
little more tape just on top to make
sure<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.840> doesn't<00:03:17.050> come<00:03:17.320> undone<00:03:19.230> now

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230

layer serves as a nice mat for this

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.930 
layer serves as a nice mat for this
image<00:03:57.550> but<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.300> will<00:03:58.420> also<00:03:58.660> cover<00:03:59.410> up<00:03:59.740> that<00:04:00.550> gap

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
image but it will also cover up that gap

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.690 
image but it will also cover up that gap
in<00:04:01.240> stamping<00:04:01.840> from<00:04:02.620> having<00:04:02.980> those<00:04:03.130> two<00:04:03.400> layers

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
in stamping from having those two layers

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.880 
in stamping from having those two layers
I'm<00:04:04.390> going<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.780> add<00:04:04.900> dimensionals<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.770> the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
I'm going to add dimensionals to the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:15.850 
I'm going to add dimensionals to the
back<00:04:06.070> probably<00:04:06.970> about<00:04:07.120> six<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.840> these

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.160 

so<00:04:16.860> we're<00:04:17.040> going<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.310> double<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.750> linen

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
so we're going to double up this linen

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.930 
so we're going to double up this linen
thread<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:20.300> tie<00:04:21.300> a<00:04:21.330> little<00:04:21.810> bow<00:04:22.820> so<00:04:23.820> you're

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
thread and tie a little bow so you're

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.480 
thread and tie a little bow so you're
going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.090> make<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.570> loop<00:04:26.330> wrap<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:27.540> around

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
going to make a loop wrap this around

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.560 
going to make a loop wrap this around
and<00:04:29.490> then<00:04:29.730> we're<00:04:29.820> going<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.000> push<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.330> back

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
and then we're going to push that back

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.000 
and then we're going to push that back
through<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:34.140> don't<00:04:34.380> worry<00:04:34.590> about<00:04:34.680> what<00:04:34.860> it

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
through and don't worry about what it

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.680 
through and don't worry about what it
looks<00:04:35.100> like<00:04:35.460> when<00:04:35.670> you<00:04:35.760> first<00:04:36.000> tie<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.360> just

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
looks like when you first tie it just

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.320 
looks like when you first tie it just
get<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.930> tight<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.530> then<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:38.430> can<00:04:38.670> make<00:04:39.150> your

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
get it tight and then you can make your

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.120 
get it tight and then you can make your
adjustments<00:04:41.990> now<00:04:42.990> after<00:04:43.320> I<00:04:43.380> tie<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.800> kind<00:04:44.040> of

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
adjustments now after I tie it I kind of

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.930 
adjustments now after I tie it I kind of
tug<00:04:44.460> these<00:04:44.940> little<00:04:45.330> tails<00:04:45.600> down<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.020> little<00:04:46.260> bit

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
tug these little tails down a little bit

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.910 
tug these little tails down a little bit
and<00:04:47.940> I<00:04:48.330> actually<00:04:48.570> want<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.050> little<00:04:49.320> bit

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
and I actually want it a little bit

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.440 
and I actually want it a little bit
smaller<00:04:51.920> and<00:04:52.920> then<00:04:53.310> when<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.430> trim<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:54.180> want

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
smaller and then when I trim it I want

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.750 
smaller and then when I trim it I want
these<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:55.020> be<00:04:55.050> at<00:04:55.320> different<00:04:55.530> links<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.460> I'm

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
these to be at different links so I'm

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.410 
these to be at different links so I'm
going<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:56.940> trim<00:04:57.120> this<00:04:57.300> one<00:04:57.510> slightly<00:04:57.810> longer

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
going to trim this one slightly longer

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.270 
going to trim this one slightly longer
and<00:05:00.420> that<00:05:00.600> one<00:05:00.840> we're<00:05:01.560> going<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.800> use<00:05:01.890> our<00:05:02.160> glue

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
and that one we're going to use our glue

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.940 
and that one we're going to use our glue
dot<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.970> add<00:05:03.450> one<00:05:03.690> right<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.320> center<00:05:04.590> of

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950
