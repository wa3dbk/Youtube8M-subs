00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
so Rex and I decided to make a

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.970 
so Rex and I decided to make a
hovercraft<00:00:01.860> today<00:00:03.290> I've<00:00:04.290> got<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.470> piece<00:00:04.950> of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
hovercraft today I've got a piece of

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.610 
hovercraft today I've got a piece of
four<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.430> plywood<00:00:05.759> cut<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.420> half<00:00:06.470> made<00:00:07.470> it

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
four of a plywood cut it in half made it

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.509 
four of a plywood cut it in half made it
into<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.859> circle<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.719> then<00:00:12.559> here<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> hole

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
into a circle and then here is a hole

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.870 
into a circle and then here is a hole
that<00:00:14.700> matches<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> size<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.599> our<00:00:15.690> leaf<00:00:15.870> blower

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.550 

so<00:00:22.679> once<00:00:23.679> we<00:00:23.830> did<00:00:23.980> that<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:25.269> got<00:00:25.449> some<00:00:25.750> six

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
so once we did that we got some six

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.189 
so once we did that we got some six
milliliter<00:00:27.039> plastic<00:00:27.789> laid<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:28.840> down<00:00:28.869> on<00:00:29.169> top

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
milliliter plastic laid it down on top

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.650 
milliliter plastic laid it down on top
of<00:00:29.410> that<00:00:29.710> with<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.669> little<00:00:30.849> bit<00:00:31.029> of<00:00:31.090> foot<00:00:31.329> over

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
of that with a little bit of foot over

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.650 
of that with a little bit of foot over
draft<00:00:32.619> it<00:00:32.800> over<00:00:33.100> staple<00:00:34.059> gunned<00:00:34.239> it<00:00:34.360> to<00:00:34.420> the

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
draft it over staple gunned it to the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.110 
draft it over staple gunned it to the
surface<00:00:34.870> keep<00:00:35.290> it<00:00:35.379> up<00:00:35.440> fairly<00:00:35.710> tight<00:00:36.040> and<00:00:36.879> cut

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
surface keep it up fairly tight and cut

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.729 
surface keep it up fairly tight and cut
off<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.420> excess<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.900> take<00:00:38.110> it<00:00:38.260> down<00:00:38.409> with<00:00:38.559> duct

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
off the excess to take it down with duct

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:47.280 
off the excess to take it down with duct
tape<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:40.329> on<00:00:40.480> this<00:00:40.600> side<00:00:45.540> I've<00:00:46.540> got<00:00:46.960> a<00:00:46.989> small

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
tape and on this side I've got a small

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.810 
tape and on this side I've got a small
disc<00:00:47.530> here<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.629> center<00:00:49.960> and<00:00:50.110> then<00:00:51.040> cut<00:00:51.489> six

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
disc here in the center and then cut six

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.450 
disc here in the center and then cut six
holes<00:00:52.059> around<00:00:52.300> this<00:00:52.720> disc<00:00:53.079> this<00:00:54.010> sort<00:00:54.220> of<00:00:54.280> keep

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
holes around this disc this sort of keep

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.399 
holes around this disc this sort of keep
this<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.879> little<00:00:55.239> gap<00:00:55.540> right<00:00:55.809> here<00:00:55.869> so<00:00:56.199> that<00:00:56.320> the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
this a little gap right here so that the

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.020 
this a little gap right here so that the
air<00:00:56.559> that<00:00:56.769> comes<00:00:56.949> in<00:00:57.220> through<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.610> hole<00:00:57.760> and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
air that comes in through the hole and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.840 
air that comes in through the hole and
the<00:00:58.420> top<00:00:58.689> fills<00:00:59.470> up<00:00:59.680> this<00:00:59.860> doughnut<00:01:00.369> of<00:01:00.489> space

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
the top fills up this doughnut of space

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.609 
the top fills up this doughnut of space
and<00:01:01.119> then<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.659> air<00:01:01.780> comes<00:01:02.019> out<00:01:02.170> of<00:01:02.350> here<00:01:02.530> and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
and then the air comes out of here and

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.710 
and then the air comes out of here and
then<00:01:02.739> rushes<00:01:03.129> out<00:01:03.280> underneath<00:01:03.640> just<00:01:03.970> played<00:01:04.689> a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
then rushes out underneath just played a

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.340 
then rushes out underneath just played a
doughnut<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.570> ride<00:01:10.780> on<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> cushion<00:01:11.140> of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
doughnut and you ride on a cushion of

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.690 
doughnut and you ride on a cushion of
air<00:01:11.530> then<00:01:11.860> we<00:01:11.950> got<00:01:12.100> some<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.369> this<00:01:12.430> little

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
air then we got some of this little

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.539 
air then we got some of this little
rubber<00:01:13.479> molding<00:01:13.900> here<00:01:14.049> too<00:01:14.310> I'll<00:01:15.310> make<00:01:15.430> it

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
rubber molding here too I'll make it

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.890 
rubber molding here too I'll make it
hurt<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:15.850> much<00:01:15.880> when<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.180> bumps<00:01:16.420> into<00:01:16.600> your

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
hurt so much when it bumps into your

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.810 
hurt so much when it bumps into your
shins<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:19.920> all<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.040> need<00:01:21.189> is<00:01:21.280> power<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.640> then

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
shins and all you need is power and then

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.819 
shins and all you need is power and then

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
you have a hovercraft let's see how it

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.620 
you have a hovercraft let's see how it
works<00:01:24.150> can't<00:01:25.150> we<00:01:25.499> sure

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:02:01.080 

ok

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:20.510 

when

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.580 

Oh
