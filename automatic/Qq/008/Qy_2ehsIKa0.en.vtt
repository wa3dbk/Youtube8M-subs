00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
about different ways of working in the

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.989 
about different ways of working in the
round<00:00:19.240> you<00:00:19.869> can<00:00:20.019> either<00:00:20.199> work<00:00:20.560> in<00:00:21.070> rows<00:00:21.490> in

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:21.999 
round you can either work in rows in

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.540 
round you can either work in rows in
flat<00:00:22.660> fabric<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.349> then<00:00:23.529> join<00:00:23.859> them<00:00:24.099> into<00:00:24.519> a

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
flat fabric and then join them into a

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.120 
flat fabric and then join them into a
round<00:00:24.880> at<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.210> end<00:00:25.359> or<00:00:25.659> you<00:00:26.199> can<00:00:26.409> work<00:00:26.619> in<00:00:26.919> the

round at the end or you can work in the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.339 
round at the end or you can work in the
round<00:00:27.550> as<00:00:27.820> you're<00:00:28.329> knitting<00:00:28.570> and<00:00:28.839> there<00:00:29.259> are

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
round as you're knitting and there are

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.899 
round as you're knitting and there are
different<00:00:29.679> few<00:00:29.980> different<00:00:30.279> types<00:00:30.460> of<00:00:30.669> tools

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:30.909 
different few different types of tools

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.479 
different few different types of tools
you<00:00:31.119> can<00:00:31.300> use<00:00:31.329> to<00:00:31.720> do<00:00:31.900> that<00:00:31.929> for<00:00:32.800> knitting<00:00:33.160> in

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
you can use to do that for knitting in

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.639 
you can use to do that for knitting in
the<00:00:33.520> round<00:00:33.699> like<00:00:34.329> for<00:00:34.600> example<00:00:34.690> on<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.379> lacy

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
the round like for example on the lacy

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.790 
the round like for example on the lacy
knee-high<00:00:36.340> socks<00:00:36.370> or<00:00:37.210> on<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:37.899> Hopalong<00:00:38.469> Bunny

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
knee-high socks or on the Hopalong Bunny

knee-high socks or on the Hopalong Bunny
you<00:00:39.100> all<00:00:39.579> we<00:00:39.940> would<00:00:40.090> use<00:00:40.390> double<00:00:41.140> pointed

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
you all we would use double pointed

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.400 
you all we would use double pointed
needles<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.219> you've<00:00:42.780> put<00:00:43.780> your<00:00:43.899> stitches

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
needles and you've put your stitches

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.650 
needles and you've put your stitches
like<00:00:44.890> if<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:45.280> have<00:00:45.519> let's<00:00:45.760> say<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:45.969> have<00:00:46.179> 16

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
like if you have let's say you have 16

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.080 
like if you have let's say you have 16
stitches<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.710> work<00:00:47.890> in<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.219> round<00:00:48.399> you<00:00:48.940> would

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
stitches to work in the round you would

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.020 
stitches to work in the round you would
evenly<00:00:49.570> place<00:00:49.870> them<00:00:50.230> on<00:00:50.550> several<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.879> your

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
evenly place them on several of your

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.079 
evenly place them on several of your
needles<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.750> then<00:00:53.230> use<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.800> last<00:00:54.129> one<00:00:54.519> for

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
needles and then use the last one for

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.209 
needles and then use the last one for
doing<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.600> actual<00:00:55.989> knitting<00:00:56.469> so<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.070> could

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
doing the actual knitting so you could

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.160 
doing the actual knitting so you could
do<00:00:57.339> it<00:00:57.370> like<00:00:57.489> that<00:00:57.670> or<00:00:58.179> you<00:00:58.510> could<00:00:58.660> work<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:59.140> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
do it like that or you could work in the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.349 
do it like that or you could work in the
round<00:00:59.499> if<00:00:59.679> you<00:00:59.710> have<00:01:00.010> more<00:01:00.370> stitches<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.179> do

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
round if you have more stitches to do

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.740 
round if you have more stitches to do
you<00:01:02.019> would<00:01:02.260> use<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.890> circular<00:01:03.609> needle<00:01:03.999> like<00:01:04.480> for

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
you would use a circular needle like for

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.499 
you would use a circular needle like for
example<00:01:04.839> on<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.890> endless<00:01:06.220> circles<00:01:06.790> vest<00:01:07.119> here

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
example on the endless circles vest here

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.929 
example on the endless circles vest here
what<00:01:07.990> we<00:01:08.140> do<00:01:08.350> is<00:01:08.619> we<00:01:08.799> have<00:01:08.920> a<00:01:08.950> lot<00:01:09.280> of<00:01:09.340> stitches

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
what we do is we have a lot of stitches

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.910 
what we do is we have a lot of stitches
to<00:01:09.970> work<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.570> collar<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.229> that<00:01:11.650> wouldn't

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
to work the collar and that wouldn't

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.499 
to work the collar and that wouldn't
work<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:12.340> double<00:01:12.700> pointed<00:01:13.000> needles<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:13.420> you

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
work on double pointed needles so you

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.899 
work on double pointed needles so you
need<00:01:13.750> sup<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.530> learn<00:01:14.799> Eagles<00:01:15.100> which<00:01:15.250> are<00:01:15.430> on<00:01:15.610> a

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
need sup you learn Eagles which are on a

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.060 
need sup you learn Eagles which are on a
long<00:01:16.420> cable<00:01:17.079> and<00:01:17.229> that's<00:01:17.590> how<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.829> can

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
long cable and that's how you can

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.370 
long cable and that's how you can
accommodate<00:01:18.399> all<00:01:18.820> those<00:01:19.000> stitches<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:20.170> work

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
accommodate all those stitches to work

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.100 
accommodate all those stitches to work
in<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.860> round<00:01:21.070> now<00:01:21.729> another<00:01:22.509> way<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.810> can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
in the round now another way you can

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.160 
in the round now another way you can
work<00:01:23.430> rounded<00:01:24.430> fabrics<00:01:25.000> is<00:01:25.210> something<00:01:25.960> like

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
work rounded fabrics is something like

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.969 
work rounded fabrics is something like
this<00:01:26.520> valentine<00:01:27.520> mug<00:01:27.880> hug<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.140> what<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.799> is

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
this valentine mug hug and what that is

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.840 
this valentine mug hug and what that is
is<00:01:30.219> you<00:01:31.000> work<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.600> rows<00:01:32.140> back<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.310> forth<00:01:33.640> and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
is you work in rows back and forth and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.639 
is you work in rows back and forth and
then<00:01:34.270> when<00:01:34.450> you're<00:01:34.570> done<00:01:34.780> with<00:01:34.960> your<00:01:34.990> fabric

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
then when you're done with your fabric

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.569 
then when you're done with your fabric
you<00:01:36.100> can<00:01:36.340> sew<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.560> seam<00:01:38.560> right<00:01:38.829> here<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.460> then

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
you can sew a seam right here and then

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.789 
you can sew a seam right here and then
make<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.000> button<00:01:40.360> loop<00:01:40.600> for<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.170> button<00:01:41.439> on<00:01:41.649> the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
make the button loop for a button on the

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.830 
make the button loop for a button on the
opposite<00:01:42.219> side<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.759> then<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.240> ends<00:01:43.539> up<00:01:43.600> being

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
opposite side and then it ends up being

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.940 
opposite side and then it ends up being
in<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.110> round<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.439> that's<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.799> way

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
in the round and that's the way

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.859 
in the round and that's the way
sometimes<00:01:45.520> hats<00:01:45.850> are<00:01:46.149> worked<00:01:46.360> -<00:01:46.570> they'll<00:01:46.810> be

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
sometimes hats are worked - they'll be

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.499 
sometimes hats are worked - they'll be
worked<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:47.500> rows<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:48.100> then<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.640> seam<00:01:48.969> at<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
worked in rows and then you seam at the

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.139 
worked in rows and then you seam at the
end<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:49.990> one<00:01:50.560> tip<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:50.890> remember<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.700> when

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
end and one tip to remember is when

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.330 
end and one tip to remember is when
you're<00:01:52.299> choosing<00:01:52.659> a<00:01:52.930> pattern<00:01:53.200> if<00:01:53.590> you<00:01:53.829> want<00:01:54.219> to

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
you're choosing a pattern if you want to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.740 
you're choosing a pattern if you want to
know<00:01:54.460> if<00:01:54.610> it's<00:01:54.759> worked<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.329> row<00:01:55.509> around

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
know if it's worked in the row around

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.260 
know if it's worked in the row around
the<00:01:56.320> easiest<00:01:56.979> way<00:01:57.219> to<00:01:57.250> find<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:57.820> out<00:01:58.060> is<00:01:58.090> to

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
the easiest way to find that out is to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.990 
the easiest way to find that out is to
just<00:01:58.630> look<00:01:58.899> at<00:01:59.109> how<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.320> line-by-line

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
just look at how the line-by-line

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.639 
just look at how the line-by-line
instructions<00:02:01.000> are<00:02:01.180> written<00:02:01.479> if<00:02:01.659> it<00:02:02.049> says<00:02:02.320> row

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
instructions are written if it says row

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.010 
instructions are written if it says row
it's<00:02:03.280> only<00:02:03.579> going<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.000> be<00:02:04.119> worked<00:02:04.359> in<00:02:04.509> rows<00:02:04.780> and

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
it's only going to be worked in rows and

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.959 
it's only going to be worked in rows and
if<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.229> says<00:02:05.469> round<00:02:05.770> it's<00:02:06.399> going<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:06.670> be<00:02:06.789> work

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
if it says round it's going to be work

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.969 
if it says round it's going to be work
circularly<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.170> round<00:02:08.350> those<00:02:08.590> two<00:02:08.800> words

marking<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.690> beginning<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:29.170> your<00:02:29.500> round<00:02:29.740> is

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
marking the beginning of your round is

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.430 
marking the beginning of your round is
extremely<00:02:30.730> important<00:02:31.300> because<00:02:31.720> as<00:02:32.200> you're

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
extremely important because as you're

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.110 
extremely important because as you're
going<00:02:32.470> around<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:33.190> can<00:02:33.370> get<00:02:33.490> caught<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:33.820> in

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
going around you can get caught up in

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.420 
going around you can get caught up in
your<00:02:34.270> stitching<00:02:34.750> or<00:02:34.960> counting<00:02:35.410> or<00:02:35.590> even<00:02:36.220> just

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
your stitching or counting or even just

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.220 
your stitching or counting or even just
daydreaming<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.150> forget<00:02:37.750> where<00:02:38.020> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
daydreaming and forget where the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.230 
daydreaming and forget where the
beginning<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.740> end<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.130> round<00:02:39.370> are<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.000> just

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
beginning and end of a round are so just

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.270 
beginning and end of a round are so just
slipping<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.690> stitch<00:02:40.930> marker<00:02:41.380> as<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.770> begin<00:02:42.100> to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
slipping a stitch marker as you begin to

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.100

join<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> round<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.450> perfect<00:02:43.900> way<00:02:44.080> to

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
join in the round is the perfect way to

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.290 
join in the round is the perfect way to
always<00:02:44.530> remember<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.460> beginning<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.000> end<00:02:46.150> of

always remember the beginning and end of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.540 
always remember the beginning and end of
every<00:02:46.420> round<00:02:47.160> sometimes<00:02:48.160> when<00:02:48.400> you're

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
every round sometimes when you're

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.280 
every round sometimes when you're

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
double pointed needles when that's the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.800 
double pointed needles when that's the
case<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.770> regular<00:02:57.430> stitch<00:02:57.730> marker<00:02:58.180> won't<00:02:58.480> work

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
case a regular stitch marker won't work

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.600 
case a regular stitch marker won't work
because<00:02:59.050> it'll<00:02:59.230> slip<00:02:59.470> off<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.710> needle<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.580> a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
because it'll slip off the needle so a

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.520 
because it'll slip off the needle so a
couple<00:03:00.910> things<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.480> do<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.350> could

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
couple things you can do if you could

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.610 
couple things you can do if you could
find<00:03:02.770> a<00:03:03.270> split<00:03:04.270> ring<00:03:04.480> stitch<00:03:04.810> marker<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.590> can

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
find a split ring stitch marker you can

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.530 
find a split ring stitch marker you can
just<00:03:05.950> insert<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.550> into<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> fabric<00:03:07.390> around

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
just insert that into the fabric around

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.450 
just insert that into the fabric around
the<00:03:07.990> approximate<00:03:08.680> location<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:09.340> the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
the approximate location of the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.980 
the approximate location of the
beginning<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:09.970> end<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.300> round<00:03:10.450> as<00:03:10.930> a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
beginning and end of the round as a

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.200 
beginning and end of the round as a
reminder<00:03:11.650> or<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:12.250> could<00:03:12.400> even<00:03:12.580> use<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.850> safety

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
reminder or you could even use a safety

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.390 
reminder or you could even use a safety
pin<00:03:13.570> or<00:03:13.810> something<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.530> nature<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.220> what

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
pin or something of that nature and what

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.460 
pin or something of that nature and what
you'll<00:03:15.520> want<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.850> do<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:16.390> attach<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.020> into

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
you'll want to do is just attach it into

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.949 
you'll want to do is just attach it into
the<00:03:17.620> fabric<00:03:18.220> just<00:03:18.700> as<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.030> reminder<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:19.750> won't

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
the fabric just as a reminder it won't

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.900 
the fabric just as a reminder it won't
actually<00:03:20.230> be<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.190> needles<00:03:21.550> with<00:03:21.760> the

actually be on the needles with the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.550 
actually be on the needles with the
stitches<00:03:22.360> but<00:03:22.810> it's<00:03:22.990> a<00:03:23.110> great<00:03:23.320> way<00:03:23.530> to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
stitches but it's a great way to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.170 
stitches but it's a great way to
remember<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.400> beginning<00:03:24.520> and<00:03:24.910> end<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.150> the
