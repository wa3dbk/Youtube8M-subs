00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.759
 we evaluated the operation as very 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.140
 positive 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.270
 the stadium today he is obviously very 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.760
 more prepared because we do not have 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.430
 interference as we had to 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.039
 example when we did the two events 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.149
 test before the start of the world cup 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.579
 then the structure in general is 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.690
 as time goes on, people 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.450
 Go understand the methodology let's say 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.500
 of use because thing is in project 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.730
 in the paper 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.399
 another thing is you are effectively however 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.059
 complex use then we have noticed 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.059
 to each event a significant improvement 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.770
 for the moment the price policy 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.360
 keep as I told you, go and ray 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:13.690
 going to hit people does not pretend to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.650
 to find the ideal model, despite 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.570
 ideal model he will never have that 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.280
 sense of injustice because it always goes 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.620
 You will have someone who will find 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.850
 wronged within this model 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.860
 We are working to power. 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.100
 to find the ideal model is the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.770
 40% discount now placing three 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.910
 games including a classic the people 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.040
 understands and is in fair value and then 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.070
 working in this process 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.160
 we ask that the supporter is able 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.890
 understand this moment of adjustment and 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.130
 more necessary now on the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.930
 board will evaluate and define whether 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.800
 have some change but for now 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.800
 keep up 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:10.170
 in the morning today we have around 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.180
 43 thousand tickets available 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.580
 precisely because of what you 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.230
 just mentioned where the press is from 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:23.220
 the table model you have is each table 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.310
 six place supporters means 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.510
 all this is decreasing our ability 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.200
 of service 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.290
 then this number it will still vary 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.340
 while we went and performed the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.610
 changes 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.750
 the time you have in the paging of what is 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.900
 legacy 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.829
 we have 47 thousand and 600 places 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.829
 available 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.390
 not our project is to take the chairs 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.629
 but for this we are doing a 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.430
 study involving the organs 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.540
 who take care of the part of 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.450
 finally getting a number is 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.280
 that would be ideal when we take the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.660
 what would be the capacity of 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.459
 public in that sector 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.730
 but our goal is to take the hair 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.730
 like this
