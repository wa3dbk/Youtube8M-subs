00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.109
 to a new video game with more 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.240
 Children's toys like him already 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.910
 you have noticed the carnival season 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.630
 in front of the door and I thought I show 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 just different 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.970
 Facial painting you carne 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 can contribute 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.410
 and first of all, we start with that 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.660
 pirate i have our may model here 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.119
 doll and I'll do that now on the doll 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.910
 demonstrate here and we start with 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:38.210
 red color on the forehead and that should 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.210
 then learn the headscarf pirate 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.240
 I prefer my finger 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.050
 make the company better 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.050
 elapse 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.070
 then we'll do the sleeping here 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 doll also with red color a point 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.930
 that's the knot 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.310
 show kerchiefs 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.010
 Of course, the loop is missing 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:35.760
 then we cautiously meet here on the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.850
 a quiet red cheek then later 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.410
 a scar 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 and now we start with the contours 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.430
 I'll take a brush again 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.430
 and black color 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.909
 the whole thing then take care of the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.830
 fade out a bit 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.830
 otherwise the lines are too hard 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.070
 Now we want the contours of the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.790
 knotens hereafter and also with one 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.790
 brush and black face times color 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.040
 then afterwards ran around 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.709
 then we surround the left eye of the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.269
 doll with black color 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.780
 I'll try the pennants now 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:40.590
 below and then ran around 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.549
 we still have a free eye with us as well 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.370
 black color 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.370
 but much stronger this time 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.310
 this is our eye patch and 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.110
 at the eye flap allowed naturally 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.420
 Not even the bands are missing and counts 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.370
 he also does not mean the eyelid 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:11.870
 they make up and down then too 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.870
 hint of a band 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.810
 then we come to the opposite as I do 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.520
 find 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.330
 because now as the group still paint 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.330
 a mustache 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.980
 and our names here 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.470
 me personally is the red headscarf of 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.400
 Do not pirate enough 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.319
 the color 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.610
 I think they are balanced 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.040
 That's why I'm trying again 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.040
 The brush that a bit 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.470
 covering to apply 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.330
 however, the skin is the may model 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.240
 Of course, much much smoother than doll 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.800
 The skin of a human being 's color 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.650
 not so well received but me 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.420
 hope 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:14.829
 you have a first impression of it 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.829
 get what the painting looks like 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.780
 and I would say ours is done 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.610
 pirate 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.960
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.570
 leaves with a nice as well 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.220
 comment gives me a thumbs up and 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.910
 Of course, do not forget the channel too 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.760
 subscribe to 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.830
 if you have another face painting 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.200
 carnival wishes drive me 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.700
 just what you would like to see 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.669
 few if I still show you but 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.530
 maybe you still have your own ideas 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.090
 just write in the comments they 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.090
