00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.829
 let's see now 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.230
 the representation of a tel object 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.840
 one of the most viewed 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.560
 is not that we have here one has a solemn in quotation 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.119
 or d revolution as it is known 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.529
 was leandro 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.580
 then usually through the generations are the side surfaces 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.689
 I isolate myself, I would like to present with 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.140
 two of these 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.069
 so we'll have it here 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.069
 your presentation yes 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 in the state 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.800
 nor front 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
 and with the side view 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.520
 I know 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.080
 lateral left 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.500
 voting celtic fish 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.010
 hermes approached the master line sound and point 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 river - a study today the study of the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.340
 serene like 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.690
 I went up symmetry 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.900
 what would be the axis of symmetry 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.040
 the goal the objects 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.540
 on one side is the same as another symmetrical museum 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.150
 so we have 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.370
 the Chilean 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.820
 That 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.270
 first half equals second 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.840
 iaquinta no sengoku and his father and the center 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.450
 the center of the second river 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.690
 so that's why that stretch of 100 meters of rihanna and neither mine nor center 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.700
 as he himself already in the study 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.850
 of people 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.479
 another example would be with the opel is inserted 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.940
 also that it has the saints and the cubic meter representation I understand the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.250
 views 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 so we have 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.020
 is also part of the fascicle 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.919
 and exercise 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.919
 solid is an illusion 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.309
 in Italy 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.309
 your left view 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.169
 the slot represented here that I would have freight 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.169
 left air 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.149
 the first 50 days 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.269
 the center line 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.269
 representing 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:41.989
 sorrowful 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.989
 and here we have representation 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.089
 representation in three lawyers 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.659
 fredson appealed to esperantina 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.659
 Present voltage presentations 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.199

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.969
 right lower left posterior 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.729
 resubmission in two states 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:08.759
 for the voting sector 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:09.839
 freight 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:11.059
 clash 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.349
 instituted front 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.160
 in a presentation 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.980
 I was the only list 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.980
 I could simplify for example the cylinder 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.789
 if you want to appear on a single list 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.789
 as being 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.789
 aline saints 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
 and the difference would now be in the cup 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.969
 wanted to appear a non-symbol 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.279
 viana grito 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.279
 Greek letter 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:50.149
 which would represent hulk diameter 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.449
 so here I would say the dialect of that number would be 40 millimeters 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:59.719
 so I wrote here 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.719
 40 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.629
 he would give the measure 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.089
 in your reading 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:13.619
 35 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.979
 then the representation is a single list 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.609
 the drawing would be 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.400
 understood then I collect minima 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.460
 the presentation of objects 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.969
 in two 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.559
 3 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.409
 a single list will be incinerated 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.210
 Paulo do the exercises 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.330
 the next meeting in mexico will have
