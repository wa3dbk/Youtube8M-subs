there I'm just trying to do some
practice<00:00:54.679> I<00:00:54.799> guess<00:00:54.829> just<00:00:55.249> to<00:00:55.339> flick<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:55.609> and

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
practice I guess just to flick it and

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.250 
practice I guess just to flick it and
try<00:00:55.909> to<00:00:55.940> line<00:00:56.149> up<00:00:56.179> my<00:00:56.299> front<00:00:56.569> foot<00:00:56.690> but<00:00:57.019> then<00:00:57.139> I

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
try to line up my front foot but then I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.169 
try to line up my front foot but then I
actually<00:00:57.409> try<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.799> land<00:00:58.010> on<00:00:58.159> it<00:00:58.339> and<00:00:58.489> then<00:00:59.059> you

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
actually try to land on it and then you

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.729 
actually try to land on it and then you
can<00:00:59.299> really<00:00:59.479> see<00:00:59.719> how<00:00:59.899> it<00:00:59.929> just<00:01:00.350> kind<00:01:00.499> of<00:01:00.589> goes

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
can really see how it just kind of goes

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.889 
can really see how it just kind of goes
either<00:01:01.100> forward<00:01:01.670> or<00:01:01.789> I<00:01:01.819> go<00:01:02.089> back<00:01:02.269> I'm<00:01:02.539> not<00:01:02.690> sure

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899

cool<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:12.590> those<00:01:12.740> previous<00:01:13.189> steps<00:01:13.460> look<00:01:13.700> pretty

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
cool so those previous steps look pretty

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.700 
cool so those previous steps look pretty
good<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.570> your<00:01:15.439> kickflip<00:01:15.950> looks

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
good and your kickflip looks

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.149 
good and your kickflip looks
excruciating<00:01:18.710> ly<00:01:18.890> painfully<00:01:20.020> amazingly

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
excruciating ly painfully amazingly

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.069 
excruciating ly painfully amazingly
incredibly<00:01:22.159> close<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.759> being<00:01:23.000> landed<00:01:23.450> mark

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
incredibly close to being landed mark

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.679 
incredibly close to being landed mark
melodia<00:01:24.700> cool<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:25.909> I<00:01:25.969> was<00:01:26.090> just<00:01:26.270> thinking<00:01:26.570> to

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
melodia cool so I was just thinking to

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.539 
melodia cool so I was just thinking to
myself<00:01:26.719> and<00:01:27.200> wonder<00:01:27.439> if<00:01:27.590> anybody<00:01:28.130> would<00:01:28.250> just

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
myself and wonder if anybody would just

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.899 
myself and wonder if anybody would just
do<00:01:28.700> all<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.270> practice<00:01:29.719> steps<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.320> then<00:01:30.909> show

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
do all the practice steps and then show

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.279 
do all the practice steps and then show
me<00:01:32.060> what<00:01:32.270> their<00:01:32.450> kickflip<00:01:32.929> looked<00:01:33.140> like

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
me what their kickflip looked like

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.840 
me what their kickflip looked like
afterwards<00:01:33.799> and<00:01:34.009> I<00:01:34.070> was<00:01:34.189> thinking<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:34.729> if

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
afterwards and I was thinking but if

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.069 
afterwards and I was thinking but if
they<00:01:34.969> did<00:01:35.149> all<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.390> practice<00:01:35.749> steps<00:01:35.929> they

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
they did all the practice steps they

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.499 
they did all the practice steps they
would<00:01:36.259> probably<00:01:36.619> just<00:01:36.890> do<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.219> kickflip<00:01:37.640> cool

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
would probably just do the kickflip cool

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.050 
would probably just do the kickflip cool
so<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.719> was<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:39.049> good<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.619> saw<00:01:39.890> you

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
so it was really good that I saw you

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.849 
front foot so you get your stepping off
with<00:03:26.690> your<00:03:26.840> front<00:03:27.019> foot<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:27.319> land<00:03:27.560> with<00:03:27.709> your

with your front foot and land with your
back<00:03:28.040> foot<00:03:28.280> still<00:03:29.030> do<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.209> proper<00:03:29.660> flick<00:03:29.900> just

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
back foot still do a proper flick just

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.920 
back foot still do a proper flick just
practice<00:03:30.739> landing<00:03:31.040> with<00:03:31.160> your<00:03:31.190> back<00:03:31.519> foot

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
practice landing with your back foot

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.220 
practice landing with your back foot
this<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:32.989> more<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:34.690> in-between<00:03:35.690> step<00:03:35.959> just

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
this is more of a in-between step just

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.110 
this is more of a in-between step just
to<00:03:36.319> get<00:03:36.470> your<00:03:36.560> commitment<00:03:37.220> down<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.609> be<00:03:37.730> honest

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
to get your commitment down to be honest

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.050 
to get your commitment down to be honest
I<00:03:38.359> think<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.620> was<00:03:39.829> there<00:03:40.280> with<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:40.940> your

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
I think if I was there with you in your

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.180 
I think if I was there with you in your
garage<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:42.139> was<00:03:42.620> just

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
garage and I was just

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.099 
garage and I was just
I<00:03:43.220> actually<00:03:43.609> just<00:03:43.910> forced<00:03:44.359> you<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.569> do<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.930> I

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
I actually just forced you to do it I

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.990 
I actually just forced you to do it I
think<00:03:45.200> you<00:03:45.440> would<00:03:45.590> land<00:03:45.769> a<00:03:45.859> kickflip<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.489> bet<00:03:46.970> I

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
think you would land a kickflip I bet I

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.090 
think you would land a kickflip I bet I
could<00:03:47.090> get<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.450> land<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.870> within<00:03:48.100> ten

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
could get you to land it within ten

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.660 
could get you to land it within ten
minutes<00:03:49.280> no<00:03:50.180> matter<00:03:50.420> how<00:03:50.950> much<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.190> think<00:03:52.549> you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
minutes no matter how much you think you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.199 
minutes no matter how much you think you
can't<00:03:53.060> land<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:54.109> would<00:03:54.920> get<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.370> landed<00:03:55.819> for

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
can't land it I would get you landed for

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.150 
can't land it I would get you landed for
sure<00:03:56.389> I<00:03:56.630> mean<00:03:57.139> you<00:03:57.350> should<00:03:57.530> have<00:03:57.620> seen<00:03:57.680> some<00:03:58.130> of

sure I mean you should have seen some of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.729 
sure I mean you should have seen some of
the<00:03:58.340> tries<00:03:58.609> that<00:03:59.000> Lance<00:03:59.269> did<00:03:59.690> on<00:03:59.900> his<00:04:00.139> kickflip

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
the tries that Lance did on his kickflip

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.800 
the tries that Lance did on his kickflip
you<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.190> might<00:04:01.370> have<00:04:01.489> seen<00:04:01.670> it<00:04:01.849> some<00:04:02.569> of<00:04:02.599> them

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
you you might have seen it some of them

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.210 
you you might have seen it some of them
were<00:04:02.959> in<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.200> video<00:04:03.349> not<00:04:03.680> all<00:04:03.859> of<00:04:04.069> them

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
were in the video not all of them

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.440 
were in the video not all of them
because<00:04:04.489> there<00:04:04.639> definitely<00:04:04.790> were<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.180> lot<00:04:05.420> of

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
because there definitely were a lot of

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.020 
because there definitely were a lot of
tries<00:04:05.810> but<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.650> got<00:04:06.829> lands<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.340> land<00:04:07.579> it<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:07.760> he

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
tries but I got lands to land it and he

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.199 
tries but I got lands to land it and he
was<00:04:08.209> so<00:04:08.720> much<00:04:09.200> further<00:04:09.530> away<00:04:09.799> than<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.579> is

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
was so much further away than you it is

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.509 
was so much further away than you it is
not<00:04:11.599> even<00:04:12.200> funny<00:04:12.470> how<00:04:12.859> much<00:04:12.950> further<00:04:13.220> away<00:04:13.400> he

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
not even funny how much further away he

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.789 
not even funny how much further away he
was<00:04:13.849> but<00:04:14.510> sometimes<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:15.200> takes<00:04:15.230> another

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
fully commit a little bit more you can

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.629 
fully commit a little bit more you can
do<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.530> extra<00:04:39.860> practice<00:04:40.280> step<00:04:40.460> of

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
do that extra practice step of

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.250 
do that extra practice step of
practicing<00:04:41.150> Lin<00:04:41.300> with<00:04:41.570> your<00:04:41.720> back<00:04:41.930> foot<00:04:42.200> and

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
practicing Lin with your back foot and

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.690 
practicing Lin with your back foot and
that's<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:42.680> foot<00:04:42.889> you're<00:04:43.010> going<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.220> catch<00:04:43.490> it

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
that's the foot you're going to catch it

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.330 
that's the foot you're going to catch it
with<00:04:43.820> too<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:44.900> if<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.200> get<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.560> catch<00:04:45.830> down<00:04:46.130> on

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
with too so if you get the catch down on

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.950 
with too so if you get the catch down on
the<00:04:46.430> kickflip<00:04:46.880> then<00:04:47.270> it's<00:04:47.480> going<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.660> be<00:04:47.750> very

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
the kickflip then it's going to be very

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.710 
the kickflip then it's going to be very
very<00:04:48.350> very<00:04:48.620> easy<00:04:49.010> because<00:04:49.910> then<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.210> board<00:04:50.450> is

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
very very easy because then the board is

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.570 
very very easy because then the board is
underneath<00:04:51.260> you<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.680> are<00:04:51.860> catching<00:04:52.220> it

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
underneath you and you are catching it

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.060 
underneath you and you are catching it
like<00:04:53.240> it's<00:04:53.780> almost<00:04:53.930> like<00:04:54.139> you're<00:04:54.470> just

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
like it's almost like you're just

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.800 
like it's almost like you're just
practicing<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.669> flip<00:04:56.060> but<00:04:56.510> you're<00:04:56.630> just

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
practicing the flip but you're just

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.300 
practicing the flip but you're just
practicing<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.500> flip<00:04:57.830> you're<00:04:58.160> not

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
practicing the flip you're not

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.610 
practicing the flip you're not
practicing<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:59.060> catch<00:04:59.300> or<00:04:59.630> any<00:04:59.810> other<00:05:00.169> part

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
practicing the catch or any other part

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.740 
practicing the catch or any other part
that<00:05:00.770> comes<00:05:00.980> after<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.550> flip<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.000> that's<00:05:02.600> why

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
that comes after the flip and that's why

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.390 
that comes after the flip and that's why
it's<00:05:02.990> getting<00:05:03.169> away<00:05:03.560> from<00:05:03.620> your<00:05:03.889> feet<00:05:04.160> and

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400

going away from you as you can see my

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.820 
going away from you as you can see my
kick<00:05:07.580> flips<00:05:07.790> they<00:05:08.000> are<00:05:08.150> very<00:05:08.630> very<00:05:09.080> controlled

kick flips they are very very controlled

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.550 
kick flips they are very very controlled
they<00:05:10.310> are<00:05:10.490> flipping<00:05:10.940> exactly<00:05:11.870> under<00:05:12.139> my<00:05:12.290> feet

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
they are flipping exactly under my feet

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.740 
they are flipping exactly under my feet
the<00:05:12.620> whole<00:05:12.979> time<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.970> board<00:05:14.240> doesn't<00:05:14.540> go<00:05:14.690> to

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
the whole time the board doesn't go to

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.230 
the whole time the board doesn't go to
the<00:05:15.139> side<00:05:15.350> at<00:05:15.590> all<00:05:15.740> and<00:05:16.100> a<00:05:16.669> big<00:05:16.850> part<00:05:17.120> of<00:05:17.180> that

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
the side at all and a big part of that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.909 
the side at all and a big part of that
like<00:05:17.630> I'm<00:05:17.750> not<00:05:17.900> doing<00:05:18.020> anything<00:05:18.470> different

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
like I'm not doing anything different
