them<00:00:51.989> both<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.920> very<00:00:53.399> fast<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
them both it will be very fast that's a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.619 
them both it will be very fast that's a
very<00:00:55.020> big<00:00:55.260> guarantee<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.730> second<00:00:57.180> step<00:00:57.390> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
very big guarantee so the second step is
