00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.730
 all 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.640
 in this episode we have prepared a 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.700
 Tagine a delicious tajine artichokes of 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.500
 cardon and peas and yes these 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.370
 three vegetables work very well 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.030
 together 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.160
 the cards usually have 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.260
 use as a garnish the cardoons 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.540
 with preserved lemon either 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.100
 artichokes combined with peas 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.660
 but it's very rare to see these three 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.640
 vegetables combined together 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.620
 I'm going to make a meat tagine 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.750
 of lamb but we can very well 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.330
 replace lamb meat with 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.190
 veal I'm going to need to die 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.500
 only die I will not put 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.680
 onions for this lemon tajine 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.690
 fresh lemon confit stems from 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.250
 parsley and coriander can be 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.369
 hoisted the tajine so that the elements 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.290
 do not attach a small bouquet of 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.130
 coriander for spices I'm going to have 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.670
 need of turmeric sewn and 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.240
 ginger sunflower oil and oil 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.100
 olive 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.770
 that's all I need 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.619
 to prepare the tagine of lamb 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.750
 cardoons artichokes and peas and we 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.789
 starts with cooking meat 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.009
 so at first I'm going 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.709
 cook the meat in a cooking pot 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.369
 mild fire neuton they be fine 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:43.569
 cooked and bank funds before the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.209
 decant or place it in a 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.310
 tajine and put the garnish like that 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.869
 my trim will stay very nicely 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.869
 in the tajine 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.030
 he 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.970
 he 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.350
 and 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.220
 he 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.220
 are you 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.080
 and 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.380
 and 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.620
 I cooked the meat in a 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.099
 pot with garlic 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.000
 we put ginger with turmeric and 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.690
 salt 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.120
 a little bit of sunflower oil and 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.740
 preserved the olive oil for the end 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.039
 of cooking that is to say that just at 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.139
 moment to remove the tajine from the fire we go 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.990
 add the olive oil and the juice of 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:39.159
 fresh lemon to enhance the side 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.349
 tart of candied lemon of tajine 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.750
 Generally speaking, I recovered the meat 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:46.509
 cooked and I arrange them on a bed of 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.819
 stalks of parsley and coriander I 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:52.090
 prepared vegetables so 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:55.180
 harmonious and pretty on the meat and 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.889
 I spent the sauce on the on the 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.990
 vegetables and from time to time during the 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.419
 cooking vegetables you can take 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.009
 with a spoon the juice and water 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.590
 the vegetables so that they impregnate themselves 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.840
 meat cooking juices I have 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.849
 do not forget to put the lemon confit 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.190
 so for candied lemons in the 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:13.990
 cutting neighborhood removes the ad that 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.240
 is very salty and you do not need 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.130
 and we keep the Corsican which is very 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.279
 scented that will give the taste of lemon 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.440
 confit with tajine so we put everything 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:23.949
 coriander to scent also 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.699
 vegetables 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.919
 we put everything there is the lemon 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.770
 so I just add five minutes 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.789
 before removing the tajine from the fire and 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.219
 olive oil 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.990
 a little trickle so that the scent of 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.629
 olive oil remains present in the 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.879
 in the sauce and perfume a little 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:45.940
 little vegetables so I cover the 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:46.690
 tajine and I'm going to take him leather on a 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.500
 coal fire 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.500
 come with me 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.140
 cook vegetables over a fire 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.780
 coal and then I added a tiny 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.310
 little lemon juice with a fillet 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.470
 of olive oil just before removing 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.420
 the tajine of fire you can hear it 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.760
 he's singing that means 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.470
 that it is delicious I hope you 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.360
 go test it's really very very 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.420
 good as I present them with 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.090
 the ingredients binds his onians just the 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.290
 ginger with turmeric and salt and 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.120
 then the final touch 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.040
 lemon juice and oil fillet 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.690
