bracket outside a little bit the
difference<00:00:57.149> between<00:00:57.770> aluminum<00:00:58.770> version<00:01:00.320> I'm

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
difference between aluminum version I'm

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.450 
difference between aluminum version I'm
look<00:01:01.500> at<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.480> CPU<00:01:03.619> is<00:01:04.619> unboxing<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.309> bit

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
look at this the CPU is unboxing a bit

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:17.429 
look at this the CPU is unboxing a bit
already<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.500> will<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:10.130> here<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.250> is

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.490 

okay<00:01:18.439> this<00:01:18.680> is<00:01:18.890> aluminum<00:01:19.159> version<00:01:20.380> here<00:01:21.380> is

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
okay this is aluminum version here is

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.389 
okay this is aluminum version here is
for<00:01:21.829> the<00:01:22.479> mounting<00:01:23.479> screws<00:01:25.119> for<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.600> 1155

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
for the mounting screws for the 1155

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
1366 1156 975 these are the ones okay

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.399 
1366 1156 975 these are the ones okay
this<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:33.950> obvious<00:01:34.399> or<00:01:34.610> here<00:01:35.119> is<00:01:35.479> for<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.810> 2011

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
this is obvious or here is for the 2011

these are M force use these and use the
part<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:49.360> melt<00:01:50.360> together<00:01:50.479> that's<00:01:50.959> it

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
part of that melt together that's it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.870 
part of that melt together that's it
little<00:01:53.080> how<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.140> put<00:01:54.349> them<00:01:54.439> on<00:01:54.500> together<00:01:54.880> link

description<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.709> then<00:01:57.709> will<00:01:57.860> compound

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
description to that then will compound

description to that then will compound
bracket<00:02:03.819> that<00:02:04.819> is<00:02:05.030> for<00:02:06.189> 155<00:02:07.189> 1156<00:02:08.950> 75<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:14.709> 1366

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
bracket that is for 155 1156 75 and 1366

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.240 
bracket that is for 155 1156 75 and 1366
and<00:02:16.190> 420<00:02:16.819> levin<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:18.200> don't<00:02:18.769> need<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.099> because

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
and 420 levin you don't need it because

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.370 
and 420 levin you don't need it because
you<00:02:25.209> don't<00:02:26.209> need<00:02:26.299> a<00:02:26.359> bracket<00:02:26.569> because<00:02:26.989> it's

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
you don't need a bracket because it's

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:49.030 
you don't need a bracket because it's
already<00:02:27.590> built<00:02:27.799> into<00:02:28.069> it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.830 

angin<00:02:50.040> open<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.520> quite<00:02:50.849> as<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.300> see<00:02:51.599> it<00:02:51.690> from

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
angin open it's quite as you see it from

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.690 
angin open it's quite as you see it from
there<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:53.640> protect<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.120> item<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.280> pretty<00:02:56.550> much

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
there to protect the item so pretty much

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.550 
there to protect the item so pretty much
this<00:02:57.480> is<00:02:59.060> the<00:03:00.060> copper<00:03:00.420> version<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.260> whole

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
this is the copper version so the whole

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.250 
this is the copper version so the whole
things<00:03:01.860> made<00:03:02.160> out<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.459> copper<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.180> heavy<00:03:03.870> as

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
things made out of copper it is heavy as

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.930 
things made out of copper it is heavy as
hell<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.360> versus<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:07.100> having<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
hell for this versus the having the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.870 
hell for this versus the having the
regular<00:03:09.180> one<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.600> plastic<00:03:10.019> one<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.519> non<00:03:11.519> full

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
regular one of plastic one and non full

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.540 
regular one of plastic one and non full
copper<00:03:12.269> indicates<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.830> whole<00:03:14.130> thing<00:03:14.430> is

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
copper indicates the whole thing is

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.520 
copper indicates the whole thing is
copper<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:15.030> other<00:03:15.180> part<00:03:15.540> on<00:03:15.720> top<00:03:15.900> here<00:03:16.860> of

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
copper the other part on top here of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.370 
copper the other part on top here of
Accession<00:03:19.530> nickel<00:03:19.920> plated<00:03:20.750> this<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:21.959> full

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
Accession nickel plated this is full

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.009 
Accession nickel plated this is full
copper<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.519> costs<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.970> lot<00:03:24.360> more<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.989> know<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
copper so it costs a lot more I know and

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.490 
copper so it costs a lot more I know and
you<00:03:28.019> have<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.260> have<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.120> bracket<00:03:30.120> that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
you have to have the bracket that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.770 
you have to have the bracket that
bracket<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.620> excess<00:03:31.950> PC<00:03:32.340> bracket<00:03:32.760> flipped<00:03:33.600> up

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
bracket the excess PC bracket flipped up

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.270 
bracket the excess PC bracket flipped up
saying<00:03:33.989> don't<00:03:34.110> be<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> silver<00:03:34.650> or<00:03:34.980> black

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
saying don't be a silver or black

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.850 
saying don't be a silver or black
version<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.260> back<00:03:37.470> plate

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
version and you have the back plate

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.120 
version and you have the back plate
where<00:03:38.489> hair<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:39.000> actually<00:03:39.510> aluminum<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.980> looks

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
where hair is actually aluminum so looks

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.890 
where hair is actually aluminum so looks
a<00:03:41.220> lot<00:03:41.340> more<00:03:41.580> solid<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:42.120> actually<00:03:42.569> we<00:03:42.630> have<00:03:42.780> it

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
a lot more solid it actually we have it

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.440 
a lot more solid it actually we have it
here<00:03:43.140> we<00:03:43.410> actually<00:03:44.160> have<00:03:44.549> a<00:03:44.580> two<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.090> put<00:03:45.329> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
here we actually have a two and put the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.300 
here we actually have a two and put the
lead<00:03:45.600> description<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.260> about<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.650> got<00:03:47.160> about

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
lead description to about it got about

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.580 
lead description to about it got about
ten<00:03:47.549> of<00:03:47.700> these<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:48.120> pretty<00:03:48.390> nice<00:03:48.540> fair<00:03:49.410> light
