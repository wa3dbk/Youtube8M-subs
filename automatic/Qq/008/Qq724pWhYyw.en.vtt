color adding the eye shadow gradually in

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.359 
color adding the eye shadow gradually in
small<00:01:52.000> amounts<00:01:52.540> it<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:52.990> far<00:01:53.500> more<00:01:53.650> sensible<00:01:54.040> to

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
small amounts it is far more sensible to

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.490 
small amounts it is far more sensible to
add<00:01:54.550> eye<00:01:54.760> shadow<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.270> small<00:01:55.720> amounts<00:01:56.140> than<00:01:56.320> to

add eye shadow in small amounts than to

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.710 
add eye shadow in small amounts than to
add<00:01:56.619> too<00:01:56.860> much<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.340> then<00:01:57.580> try<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:57.940> undo<00:01:58.540> what

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
add too much and then try to undo what

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.870 
add too much and then try to undo what
you've<00:01:58.869> done<00:01:59.080> almost<00:01:59.860> impossible<00:02:00.640> without

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
you've done almost impossible without

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.220 
you've done almost impossible without
making<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.270> huge<00:02:01.600> mess<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.259> add<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.560> bit<00:02:02.710> by<00:02:02.740> bit

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.320 

now<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.500> take<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.739> larger<00:02:12.190> blending<00:02:12.610> brush<00:02:12.820> this

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
now I take a larger blending brush this
