anywhere<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.540> basically<00:01:25.350> cut<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.860> down<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
anywhere I basically cut it down up to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.670 
anywhere I basically cut it down up to
the<00:01:26.700> point<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> point<00:01:27.960> still<00:01:28.259> inside

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the point I have the point still inside

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.530 
the point I have the point still inside
just<00:01:29.250> somewhere<00:01:29.579> nail<00:01:29.759> polish<00:01:30.090> doesn't<00:01:30.450> go

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
just somewhere nail polish doesn't go

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
just somewhere nail polish doesn't go
inside<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.259> stays<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> top<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
inside it stays on the top of the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.600 
inside it stays on the top of the
surface<00:01:32.600> I'm<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> dip<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:35.930> and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
surface I'm going to dip it down and

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.679 
surface I'm going to dip it down and
then<00:01:38.610> create<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.540> dots<00:01:40.670> this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.729> actually

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
then create little dots this is actually

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.130 
then create little dots this is actually
very<00:01:43.140> simple<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:45.180> harder<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.720> do

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
very simple to do and the harder you do

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.340 
very simple to do and the harder you do
this<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.280> bigger<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.759> darts<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.899> bigger<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
this the bigger the darts the bigger the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.050 
this the bigger the darts the bigger the
dots<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.890> become<00:01:50.659> if<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.200> gently<00:01:53.060> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
dots can become if you do it gently you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.100 
dots can become if you do it gently you
can<00:01:54.299> create<00:01:54.630> smaller<00:01:55.200> dots<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.810> can

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
can create smaller dots so you can

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.380 
can create smaller dots so you can
actually<00:01:58.530> control<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.030> great<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
actually control this it's so great and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.889 
actually control this it's so great and
then<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.049> wipe<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.350> off<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
then you just wipe it off that's it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.080 
then you just wipe it off that's it

basically I'm going to puncture a hole
again<00:03:32.290> in<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.530> center<00:03:32.980> push<00:03:33.700> my<00:03:33.940> safety<00:03:34.450> pin

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
again in the center push my safety pin

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.460 
again in the center push my safety pin
as<00:03:34.840> far<00:03:35.350> as<00:03:36.160> it'll<00:03:36.370> let<00:03:36.670> me<00:03:36.850> go<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.720> stopped<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
as far as it'll let me go it stopped the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.290 
as far as it'll let me go it stopped the
minute<00:03:38.740> it<00:03:38.890> stopped<00:03:39.190> you're<00:03:39.610> fine

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
minute it stopped you're fine

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.750 
minute it stopped you're fine
this<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.810> going<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.200> create<00:03:41.350> a<00:03:41.560> smaller<00:03:42.280> dot

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
this is going to create a smaller dot

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.240 
this is going to create a smaller dot
for<00:03:43.120> you

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:04:11.030 

simple

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.210 

the<00:04:11.939> reason<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.659> noticed<00:04:13.080> my<00:04:13.650> polish<00:04:14.069> is

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
the reason you noticed my polish is

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.129 
the reason you noticed my polish is
turning<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.730> little<00:04:14.879> purple<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.569> because<00:04:15.959> the

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
turning a little purple is because the

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.680 
turning a little purple is because the
polish<00:04:16.470> underneath<00:04:16.829> wasn't<00:04:17.760> completely<00:04:18.389> dry

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
polish underneath wasn't completely dry

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.259 
polish underneath wasn't completely dry
but<00:04:19.290> imagine<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.579> created<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.060> cool

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
but imagine that it created a cool

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.640 
but imagine that it created a cool
effect<00:04:21.449> I<00:04:21.900> kinda<00:04:22.199> like<00:04:22.380> it

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
effect I kinda like it

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.250 
effect I kinda like it
a<00:04:22.889> mile<00:04:23.280> cubed<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:24.090> all<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.810> safety

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
a mile cubed and all it is is a safety

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.840 
a mile cubed and all it is is a safety
pin<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.860> all<00:04:26.070> have<00:04:26.460> them<00:04:27.979> so<00:04:28.979> look<00:04:29.250> how<00:04:29.460> cute

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
pin we all have them so look how cute

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.480 
pin we all have them so look how cute
and<00:04:30.120> simple<00:04:30.419> that<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.960> basically<00:04:31.949> what<00:04:32.220> things

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490
