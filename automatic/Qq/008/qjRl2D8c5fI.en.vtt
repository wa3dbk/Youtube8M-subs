Live<00:00:25.740> controller<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.820> course<00:00:26.970> it'll<00:00:27.119> work

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
Live controller but of course it'll work

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.290 
Live controller but of course it'll work
with<00:00:27.359> any<00:00:27.510> kind<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.840> music<00:00:28.109> software<00:00:28.619> now

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
with any kind of music software now

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
with any kind of music software now
that's<00:00:30.300> great<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.800> great<00:00:32.009> for

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that's great and it's great for

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.069 
that's great and it's great for
controlling<00:00:32.279> music<00:00:32.880> software<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.660> I'm<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.840> big

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
controlling music software but I'm a big

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.709 
controlling music software but I'm a big
fan<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.530> working<00:00:34.829> exclusively<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:36.120> hardware

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
fan of working exclusively with hardware

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.200 
fan of working exclusively with hardware
really<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.370> saw<00:00:38.610> brought<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.180> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
really and so I saw brought a lot of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.790 
really and so I saw brought a lot of
power<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.469> being<00:00:40.620> able<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
power in this thing for being able to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
power in this thing for being able to
control<00:00:41.100> external<00:00:41.610> devices<00:00:41.879> such<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.480> for

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
control external devices such as for

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.830 
control external devices such as for
example<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.620> trusty<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.670> beloved<00:00:45.120> electronic

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
example my trusty and beloved electronic

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.650 
example my trusty and beloved electronic
to<00:00:45.989> track<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.190> appear

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
to track that I have just so appear

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.360 
to track that I have just so appear
problem<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.410> course<00:00:49.680> we've<00:00:49.800> got<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.950> USB

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
problem is of course we've got a USB

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.630 
problem is of course we've got a USB
connection<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:52.320> octatrack<00:00:52.739> does<00:00:53.430> not

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
connection and the octatrack does not

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.240 
connection and the octatrack does not
take<00:00:53.910> MIDI<00:00:54.180> over<00:00:54.570> USB<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> actually<00:00:55.980> needs

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
take MIDI over USB so it actually needs

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.299 
take MIDI over USB so it actually needs
to<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:57.059> some<00:00:57.300> sort<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> MIDI<00:00:57.750> connection

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
to have some sort of MIDI connection

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
to have some sort of MIDI connection
well<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.430> did<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:00:59.850> project<00:01:00.000> video<00:01:00.420> loops

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
well I did a little project video loops

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
well I did a little project video loops
last<00:01:01.020> year<00:01:01.289> some<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.649> may<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:01.949> seen<00:01:02.070> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
last year some of you may have seen it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
last year some of you may have seen it
it's<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:03.420> called<00:01:03.660> Project<00:01:04.019> calc<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
it's was called Project calc and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
it's was called Project calc and
essentially<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:05.850> bit<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.119> an

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
essentially it was a little bit of an

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210 
essentially it was a little bit of an
all<00:01:06.360> hardware<00:01:06.840> setup<00:01:07.110> using<00:01:07.530> some<00:01:07.680> innovation

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
all hardware setup using some innovation

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
all hardware setup using some innovation
products<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.510> using<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> launch

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
products and I was using the launch

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.230 
products and I was using the launch
control<00:01:10.229> excel<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.100> control<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> octatrack

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
control excel to control the octatrack

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.410 
control excel to control the octatrack
but<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> more<00:01:13.260> astute<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.430> viewers<00:01:15.210> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
but the more astute of the viewers of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.149 
but the more astute of the viewers of
that<00:01:15.570> particular<00:01:15.900> video<00:01:16.020> spotted<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.799> had<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that particular video spotted I had to

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.480 
that particular video spotted I had to
use<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.659> computer<00:01:18.920> basically<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> MIDI

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
use a computer basically to get the MIDI

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.550 
use a computer basically to get the MIDI
signal<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.840> logical<00:01:22.140> Tron<00:01:22.290> excel

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
signal out of the logical Tron excel

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.880 
signal out of the logical Tron excel
into<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> octatrack<00:01:23.790> well<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.439> reason<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> had

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
into the octatrack well the reason I had

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
into the octatrack well the reason I had
to<00:01:25.920> do<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.330> firmware

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
to do that is at the time the firmware

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.359 
to do that is at the time the firmware
that<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:27.990> had<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> launch<00:01:28.619> control<00:01:28.710> Excel

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that we had in the launch control Excel

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
that we had in the launch control Excel
wouldn't<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.240> let<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> work<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.110> this

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
wouldn't really let it work with this

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
wouldn't really let it work with this
type<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.950> box<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.450> quite<00:01:33.600> an

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
type of box now this is quite an

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.020 
type of box now this is quite an
interesting<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.829> Kenton<00:01:35.610> MIDI

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
interesting thing this is a Kenton MIDI

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.520 
interesting thing this is a Kenton MIDI
USB<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.840> mini-usb<00:01:37.470> host<00:01:38.280> device<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.290> lets

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
USB to mini-usb host device and it lets

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.910 
USB to mini-usb host device and it lets
me<00:01:40.650> plug<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.100> any<00:01:41.460> USB<00:01:42.329> device<00:01:42.509> into<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
me plug in any USB device into here and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.139 
me plug in any USB device into here and
it<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.189> convert<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.579> into<00:01:44.909> an<00:01:45.000> actual

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
it will convert that into an actual

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.289 
it will convert that into an actual
standard<00:01:45.689> MIDI<00:01:45.899> output<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.520> there<00:01:48.060> are<00:01:48.180> many

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
standard MIDI output so there are many

through<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.250> MIDI<00:03:35.459> USB<00:03:35.940> host<00:03:36.150> into<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
through the MIDI USB host into the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.259 
through the MIDI USB host into the
octatrack<00:03:37.319> so<00:03:38.069> let's<00:03:38.280> explore<00:03:38.730> how<00:03:38.790> we've<00:03:39.120> got

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
octatrack so let's explore how we've got

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.940 
octatrack so let's explore how we've got
it<00:03:39.360> set<00:03:39.599> up<00:03:39.629> it's<00:03:40.409> actually<00:03:40.739> pretty

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
it set up it's actually pretty

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.839 
it set up it's actually pretty
straightforward

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
straightforward

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.390 
straightforward
and<00:03:42.030> we<00:03:42.900> have<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.110> user<00:03:43.500> templates<00:03:44.069> on<00:03:44.220> launch

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
and we have a user templates on launch

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.430 
and we have a user templates on launch
control<00:03:44.790> excel<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.629> way<00:03:45.750> I've<00:03:45.900> decided<00:03:46.290> to

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
control excel so the way I've decided to

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.250 
control excel so the way I've decided to
do<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:47.129> set<00:03:47.849> track<00:03:48.209> 1<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.840> be<00:03:48.959> on<00:03:49.049> user

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
do is to set track 1 to be on user

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.100 
do is to set track 1 to be on user
template<00:03:49.739> 1<00:03:49.980> track<00:03:50.730> 2<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.480> user<00:03:51.690> template

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
template 1 track 2 to the user template

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.550 
template 1 track 2 to the user template
to<00:03:52.349> track<00:03:53.069> 3<00:03:53.400> user<00:03:53.730> template<00:03:54.209> 3<00:03:54.480> track<00:03:54.900> 4<00:03:55.200> user

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
to track 3 user template 3 track 4 user

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.960 
to track 3 user template 3 track 4 user
template<00:03:55.980> 4<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:56.730> on

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
template 4 and so on

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.110 
template 4 and so on
um<00:03:57.709> so<00:03:58.709> for<00:03:58.890> example<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.340> want<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.580> control

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
um so for example if I want to control

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.020 
um so for example if I want to control
track<00:04:00.629> 1<00:04:00.900> basically<00:04:01.379> our<00:04:01.590> whole<00:04:01.620> user<00:04:02.069> 1<00:04:02.370> press

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
track 1 basically our whole user 1 press

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.570 
track 1 basically our whole user 1 press
track<00:04:03.659> 1<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.379> now<00:04:04.980> I'm<00:04:05.280> going<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.519> be

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
track 1 and now I'm going to be

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.780 
track 1 and now I'm going to be
controlling<00:04:06.030> trap<00:04:06.360> 1<00:04:06.540> always<00:04:07.200> my<00:04:07.950> faders<00:04:08.580> will

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
controlling trap 1 always my faders will

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.059 
controlling trap 1 always my faders will
control<00:04:09.269> all<00:04:09.450> eight<00:04:09.959> tracks<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.560> regardless

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
control all eight tracks so regardless

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.250 
control all eight tracks so regardless
of<00:04:11.220> which<00:04:11.340> page<00:04:11.640> I'm<00:04:11.849> in<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.150> bottom<00:04:12.659> half<00:04:12.930> of

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
of which page I'm in this bottom half of

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.080 
of which page I'm in this bottom half of
the<00:04:13.680> launch<00:04:13.799> control<00:04:14.010> itself<00:04:14.549> stays<00:04:14.849> exactly

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
the launch control itself stays exactly

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.090 
the launch control itself stays exactly
the<00:04:15.420> same<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:16.199> means<00:04:16.440> I've<00:04:16.530> always<00:04:16.949> got

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
the same this means I've always got

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.509 
the same this means I've always got
access<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.459> my<00:04:17.750> faders<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:20.070> can<00:04:20.250> always

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
access to my faders and I can always

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.000 
access to my faders and I can always
bring

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
bring

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.220 
bring
all<00:04:22.730> of<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.120> tracks<00:04:23.390> regardless<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.080> which

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
all of the tracks regardless of which

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.480 
all of the tracks regardless of which
page<00:04:24.500> em<00:04:24.740> all

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.240 

so<00:04:28.490> yeah<00:04:29.120> it's<00:04:29.240> got<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.450> trap<00:04:29.660> wall<00:04:29.950> again<00:04:30.950> mine

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
so yeah it's got to trap wall again mine

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.710 
so yeah it's got to trap wall again mine
three<00:04:31.520> four<00:04:31.730> knobs<00:04:31.880> here<00:04:32.120> now<00:04:32.270> these<00:04:32.450> will

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
three four knobs here now these will

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.630 
three four knobs here now these will
focus<00:04:32.990> on<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.350> track<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.860> select<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:34.520> in

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
focus on the track that I select so in

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.300 
focus on the track that I select so in
this<00:04:34.730> instance<00:04:34.940> I'm<00:04:35.690> on<00:04:35.900> track<00:04:36.140> 1<00:04:36.350> and<00:04:36.770> here<00:04:37.220> we

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
this instance I'm on track 1 and here we

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.830 
this instance I'm on track 1 and here we
can<00:04:37.460> see<00:04:37.670> and<00:04:37.880> select<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.390> so<00:04:38.510> we<00:04:38.600> can<00:04:38.690> see

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
can see and select it so we can see

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.290 
can see and select it so we can see
what's<00:04:39.020> going<00:04:39.080> on<00:04:39.380> but<00:04:39.890> now<00:04:40.160> I<00:04:40.430> can<00:04:40.820> control<00:04:41.090> my

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
what's going on but now I can control my

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.230 
what's going on but now I can control my
pitch<00:04:41.510> for<00:04:41.690> example<00:04:42.320> here<00:04:42.590> control<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.790> rates

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
pitch for example here control the rates

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:53.110 
pitch for example here control the rates
as<00:04:44.450> well<00:04:46.810> read<00:04:47.810> triggers<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:52.460> start<00:04:52.820> length

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
as well read triggers and start length

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:08.290 
as well read triggers and start length
as<00:04:53.450> well<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:07.100> we've<00:05:07.220> got<00:05:07.340> access<00:05:07.760> to<00:05:07.970> all<00:05:08.120> of

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
as well so we've got access to all of

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.480 
as well so we've got access to all of
the<00:05:08.540> parameters<00:05:09.020> on<00:05:09.230> the<00:05:09.530> paper<00:05:09.740> page<00:05:10.010> but<00:05:10.340> at

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
the parameters on the paper page but at

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.390 
the parameters on the paper page but at
the<00:05:10.610> same<00:05:10.820> time<00:05:11.090> I<00:05:11.330> can<00:05:11.480> control<00:05:11.900> things<00:05:12.400> which

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
the same time I can control things which

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.020 
the same time I can control things which
are<00:05:13.490> going<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.640> be<00:05:13.730> here<00:05:15.280> this<00:05:16.280> is<00:05:16.340> no<00:05:16.700> effects

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
are going to be here this is no effects

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.780 
are going to be here this is no effects
page<00:05:17.240> -<00:05:17.570> so<00:05:17.750> 1/3<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.200> if<00:05:18.320> a<00:05:18.440> page<00:05:18.740> 1<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.550> yellow

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
page - so 1/3 so if a page 1 the yellow

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.370 
page - so 1/3 so if a page 1 the yellow
so<00:05:20.060> if<00:05:20.120> we<00:05:20.240> look<00:05:20.420> and<00:05:20.720> we<00:05:20.780> thought<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.140> effects

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
so if we look and we thought it effects

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.360 
so if we look and we thought it effects
page<00:05:21.560> 1<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:21.920> see<00:05:22.190> now<00:05:22.340> all<00:05:23.830> that<00:05:24.830> means<00:05:25.100> is<00:05:25.310> I

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
page 1 you see now all that means is I

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.860 
page 1 you see now all that means is I
actually<00:05:25.550> have<00:05:25.880> access<00:05:26.000> to<00:05:26.240> all<00:05:26.600> my

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
actually have access to all my

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.910 
actually have access to all my
parameters<00:05:27.940> all<00:05:28.940> times<00:05:29.420> on<00:05:29.900> all<00:05:30.290> tracks<00:05:30.620> so

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
parameters all times on all tracks so

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.390 
parameters all times on all tracks so
it's<00:05:31.040> a<00:05:31.070> really<00:05:31.370> nice<00:05:31.610> way<00:05:31.820> of<00:05:31.850> working<00:05:33.400> the

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
it's a really nice way of working the

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.580 
it's a really nice way of working the
buttons<00:05:34.730> at<00:05:34.850> the<00:05:34.880> bottom<00:05:35.360> here<00:05:35.600> also<00:05:35.870> has<00:05:36.410> loop

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
buttons at the bottom here also has loop

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.400 
buttons at the bottom here also has loop
switches<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:38.060> stop<00:05:38.510> that<00:05:38.720> sorry<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.050> top<00:05:39.260> of

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
switches and stop that sorry the top of

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.060 
switches and stop that sorry the top of
my<00:05:39.830> audio<00:05:40.160> tracks

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.100 

the<00:05:46.070> bottom<00:05:46.460> row<00:05:46.640> which<00:05:47.150> if<00:05:47.510> I<00:05:47.600> switch<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.810> MIDI

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
the bottom row which if I switch to MIDI

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.100 
the bottom row which if I switch to MIDI
here<00:05:48.290> you'll<00:05:48.440> see<00:05:48.650> are<00:05:48.890> for<00:05:49.100> my<00:05:49.220> MIDI<00:05:49.430> tracks

functions on the bottom half here but

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.950 
functions on the bottom half here but
the<00:06:48.260> knobs<00:06:48.500> now<00:06:48.740> represent<00:06:49.720> controls<00:06:50.720> that<00:06:50.840> I

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
the knobs now represent controls that I

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.220 
the knobs now represent controls that I
wanted<00:06:51.410> on<00:06:52.280> the<00:06:52.490> effects<00:06:52.910> so<00:06:53.270> for<00:06:53.510> example<00:06:54.050> I

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.230 
wanted on the effects so for example I

00:06:54.230 --> 00:07:19.689 
wanted on the effects so for example I
have<00:06:54.530> a<00:06:54.560> delay<00:06:54.950> right<00:06:55.940> there

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:19.699 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.219 

so<00:07:20.699> there<00:07:20.820> we<00:07:20.940> go<00:07:20.970> so<00:07:21.330> that's<00:07:21.690> the<00:07:21.870> launch

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229 
so there we go so that's the launch

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.969 
so there we go so that's the launch
control<00:07:22.410> excel<00:07:24.350> with<00:07:25.350> the<00:07:25.530> octatrack
