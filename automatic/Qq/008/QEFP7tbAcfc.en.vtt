00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Good day comrades I perfect 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.340
 noob and this is the second episode no less 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.130
 unique project and history of the series 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.719
 heroes of might and magick for 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.450
 adequate understanding is necessary 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.550
 watch the first episode though no no 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.380
 sure there I tell mostly 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
 about things that everyone knows at least once 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.789
 who saw the heroes what you see the window 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.980
 virtual operating system and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.820
 panel below let's assume that 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.920
 it's not a joint 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.050
 and the chip is okay so in the yard 1997 bowl 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.180
 pumpkin for two years not world 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.760
 computing up to a number of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.190
 New chips that they proudly dubbed 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 second part at first glance second 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.050
 heroes are like the first from afar 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.789
 even confuse the same interface 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.190
 only in a different color and with two buttons 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.270
 handed down to the rest of the same 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.850
 heroic hari but no everything is much deeper 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.399
 the first thing I would like to mention is the fights 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.949
 replaced by a huge model of com units 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.199
 came the minimalist style though the field itself 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.729
 The battlefield has grown fat and began to contain where 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.030
 more hexagonal cells 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.890
 more maneuvers for god maneuvers yes and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.170
 Tactics, it seems, as it became more 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.509
 during the siege of cities on the side of the defenders 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 can stand up to three defensive 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.680
 towers depending on how much you 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
 build them and a for a fee 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 you can dig a moat that will solve 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 attacking free to march along 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.009
 walls and the wall itself is not 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.110
 impenetrable there is a gate through which 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 release defenders if he is so for 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.610
 I want to take a walk in the fresh air for not 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.890
 less separate fee can be put in 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.860
 city officers who will replace the hero if 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.500
 such a city suddenly will not be a 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.229
 the hero grew bolder from the tent 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.270
 climbed a horse but his participation in battle 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.030
 still limited to custom 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.009
 spell 1 input or decision 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.369
 about the fact that we should quietly dump 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.280
 cycle karoch generally associated with the characters 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.920
 a whole bunch of changes they still 4 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.890
 characteristics of the shackles protection of the power of magic 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.870
 knowledge 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.000
 only knowledge now works 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.100
 differently charge on spells 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.790
 turned into more human mana 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.350
 one unit of knowledge 10 mana each 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.480
 spells its cost 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.819
 and it is restored one by one 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.800
 entrance though stay in the guild of mages or 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.350
 a special well on the Regina map, then I 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.360
 faster in addition to this each 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.520
 the hero has become at taking the level is not easy 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.790
 raise one of the characteristics but also 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.890
 receive special skills randomly offers 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.709
 we are two of which already need to choose 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.880
 You can add these properties manually. 8 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.040
 pieces in each hero 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.110
 and given the fact that they swing by three 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.400
 times a hero can harmlessly develop 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.560
 up to level 24 and maybe further I just 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.200
 never saw a tree 24 rubles 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.480
 running around the map has become even more interesting for 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.910
 account of a sharp increase in the number of seats 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.470
 which can be visited 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.540
 there were places like mill which 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.850
 it would be nice to look once a week 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.800
 hut on chicken legs where Baba Yaga 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.350
 teach some kind of skill ahead of time without 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.660
 elevation level locks have grown a bit 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.420
 the number of buildings has greatly increased 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.420
 there were such wonderful things as statues 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.400
 finally increasing the income of the city 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.829
 you can build a market and exchange resources 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.350
 at inadequate predatory prices 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.209
 But after the first part, even such 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.900
 the exchange rate makes the player a bit 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.209
 happier 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.640
 there is still a unique building for each 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.829
 races such as sorcerers unique 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.440
 adjustment even more raises the income and 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.410
 wizards increase luck 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.019
 city ​​defenders tree technology a 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.579
 now consist not of one branch and also 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.500
 individually for each race 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.870
 the final construction of magicians can 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.290
 build a passing through a bunch of buildings and in 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.900
 Necromancers at once would be money a 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.340
 before 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:56.190
 magic and necromancers 2 new faction magic 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.950
 these are such funny guys who love 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.959
 learn a lot of spells they breed 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.150
 pigs and chickens in their free time 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.370
 terminators from ordinary and liquid 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.980
 metal still percy jackson of on 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.690
 with steroids and with lightning zeus they can 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.209
 close the circuit poking lightning in 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.280
 opponents here so necromancers like 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.519
 it is not difficult to guess undead rule 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.680
 i like the undead she looks like me in 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.510
 youth she also do not care a shit 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.620
 dead girls by sex 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.620
 most of the living will 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.570
 zhivchiki shy look not live in 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.180
 eyes why the army falls moral 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.130
 however in an undead morality is not exactly 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.630
 do n't give a shit 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.240
 hero necromancers know how to kill 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.340
 enemies replenish skeletons in 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.250
 bringing these guys at the end of the game 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.530
 vanshotyat everything that moves and what does not 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.750
 moves they move and voshotyat then 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.660
 heroes make still skeletons dead 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.550
 and this cycle is unstoppable undead 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.740
 remembered by dudes wrapped in 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.050
 toilet paper and my licha 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.330
 boots give the privilege to beat on the area 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.000
 old times and include the same line 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.130
 units as before here only now 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.600
 some units can be transferred to 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.100
 new stage of evolution of some 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.580
 some troops are dead end 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.680
 branch 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.590
 and flatly refuses to become 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.050
 multicellular so it is impossible to bring to 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.690
 perfection of the initial units and more 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.810
 depends on race someone gets threatened 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.290
 someone no bone dragon is good by himself 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.200
 to myself 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.300
 but titanium can develop the price is true 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.680
 bite you both eggs and it is worth it 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.650
 decide whether or not 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.300
 but in the conclusion about the company means so 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.970
 on the events of the first part in the fight for 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.830
 the power was defeated by the knight then he tuned 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.280
 2 Ivanov and dropped the skates 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.230
 1 Ivan Tsarevich in the role of Archibald apparently 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.630
 in the world of heroes the game of thrones began 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.730
 show 800 years earlier therefore 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.710
 Ivan Tsarevich began to weave intrigues and 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.050
 methodically kill oracles which 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.960
 should have called the heir 2 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.030
 ivan the fool the role of roland is a fool because 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.340
 point blank does not notice the dead one 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.470
 other oracles as a result of archibald 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.900
 He becomes king of barks and taken into 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.640
 Siberia after this roland suspected 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.320
 wrong and gathering a group of fast 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.170
 response goes to beat the face 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.600
 hatch a plot provided by the two companies and 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.210
 let's not say so do not shine the maximum is 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.250
 carry out one enemy now another 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.320
 now take out the king of the gnomes or not 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.570
 makes happy that periodically 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.510
 choice is given choice 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.700
 carries consequences for example 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.590
 if not to endure the aforementioned king 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.470
 gnomes then he will get in the way late 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.830
 missions plus there is still a joke appears 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.980
 task called betrayal 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.130
 perform 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.860
 both of them on me in another company this 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.110
 called with a soul come up artificial 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.300
 intelligence is still no ice again 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.390
 unmistakably recognizable such you are bis and 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.830
 traits like hate afar nickname and 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.440
 computer hero who crawl away 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.900
 like cockroaches sometimes slippers are missing 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.330
 bringing all but no less than 2 heroes 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.630
 far away from the first ones already possible 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.610
 play and even have fun 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.760
 more tactics more features 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.540
 more than 1 and heroes no balance 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.590
 with so drastically different factions and 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:22.010
 This is good and with you was perfect noob and to 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.010
 meeting
