your fingers or with a soft fan brush
and<00:01:28.970> in<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.060> case<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.479> blending<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and in this case I'm just blending it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.810 
and in this case I'm just blending it
horizontally<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.340> upwards

here's<00:02:28.140> another<00:02:28.230> technique<00:02:28.830> onto<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.730> paper

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
here's another technique onto that paper

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.720 
here's another technique onto that paper
I've<00:02:30.390> sprayed<00:02:30.930> some<00:02:31.200> some<00:02:32.190> more<00:02:32.370> colors<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
I've sprayed some some more colors and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.580 
I've sprayed some some more colors and
instead<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.300> sliding<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.019> can<00:02:34.319> apply<00:02:34.500> it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
instead of sliding it I can apply it

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.670 
instead of sliding it I can apply it
just<00:02:34.860> by<00:02:35.130> touching<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.450> paper<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.959> I

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
just by touching it to the paper and I

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.009 
just by touching it to the paper and I
can<00:02:37.860> blend<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.750> that<00:02:39.750> gives<00:02:39.930> you

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
can blend that in and that gives you

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.090 
can blend that in and that gives you
very<00:02:40.260> different<00:02:40.709> kinds<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.160> very<00:02:41.940> striking

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
very different kinds of very striking

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.880 
very different kinds of very striking
tiny<00:02:44.100> little<00:02:44.310> details<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.500> use<00:02:46.739> this

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
tiny little details and you can use this

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.039 
tiny little details and you can use this
technique<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.310> make<00:02:47.430> galaxies<00:02:48.150> works<00:02:48.720> really

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
technique to make galaxies works really

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.620 
technique to make galaxies works really
really<00:02:49.200> well<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.680> galaxies<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.489> any<00:02:51.329> place

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
really well for galaxies and any place

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.720 
really well for galaxies and any place
where<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.870> need<00:02:52.110> kind<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:53.000> flash<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.269> color

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
where you need kind of a flash of color

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.020 
where you need kind of a flash of color
and<00:02:56.730> I'm<00:02:56.880> using<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:58.350> lot<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.130> Montana<00:02:59.579> hardcore

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
and I'm using a lot of Montana hardcore

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.130 
and I'm using a lot of Montana hardcore
mostly<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:00.510> I'm<00:03:00.600> using<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.840> little<00:03:00.930> bit<00:03:01.049> of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
mostly but I'm using a little bit of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.319 
mostly but I'm using a little bit of
color<00:03:01.350> place<00:03:01.590> white<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.489> could<00:03:02.640> use<00:03:02.820> molotov

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
color place white you could use molotov

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.680 
color place white you could use molotov
White's<00:03:03.570> dead<00:03:04.079> but<00:03:04.890> pretty<00:03:05.100> much<00:03:05.690> you're

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
White's dead but pretty much you're

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.670 
White's dead but pretty much you're
going<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.840> be<00:03:06.930> able<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.170> do<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.380> with<00:03:07.530> any

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
going to be able to do this with any

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.039 
going to be able to do this with any
spray<00:03:07.950> paint<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:08.310> thick<00:03:08.640> enough<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.810> got<00:03:09.959> to

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
spray paint but thick enough it's got to

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.490

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
to create a little city just with my

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.849 
to create a little city just with my
spatula<00:03:22.380> since<00:03:22.859> my<00:03:22.980> paper<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.400> already<00:03:23.549> dark

it's<00:03:25.859> going<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.130> come<00:03:26.280> out<00:03:26.370> dark<00:03:26.820> now<00:03:27.299> if<00:03:27.480> you

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
it's going to come out dark now if you

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.560 
it's going to come out dark now if you
are<00:03:27.930> using<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.440> lighter<00:03:28.970> color<00:03:29.970> poster<00:03:30.359> board
