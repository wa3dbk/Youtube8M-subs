00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:03.949
 I would like to do an alliance today 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.720
 More than double 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.449
 From the start 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:12.489
 A little above is a building with a few of these 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.230
 Part 7 companies 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.560
 Let's take a look at the daily schedule 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.990
 It's a place where you will use lacquer 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.420
 It was a shame but there was a first encounter 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.200
 A little longer here is easier to put in force 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.820
 In a pinch 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.770
 Match 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 If you have it with a plier 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.790
 The shorter one 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.350
 in this way 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 I will go ahead 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.370
 It is not enough to become a nucleus 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.850
 This is the second half of 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.929
 Because experience value gets in the way and it is decided ahead 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.200
 Once here 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.350
 I think it would be nice to take it home 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.890
 And 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.569
 In the corner part 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:06.730
 Because I love a little while ago 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.440
 As it is with mac 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.880
 This money remains 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.560
 Body south side one after another in a single year 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.350
 Once firmly 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 Bring me on this side 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.080
 Too heavy rain 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.200
 I think it is good today 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.690
 It was this way 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.100
 This gap is a certainty as a little bit longer method 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.730
 I feel like I won't go back 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.610
 This short 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.120
 Though it is former use 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.850
 Here is an example 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.670
 Here also new people but not people 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.950
 I will come out again 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.390
 I'll stare and pull it outside as much as possible 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.600
 I have decided 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.820
 it's the same 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.720
 I want to Sat 9 days Sino-Russia from now but more 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.390
 On the democratic side 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.700
 It is an image like winding while pulling 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.770
 And because the first time is the most important 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.380
 here 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.249
 It is as round as possible 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.249
 It is a point 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.119
 Now for the second lap 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.409
 In the night game 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.429
 In the content of the lyrics 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:22.379
 This too 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.539
 Feels good 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.959
 Here while pulling the second 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.339
 I will decide on my own 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.159
 I think there is a p2p hand 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 Though team is not done 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:39.079
 There is no need to stop moving. 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.499
 It's not like a coat but it's lacking here 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.629
 It is difficult 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.459
 Once 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.469
 Especially the introduction 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.249
 Follow 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.309
 come 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.829
 I felt like this 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.829
 I prepared 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.119
 Like this 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.840
 And at last 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.890
 I guess
