00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:10.269

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:10.269
 we have here in the carlitos forum 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.779
 today carlitos the expected releases one 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.090
 of them which is a fundamental part of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.420
 avengers who do not see it that way the people and 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.369
 another premiere that reminds us of the 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.229
 that we live although it is the last part 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.749
 of video games tangentially the 

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:38.059
 era of the 80 if good on the one hand 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:39.379
 let's talk about German that exists in 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.739
 last week but today we talk to you 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.239
 first of johnny pixels because it's 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.269
 the movie that is premiering on 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.519
 today pixels is an explosion 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.780
 cinematographic nostalgia ochentera 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.569
 first of all of course with the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.459
 subject that is visually very nice and 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:57.469
 very graphic very very impressive 

00:00:55.459 --> 00:01:00.019
 visually what is what would happen if 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.149
 these 8-bit games of the 80s like 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.619
 pacman donkey kong will come to the 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.210
 reality but in the form of attackers 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.590
 it turns out that an intelligence 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 alien 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.079
 receives a time capsule of the 80s 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.939
 and interprets as a threat 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.319
 the image these video games and decide 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.810
 attack the planet 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.909
 in the same way not then to whom 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.579
 they will have to resort then to the archers 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.490
 of yesteryear to those who were young 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.390
 the groupers good for those games and this 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.369
 he is very father because the movie 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.450
 start with this plan kid in the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.549
 eighties where we see the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.969
 personalities the characters of which 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.179
 will be played by adam sandler and by 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.649
 peter dinklage in word kevin james 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.989
 of young version that is very well the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.479
 casting bravo for that casting of those 

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:46.099
 boys and then we see them adults 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.709
 already in other roles completely 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:51.739
 different and the movie in its first 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.450
 half johnny and chita is very good at what 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:55.069
 that has to do with humor with the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.750
 references with the cameos not even 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.929
 I say who goes out because he's very father 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.759
 how are you using all this nod to the 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.349
 viewer who knew them but also 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.719
 towards the new generations see 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.099
 present them something they did not know and that 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.229
 is part of the evolution and the 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.000
 videogames is at a stage very much 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.380
 more advanced even with look 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.030
 film 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.000
 the director of the movie is chris 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.590
 columbus to the selection located because 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.750
 He directed the first two of Harry Potter 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 but remember that it was also 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.620
 screenwriter of movies like the goonies 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.020
 or as gremlins and that led my poor 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.520
 little angel let's talk about what he did in 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.590
 eighties in this era that he is 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.540
 remembering he is very good at working 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.670
 with children's characters 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.710
 they have to overcome an obstacle and 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.170
 that mature here the opposite is with 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.210
 Forty characters are already adults 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.310
 but they are completely immature and 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.560
 as the trailer for the film says 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.270
 president of the us let the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.250
 nerds are in charge of this attack 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.070
 because the Marines themselves do not know and do not know 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.230
 they know what the dynamics of the 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.670
 videogames not clear that part is very 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.320
 father of the movie what is 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.480
 truly unfortunate is that out there 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.270
 in half the movie sells every 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.650
 day you realize that you change control 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.930
 of the crisco tape the mousse as the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.420
 seal is a great director but of 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.220
 suddenly it seems that the humor of 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.190
 adam sandler kevin james that is a humor 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.410
 more coarse and let's say a little more clumsy 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.610
 more gringo love gringos adam 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.410
 sandler I think we can rescue 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.690
 two or three movies of the staff 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.790
 and that makes this second half of the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.830
 movie really ruin what 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.170
 it was being a great experience 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.060
 however, visually and by 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.280
 nostalgia that you said your people that you 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.770
 he said he is a fan of pac-man identikit that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.510
 it also appears that it also appears in 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.600
 the movie that's what makes it worth 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.910
 It's worth seeing this tape the truth that 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.490
 this leaves michelle monaghan which is a 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.440
 Spectacularly beautiful woman in a 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.660
 interesting role and it's a military that 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.810
 you have to help these men to 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.570
 achieve its mission not then also 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.520
 it seems appears by hisham bean brian cox 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:09.740
 all very important English actors 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:11.600
 who have good roles in the subject of 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.490
 the movie but the tradition that does not 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.170
 see and go see the movie for that 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.880
 Surprise with these very good 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.799
 occurrences surely all those who 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.600
 we play those new ones let's go let's go 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.049
 see hey but there's another movie that 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.049
 it also goes
