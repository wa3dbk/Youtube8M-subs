00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
parametric equation that I wrote a long

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.380 
parametric equation that I wrote a long
time<00:01:44.319> ago<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.560> yields<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.129> heart<00:01:45.459> on<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.759> graph

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
time ago that yields a heart on a graph

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.669 
time ago that yields a heart on a graph
and<00:01:46.720> if<00:01:46.929> you<00:01:46.989> guys<00:01:47.080> don't<00:01:47.259> know<00:01:47.379> I'm<00:01:47.470> pretty

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.559 
and if you guys don't know I'm pretty
into<00:01:48.009> math<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.729> thought<00:01:48.910> I<00:01:48.970> would<00:01:49.060> put<00:01:49.179> on<00:01:49.479> a

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
into math so I thought I would put on a

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.499 
into math so I thought I would put on a
shirt<00:01:50.399> possible<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.519> course<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:52.179> shirt<00:01:52.360> would

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
shirt possible of course the shirt would

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.240 
shirt possible of course the shirt would
also<00:01:52.629> be<00:01:52.840> black<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:53.470> please<00:01:53.800> do<00:01:54.009> let<00:01:54.129> me<00:01:54.190> know
