00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
this was I've eaten all this section

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.510 
this was I've eaten all this section
over<00:01:36.429> here<00:01:36.579> and<00:01:36.880> replanted<00:01:37.539> this<00:01:38.409> is<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.649> salad

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
over here and replanted this is a salad

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.020 
over here and replanted this is a salad
mix<00:01:39.759> that<00:01:40.719> we've<00:01:41.020> got<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:42.219> mix<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.579> a<00:01:42.700> bunch<00:01:42.880> of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
mix that we've got to mix of a bunch of

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.800 
mix that we've got to mix of a bunch of
different<00:01:43.329> types<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.689> lettuce<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:45.810> figured

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
different types of lettuce and figured

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.279 
different types of lettuce and figured
I'd<00:01:46.959> then<00:01:47.850> had<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.029> much<00:01:49.179> luck<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.630> that

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
I'd then had so much luck with that that

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.249 
I'd then had so much luck with that that
I<00:01:50.319> try<00:01:50.649> something<00:01:51.039> else<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:52.149> put<00:01:52.929> someone's

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
I try something else and put someone's

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.339 
I try something else and put someone's
in<00:01:53.529> the<00:01:53.619> systems<00:01:55.529> we<00:01:56.529> couple<00:01:57.130> weeks<00:01:57.279> ago<00:01:57.399> and

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
in the systems we couple weeks ago and

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.349 
in the systems we couple weeks ago and
they<00:01:59.349> all<00:01:59.859> seem<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.189> still<00:02:00.609> be<00:02:00.759> alive<00:02:00.969> I've

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
they all seem to still be alive I've

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.179 
they all seem to still be alive I've
checked<00:02:01.810> well<00:02:02.049> I've<00:02:02.200> been<00:02:02.229> feeding<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.009> worms

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
checked well I've been feeding the worms

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.779 
checked well I've been feeding the worms
and<00:02:03.969> they're<00:02:04.749> still<00:02:04.959> there<00:02:05.609> so<00:02:06.609> I<00:02:06.639> guess

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
and they're still there so I guess

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.910 
and they're still there so I guess
that's<00:02:07.149> a<00:02:07.240> good<00:02:07.420> thing

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.640 

but<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.099> said<00:02:11.219> it<00:02:11.489> basically<00:02:12.049> doubled<00:02:13.049> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
but like I said it basically doubled the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.349 
but like I said it basically doubled the
amount<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:14.040> water<00:02:14.310> running<00:02:15.060> through<00:02:15.209> the

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
amount of water running through the

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.520 
amount of water running through the
system<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.569> probably<00:02:18.750> add<00:02:19.200> two<00:02:19.409> more

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
system and I can probably add two more

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.089 
system and I can probably add two more
real<00:02:19.829> bids<00:02:20.069> I'll<00:02:21.319> I'll<00:02:22.319> probably<00:02:22.560> consider

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
real bids I'll I'll probably consider

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.869 
real bids I'll I'll probably consider
doing<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.459> as<00:02:23.790> as<00:02:24.060> funds<00:02:24.629> become<00:02:24.989> available

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
doing that as as funds become available
