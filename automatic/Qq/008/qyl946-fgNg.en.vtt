condition<00:00:28.679> okay<00:00:29.679> now<00:00:30.369> this<00:00:31.269> way<00:00:31.480> I'm<00:00:31.810> not

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
talking about the kicking leg anymore

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.220 
talking about the kicking leg anymore
but<00:00:33.940> I'm<00:00:34.030> talking<00:00:34.390> about<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:34.690> supporting<00:00:35.170> leg

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
but I'm talking about the supporting leg

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.220 
but I'm talking about the supporting leg
let<00:00:35.860> me<00:00:36.010> explain<00:00:36.280> what<00:00:36.490> I<00:00:36.520> mean<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:40.870> home

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
let me explain what I mean when a home

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.480 
let me explain what I mean when a home
kick<00:00:41.410> is<00:00:41.590> sown<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:43.450> a<00:00:43.630> hamstring<00:00:44.290> is<00:00:45.190> not

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
kick is sown it's a hamstring is not

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.520 
kick is sown it's a hamstring is not
flexible<00:00:46.150> enough<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:47.170> pelvis<00:00:47.680> will<00:00:47.950> shift<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
flexible enough the pelvis will shift to

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.010 
flexible enough the pelvis will shift to
allow<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.610> hamstring<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.150> be<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.420> little<00:00:52.840> bit

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
allow the hamstring to be a little bit

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.830 
allow the hamstring to be a little bit
longer<00:00:53.320> okay<00:00:53.770> this<00:00:54.760> can<00:00:54.940> be<00:00:55.060> rotational<00:00:55.480> to

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
longer okay this can be rotational to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.920 
longer okay this can be rotational to
tell<00:00:56.050> it<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.650> rotation<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.430> pelvis

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
tell it the rotation of the pelvis

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
tell it the rotation of the pelvis
causes<00:00:59.160> the<00:01:00.160> lengthening<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:01.720> hip<00:01:02.050> flexor

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
causes the lengthening of the hip flexor

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.779 
causes the lengthening of the hip flexor
okay<00:01:03.910> that's<00:01:04.750> one<00:01:05.080> point<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:06.220> second<00:01:06.640> point

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:06.789 
okay that's one point the second point

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.340 
okay that's one point the second point
is<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.579> body<00:01:09.789> let's<00:01:10.600> say<00:01:10.780> this<00:01:10.929> is<00:01:10.990> the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
is when the body let's say this is the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.160 
is when the body let's say this is the
most<00:01:11.799> that<00:01:12.609> you<00:01:12.939> have<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.329> flexibility<00:01:13.990> and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
most that you have the flexibility and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.709 
most that you have the flexibility and
Hamson<00:01:14.619> so<00:01:14.799> if<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.490> leg<00:01:15.670> goes<00:01:15.880> up<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.479> body

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
Hamson so if the leg goes up the body

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.889 
Hamson so if the leg goes up the body
will<00:01:16.960> go<00:01:17.170> back<00:01:17.469> to<00:01:17.799> compensate<00:01:18.429> because<00:01:19.359> you

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
will go back to compensate because you

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.840 
will go back to compensate because you
can't<00:01:20.200> bring<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.560> leg<00:01:20.740> up<00:01:20.920> anymore<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:21.700> have

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
can't bring the leg up anymore you have

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.489 
can't bring the leg up anymore you have
no<00:01:22.030> flexible<00:01:22.539> in<00:01:22.600> your<00:01:22.630> hamstrings<00:01:23.170> I'd<00:01:23.319> say

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
no flexible in your hamstrings I'd say

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:26.370 
no flexible in your hamstrings I'd say
that's<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.829> case<00:01:24.069> the<00:01:24.789> body<00:01:25.030> goes<00:01:25.240> back<00:01:25.509> if

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
that's the case the body goes back if

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.849 
that's the case the body goes back if
the<00:01:26.590> body<00:01:26.799> goes<00:01:27.009> back<00:01:27.899> you<00:01:28.899> can<00:01:29.109> see<00:01:29.350> that<00:01:29.619> now

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
the body goes back you can see that now

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.539 
the body goes back you can see that now
that<00:01:29.890> hip<00:01:30.249> flexor<00:01:30.729> takes<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:32.020> pressure

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that hip flexor takes the pressure

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.190 
that hip flexor takes the pressure
because<00:01:33.549> my<00:01:33.789> body<00:01:34.060> is<00:01:34.210> behind<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.780> center<00:01:35.139> of

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
because my body is behind the center of

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.230 
because my body is behind the center of
gravity<00:01:35.649> so<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.369> hip<00:01:36.609> flexes<00:01:37.060> well

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
gravity so the hip flexes well

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.660 
gravity so the hip flexes well
abdominals<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.880> under<00:01:40.509> pressure<00:01:41.249> in<00:01:42.249> this

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
abdominals is under pressure in this

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.359 
abdominals is under pressure in this
pledged<00:01:43.469> range<00:01:44.469> of<00:01:44.649> motion<00:01:45.389> okay<00:01:46.389> so<00:01:47.350> for<00:01:48.219> me

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
pledged range of motion okay so for me

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.120 
pledged range of motion okay so for me
not<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.759> get<00:01:48.909> into<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.389> now<00:01:49.859> we're<00:01:50.859> talking

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
not to get into it now we're talking

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.499 
not to get into it now we're talking
about<00:01:51.189> supporting<00:01:51.789> let<00:01:51.939> me<00:01:52.030> get<00:01:52.209> not<00:01:52.389> the

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
about supporting let me get not the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.449 
about supporting let me get not the
chicken<00:01:52.869> leg<00:01:53.020> because<00:01:53.409> most<00:01:53.619> people<00:01:53.950> practice

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
chicken leg because most people practice

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.820 
chicken leg because most people practice
detect<00:01:54.819> people<00:01:55.450> do<00:01:55.810> something<00:01:56.229> in<00:01:56.499> this

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
for the hypnotist in the normal way but

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.140 
for the hypnotist in the normal way but
for<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.240> extended<00:02:01.900> range<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.460> get<00:02:03.610> hurt

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
for the extended range not to get hurt

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.230 
for the extended range not to get hurt
the<00:02:04.480> muscle<00:02:04.840> would<00:02:04.960> be<00:02:05.170> strong<00:02:06.070> in<00:02:06.400> this<00:02:06.730> range

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the muscle would be strong in this range

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.990 
the muscle would be strong in this range
okay<00:02:07.960> I'm<00:02:08.500> down<00:02:08.680> on<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.130> world<00:02:09.369> but<00:02:09.490> no<00:02:09.670> people

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
okay I'm down on the world but no people

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.330 
okay I'm down on the world but no people
do<00:02:10.570> access<00:02:11.080> without<00:02:11.320> dominant<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.010> that's<00:02:12.160> not

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
do access without dominant so that's not

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.940 
do access without dominant so that's not
a<00:02:12.400> problem<00:02:12.630> okay<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:16.180> often<00:02:16.630> people<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
a problem okay but often people do the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.410 
a problem okay but often people do the
same<00:02:17.980> stance<00:02:18.520> sometimes<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.210> weight

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
same stance sometimes to the weight

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.890 
same stance sometimes to the weight
sometimes<00:02:19.960> not<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.430> good<00:02:21.460> exercise<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:22.750> it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
sometimes not so good exercise but it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.470 
sometimes not so good exercise but it
does<00:02:23.020> not<00:02:23.170> isolate<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.860> complex's<00:02:24.490> okay

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
does not isolate the complex's okay

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.930 
does not isolate the complex's okay
because<00:02:26.080> also<00:02:26.500> they<00:02:26.950> hamstring<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:27.520> this<00:02:27.700> side

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
because also they hamstring on this side

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.760 
because also they hamstring on this side
the<00:02:28.210> glutes<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:28.810> side<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.290> little<00:02:29.500> bit<00:02:29.620> of

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
the glutes on this side a little bit of

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.070 
the glutes on this side a little bit of
quadriceps<00:02:30.220> here<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.970> also<00:02:31.300> work<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.660> quality

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
quadriceps here I also work in quality

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.710 
quadriceps here I also work in quality
since<00:02:32.470> here<00:02:32.680> there's<00:02:33.250> not<00:02:33.460> only<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.240> muscle

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
since here there's not only this muscle

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600 
since here there's not only this muscle
but<00:02:35.140> would<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.620> isolate<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.190> muscle

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
but would like to isolate this muscle

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.520 
but would like to isolate this muscle
and<00:02:37.480> I'll<00:02:38.020> show<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.260> had<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:40.530> again

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
angle obviously this exercise on both

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.800 
angle obviously this exercise on both
sides<00:03:02.920> but<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:04.090> should<00:03:04.270> never<00:03:04.390> do<00:03:04.630> anything

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
on one side but I'm just gonna put it in

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.250 
on one side but I'm just gonna put it in
one<00:03:07.270> leg<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.750> I'm<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:08.050> to<00:03:08.110> demonstrate

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
one leg that I'm going to demonstrate

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.070 
one leg that I'm going to demonstrate
with<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:10.060> case<00:03:10.270> can<00:03:10.510> be<00:03:10.540> my<00:03:10.690> left<00:03:10.900> leg

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
with and this case can be my left leg

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.760 
with and this case can be my left leg
let's<00:03:11.320> say<00:03:13.980> no

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
let's say no

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.920 
let's say no
taking<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.730> ankle<00:03:18.120> weights<00:03:19.100> placement<00:03:20.100> here

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
taking the ankle weights placement here

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.710 
taking the ankle weights placement here
okay<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:23.010> I'm<00:03:23.100> going<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.340> be<00:03:23.460> working<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.480> hip

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
okay so I'm going to be working on hip

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:33.530 
okay so I'm going to be working on hip
flexes<00:03:25.200> now<00:03:28.700> if<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:29.880> simply<00:03:30.360> do<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:32.540> don't

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
flexes now if I simply do this I don't

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.990 
flexes now if I simply do this I don't
know<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.290> see<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:34.680> my<00:03:34.860> pelvis<00:03:35.370> can

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
know if you can see but my pelvis can

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.360 
know if you can see but my pelvis can
shift<00:03:36.330> my<00:03:36.680> pelvis

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
shift my pelvis

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.730 
shift my pelvis
so<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> movement<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.780> not<00:03:39.930> necessarily<00:03:40.440> from

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
so the movement is not necessarily from

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.040 
so the movement is not necessarily from
here<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:41.700> also<00:03:41.880> from<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.300> pelvis<00:03:42.750> from<00:03:42.960> the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
here but also from the pelvis from the

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.530 
here but also from the pelvis from the
abdominals<00:03:43.650> maybe<00:03:44.430> I'm<00:03:44.610> pushing<00:03:44.850> back<00:03:45.030> down

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
abdominals maybe I'm pushing back down

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.400 
abdominals maybe I'm pushing back down
with<00:03:46.020> this<00:03:46.170> way<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:47.160> help<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:48.020> don't<00:03:49.020> want<00:03:49.260> that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.200 
with this way to help I don't want that
I<00:03:49.650> don't<00:03:49.770> want<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.130> muscle<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.670> work<00:03:50.850> in<00:03:51.060> us
