00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
off the stems and try to cut them off so

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.540 
off the stems and try to cut them off so
that<00:01:50.380> there's<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.770> little<00:01:50.920> bit<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.310> stem

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
that there's a little bit of the stem

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.600 
that there's a little bit of the stem
left<00:01:51.790> on<00:01:51.940> it<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.410> can<00:01:53.740> put<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.400> glue

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
left on it because you can put the glue

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.290 
left on it because you can put the glue
on<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:55.390> part<00:01:55.780> you'll<00:01:56.590> see<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.730> then<00:01:57.880> for<00:01:58.180> the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
the blue just in case and I decided to

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.670

use<00:02:06.580> some<00:02:07.300> of<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.450> green<00:02:07.660> leaves<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.410> make<00:02:08.530> it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
use some of the green leaves to make it

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.990 
use some of the green leaves to make it
look<00:02:08.890> more<00:02:09.369> nature<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.930> and<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:12.430> glued<00:02:12.790> a

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
look more nature like and I just glued a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.150 
look more nature like and I just glued a
whole<00:02:13.240> bunch<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.720> green<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.230> use<00:02:14.500> down

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.060 

just<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.370> give<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.940> nature<00:02:19.930> feel<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:21.040> a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
just to give it that nature feel like a

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.280 
just to give it that nature feel like a
whole<00:02:21.700> bunch<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.970> them<00:02:22.090> down<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.960> think<00:02:23.170> it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
whole bunch of them down and I think it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.470 
whole bunch of them down and I think it
turned<00:02:23.530> out<00:02:23.680> really<00:02:23.740> cool<00:02:24.310> how<00:02:24.610> they<00:02:24.820> were

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
turned out really cool how they were

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.510 
turned out really cool how they were
underneath<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.170> flowers<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:27.310> like

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
underneath the flowers and I just like

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.020 
underneath the flowers and I just like
that<00:02:28.620> then<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.860> took<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.250> bigger<00:02:30.430> flowers<00:02:30.700> and

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
that then I took the bigger flowers and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.160 
that then I took the bigger flowers and
they<00:02:31.090> started<00:02:31.330> gluing<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.780> bigger<00:02:31.930> flowers

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
they started gluing the bigger flowers

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.740 
they started gluing the bigger flowers
on<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:33.130> want<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.700> whole<00:02:34.030> bunch<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.390> glue

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
on you want to get a whole bunch of glue

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.320 
on you want to get a whole bunch of glue
on<00:02:34.780> these<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.500> make<00:02:35.920> sure<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.850> glue<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.090> on

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
on these and make sure we glue it on

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.570 
on these and make sure we glue it on
very<00:02:37.930> tight<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.710> make<00:02:38.890> sure<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.160> glued<00:02:39.430> onto

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
very tight and make sure it's glued onto

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.750 
very tight and make sure it's glued onto
the<00:02:39.880> ribbon<00:02:40.300> not<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.380> leaves<00:02:41.650> because<00:02:42.550> if

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
the ribbon not the leaves because if

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.670 
the ribbon not the leaves because if
it's<00:02:42.880> glued<00:02:43.150> onto<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.450> leaves<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.959> won't<00:02:44.140> it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
it's glued onto the leaves it won't it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.890 
it's glued onto the leaves it won't it
probably<00:02:45.160> won't<00:02:45.310> stay<00:02:45.610> if<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:45.970> glued<00:02:46.690> onto

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
probably won't stay if it's glued onto

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.650 
probably won't stay if it's glued onto
the<00:02:47.110> ribbon<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.620> will<00:02:47.860> stay<00:02:48.190> longer

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.080 

also<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.470> kind<00:02:51.830> of<00:02:51.860> like<00:02:52.070> moved<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.850> leaves

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
also I kind of like moved the leaves

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.300 
also I kind of like moved the leaves
around<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.630> bit<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:53.870> made<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:54.890> they're<00:02:55.070> kind

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
around a bit and made it so they're kind

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:04.980 
around a bit and made it so they're kind
of<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.490> overlapping<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.480> flowers

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.750 

want<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.080> be<00:03:06.170> very<00:03:06.530> careful<00:03:06.980> with<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.520> glue

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
want to be very careful with the glue

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.980 
want to be very careful with the glue
gun<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.330> did<00:03:08.930> burn<00:03:09.470> myself<00:03:10.210> multiple<00:03:11.210> times<00:03:11.480> and

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
gun I did burn myself multiple times and

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.780 
gun I did burn myself multiple times and
I<00:03:12.080> literally<00:03:12.470> had<00:03:12.740> blisters<00:03:13.070> on<00:03:13.580> my<00:03:13.610> fingers

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
I literally had blisters on my fingers

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.770 
I literally had blisters on my fingers
for<00:03:14.660> like<00:03:14.870> four<00:03:15.410> days<00:03:15.440> after<00:03:16.100> illness<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:17.510> was

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
for like four days after illness it was

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:43.890 
for like four days after illness it was
painful

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:53.640 

I<00:03:49.590> really<00:03:50.590> like<00:03:50.769> how<00:03:50.980> I<00:03:51.010> put<00:03:51.430> it<00:03:51.549> together<00:03:52.650> and

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
I really like how I put it together and

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.080 
I really like how I put it together and
I<00:03:53.709> think<00:03:53.739> if<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.069> use<00:03:54.189> the<00:03:54.220> same<00:03:54.489> technique<00:03:54.879> it

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
I think if you use the same technique it

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.800 
I think if you use the same technique it
will<00:03:55.209> turn<00:03:55.360> out<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.599> same<00:03:55.780> way<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:58.510> this<00:03:58.689> is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
will turn out the same way so this is

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.110 
will turn out the same way so this is
how<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.079> turned<00:03:59.319> out<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.860> really<00:04:00.370> love<00:04:00.819> it<00:04:00.970> like

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
how it turned out I really love it like

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.619 
how it turned out I really love it like
I<00:04:01.269> said<00:04:01.540> it's<00:04:02.260> kind<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.620> crazy<00:04:02.829> but<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.629> like

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
I said it's kind of crazy but I like

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:13.860 
I said it's kind of crazy but I like
crazy<00:04:05.200> things<00:04:05.590> cuz<00:04:06.280> I'm<00:04:06.459> crazy

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.009 

this<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.200> second<00:04:15.620> crown<00:04:15.830> and<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.310> very

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
this is the second crown and it's very

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.580 
this is the second crown and it's very
very<00:04:18.019> simple<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:19.310> also<00:04:20.290> ethereal<00:04:21.290> at<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
very simple but also ethereal at the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.909 
very simple but also ethereal at the
same<00:04:21.829> time<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.700> just<00:04:23.030> think<00:04:23.660> it<00:04:23.780> looks<00:04:24.050> so

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
same time I just think it looks so

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.909 
same time I just think it looks so
pretty<00:04:25.270> it's<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:26.570> it's<00:04:26.840> such<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> girly<00:04:27.889> thing

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
pretty it's so it's such a girly thing

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.110 
pretty it's so it's such a girly thing
and<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:29.270> think<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.570> could<00:04:29.720> wear<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.110> a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
and I think you could wear this to a

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.530 
and I think you could wear this to a
picnic<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.540> it'd<00:04:33.260> be<00:04:33.470> super<00:04:33.770> cute<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.210> got

flowers that I got actually are this

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.129 
flowers that I got actually are this
stems<00:04:40.820> are<00:04:41.150> made<00:04:41.690> from<00:04:42.130> wire<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:44.780> you'll<00:04:44.960> see

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
stems are made from wire so you'll see

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.360 
stems are made from wire so you'll see
what<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.320> do<00:04:45.410> I<00:04:45.740> cut<00:04:46.520> I<00:04:46.850> used<00:04:47.830> like<00:04:48.830> regular

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
what I do I cut I used like regular

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.130 
what I do I cut I used like regular
scissors<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:50.060> then<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.270> change<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:50.810> kitchen

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
scissors and then I change to kitchen

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.990 
scissors and then I change to kitchen
shears<00:04:51.500> because<00:04:51.830> this<00:04:52.370> is<00:04:52.520> it<00:04:52.640> we're<00:04:52.880> not

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
shears because this is it we're not

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.090 
shears because this is it we're not
working<00:04:53.180> I<00:04:53.450> pulled<00:04:53.810> off<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.140> wired<00:04:54.410> branches

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
working I pulled off the wired branches

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:03.840 
working I pulled off the wired branches
and<00:04:55.900> then<00:04:56.900> you'll<00:04:57.380> see<00:04:57.710> what<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:57.950> do<00:04:58.070> with<00:04:58.430> them

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.340 

this<00:05:04.850> part<00:05:05.060> is<00:05:05.120> extremely<00:05:05.750> simple<00:05:05.960> I

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
this part is extremely simple I

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.590 
this part is extremely simple I
basically<00:05:06.680> just<00:05:06.950> twisted<00:05:07.700> them<00:05:07.910> together<00:05:08.090> in

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
basically just twisted them together in

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.230 
basically just twisted them together in
the<00:05:09.140> shape<00:05:09.380> of<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:10.250> circle<00:05:10.430> in<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:10.910> shape<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.180> my

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
the shape of a circle in the shape of my

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.570 
the shape of a circle in the shape of my
head<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.840> measured<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.560> around<00:05:12.830> my<00:05:12.979> head<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:13.430> I

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
head I measured it around my head and I

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.879 
head I measured it around my head and I
basically<00:05:13.729> just<00:05:14.560> twisted<00:05:15.560> them<00:05:15.710> together

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
basically just twisted them together

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.280 
basically just twisted them together
that's<00:05:16.820> all<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.150> did<00:05:17.360> for<00:05:17.540> this<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:17.990> didn't<00:05:18.229> even

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
that's all I did for this I didn't even

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.860 
that's all I did for this I didn't even
use<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.560> glue<00:05:18.830> gun<00:05:18.979> or<00:05:19.130> anything<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:19.790> it<00:05:20.510> stayed

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
use a glue gun or anything and it stayed

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.570 
use a glue gun or anything and it stayed
perfectly<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:21.860> I<00:05:21.950> think<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.250> turned<00:05:22.430> out

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
perfectly and I think it turned out

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.080 
perfectly and I think it turned out
really<00:05:22.640> nice<00:05:23.000> I<00:05:23.510> i<00:05:24.500> think<00:05:25.400> i<00:05:25.490> could<00:05:25.550> even<00:05:25.880> wear

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
really nice I i think i could even wear

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.450 
really nice I i think i could even wear
this<00:05:26.270> one<00:05:26.510> just<00:05:27.140> doing<00:05:27.590> random<00:05:27.800> daily
