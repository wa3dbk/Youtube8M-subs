00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.740
 I will. 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:13.309
 Hello, this is iPad Air Two . 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.309
 IPad Air's weight do once Want to start? 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.450
 The face came out this time, too jotgetjyo room space isomerase Graham Gold 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.529
 Class Apple Nowadays shoes are not so good right 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.720
 Well, of course you can , depending on your taste, but somehow it's thinner and lighter. 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:32.750
 Just do it. Let's take a look. 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.370
 How long ago that we saw the low part that you are at the bottom of that well-known to the minutes 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.940
 I saw that dubbing 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.449
 It's fun, but what you're introducing today is not great. 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.960
 It's great. 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:49.339
 Let me let you know that I have an excellent name for you Lung 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:55.670
 For jingle Kyu wrung 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:59.780
 O pad row against John Toon 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:04.430
 Yesterday I hardly awful across 30 nanwojwotda geuraetneunde really light 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.250
 Shock and fear. Wait a minute. 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.390
 With various manuals 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.780
 Various manuals and Apple guess this is a sticker containing gas od fives 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.780
 why 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:22.460
 If you put it in, it's a good size, it's a moderate lightning cable. 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.509
 And what 's the matter with the sp charger here ? 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.509
 Each're not important is not it in fact not even specific skills Refurbished reported smoking yireongeo 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.049
 I'll see what 's important . 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.049
 I do not. 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:42.050
 ìŠ‰ 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:46.520
 5, and tell me this is what I mean, before I see the iPad Air the first time 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.330
 When I asked for it, I placed it behind the pencil and advertised it. 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.980
 It's slim. 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:57.260
 Bugo Monk I wanted to be crazy but oie is really crazy. 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:01.190
 Where do I start? I have a pixel front camera 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.450
 Display of course, and under its foundation # 2 Ah finally became what it added 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.990
 Well, actually. 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.860
 It's great . You know, we were all better than this . 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.560
 In fact, as many would have been able to just go down and touch, as indeed Fisheye 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.870
 I put it in the iPad air frame. 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:22.730
 Oh, look at the right moment and here is the original volume key here is that what is there 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:27.020
 There was a button to turn off the sound and control the screen , 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.800
 There was a button. I got rid of it. Cost savings. 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.240
 What can i do 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.440
 Anyway Yes unknown and Green Art Volume keys Microphone 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.670
 The power key on the left is the same as the 3.5th, and this is cellular version 4 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:45.019
 Before something else that I'm not the other stars, not to the side oh I'm under John 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.190
 There's a lighting port and a speaker . The shape of the speaker design has changed. 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.340
 follow 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.269
 What in fact the first thing eopne important part is the same for each ahningeot 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.800
 And of course there is the rear camera and far below the path of destruction 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.160
 Haetguyo upgrade Moth 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.480
 Apple logo There are various certification logos. 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.680
 But I think this is a little ridiculous . 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.000
 How can I get thinner? 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.370
 There is nothing wrong with your teacher . 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.850
 You do not see much difference. 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.210
 Anyway , if you look towards the design, there is no difference between the young and the young. 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.920
 It can be said that it is less than nine minutes 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.920
 Let's try a thousand won once. 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.520
 It changed a lot inside and out. 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.090
 The seventh grade we'll see that fight for one cause 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.220
 It's the same color. I do not need it. 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.640
 The requirements are on. 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.990
 I have to say that I have to touch the front side of the 200 won . 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.770
 But in fact what many here not obtained by folding the 7th yiradeunji surface film 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:54.450
 The part was counted. 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:59.400
 It seems to be just like the week and soon , and it's a good test. 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.530
 Anyway, as I said before, the thickness is thin to the level of shock and horror 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.220
 I lost it. 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.120
 If he's not like this, he's nervous. 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.660
 Getting lighter 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:16.380
 Now was going to finish setting gave 1.4mm thinner 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.359
 Hello Hello Korean hasiji 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.930
 I do not have a tiffle core in the set. 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.810
 Almost all parts are upgraded. 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.009
 So this is iPad AirTuba, while the existing iPad is worth $ 100 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.389
 Air dwaetneunde 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:37.370
 Pufferfish should be, but this iPad Mini 3, of course, another video again 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:39.620
 But if you see the same iPad mini three, the performance is something you ronde why the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.629
 It's a tooth gossip. 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:49.300
 I mean, there's a situation like that. 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:53.350
 Why Wi-Fi do not catch them gave examples 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.050
 I can not tell you that . Excuse me. 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.740
 It takes a long time to set 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:04.300
 What is good before? We have several. 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.030
 It does not add password anyway 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:13.060
 Do not add a password when iOS7 first came out of this 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:15.460
 It was like this, and I told you I did not add anything . 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.700
 You're done iPad AirTour 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.840
 Internally, actually, right now , there's only one thing that's gotten into Paris . 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:26.770
 Eopgetjiman fact that the cpu cores growing things easy internal RAM reason 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:31.090
 And the bii 3 camera is 8 megabytes in omega 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:35.020
 And that the continuous processing speaker or slow motion a has been added and 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:38.560
 The barometer sensor is added internally, so it is highly utilized 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.940
 Jigetjyo Give the iPhone and the iPad come to unconsciously Raising 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.790
 Fingerprint recognition. 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:50.300
 There will be changes like that . Let's compare the choreography with our other colors. 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:53.740
 See you to b7 services enable dramatic 0-2 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.740
 Then use Meet Me 1 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:02.800
 They look at the alternate terms and conditions as they look. 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:08.110
 It's like a cd, but it's not. 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:11.320
 Old was going to tear out of the windows cd will not listen to this cd there that 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:15.580
 I agree to the End User Agreement . 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:19.660
 It says "Do not break if you do not agree," but the iPad does. 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.720
 It'll be easy. Let's see it . IPad Air Tour 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:28.449
 We will be Space Gray and White Silver. 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:35.260
 Not always paved, not always trying to import this happens all the time brooding keen viewed 7 times 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:39.010
 Let's compare colors once again. Today , 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:42.580
 In the case of a model, this antenna will be added like an existing iPad. 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:46.539
 It's amazing. When iPad Air first came out, 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.800
 Village was lovable because you can view without the iPad assuming tone ah now existing 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:58.270
 It seems heavy to be announced and not so sophisticated. 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:59.199
 Heck did that to yoreonsik iPad Air to air twice a party makes sense 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.400
 Be 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:07.780
 It's a strange world. In fact, it looks like the ufo-like building on the Apple campus. 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.180
 I do not build a web ball. I think I'm already on the bread. I have Jackie. 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:15.160
 I do not think that's a joke. 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:17.919
 If you do not know what to do and if you can not see it in video, 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.610
 I'll apps floating point co Lorca that care on a hill 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:25.389
 When is the iPad, but the app for the drink or iPad in the CAD know-how? 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:29.380
 Upcoming kids'm also force during squatting Please wait geumman and that is our 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:33.880
 You can take a look at the mobile badge and drop me a few pages and we 're different. 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:37.570
 Thanks to you, Sipyu just sns instaggram Facebook Twitter Google Plus 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.740
 If you want to go faster, we also of course the app is a little faster fc Articles 

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.820

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:45.940
 Well, you can find out. Let 's have a look at the reviews and iPad. 

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:48.389
 I do not like fast-to-hayeoteoyo 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.389
