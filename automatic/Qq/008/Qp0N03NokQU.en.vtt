00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
dinosaurs and they can move well I don't

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.630 
dinosaurs and they can move well I don't
know<00:03:23.250> could<00:03:24.180> be<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.720> two<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.459> is

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.900 
actually sure i'm probably gonna get a
lot<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.560> hate<00:03:52.830> for<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.160> i<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:53.580> it's

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
lot of hate for that i know it's

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.190 
lot of hate for that i know it's
something<00:03:54.120> not<00:03:54.420> really<00:03:56.300> admired<00:03:57.300> in<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
something not really admired in the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.630 
something not really admired in the
gaming<00:03:58.380> community<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:59.070> it's<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.340> something

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
gaming community but it's just something

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.830 
gaming community but it's just something
it's<00:03:59.820> just<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.090> way<00:04:00.180> I've<00:04:00.300> always<00:04:00.390> done<00:04:00.570> it

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
it's just the way I've always done it

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.870 
it's just the way I've always done it
and<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.200> play<00:04:02.010> better<00:04:02.250> with<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.580> slower

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
and I play better with a slower

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.680 
and I play better with a slower
sensitivity<00:04:03.630> that's<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.860> me<00:04:05.040> but<00:04:05.940> um<00:04:06.269> so

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
sensitivity that's just me but um so

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.840 
sensitivity that's just me but um so
firstly<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.410> sensitivity<00:04:08.130> upgrade<00:04:08.550> is

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
firstly the sensitivity upgrade is

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.479 
firstly the sensitivity upgrade is
hellish<00:04:09.750> for<00:04:10.110> me<00:04:10.230> then<00:04:10.920> you've<00:04:11.130> got<00:04:11.340> this

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
hellish for me then you've got this

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.750 
hellish for me then you've got this
factor<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.060> you're<00:04:12.239> an<00:04:12.330> f5<00:04:12.750> mode<00:04:13.080> which<00:04:13.760> even

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
factor that you're an f5 mode which even

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.909 
factor that you're an f5 mode which even
with<00:04:14.940> normal<00:04:15.600> kind<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.959> view<00:04:16.229> distance<00:04:16.680> makes

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
with normal kind of view distance makes

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.070 
with normal kind of view distance makes
it<00:04:17.130> kind<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.430> tricky<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.910> see<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.390> then<00:04:18.930> you've

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
it kind of tricky to see and then you've

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.279 
it kind of tricky to see and then you've
got<00:04:19.290> quake<00:04:19.650> pro<00:04:20.100> 1<00:04:20.370> which<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.700> just<00:04:21.330> yeah

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
got quake pro 1 which is just yeah

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.090 
got quake pro 1 which is just yeah
