00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
lift arms and down at the bottom here of

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.210 
lift arms and down at the bottom here of
course<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.080> haven't<00:01:13.260> used<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.830> quite<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.010> few

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
course I haven't used it for quite a few

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.510 
course I haven't used it for quite a few
years<00:01:15.259> it's<00:01:16.259> cracked<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.400> pull<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
years it's cracked so when I pull the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
years it's cracked so when I pull the
lever<00:01:20.549> back<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.299> puts<00:01:21.509> pressure<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
lever back and it puts pressure in that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.950 
lever back and it puts pressure in that
cylinder<00:01:23.009> oil<00:01:23.360> pisses<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.720> over<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
cylinder oil pisses out all over the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.640 
cylinder oil pisses out all over the
ground<00:01:25.460> that's<00:01:26.460> why<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.020> being<00:01:28.229> replaced

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
ground that's why that is being replaced

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.380 
ground that's why that is being replaced
now<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.310> demonstrate<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> new<00:01:30.240> one

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
now I can demonstrate on the new one

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
now I can demonstrate on the new one

where the crack is beans it's upside
down<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.590> cracked<00:01:37.920> across<00:01:38.630> from<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
down here it cracked across from the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.380 
down here it cracked across from the
cylinder<00:01:40.079> right<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.799> bowl<00:01:41.240> which<00:01:42.240> is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
cylinder right to that bowl which is

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.289 
cylinder right to that bowl which is
kind<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.689> amazing<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.290> me<00:01:43.439> yeah<00:01:43.860> I'll<00:01:44.729> show<00:01:45.119> it
