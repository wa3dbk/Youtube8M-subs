problem<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.880> course<00:01:33.300> you<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
problem with it of course you know you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.830 
problem with it of course you know you
need<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.560> change<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.130> filter<00:01:35.840> occasionally

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
need to change the filter occasionally

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.340

the standard paper filter in it I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.590

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
maybe which I did not do that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.050 
maybe which I did not do that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
upgraded hose for this because its

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.170 
upgraded hose for this because its
