00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:19.730
 ideas for singing I come to introduce you 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.730
 a composter that has a 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.130
 particularity is compartmentalized in 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.310
 three independent spaces 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.160
 reception material I offer a second 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.660
 for degradation and a third for 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.120
 maturation 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.580
 for more than 20 years the engineers 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.820
 and owners of the company in new 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.430
 zealand work improving processes 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.770
 of composting for units 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.640
 residential and houses fincas or houses 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.790
 gardens in the translation to colombia the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.650
 capacity of this compostera is 466 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.500
 liters as I commented previously 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.519
 It is subdivided into three compartments 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.680
 the first of 186 liters is the highest 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.410
 capacity because it is the one that will receive 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.670
 the fresh material and in its process it goes 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.530
 to produce the largest volume reduction 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.100
 We mainly have them for families 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.649
 from four to six people the remarkable thing 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.860
 of this compostera is that we are going to try 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.110
 between 500 and 1000 kilos per year of 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.020
 green waste and kitchen waste 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.120
 to have as final product a 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.240
 ripe compost 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.670
 after 30 or 60 days that's going to 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.659
 depend on the interests and 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.049
 consumer needs 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.960
 there are 34 main basics 1 the 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.409
 carbon nitrogen ratio 2 the process 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.350
 of humidity in which 3 starts the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.390
 aeration oxygenation those are the three 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.819
 main concepts that one has to 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.340
 have clear to have a good process 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.490
 of composting where they are from 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.110
 these composters 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.630
 We are mainly talking about houses 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.600
 gardens with their garden waste or 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.560
 small organic own gardens and 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.130
 kitchen waste such as potato peels or 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.319
 of fruit well this process is 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.950
 designed or is compostela is designed 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.780
 to give a solution to those families that 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.910
 generate this type of waste and treat 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.800
 your waste and transform it into fertilizer 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:32.650
 in the same place it was absurd 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.600
 transport a waste with large volume 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.100
 and very little weight for many 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.400
 kilometers to take it to a landfill 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.760
 health and has evolved and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.950
 has been perfecting the use 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.680
 in situ in the place where the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.900
 waste this is designed in such 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.450
 way with the holes that there are at 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.180
 inside so there is a circulation 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.819
 of air that is aerobic therefore in 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.680
 an aerobic process is not going to be 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:05.220
 putrefaction by not seeing another faction not 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.220
 there will be aggressive or harmful odors
