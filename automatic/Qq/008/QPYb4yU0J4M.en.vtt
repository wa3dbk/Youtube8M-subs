training<00:01:42.170> lives<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.859> constant<00:01:43.369> friction<00:01:43.549> I

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
training lives of constant friction I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.910 
training lives of constant friction I
think<00:01:44.539> that<00:01:44.630> has<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.869> lot<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.259> do<00:01:45.619> with<00:01:45.649> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
think that has a lot to do with the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.370 
think that has a lot to do with the
endurance<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.999> the<00:01:47.539> speed<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.020> they<00:01:48.170> have

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
endurance and the speed that they have

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.590 
endurance and the speed that they have
is<00:01:48.619> that<00:01:48.770> they're<00:01:49.009> all<00:01:49.609> of<00:01:50.179> their<00:01:50.329> training

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
is that they're all of their training

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.980 
is that they're all of their training
they're<00:01:50.899> constantly<00:01:51.439> being<00:01:51.740> tested<00:01:52.749> he<00:01:53.749> has

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
they're constantly being tested he has
