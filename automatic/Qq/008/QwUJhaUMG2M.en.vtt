so<00:04:08.049> that's<00:04:08.349> really<00:04:08.530> stupid<00:04:08.919> that<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.310> did<00:04:09.459> that

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
so that's really stupid that it did that

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.229 
so that's really stupid that it did that
I'm<00:04:09.970> actually<00:04:10.410> pretty<00:04:11.410> upset<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:13.150> it

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
I'm actually pretty upset that that it

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.990 
I'm actually pretty upset that that it
did<00:04:13.359> that<00:04:13.480> but<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:14.829> guys<00:04:14.980> can<00:04:15.220> learn<00:04:15.639> from<00:04:15.849> my

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
did that but you guys can learn from my

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.550 
did that but you guys can learn from my
mistake<00:04:16.329> i<00:04:16.479> guess<00:04:16.660> i<00:04:17.019> should<00:04:17.320> have<00:04:17.380> just

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
mistake i guess i should have just

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.740 
mistake i guess i should have just
stayed<00:04:17.709> there<00:04:17.769> for<00:04:18.370> one<00:04:18.489> more<00:04:18.669> round<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.239> it

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
stayed there for one more round and it

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.599 
stayed there for one more round and it
probably<00:04:19.930> would've<00:04:20.169> worked<00:04:20.459> but<00:04:21.459> then<00:04:21.579> again

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
probably would've worked but then again

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:22.740 
probably would've worked but then again
some<00:04:21.910> people<00:04:21.940> say<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.240> you<00:04:22.389> have<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.570> be<00:04:22.660> you

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
some people say that you have to be you

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
and we're gonna do it it doesn't make a

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.320 
and we're gonna do it it doesn't make a
