really been fun Oh Bravo

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.649 
really been fun Oh Bravo
next<00:03:49.599> up<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.950> pulper<00:03:51.549> where<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.299> paper<00:03:52.540> is

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
next up the pulper where the paper is

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.820 
next up the pulper where the paper is
doused<00:03:53.049> in<00:03:53.409> 30,000<00:03:54.370> gallons<00:03:54.849> of<00:03:54.970> warm<00:03:55.239> water

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
doused in 30,000 gallons of warm water

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.470 
doused in 30,000 gallons of warm water
paper<00:03:56.830> will<00:03:57.099> absorb<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.459> water<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:58.090> it

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
paper will absorb the water and it

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.479 
paper will absorb the water and it
starts<00:03:58.989> breaking<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.500> individual<00:04:00.069> fibers

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
starts breaking the individual fibers

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.789 
starts breaking the individual fibers
okay<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.450> water<00:04:01.690> weakens<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.530> paper

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
okay so the water weakens the paper

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.100 
okay so the water weakens the paper
exactly<00:04:03.280> paper<00:04:03.849> Megan<00:04:04.239> is<00:04:04.329> all<00:04:04.450> about<00:04:04.780> adding
