with skis with early rise in the tip so
they're<00:00:51.719> fantastic<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.559> powder<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.270> want

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
they're fantastic in powder and you want

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.439 
they're fantastic in powder and you want
to<00:00:54.539> charge<00:00:54.809> big<00:00:55.170> steep<00:00:55.500> runs<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to charge big steep runs so we have that

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.000 
to charge big steep runs so we have that
element<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> new<00:00:58.379> boot<00:00:58.590> called<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
element with a new boot called the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.299 
element with a new boot called the
Delirium<00:00:59.899> we<00:01:00.899> also<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> completely

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
Delirium we also have a completely

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.850 
Delirium we also have a completely
different<00:01:02.870> boot<00:01:03.870> where<00:01:04.170> we've<00:01:04.350> knocked<00:01:04.589> as

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
different boot where we've knocked as

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
different boot where we've knocked as
much<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> material<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> upper<00:01:06.299> as

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
much of the material out of the upper as

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.350 
much of the material out of the upper as
possible<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.920> spiderweb<00:01:08.490> effect<00:01:09.090> allows

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
possible so this spiderweb effect allows

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.359 
possible so this spiderweb effect allows
us<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> take<00:01:09.960> structure<00:01:10.619> away<00:01:10.860> from<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> boot

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
us to take structure away from the boot

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.500 
us to take structure away from the boot
except<00:01:11.790> where<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.090> needed

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
except where it's needed

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.929 
except where it's needed
we<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> boot<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.740> weighs<00:01:13.939> 2400

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
we have a boot here that weighs 2400

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.249 
we have a boot here that weighs 2400
grams<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> boot<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.110> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
grams and we have a boot here that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
grams and we have a boot here that
weighs<00:01:16.460> 1100<00:01:17.460> grams<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.509> half<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
weighs 1100 grams so this is half the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.510 
weighs 1100 grams so this is half the
weight<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.439> than<00:01:19.500> half<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> weight<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.250> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
