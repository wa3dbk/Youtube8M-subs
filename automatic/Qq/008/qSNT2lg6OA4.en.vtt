00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.979
 even the lenovo sealing 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.520
 on this other side nothing important at all 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.910
 interesting to turn the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.910
 notebook 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:39.590
 so folks 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:49.810
 You can see here comes to my case the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:49.810
 battery him for instruction manuals 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:11.300

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:24.520
 power cord and the cable is here 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:24.520
 with the charger and here 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.880
 tavinho gatti is not new at home either 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.190
 is here 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.240
 a final shock 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:24.530
 as you can see right attack 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.860
 in the back he has time that does not 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.590
 texture means getting good 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:35.140
 isaac but then the structure 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.140
 cool that the symbol of lenovo 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:47.450
 a fight he 14 inch screen 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.450
 or tomorrow 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:05:08.130
 Like your webcam's built-in your keyboard 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:12.590
 has a cool touch on either sticker or with 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.590
 the information he has 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:23.510
 asks 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:23.510
 then I'll do it on the review 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.240
 sides backgrounds 70 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.030
 here you can see that he has 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.230
 in the case of what would be the feeding or 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.230
 so I think this is the lock of 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.140
 safety if I mistake or you're 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.630
 Of course this is not the case here. 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:58.010
 The feeding 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:59.000
 Here it is to a VGA port a port 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:05.390

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:09.160
 there is here in case it would be an hdmi two 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.160
 usb outputs 3.0 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:22.040
 on the other side it has a handset output 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:24.470
 and microphone in case le are both in 1 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.100
 in the case of secretaries to a microphone and 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:32.360
 an iphone or any other headset. 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:36.220
 mobile phone that has a microphone and the receiver 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:39.860
 same exit 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:49.060

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:54.470
 usb 2.0 memory card and here is the 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.360

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.470

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.710

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.840

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:34.550

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:37.120
