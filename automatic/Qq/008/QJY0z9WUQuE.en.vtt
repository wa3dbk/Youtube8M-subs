amazingly enough some controversy out
there<00:00:22.020> about<00:00:22.140> whether<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.650> forward<00:00:23.519> position

ridiculous<00:00:53.550> rule<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.660> well<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> course<00:00:55.199> we'll

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
ridiculous rule and well of course we'll

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.590 
ridiculous rule and well of course we'll
see<00:00:56.100> why<00:00:56.309> here<00:00:56.640> let's<00:00:56.850> start<00:00:57.000> off<00:00:57.270> by<00:00:57.300> looking

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
see why here let's start off by looking

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
see why here let's start off by looking
at<00:00:58.460> Tyler<00:00:59.460> Farrar<00:00:59.670> here<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.829> we<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:02.010> plot<00:01:02.489> if

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
at Tyler Farrar here and we can plot if

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.729 
at Tyler Farrar here and we can plot if
we<00:01:03.359> plot<00:01:03.629> where<00:01:03.809> his<00:01:03.930> sit<00:01:04.170> bones<00:01:04.559> are

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
we plot where his sit bones are

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.270 
we plot where his sit bones are
approximately<00:01:05.960> we're<00:01:06.960> getting<00:01:07.350> his

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
approximately we're getting his

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.000 
approximately we're getting his
effective<00:01:08.820> seat<00:01:09.030> angle<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:11.270> 79<00:01:12.270> 80<00:01:12.570> degrees<00:01:13.010> so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
effective seat angle at 79 80 degrees so

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
effective seat angle at 79 80 degrees so
very<00:01:14.310> steep<00:01:14.700> typical<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:16.040> triathlon

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
very steep typical of a triathlon

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.719 
very steep typical of a triathlon
position<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
position and but we see to do that that

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
position and but we see to do that that
he's<00:01:20.909> got<00:01:21.119> himself<00:01:21.299> slid<00:01:22.259> forward<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
he's got himself slid forward on a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.390 
he's got himself slid forward on a
saddle<00:01:23.250> maybe<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.610> much<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:23.970> 10<00:01:24.180> centimeters

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
saddle maybe as much as 10 centimeters

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
forward he can have the saddle so it's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.200 
forward he can have the saddle so it's
it's<00:01:36.420> clear<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.920> looking<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.850> rider

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
proper saddle height and knee angle when

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
proper saddle height and knee angle when
they're<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.530> forward<00:02:10.920> position<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:12.270> he's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
they're in this forward position if he's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.820 
they're in this forward position if he's
sliding<00:02:13.080> forward<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
sliding forward on the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.560 
sliding forward on the
saddle<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:14.250> much<00:02:14.460> as<00:02:14.610> ten<00:02:14.820> centimeters<00:02:15.390> his

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
saddle as much as ten centimeters his

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.120 
saddle as much as ten centimeters his
saddle<00:02:15.960> heights<00:02:16.140> dropping<00:02:16.650> by<00:02:16.800> as<00:02:16.920> much<00:02:17.070> as

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
saddle heights dropping by as much as

saddle heights dropping by as much as
three<00:02:17.460> centimeters<00:02:18.120> relative<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.170> his<00:02:19.290> normal

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
three centimeters relative to his normal

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.490 
three centimeters relative to his normal
seating<00:02:20.520> position<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.570> look<00:02:21.840> at<00:02:21.990> several

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
seating position and I look at several

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.080 
seating position and I look at several
these<00:02:22.740> riders<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.280> appears<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.640> some<00:02:23.970> of

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
these riders it appears that some of

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.790 
these riders it appears that some of
them<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.300> compensate<00:02:24.900> for<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.170> Tyler<00:02:25.530> being

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
them to compensate for this Tyler being

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.640 
them to compensate for this Tyler being
one<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.070> them<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.430> think<00:02:27.390> his<00:02:27.600> his<00:02:28.260> knee<00:02:28.470> angle

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
one of them I think his his knee angle

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.470 
one of them I think his his knee angle
is<00:02:28.950> good<00:02:29.220> his<00:02:29.460> saddle<00:02:29.820> height<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> good<00:02:30.270> in

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
is good his saddle height is good in

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.990 
is good his saddle height is good in
this<00:02:30.570> forward<00:02:30.900> position<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:32.520> some<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.910> them

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
this forward position but some of them

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.200 
this forward position but some of them
look<00:02:33.240> very<00:02:33.960> low<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.010> me<00:02:35.250> when<00:02:35.520> they're<00:02:35.700> when

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
look very low to me when they're when

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.490 
look very low to me when they're when
they<00:02:36.270> pulled<00:02:36.540> himself<00:02:36.690> forward<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
they pulled himself forward on the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.310 
they pulled himself forward on the
saddle<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.730> gives<00:02:39.180> them<00:02:39.300> complete<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
saddle so that gives them complete the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.770 
saddle so that gives them complete the
conundrum<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:42.060> know<00:02:42.180> do<00:02:42.360> they<00:02:42.510> set

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
conundrum of you know do they set

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.380 
conundrum of you know do they set
themselves<00:02:42.990> up<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.710> be<00:02:44.490> at<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> optimal<00:02:45.240> knee

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
themselves up to be at the optimal knee

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
sitting forward on the saddle let's

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.890 
sitting forward on the saddle let's
let's<00:02:49.410> look<00:02:49.530> at<00:02:49.620> some<00:02:49.770> other<00:02:49.860> riders<00:02:50.720> can<00:02:51.720> look

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
let's look at some other riders can look

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.560 
let's look at some other riders can look
at<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.320> floyd<00:02:53.130> landis<00:02:53.370> year<00:02:53.970> who<00:02:54.180> didn't

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
at that floyd landis year who didn't

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.430 
at that floyd landis year who didn't
have<00:02:54.860> hasn't<00:02:55.860> had<00:02:56.100> great<00:02:56.340> results<00:02:56.959> this<00:02:57.959> tour

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
have hasn't had great results this tour

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.860 
have hasn't had great results this tour
his<00:02:59.040> time<00:02:59.340> trials<00:02:59.700> have<00:02:59.790> been<00:02:59.820> frankly<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.540> bit

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
his time trials have been frankly a bit

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.520 
his time trials have been frankly a bit
disappointing<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.860> think<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:03.140> if<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.260> look<00:03:04.440> at

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
disappointing I think and if we look at

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.710 
disappointing I think and if we look at
his<00:03:04.680> position<00:03:04.920> though<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.180> see<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.600> know

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
his position though we can see you know

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.480 
his position though we can see you know
everything<00:03:07.110> arrow<00:03:07.500> wise<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.040> looks<00:03:08.190> quite

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
everything arrow wise it looks quite

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.690 
everything arrow wise it looks quite
good<00:03:08.790> we<00:03:09.000> could<00:03:09.120> also<00:03:09.300> see<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:10.700> once

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
good we could also see that that once

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.830 
good we could also see that that once
again<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:12.390> we<00:03:13.110> plot<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.680> position<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.520> his

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
again if we plot the position of his

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.240 
again if we plot the position of his
proximate<00:03:15.840> position<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.350> sit<00:03:16.620> bones<00:03:16.890> that

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
proximate position of a sit bones that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.759 
proximate position of a sit bones that
he<00:03:17.910> also<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.780> sitting<00:03:19.050> somewhere<00:03:19.230> around<00:03:19.470> 80

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
he also is sitting somewhere around 80

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.710 
he also is sitting somewhere around 80
81<00:03:20.130> degrees<00:03:20.580> we<00:03:21.269> take<00:03:21.480> into<00:03:21.660> consideration

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
81 degrees we take into consideration

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.240 
81 degrees we take into consideration
the<00:03:22.500> fact<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.360> bike<00:03:25.070> might<00:03:26.070> be

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the fact that the the bike might be

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.280 
the fact that the the bike might be
tilted<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.760> your<00:03:26.910> nods<00:03:27.090> it's<00:03:27.450> close<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.019> level

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
tilted to your nods it's close to level

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.170 
tilted to your nods it's close to level
might<00:03:28.560> be<00:03:28.590> tilted<00:03:29.070> up<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.250> degree<00:03:29.519> or<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:29.880> so

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
might be tilted up a degree or so so

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.000 
might be tilted up a degree or so so
he's<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.019> even<00:03:31.380> sitting<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.739> degree

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
he's really even sitting a degree

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.900 
he's really even sitting a degree
steeper<00:03:32.459> than<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:35.040> once<00:03:35.280> again<00:03:35.400> we<00:03:35.730> see

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
steeper than that so once again we see

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.449 
steeper than that so once again we see
him<00:03:36.000> sitting<00:03:36.330> at<00:03:36.390> 81<00:03:36.570> degrees<00:03:36.860> we<00:03:37.860> also<00:03:38.070> see

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
him sitting at 81 degrees we also see

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.759 
him sitting at 81 degrees we also see
that<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.880> he's<00:03:39.330> forward<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> saddle

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
that that he's forward on the saddle

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.690 
that that he's forward on the saddle
again<00:03:41.730> maybe<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.989> know<00:03:43.080> 7<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.860> 10<00:03:44.070> centimeters

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
again maybe you know 7 to 10 centimeters

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.729 
again maybe you know 7 to 10 centimeters
so<00:03:44.970> again<00:03:45.239> lowering<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.750> saddle<00:03:46.170> height<00:03:46.320> 2<00:03:46.590> or

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
so again lowering the saddle height 2 or

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.270 
so again lowering the saddle height 2 or
3<00:03:46.980> centimeters<00:03:47.340> now<00:03:48.000> Ford<00:03:48.330> is<00:03:48.540> actually<00:03:49.280> one

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
3 centimeters now Ford is actually one

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.310 
3 centimeters now Ford is actually one
who<00:03:50.489> appears<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.880> have<00:03:51.060> gone<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:52.170> other

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
who appears to have gone the other

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.410 
who appears to have gone the other
direction<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.400> even<00:03:53.880> looks<00:03:54.030> too<00:03:54.239> high

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
direction that that even looks too high

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.620 
direction that that even looks too high
to<00:03:54.480> me<00:03:54.750> on<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.590> saddle<00:03:56.100> when<00:03:56.370> he's<00:03:56.489> when<00:03:57.360> he's<00:03:57.480> up

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
to me on a saddle when he's when he's up

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.060 
to me on a saddle when he's when he's up
here<00:03:57.810> on<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.019> nose<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:58.560> can<00:03:58.709> especially

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
here on the nose and you can especially

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.970 
here on the nose and you can especially
see<00:03:59.340> how<00:04:00.269> how<00:04:00.780> darn<00:04:01.080> high<00:04:01.320> he<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.620> when<00:04:01.920> he

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
see how how darn high he is when he

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.550 
see how how darn high he is when he
slides<00:04:02.310> back<00:04:02.430> on<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:02.910> saddle<00:04:03.300> here<00:04:03.540> here<00:04:04.290> he

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
slides back on the saddle here here he

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.030 
slides back on the saddle here here he
is<00:04:05.180> sitting<00:04:06.180> he<00:04:06.660> slim<00:04:07.019> self<00:04:07.350> back<00:04:07.620> into<00:04:07.950> the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
is sitting he slim self back into the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.490 
is sitting he slim self back into the
normal<00:04:08.459> position<00:04:09.209> for<00:04:09.780> whatever<00:04:09.930> reason

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
normal position for whatever reason

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.380 
normal position for whatever reason
maybe<00:04:11.040> just<00:04:11.310> saddle<00:04:11.670> comfort<00:04:12.060> or<00:04:12.120> whatever

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
maybe just saddle comfort or whatever

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.050 
maybe just saddle comfort or whatever
here<00:04:12.750> temporarily<00:04:13.680> we<00:04:14.280> can<00:04:14.459> see<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.760> his<00:04:14.820> leg

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
here temporarily we can see that his leg

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.960 
here temporarily we can see that his leg
is<00:04:15.239> almost<00:04:15.390> fully<00:04:15.750> extended<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.880> know

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
is almost fully extended so you know

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.659 
is almost fully extended so you know
back<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.510> he's<00:04:18.630> clearly<00:04:19.019> too<00:04:19.290> high<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.799> up

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
back here he's clearly too high and up

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.480 
back here he's clearly too high and up
in<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.970> front<00:04:21.209> he<00:04:21.870> buy<00:04:22.560> all<00:04:22.740> my<00:04:22.770> measures<00:04:23.310> he

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
in the front he buy all my measures he

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.820 
in the front he buy all my measures he
stole<00:04:23.880> too<00:04:24.539> high<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:25.380> that<00:04:25.560> might<00:04:25.740> have

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
stole too high so that might have

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.350 
stole too high so that might have
something<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.130> do<00:04:26.280> with<00:04:26.310> his

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
something to do with his

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.600 
something to do with his
with<00:04:27.960> his<00:04:28.110> fairly<00:04:28.500> poor<00:04:28.710> results<00:04:29.220> but<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.490> any

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
with his fairly poor results but in any

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.860 
with his fairly poor results but in any
case<00:04:29.849> we<00:04:30.030> can<00:04:30.180> see<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.419> he<00:04:30.539> is<00:04:30.659> sitting

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
case we can see that he is sitting

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.649 
case we can see that he is sitting
buried<00:04:31.319> forward<00:04:31.939> something<00:04:32.939> in<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.330> 80

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
buried forward something in the 80

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.279 
buried forward something in the 80
degree<00:04:33.840> plus<00:04:34.259> range<00:04:35.090> let's<00:04:36.090> look<00:04:36.300> at<00:04:36.449> David

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
degree plus range let's look at David

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.790 
degree plus range let's look at David
Zabriskie<00:04:37.800> in<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.159> Subang<00:04:39.080> time<00:04:40.080> trial<00:04:40.439> here

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
Zabriskie in the Subang time trial here

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.999 
Zabriskie in the Subang time trial here
and<00:04:41.509> same<00:04:42.509> thing<00:04:42.539> obviously<00:04:42.960> pulled<00:04:43.530> very<00:04:43.680> far

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
and same thing obviously pulled very far

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.670 
and same thing obviously pulled very far
forward<00:04:44.370> on<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.550> saddle<00:04:45.020> we<00:04:46.020> were<00:04:46.469> a<00:04:46.500> little

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
forward on the saddle we were a little

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.429 
forward on the saddle we were a little
behind<00:04:46.860> him<00:04:47.340> here<00:04:47.699> so<00:04:48.569> that's<00:04:48.780> gonna<00:04:48.930> change

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
behind him here so that's gonna change

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.850 
behind him here so that's gonna change
the<00:04:49.590> angle<00:04:50.009> slightly<00:04:50.490> but<00:04:51.120> clearly<00:04:51.860> I've

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
the angle slightly but clearly I've

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.200 
the angle slightly but clearly I've
plotted<00:04:53.099> them<00:04:53.340> before<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:53.939> this<00:04:54.060> is

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
plotted them before and this is

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.059 
plotted them before and this is
typically<00:04:54.599> he's<00:04:54.840> sitting<00:04:55.199> you<00:04:55.710> know<00:04:55.740> well

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
typically he's sitting you know well

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.540 
typically he's sitting you know well
over<00:04:56.370> 80<00:04:56.520> degrees<00:04:57.259> super<00:04:58.259> far<00:04:58.469> forward<00:04:58.979> to

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
over 80 degrees super far forward to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.520 
over 80 degrees super far forward to
accommodate<00:05:00.060> his<00:05:00.210> very<00:05:00.569> low<00:05:00.810> position<00:05:01.050> in<00:05:01.440> the

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
accommodate his very low position in the

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.779 
accommodate his very low position in the
front<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.210> know<00:05:03.300> we<00:05:03.449> could<00:05:03.599> plot<00:05:03.810> him<00:05:04.050> that

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
front so you know we could plot him that

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.320 
front so you know we could plot him that
certainly<00:05:05.789> north<00:05:06.060> of<00:05:06.240> 80<00:05:06.389> degrees<00:05:07.069> 83<00:05:08.120> 84<00:05:09.120> and

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
certainly north of 80 degrees 83 84 and

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.779 
certainly north of 80 degrees 83 84 and
you<00:05:09.389> also<00:05:09.539> get<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.289> feeling<00:05:10.710> here<00:05:11.039> it<00:05:11.520> looks

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
you also get the feeling here it looks

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.760 
you also get the feeling here it looks
like<00:05:11.879> that<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.360> bike<00:05:12.810> has<00:05:12.990> actually<00:05:13.349> tilted

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
like that the bike has actually tilted

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.980 
like that the bike has actually tilted
up<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:13.979> few<00:05:14.219> degrees<00:05:14.310> so<00:05:14.819> he's<00:05:15.539> probably

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
up a few degrees so he's probably

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.510 
up a few degrees so he's probably
sitting<00:05:16.289> even<00:05:16.620> steeper<00:05:16.860> than<00:05:17.129> that<00:05:17.280> when<00:05:17.460> we

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
sitting even steeper than that when we

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.290 
sitting even steeper than that when we
get<00:05:17.669> right<00:05:17.849> down<00:05:17.909> to<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:18.650> so<00:05:19.650> it's<00:05:19.949> it's

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
get right down to it so it's it's

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.180 
get right down to it so it's it's
extremely<00:05:21.300> forward<00:05:21.960> once<00:05:22.139> again<00:05:22.469> probably

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
extremely forward once again probably

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.010 
extremely forward once again probably
got<00:05:23.310> 10<00:05:23.669> centimeters<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.360> saddle<00:05:24.690> sticking

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
got 10 centimeters of saddle sticking

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.110 
got 10 centimeters of saddle sticking
out<00:05:25.139> behind<00:05:25.409> him<00:05:25.819> so<00:05:28.250> clearly<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.490> clearly<00:05:30.029> an

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
out behind him so clearly and clearly an

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.409 
out behind him so clearly and clearly an
issue<00:05:30.240> he's<00:05:30.870> one<00:05:31.139> who<00:05:31.319> has<00:05:31.680> also<00:05:32.340> adjusted<00:05:33.240> so

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
issue he's one who has also adjusted so

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.080 
issue he's one who has also adjusted so
that<00:05:33.449> his<00:05:33.840> saddle<00:05:34.319> height<00:05:34.469> is<00:05:34.620> proper<00:05:35.069> when<00:05:35.279> he

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
that his saddle height is proper when he

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.469 
that his saddle height is proper when he
is<00:05:36.469> in<00:05:37.469> this<00:05:37.770> forward<00:05:38.039> position<00:05:38.610> so<00:05:38.819> it's<00:05:39.060> when

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
is in this forward position so it's when

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.059 
is in this forward position so it's when
he<00:05:39.539> sits<00:05:39.810> back<00:05:40.020> it's<00:05:40.289> gonna<00:05:40.409> be<00:05:40.590> quite<00:05:40.860> high

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
he sits back it's gonna be quite high

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.779 
he sits back it's gonna be quite high
for<00:05:41.430> him<00:05:42.289> we<00:05:43.289> can<00:05:43.440> see<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.770> other<00:05:43.889> trim<00:05:44.520> that

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
for him we can see the other trim that

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.420 
for him we can see the other trim that
these<00:05:44.940> guys<00:05:45.180> were<00:05:45.479> all<00:05:45.509> showing<00:05:45.930> here<00:05:46.430> for

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
these guys were all showing here for

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.800 
these guys were all showing here for
these<00:05:47.550> short<00:05:47.789> time<00:05:48.120> Charles<00:05:48.479> remember<00:05:48.719> the

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
these short time Charles remember the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.269 
these short time Charles remember the
longest<00:05:49.139> one<00:05:49.229> only<00:05:49.349> took<00:05:49.560> him<00:05:49.680> about<00:05:49.800> half<00:05:50.129> an

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
longest one only took him about half an

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.850 
longest one only took him about half an
hour<00:05:50.400> and<00:05:51.060> that<00:05:51.210> is<00:05:51.389> the<00:05:51.509> elbows<00:05:51.900> jammed

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
hour and that is the elbows jammed

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.019 
hour and that is the elbows jammed
together<00:05:53.479> and<00:05:54.479> the<00:05:55.460> putting<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.610> head<00:05:56.789> down

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
together and the putting the head down

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:58.939 
together and the putting the head down
in<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.300> hands<00:05:57.539> they're<00:05:57.960> all<00:05:58.289> their<00:05:58.560> hands<00:05:58.770> up

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
in the hands they're all their hands up

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.700 
in the hands they're all their hands up
I<00:05:59.069> think<00:05:59.129> as<00:05:59.400> high<00:05:59.580> as<00:05:59.759> the<00:05:59.909> UCI<00:06:00.569> another<00:06:01.469> great

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
I think as high as the UCI another great

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.950 
I think as high as the UCI another great
UCI<00:06:02.099> rule<00:06:02.430> allows<00:06:03.000> him<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.270> put<00:06:03.479> their<00:06:03.629> hands

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
UCI rule allows him to put their hands

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.129 
UCI rule allows him to put their hands
up<00:06:04.050> here<00:06:04.259> so<00:06:04.620> they<00:06:05.520> are<00:06:05.849> sticking<00:06:06.750> their<00:06:06.960> head

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
up here so they are sticking their head

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.499 
up here so they are sticking their head
down<00:06:07.430> their<00:06:08.430> face<00:06:08.639> down<00:06:08.909> their<00:06:09.120> arms<00:06:09.389> as<00:06:09.479> much

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
down their face down their arms as much

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.399 
down their face down their arms as much
as<00:06:09.839> possible<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.639> to<00:06:11.639> close<00:06:12.629> this<00:06:12.870> off<00:06:13.080> and

as possible to to close this off and

the slope of the road so again very

steep slid forward on the saddle

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.800 
steep slid forward on the saddle
he's<00:06:51.480> got<00:06:52.310> certainly<00:06:53.360> six<00:06:54.360> seven<00:06:54.690> eight

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
he's got certainly six seven eight

he's got certainly six seven eight

behind<00:06:56.640> him<00:06:56.820> we<00:06:57.690> advise<00:06:57.930> one<00:06:58.170> worse<00:06:58.350> where<00:06:58.770> he

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
behind him we advise one worse where he

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.650 
behind him we advise one worse where he
actually<00:06:59.010> looks<00:06:59.280> a<00:06:59.370> little<00:06:59.460> bit<00:06:59.670> low<00:06:59.880> in<00:07:00.180> his

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
actually looks a little bit low in his

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.000 
actually looks a little bit low in his
forward<00:07:00.990> position<00:07:01.410> but<00:07:01.560> every<00:07:01.740> time<00:07:01.860> I've

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
forward position but every time I've

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.710 
forward position but every time I've
looked<00:07:02.220> at<00:07:02.370> I<00:07:02.400> mean<00:07:02.580> he<00:07:02.790> looks<00:07:03.000> a<00:07:03.240> little<00:07:03.450> bit

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
looked at I mean he looks a little bit

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.310 
looked at I mean he looks a little bit
low<00:07:04.440> so<00:07:04.800> that<00:07:04.830> may<00:07:05.220> be<00:07:05.840> just<00:07:06.840> the<00:07:06.900> way<00:07:07.110> he

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
low so that may be just the way he

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.660 
low so that may be just the way he
prefers<00:07:07.650> to<00:07:07.680> ride<00:07:08.070> but<00:07:08.670> clearly<00:07:10.580> you<00:07:11.580> know

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:11.670 
prefers to ride but clearly you know

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.610 
prefers to ride but clearly you know
very<00:07:11.970> very<00:07:12.060> fork<00:07:12.720> position<00:07:13.170> so<00:07:13.350> there<00:07:13.500> really

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
very very fork position so there really

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.440 
very very fork position so there really
shouldn't<00:07:13.920> be<00:07:14.040> any<00:07:14.100> controversy<00:07:14.910> as<00:07:15.030> far<00:07:15.270> as

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.450 
shouldn't be any controversy as far as

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.590 
shouldn't be any controversy as far as
as<00:07:15.950> whether<00:07:16.950> a<00:07:17.010> four<00:07:17.370> position<00:07:17.610> is<00:07:18.060> effective

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
as whether a four position is effective

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.520 
as whether a four position is effective
or<00:07:18.810> the<00:07:19.230> most<00:07:19.410> effective<00:07:19.740> position<00:07:20.210> in<00:07:21.210> in<00:07:22.020> in

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
or the most effective position in in in

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.280 
or the most effective position in in in
a<00:07:22.680> time<00:07:22.890> trial
