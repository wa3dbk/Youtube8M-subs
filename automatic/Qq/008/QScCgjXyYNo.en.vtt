what these are here see what you guys it
might<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.240> more

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.910 

where<00:01:26.500> they<00:01:26.740> are

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.190 

now<00:01:33.490> that's<00:01:33.700> not<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.939> large<00:01:34.299> box<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.960> kind<00:01:35.140> of

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
now that's not a large box it kind of

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.609 
now that's not a large box it kind of
looks<00:01:38.130> maybe<00:01:39.130> looks<00:01:39.430> large<00:01:39.729> in<00:01:40.720> context<00:01:41.530> to

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
looks maybe looks large in context to

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.310 
looks maybe looks large in context to
this<00:01:41.770> but<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:43.450> not<00:01:43.720> it's<00:01:44.020> probably

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
this but that it's not it's probably

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.190 
this but that it's not it's probably
about<00:01:44.850> 10<00:01:45.850> inches<00:01:45.880> wide

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.410 

all<00:02:04.750> right<00:02:04.930> there's<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.290> good<00:02:05.500> look<00:02:05.740> at<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:09.420> what

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
all right there's a good look at so what

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.450 
all right there's a good look at so what
do<00:02:10.479> we<00:02:10.509> think<00:02:10.660> those<00:02:11.080> are<00:02:11.320> those<00:02:11.920> definitely

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
do we think those are those definitely
