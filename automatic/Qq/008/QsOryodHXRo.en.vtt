00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello friends with you Anton 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.879
 Dyachenko 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.970
 and in this video we will 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:14.750
 reflash to asus rt n10 router 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:19.170
 e so first download the firmware itself 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:25.830
 we will come on the web interface of the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.930
 router me this is 192 168 11 this address 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.770
 by default, that is, if you have not changed 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:38.370
 then come in both of them 100 so usually there 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.230
 another window asking for input 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.300
 login and password 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 that is, you enter the username and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.289
 password if you have not changed anything then this 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.350
 admin admin 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.039
 if something changed there shook 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 point to 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.300
 more data then click here by 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.690
 this link 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.180
 firmware version further check 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.369
 availability version number of firmware on 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:12.090
 crawled out asus throws us right on 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.869
 Mazda page our equipment we 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.390
 we choose in principle for updating 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.920
 firmware can be anything we choose 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:29.490
 the actual operating system choose 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.009
 figure in the film and choose the most 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 last or rather the very first simply 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.640
 firmware 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.150
 she will be fresh herself to ask and you can 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:45.380
 see 1 point and download for example 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.380
 on the desktop 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:02:01.860
 that's it 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:08.660
 have downloaded times and take them here it is ours 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:13.290
 Our firmware file is now back and 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.730
 back we get our web interface 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.069
 router and so before you start 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.090
 reflash i usually do the following i 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.380
 turn off 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:29.660
 router take out all the connectors 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.930
 leaving only the power connector and connector 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.970
 connect by lan with my computer then 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.150
 have with this computer from which 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.260
 yasak will sew here everything else 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.170
 cable 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.660
 you if you have that is b 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 devices are connected all take out 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:57.570
 then turn on the router wait 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.269
 wait a minute for it to load 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:06.200
 it is advisable to reset the settings to 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.200
 factory done this by pressing on 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:18.150
 reset button on the back 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:23.000
 give the router this is it here we pinch 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:27.510
 let's say a clip or a nail for 10 and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.019
 settings are reset to factory settings. 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.799
 there must be some kind of non-standard 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:41.880
 indication that is my case usually 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:44.640
 flashing diode gps connection it means 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.140
 that the modem router is reset and you can 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.230
 let it go once 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.570
 let's start let it boot to the end then 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.220
 there is still about seconds principle we go for 100 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.360
 how let go 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.650
 then it grows and can sew sew 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.770
 in the following way 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.770
 click on 5 here you have the version 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:16.650
 firmware here click select file 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:19.660
 on the desktop we find our daddy 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.660
 awesome here the folder with files 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.550
 choose a file with the extension Tirex 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:31.800
 waiting to open click send here this 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.690
 the very moment the file is loading here it is 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.270
 at this very moment should not be 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.450
 no voltage spikes that is 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.310
 therefore it is desirable to connect a router and 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.980
 computer through uninterruptible power supply 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.400
 power supply 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.550
 so as not to complicate yourself not to look for yourself 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.550
 Adventure 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:04.520
 when the firmware comes to an end 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:07.100
 the rotor should reboot itself 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.560
 principle still the firmware is over it 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.260
 ended successfully here you are 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.180
 check that the firmware was 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.390
 corresponding to which was stitched 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.570
 here then recommended again with 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:23.620
 using the reset button reset 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:28.460
 factory settings 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.100
 set up internet set up 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.530
 router 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.890
 overload it and basically im 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.300
 enjoy all thanks for your attention with 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.620
 you was Anton Dyachenko 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.620
 see you in the next videos
