00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.740
 The Hall and FDP have been in the life of one of the best five minutes 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.169
 I also do not regret the track's position 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.499
 as you can see 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:17.220
 you can switch 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 between God and man between both forms and as the case may be 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.900
 what changes do you make 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.179
 it will work for both characters as well 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.800
 appropriate 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.030
 So you have to make the comparison even worse 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.510
 Eigenmann both ladies are still a few small ethical issues 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.950
 are integrated 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.110
 he looks pretty good 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.110
 his face still warm 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.220
 there nobody Gerd 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.680
 the tester deep valley in Sendling 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.710
 Dr 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.200
 Ludger Tholen Werder is not bad 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.200
 so, let's go 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.590
 for him not the straight way 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.790
 and the proud people of Gilnea once sided with the Alliance of 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.259
 horrible skin that clearly wanted to subdue the enormous 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.770
 The kingdom considers one in the chaotic years after the second 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.010
 War Schott he would have increasingly off 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.500
 of mistrust 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.280
 The many more built a mighty fall along the borders 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 and locked their action and their hearts 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 from the all-wise dark world 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.990
 many years later 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.539
 marches the seemingly unstoppable and death of the Scourge by Nordhorn 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
 Humanity is facing a new burnt out 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.600
 approaching in May 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.710
 Sing the Kenyan citizens of a fertile pollen fly 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.570
 the one mighty tree 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 the un-troops do not hold back much longer 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.499
 and worse 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.299
 There are rumors of even greater danger within this East 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.650
 Limits Gigabyte MSI have been gorgeous 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.699
 Although people are upright 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.709
 we had eyewitnesses between 5 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.169
 it will be a good keyword here 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.429
 we're about to see the first quest IV, we're still a human 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.809
 a speaker Kai Wolf still no word Univ 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.169
 on 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.540
 after the 4 4 ​​against the terror and we have to clear what's really going on 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.209
 first send us hans-thorben Rüder 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.959
 be after 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.959
 under the Deloitte and Wildon discomfort 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:44.519
 as a clown traces 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.029
 both clubs have now found out 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.029
 always right back and the strong report 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.879
 Something is wrong 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.879
 and that is already the first groups on the way ll 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.799
 meanwhile, firmly kill Broch 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.369
 St 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.289
 free a few locals 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:19.659
 the commissure Thylander afterward moves doors open 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.319
 Frankfurt we come after answer 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.009
 very often immediately moved again 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.769
 we felt we belonged together 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.109
 Now we have to continue 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.139
 yes sure Brussels in the loft of human life to protect itself with 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.139
 Betting on rising loads that is against it 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.989
 the homepage of the Scuderia in Hallein, too, that the sheets just a 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.299
 bit with while in the next field whether the round 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.609
 our bullets came to highlight the latest Kate Hudson one 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:10.129
 he managed to stop 2 minutes giving the paper 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.429
 Kerpen and that is already on 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.919
 Now come the interesting quests that are being asked by one 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.900
 this will be relatively fateful for us afterwards 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.460
 and now it starts in the city to be overrun by the hordes 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460
 with the first quests on a horse 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.979
 we have to Neukirchen 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.020
 but relatively easy to just press the button of the second need 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.550
 we do not 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.069
 here just as Zetsche further neat one again a few were on and 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.069
 have to pull 50 pieces in total behind 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.740
 And finally, more and more communities are closing 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.740
 that was a lot of fun for Merz 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.309
 and then 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:02.430
 There are no games that are unfortunately not available in the us 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.680
 Seidel has been transformed 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.860
 but not 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.870
 there are 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.870
 in a small town Dr 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.209
 Fortunately House and Dance did not kill 1 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.949
 just like the protocol 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.210
 we cut short 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.240
 Jänicke who lived in the city so that we could survive 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.599
 they followed the protocol 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.259
 there I am, I thought to myself this day Greta Arn 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.610
 and doubles the dosage 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.070
 So on the carpet this will have to survive playfully 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.839
 to be addressed 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:55.389
 Kring also the St I would have stormed the problem now immediately 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.389
 out 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.150
 the dress 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.970
 the Wars and thanks for watching
