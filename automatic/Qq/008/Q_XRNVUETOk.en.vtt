seen is that the grenade launcher I

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.009 
seen is that the grenade launcher I

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
think from Hale overreach that's for the

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.050 
think from Hale overreach that's for the
awesome<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.909> says<00:03:29.909> pack<00:03:30.379> we<00:03:31.379> got<00:03:31.909> what<00:03:32.909> I<00:03:32.940> like

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
to get the elite I think or the soldier

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.699 
to get the elite I think or the soldier
would<00:03:38.549> be<00:03:38.669> quite<00:03:38.879> cool<00:03:39.060> or<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.629> don't<00:03:40.260> know<00:03:40.530> if

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
up we have the operator Spartan here

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.210 
up we have the operator Spartan here
as<00:04:22.430> you<00:04:22.580> can<00:04:22.700> see<00:04:22.850> he's<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.030> green<00:04:24.100> sort<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.160> a

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
as you can see he's in green sort of a

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.030 
as you can see he's in green sort of a
marshy<00:04:25.670> green<00:04:25.940> color<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.990> he<00:04:27.320> comes<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
marshy green color and he comes with the

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.120 
marshy green color and he comes with the
scattershot<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.990> really<00:04:30.740> like<00:04:30.830> this<00:04:30.920> figure

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
scattershot I really like this figure

scattershot I really like this figure
actually<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.490> think<00:04:31.610> maybe<00:04:31.880> I've<00:04:32.030> done<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.180> great

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
actually I think maybe I've done a great

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.020 
actually I think maybe I've done a great
job<00:04:32.540> with<00:04:32.900> him<00:04:33.050> very<00:04:33.710> realistic<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.550> what<00:04:34.910> he

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
job with him very realistic to what he

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.560 
job with him very realistic to what he
looks<00:04:35.210> like<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.570> game<00:04:36.370> just<00:04:37.570> another

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
looks like in the game just another

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.390 
looks like in the game just another
really<00:04:38.840> great<00:04:38.930> figure<00:04:39.260> by<00:04:39.350> them<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.740> um

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
really great figure by them and um

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.270 
really great figure by them and um
there's<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.270> code<00:04:41.570> if<00:04:41.840> anyone<00:04:42.230> if<00:04:42.830> my<00:04:43.010> camera

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
there's a code if anyone if my camera

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.710 
there's a code if anyone if my camera
would<00:04:43.370> focus

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.270 

yeah<00:04:47.860> there's<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.980> code<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:49.430> wants<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.000> know

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
yeah there's the code and wants to know

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.130 
yeah there's the code and wants to know
so<00:04:52.280> yeah<00:04:52.490> so<00:04:53.090> he's<00:04:53.300> really<00:04:53.420> great<00:04:53.660> he's<00:04:53.960> one<00:04:54.110> of

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
so yeah so he's really great he's one of

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.500 
so yeah so he's really great he's one of
my<00:04:54.260> favorites<00:04:54.650> from<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:54.950> series<00:04:55.220> actually

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
my favorites from this series actually

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.980 
my favorites from this series actually
next<00:04:56.510> up<00:04:56.750> we<00:04:56.870> have<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.320> Promethean<00:04:57.920> watcher

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
next up we have the Promethean watcher

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.360 
next up we have the Promethean watcher
in<00:04:59.990> blue<00:05:00.290> this<00:05:00.500> time<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.740> think<00:05:00.890> this<00:05:01.130> is<00:05:01.250> the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
in blue this time I think this is the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.580 
in blue this time I think this is the
first<00:05:01.520> blue<00:05:01.760> one<00:05:01.940> they've<00:05:02.090> made<00:05:02.350> he's<00:05:03.350> really

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
first blue one they've made he's really

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.800 
first blue one they've made he's really
nice<00:05:03.740> as<00:05:03.890> well<00:05:04.210> obviously<00:05:05.210> exactly<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.630> same

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
nice as well obviously exactly the same

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.710 
nice as well obviously exactly the same
mold<00:05:06.050> as<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.770> other<00:05:07.520> Promethean<00:05:08.120> watches

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
mold as the other Promethean watches

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.060 
mold as the other Promethean watches
we've<00:05:08.870> seen<00:05:09.080> but<00:05:10.180> again<00:05:11.180> in<00:05:11.330> blue<00:05:11.620> so<00:05:12.620> he's

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
we've seen but again in blue so he's

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.900 
we've seen but again in blue so he's
white<00:05:13.250> cool

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
white cool

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.640 
white cool
not<00:05:14.419> many<00:05:14.570> it's<00:05:15.140> quite<00:05:15.320> hard<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.500> get

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
not many it's quite hard to get

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.890 
not many it's quite hard to get
Prometheans<00:05:16.190> at<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.370> moment<00:05:16.669> sets<00:05:16.910> so<00:05:17.180> it's

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
Prometheans at the moment sets so it's

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.060 
Prometheans at the moment sets so it's
probably<00:05:18.169> one<00:05:18.290> of<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.440> best<00:05:18.620> ways<00:05:18.770> to<00:05:18.800> get<00:05:19.010> the

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
probably one of the best ways to get the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.120 
probably one of the best ways to get the
watcher<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.490> guess<00:05:19.669> and<00:05:20.440> his<00:05:21.440> code<00:05:21.680> if<00:05:21.860> anyone

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
watcher I guess and his code if anyone

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:30.100 
watcher I guess and his code if anyone
wants<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.370> know<00:05:22.460> is<00:05:22.940> right<00:05:23.240> there<00:05:28.870> here<00:05:29.870> we

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
wants to know is right there here we

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.250 
wants to know is right there here we
have<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.650> covenant<00:05:31.640> storm<00:05:31.910> elite<00:05:32.090> I<00:05:32.360> really

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
have the covenant storm elite I really

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.170 
have the covenant storm elite I really
like<00:05:33.350> this<00:05:33.470> figure<00:05:33.710> um<00:05:33.980> other<00:05:34.460> than<00:05:34.580> one<00:05:34.880> thing

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
like this figure um other than one thing

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.969 
like this figure um other than one thing
I<00:05:35.390> would<00:05:36.050> just<00:05:36.080> say<00:05:36.290> I<00:05:36.410> don't<00:05:36.680> know<00:05:36.740> if<00:05:36.860> it's

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
I would just say I don't know if it's

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.250 
I would just say I don't know if it's
just<00:05:37.010> mine<00:05:37.280> but<00:05:37.540> personally<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.570> think<00:05:38.720> his

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
just mine but personally I think his

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.190 
just mine but personally I think his
head<00:05:39.560> looks<00:05:39.770> makes<00:05:40.070> him<00:05:40.190> look<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.340> bit<00:05:40.550> sort<00:05:40.760> of

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
head looks makes him look a bit sort of

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.159 
head looks makes him look a bit sort of
derpy<00:05:42.200> I<00:05:43.210> know<00:05:44.210> it's<00:05:44.360> just<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.570> eyes<00:05:44.750> maybe

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
derpy I know it's just the eyes maybe

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.219 
derpy I know it's just the eyes maybe
but<00:05:45.580> he<00:05:46.580> just<00:05:46.729> looks<00:05:46.880> a<00:05:46.970> little<00:05:47.000> bit<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:47.479> stupid

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
figure is the air assault I believe this

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.260

is<00:06:14.600> the<00:06:14.870> male<00:06:15.110> air<00:06:15.440> assault<00:06:15.740> an<00:06:16.190> air<00:06:17.000> assault

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
is the male air assault an air assault

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.870 
is the male air assault an air assault
sculpt<00:06:17.960> there's<00:06:18.950> been<00:06:19.070> lots<00:06:19.250> of<00:06:19.340> female<00:06:19.669> ones

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.700 
sculpt there's been lots of female ones
but<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.150> think<00:06:20.330> this<00:06:20.450> is<00:06:20.540> a<00:06:20.570> male<00:06:20.780> he<00:06:21.350> comes<00:06:21.560> with

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
but I think this is a male he comes with

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.080 
but I think this is a male he comes with
what<00:06:21.830> I<00:06:21.860> think<00:06:22.160> his<00:06:22.310> hailer<00:06:22.580> each<00:06:22.760> grenade

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
what I think his hailer each grenade

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.450 
what I think his hailer each grenade
launcher<00:06:23.650> he's<00:06:24.650> in<00:06:24.770> this<00:06:24.890> really<00:06:25.100> cool<00:06:25.250> sort

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
I'm the blue visor there but this is a

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.620 
I'm the blue visor there but this is a
really<00:06:31.070> cool<00:06:31.280> figure<00:06:31.580> actually<00:06:31.700> one<00:06:32.450> of<00:06:32.479> the

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
really cool figure actually one of the

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.959 
really cool figure actually one of the
rare<00:06:32.870> ones<00:06:32.900> and<00:06:33.320> there's

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:33.969 
rare ones and there's

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.959 
rare ones and there's
for<00:06:34.299> him<00:06:35.099> now

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:36.969 
for him now

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.149 
for him now
you'll<00:06:37.329> notice<00:06:37.599> that<00:06:37.749> the<00:06:38.079> figure<00:06:38.379> is<00:06:38.889> not

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159 
you'll notice that the figure is not

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.329 
you'll notice that the figure is not
assembled<00:06:39.719> and<00:06:40.719> that<00:06:40.899> is<00:06:41.019> the<00:06:41.259> orange<00:06:41.889> puzzle

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:42.339 
assembled and that is the orange puzzle

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.869 
assembled and that is the orange puzzle
and<00:06:42.699> that<00:06:42.759> is<00:06:42.999> because<00:06:44.309> after<00:06:45.309> I<00:06:45.519> put<00:06:45.669> the<00:06:45.729> head

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
and that is because after I put the head

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.249 
and that is because after I put the head
on<00:06:45.909> and<00:06:46.209> I<00:06:46.329> was<00:06:46.689> going<00:06:46.749> to<00:06:46.899> start<00:06:47.169> assembling

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:47.259 
on and I was going to start assembling

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.799 
on and I was going to start assembling
him<00:06:47.709> I<00:06:47.919> noticed<00:06:48.729> right<00:06:49.239> there<00:06:49.389> can<00:06:49.599> you<00:06:49.629> see

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:49.809 
him I noticed right there can you see

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.339 
him I noticed right there can you see
his<00:06:50.139> arm<00:06:50.409> socket<00:06:50.799> is<00:06:50.889> already<00:06:51.159> broken<00:06:51.399> so

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
his arm socket is already broken so

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.019 
his arm socket is already broken so
that's<00:06:53.349> a<00:06:53.439> bit<00:06:53.559> of<00:06:53.649> a<00:06:53.709> shame<00:06:53.949> as<00:06:54.639> you<00:06:54.789> can<00:06:54.879> see

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:55.029 
that's a bit of a shame as you can see

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:59.689 
that's a bit of a shame as you can see
there<00:06:55.379> so<00:06:56.379> I<00:06:56.709> haven't<00:06:56.979> I've<00:06:57.129> never<00:06:57.489> had<00:06:57.669> any

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
there so I haven't I've never had any

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.379 
there so I haven't I've never had any
actually<00:07:00.699> I<00:07:00.759> think<00:07:00.819> I<00:07:01.029> may<00:07:01.149> have<00:07:01.209> had<00:07:01.329> one

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
actually I think I may have had one

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.999 
actually I think I may have had one
broken<00:07:01.809> figure<00:07:02.199> in<00:07:02.259> the<00:07:02.349> past<00:07:02.559> from<00:07:02.679> my<00:07:02.799> box

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
broken figure in the past from my box

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.539 
broken figure in the past from my box
but<00:07:03.699> um<00:07:03.879> I<00:07:04.889> said<00:07:05.889> yeah<00:07:06.039> this<00:07:06.189> is<00:07:06.309> a<00:07:06.339> bit<00:07:06.429> of<00:07:06.519> a

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:06.549 
but um I said yeah this is a bit of a

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:08.789 
but um I said yeah this is a bit of a
shame<00:07:06.989> I'm<00:07:07.989> not<00:07:08.229> really<00:07:08.319> sure<00:07:08.469> what<00:07:08.589> to<00:07:08.619> do

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:08.799 
shame I'm not really sure what to do

00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:11.699 
shame I'm not really sure what to do
about<00:07:09.159> this<00:07:09.429> but<00:07:09.819> whatever<00:07:10.599> I<00:07:11.019> guess<00:07:11.529> I'll

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:11.709 
about this but whatever I guess I'll

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:13.949 
about this but whatever I guess I'll
have<00:07:12.639> to<00:07:12.699> buy<00:07:12.879> try<00:07:13.209> and<00:07:13.299> buy<00:07:13.389> another<00:07:13.539> one<00:07:13.719> but

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:13.959 
have to buy try and buy another one but

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:15.329 
have to buy try and buy another one but
it's<00:07:14.259> quite<00:07:14.469> cool<00:07:14.619> figure<00:07:14.829> other<00:07:15.129> than<00:07:15.249> the

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:15.339 
it's quite cool figure other than the

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:16.229 
it's quite cool figure other than the
fact<00:07:15.519> that<00:07:15.639> it's<00:07:15.819> broken

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:16.239 
fact that it's broken

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:21.209 
fact that it's broken
um<00:07:17.009> I'd<00:07:18.009> say<00:07:19.379> he's<00:07:20.379> got<00:07:20.409> a<00:07:20.589> sort<00:07:20.829> of<00:07:20.889> a<00:07:21.009> nice

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:21.219 
um I'd say he's got a sort of a nice

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:23.759 
um I'd say he's got a sort of a nice
sort<00:07:21.489> of<00:07:21.519> black<00:07:22.360> wash<00:07:22.659> over<00:07:23.019> it<00:07:23.229> and<00:07:23.499> makes<00:07:23.649> it

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:23.769 
sort of black wash over it and makes it

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:26.609 
sort of black wash over it and makes it
look<00:07:23.889> sort<00:07:24.129> of<00:07:24.219> worn<00:07:24.459> his<00:07:24.789> armor<00:07:25.149> and<00:07:25.469> again<00:07:26.469> he

00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:26.619 
look sort of worn his armor and again he

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:28.350 
look sort of worn his armor and again he
comes<00:07:26.739> with<00:07:26.949> a<00:07:26.979> black<00:07:27.189> grenade<00:07:27.759> launcher<00:07:28.149> and

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
comes with a black grenade launcher and

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.589 
comes with a black grenade launcher and
the<00:07:29.049> code<00:07:29.259> for<00:07:29.379> that<00:07:29.529> one<00:07:29.739> is<00:07:30.899> right<00:07:31.899> there

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:37.169 

so<00:07:34.959> yeah<00:07:35.279> this<00:07:36.279> series<00:07:36.579> looks<00:07:36.759> really<00:07:36.969> great

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:37.179 
so yeah this series looks really great

00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:38.579 
so yeah this series looks really great
other<00:07:37.389> than<00:07:37.569> the<00:07:37.659> fact<00:07:37.839> that<00:07:37.959> I<00:07:38.079> had<00:07:38.229> a<00:07:38.259> broken

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:38.589 
other than the fact that I had a broken

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:41.519 
other than the fact that I had a broken
figure<00:07:38.889> which<00:07:39.039> is<00:07:39.069> a<00:07:39.219> shame<00:07:39.489> but<00:07:40.300> um<00:07:40.529> I'll

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:41.529 
figure which is a shame but um I'll

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:43.079 
figure which is a shame but um I'll
probably<00:07:41.649> buy<00:07:41.919> some<00:07:42.099> more<00:07:42.249> fees<00:07:42.550> hoping<00:07:42.969> to

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:43.089 
probably buy some more fees hoping to

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:45.540 
probably buy some more fees hoping to
get<00:07:43.209> the<00:07:43.769> few<00:07:44.769> figures<00:07:45.009> which<00:07:45.159> I<00:07:45.249> didn't<00:07:45.489> have

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 
get the few figures which I didn't have

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.689 
get the few figures which I didn't have
in<00:07:46.089> from<00:07:46.809> these<00:07:47.019> five<00:07:47.259> packs<00:07:47.559> so<00:07:48.249> I'd<00:07:48.519> really

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:48.699 
in from these five packs so I'd really

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:51.079 
in from these five packs so I'd really
like<00:07:48.819> to<00:07:48.909> get<00:07:49.029> the<00:07:49.119> soldier<00:07:49.539> and<00:07:49.749> a

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:51.089 
like to get the soldier and a

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:53.279 
like to get the soldier and a
replacement<00:07:52.089> for<00:07:52.360> this<00:07:52.539> one<00:07:52.749> which<00:07:53.110> is<00:07:53.259> a

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:53.289 
replacement for this one which is a

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:55.859 
replacement for this one which is a
shame<00:07:53.559> but<00:07:53.829> um<00:07:54.009> I<00:07:54.419> hope<00:07:55.419> you<00:07:55.569> enjoyed<00:07:55.779> this
