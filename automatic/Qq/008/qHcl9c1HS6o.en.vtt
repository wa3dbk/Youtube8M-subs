 Hello everyone, gamer and today I 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.559

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:48.540

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.540
 I have it in the dns store for 120 rubles 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.949
 sound quality is acceptable judging by his 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.140
 reviews on the dns website or on others 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.850
 sites 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 its cable length is one and a half 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.580
 meter judging by the manufacturer's requests 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.759
 sensitivity dreaming is given white 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:17.289
 minimum frequency of 100 hertz maximum 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:22.600
 10 thousand hertz omnidirectional therefore 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:25.240
 who wants either skype network in any 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.520

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.880

 hold it 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.429

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.959

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:56.410

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:59.229

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.940
 It is written that this is a microphone with mounting 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.860
 It is so clear Well, let's 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.650

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:17.500

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.780

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:39.330
 here or here 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.380

 Hi all, themselves gorynych and this sound 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.819
 test microphone from the company jenius 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.510
 mic-01c 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.850
 how can you already hear me this sound 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.700
 the microphone is quite good but many 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.220
 use asking such a question that 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:14.100
 they have noise and 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.830
 cod this problem is easy to solve simple 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.799
 You must have the means to go to 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.530
 shop and buy a sound card mo 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:26.850
 I have a sound card built in but 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.600
 there are no problems with it therefore no noise 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.280
 ancestors I am not observed from the microphone 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.450

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.380
