of this generation that in and of itself
is<00:00:08.280> important<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.849> teach

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.420 

from<00:00:11.660> an<00:00:11.780> education<00:00:12.350> perspective<00:00:12.530> we're

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
from an education perspective we're

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.129 
from an education perspective we're
experiencing<00:00:14.000> increased<00:00:14.390> engagements

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
experiencing increased engagements

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.480 
experiencing increased engagements
across<00:00:15.710> a<00:00:16.010> variety<00:00:16.280> of<00:00:16.460> disciplines<00:00:18.310> you<00:00:19.310> can

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
across a variety of disciplines you can

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.720 
across a variety of disciplines you can
trim<00:00:19.790> both<00:00:20.060> of<00:00:20.270> these<00:00:20.360> right<00:00:20.720> there<00:00:21.400> you<00:00:22.400> still

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
trim both of these right there you still

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.950 
trim both of these right there you still
have<00:00:23.529> right<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.740> leaf<00:00:24.950> this<00:00:25.279> is<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.580> leaf

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
have right the leaf this is the leaf

this<00:00:28.670> those<00:00:28.940> the<00:00:29.119> chute<00:00:29.330> that's<00:00:29.480> been<00:00:29.780> growing

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
this those the chute that's been growing

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.770 
this those the chute that's been growing
it<00:00:30.320> makes<00:00:30.500> sense<00:00:31.029> when<00:00:32.029> I<00:00:32.059> first<00:00:32.330> got<00:00:32.480> up<00:00:32.540> here

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
it makes sense when I first got up here

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.060 
it makes sense when I first got up here
we<00:00:32.870> weren't<00:00:33.140> even<00:00:33.379> using<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.830> term

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
we weren't even using the term

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.700 
we weren't even using the term
sustainability<00:00:34.640> we<00:00:35.449> were<00:00:35.600> recycling<00:00:36.290> we<00:00:36.590> were

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
sustainability we were recycling we were

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.650 
sustainability we were recycling we were
composting<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.790> then<00:00:38.150> we<00:00:38.360> start<00:00:38.600> off

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
composting and then we start off

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.750 
composting and then we start off
battalion<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.230> little<00:00:39.470> more<00:00:39.650> into<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:40.160> classes

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
battalion a little more into the classes

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.210 
battalion a little more into the classes
so<00:00:41.059> these<00:00:41.150> are<00:00:41.330> part<00:00:41.570> energy<00:00:42.019> then<00:00:42.739> I<00:00:42.830> realized

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
so these are part energy then I realized

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.770 
so these are part energy then I realized
if<00:00:43.579> we<00:00:43.640> were<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:43.910> really<00:00:44.030> look<00:00:44.360> at<00:00:44.480> all<00:00:44.630> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
if we were to really look at all the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.569 
if we were to really look at all the
different<00:00:44.899> facets<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.800> sustainability

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
different facets of sustainability

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.850 
different facets of sustainability
certainly<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:47.270> social<00:00:47.630> and<00:00:47.750> economic<00:00:47.809> in<00:00:48.620> a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
certainly the social and economic in a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.290 
certainly the social and economic in a
biology<00:00:49.040> class<00:00:49.340> we<00:00:49.579> wouldn't<00:00:49.850> get<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.059> all<00:00:50.210> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
biology class we wouldn't get to all the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.510 
biology class we wouldn't get to all the
other<00:00:50.420> things<00:00:50.630> we<00:00:50.780> had<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:50.930> teach<00:00:51.219> so<00:00:52.219> I<00:00:52.250> put

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
other things we had to teach so I put

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.000 
other things we had to teach so I put
out<00:00:52.610> an<00:00:52.850> email<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.360> teachers<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:54.200> see<00:00:54.649> who<00:00:54.890> was

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
out an email to teachers to see who was

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.100 
out an email to teachers to see who was
interested<00:00:55.219> in<00:00:55.430> having<00:00:55.520> a<00:00:55.700> conversation

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
interested in having a conversation

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.479 
interested in having a conversation
around<00:00:57.110> using<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.950> concept<00:00:58.430> of

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
around using the concept of

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.790 
around using the concept of
sustainability<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.270> make

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
sustainability to make

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.860 
sustainability to make

what<00:01:07.130> can<00:01:07.220> we<00:01:07.280> do<00:01:07.550> here<00:01:07.970> on<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.660> campus<00:01:08.930> to

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
what can we do here on the campus to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.370 
what can we do here on the campus to
really<00:01:09.590> model<00:01:10.300> sustainability<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.930> idea<00:01:12.229> of

food<00:01:12.590> production<00:01:12.890> came<00:01:13.250> up<00:01:13.399> pretty<00:01:13.610> quick<00:01:13.940> we

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
food production came up pretty quick we

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.469 
food production came up pretty quick we
use<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.410> overarching<00:01:15.890> theme<00:01:16.310> of

use the overarching theme of

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.480 
use the overarching theme of
sustainability<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.690> provide<00:01:18.470> this<00:01:18.770> context

sustainability to provide this context
we<00:01:20.240> have<00:01:20.270> greens<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.289> what<00:01:21.590> eats<00:01:21.740> our<00:01:21.890> greens

we have greens and what eats our greens
other<00:01:22.550> than<00:01:22.819> us<00:01:22.940> if<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:24.530> consume<00:01:24.860> some<00:01:25.100> of

other than us if it's consume some of
that<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.869> ladybugs<00:01:26.869> eat<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.500> aphids<00:01:27.649> we<00:01:28.520> use

be able to let the air get out the roots
so<00:01:37.850> teachers<00:01:38.210> were<00:01:38.390> involved<00:01:38.960> from<00:01:39.260> the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
so teachers were involved from the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.250 
so teachers were involved from the
beginning<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.130> voluntary<00:01:40.850> level<00:01:41.510> and<00:01:41.990> we

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
beginning on a voluntary level and we

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.470 
beginning on a voluntary level and we
start<00:01:42.470> finding<00:01:42.860> different<00:01:43.040> ways<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.370> tie<00:01:44.180> in

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
start finding different ways to tie in

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.050 
start finding different ways to tie in
other<00:01:44.960> classes<00:01:45.860> other<00:01:46.220> teachers<00:01:46.730> and<00:01:46.910> said

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
other classes other teachers and said

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.790 
other classes other teachers and said
hey<00:01:47.210> while<00:01:47.390> we're<00:01:47.540> doing<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.590> know<00:01:48.710> in

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
hey while we're doing this you know in

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.320 
hey while we're doing this you know in
biology<00:01:49.010> looking<00:01:49.910> at<00:01:50.000> maybe<00:01:50.120> these

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
biology looking at maybe these

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.450 
biology looking at maybe these
ecological<00:01:50.600> implications<00:01:51.230> maybe<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.250> can

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
ecological implications maybe you can

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.640 
ecological implications maybe you can
look<00:01:52.730> at<00:01:52.880> some<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.270> economic<00:01:53.540> pieces<00:01:54.350> that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
look at some of the economic pieces that

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.480 
look at some of the economic pieces that
are<00:01:54.770> driving<00:01:55.010> it

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
are driving it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.490 
are driving it
what's<00:01:56.120> cool<00:01:56.330> about<00:01:56.390> public<00:01:56.900> banks<00:01:57.290> is<00:01:57.440> that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
what's cool about public banks is that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.620 
what's cool about public banks is that
there<00:01:58.130> are<00:01:58.250> not<00:01:58.430> just<00:01:58.640> a<00:01:58.820> way<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.030> reduce

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
there are not just a way to reduce

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.180 
there are not just a way to reduce
inequality<00:01:59.930> but<00:02:00.440> they're<00:02:00.590> also<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.920> way<00:02:01.130> to

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
inequality but they're also a way to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.710 
inequality but they're also a way to
promote<00:02:01.400> sustainability<00:02:02.000> in<00:02:02.240> our<00:02:02.300> state's

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
promote sustainability in our state's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.300 
promote sustainability in our state's
sustainability<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.440> really<00:02:03.650> important<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.160> me

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
sustainability is really important to me

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.850 
sustainability is really important to me
and<00:02:04.840> it's<00:02:05.840> sort<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.170> surprising<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.740> me<00:02:06.830> that

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
and it's sort of surprising to me that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.470 
and it's sort of surprising to me that
it's<00:02:07.100> not<00:02:07.280> important<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.760> all<00:02:07.910> economists

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
it's not important to all economists

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.150 
it's not important to all economists
because<00:02:08.630> economics<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.500> study<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:09.920> how<00:02:10.100> to

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
because economics is the study of how to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.490 
because economics is the study of how to
use<00:02:10.310> scarce<00:02:10.700> resources<00:02:11.210> to<00:02:11.630> fulfill<00:02:11.840> infinite

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
public bank would be to make

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.520 
public bank would be to make
low-interest<00:02:16.910> loans<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.540> small<00:02:17.750> businesses

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
low-interest loans to small businesses

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.760 
low-interest loans to small businesses
imagine<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.550> TJ<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.150> Tabitha<00:02:20.660> decide<00:02:21.440> to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
imagine that TJ and Tabitha decide to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.310 
imagine that TJ and Tabitha decide to
start<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.340> business<00:02:22.720> growing<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.990> selling

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
start a business growing and selling

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.840 
start a business growing and selling
wheat<00:02:25.360> they<00:02:26.360> could<00:02:27.080> then<00:02:27.290> get<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> small<00:02:28.190> loan

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
wheat they could then get a small loan

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.790 
wheat they could then get a small loan
from<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.480> public<00:02:29.750> bank<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.530> get<00:02:30.680> that

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
from the public bank so you get that

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.440 
from the public bank so you get that
wealth<00:02:31.010> creation<00:02:31.340> but<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.790> don't<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.240> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
wealth creation but you don't have the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.300 
wealth creation but you don't have the
wealth<00:02:32.630> extraction<00:02:32.840> because<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.950> interest

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
wealth extraction because the interest

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.420 
wealth extraction because the interest
ends<00:02:34.550> up<00:02:34.640> staying<00:02:34.940> right<00:02:35.300> here<00:02:39.310> we're<00:02:40.310> going

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
ends up staying right here we're going

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.340 
ends up staying right here we're going
to<00:02:40.490> do<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.640> irrigation<00:02:41.209> system<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:42.050> we<00:02:42.110> went<00:02:42.290> to

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
to do is irrigation system so we went to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.140 
to do is irrigation system so we went to
some<00:02:42.560> type<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:42.740> alternative<00:02:43.370> energy<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.940> power

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
some type of alternative energy to power

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.270 
some type of alternative energy to power
the<00:02:44.450> pump<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.750> was<00:02:45.020> out<00:02:45.170> there<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:45.920> tossed

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
the pump that was out there so I tossed

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.100 
the pump that was out there so I tossed
that<00:02:46.459> over<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:47.000> Anne<00:02:47.180> Watson<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.750> physics

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
that over to Anne Watson a physics

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.449 
that over to Anne Watson a physics
teacher<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.650> said<00:02:48.830> hey<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.190> what<00:02:49.280> we're

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
teacher and said hey this is what we're

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.060 
teacher and said hey this is what we're
looking<00:02:49.490> for<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:50.530> want<00:02:51.530> ice<00:02:51.680> into<00:02:51.980> your

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
looking for you want ice into your

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.100 
looking for you want ice into your
curriculum<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:53.090> said<00:02:53.360> well<00:02:53.630> maybe<00:02:53.959> we

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
curriculum and I said well maybe we

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.690 
curriculum and I said well maybe we
could<00:02:54.380> make<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.770> feasibility<00:02:55.370> study<00:02:55.640> for

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
could make this a feasibility study for

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.780 
could make this a feasibility study for
my<00:02:56.000> students<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:57.170> need<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.500> write<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> table<00:02:58.520> of

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
my students we need to write a table of

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.520 
my students we need to write a table of
the<00:02:59.060> data<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.540> you're<00:02:59.750> going<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.170> collect

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
the data that you're going to collect

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.750 
the data that you're going to collect
and<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:02.209> we<00:03:02.840> as<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.410> class<00:03:03.709> came<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.610> some

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
and so we as a class came to some

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.880 
and so we as a class came to some
conclusions<00:03:05.300> one<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.989> them<00:03:06.110> being<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.739> the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
conclusions one of them being that the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.470 
conclusions one of them being that the
school<00:03:07.370> should<00:03:08.000> look<00:03:08.209> into<00:03:08.390> getting

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
school should look into getting

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.380 
school should look into getting
photovoltaics<00:03:09.050> or<00:03:09.560> solar<00:03:09.620> panels<00:03:10.220> they<00:03:11.030> raise

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
photovoltaics or solar panels they raise

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.360 
photovoltaics or solar panels they raise
the<00:03:11.570> money<00:03:11.600> for<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.320> ultimately<00:03:12.410> worked<00:03:13.040> with

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the money for and ultimately worked with

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.420 
the money for and ultimately worked with
the<00:03:13.820> company<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.420> install<00:03:14.660> those<00:03:15.020> panels<00:03:15.500> now

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
the company to install those panels now

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.520 
the company to install those panels now
for<00:03:17.000> my<00:03:17.120> physics<00:03:17.510> classes<00:03:17.840> we're<00:03:18.020> looking<00:03:18.380> at

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
for my physics classes we're looking at

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.620 
for my physics classes we're looking at
what<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.770> production<00:03:19.010> rate<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.030> that

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
what the production rate is and is that

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.479 
what the production rate is and is that
space<00:03:20.989> sustainable<00:03:21.920> in<00:03:22.160> terms<00:03:22.370> of

space sustainable in terms of
electricity<00:03:22.850> are<00:03:23.300> we<00:03:23.720> producing<00:03:23.959> enough<00:03:24.410> to

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
electricity are we producing enough to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.310 
electricity are we producing enough to
meet<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.100> needs<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.550> space

she got biomass waste what's the third
one<00:03:34.420> respiration<00:03:35.420> yeah

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
one respiration yeah

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
doing a unit on the biosphere and we're

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.610 
doing a unit on the biosphere and we're
looking<00:03:52.400> at<00:03:52.519> energy<00:03:52.730> transfer<00:03:53.420> we<00:03:54.170> can<00:03:54.379> use

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
looking at energy transfer we can use

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.960 
looking at energy transfer we can use
something<00:03:55.010> from<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:56.239> biomass<00:03:56.599> from<00:03:57.140> those

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
something from the biomass from those

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.039 
something from the biomass from those
consumers<00:03:58.970> when<00:03:59.120> they<00:03:59.269> die<00:03:59.450> goes<00:03:59.780> into<00:03:59.959> the

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
consumers when they die goes into the

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.380 
consumers when they die goes into the
ground<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:01.190> can<00:04:01.340> be<00:04:01.489> used<00:04:01.640> by<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.849> producers

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
ground and can be used by the producers

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.970 
ground and can be used by the producers
and<00:04:02.629> their<00:04:02.750> nutrients<00:04:03.230> from<00:04:03.319> their<00:04:03.500> body<00:04:03.739> yeah

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
and their nutrients from their body yeah

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.830 
and their nutrients from their body yeah
the<00:04:04.160> key<00:04:04.549> word<00:04:04.700> there<00:04:04.849> is<00:04:04.910> nutrients<00:04:05.599> do<00:04:05.750> you

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
the key word there is nutrients do you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.150 
the key word there is nutrients do you
composers<00:04:06.230> are<00:04:06.319> really<00:04:06.590> good<00:04:06.739> at<00:04:06.799> returning

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
composers are really good at returning

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.610 
composers are really good at returning
these<00:04:07.430> things<00:04:07.790> back<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.690> system<00:04:09.049> over<00:04:09.470> the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
these things back to the system over the

these things back to the system over the
years<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:09.980> we<00:04:10.040> worked<00:04:10.280> hard<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.640> give<00:04:10.790> them<00:04:10.910> a

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
years that we worked hard to give them a

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.479 
years that we worked hard to give them a
number<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.690> different<00:04:11.989> options<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.650> classes

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
number of different options of classes

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.110 
number of different options of classes
from<00:04:13.640> AP<00:04:14.090> Spanish<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:15.049> algebra<00:04:16.010> in<00:04:16.370> which<00:04:16.820> they

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
from AP Spanish to algebra in which they

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.879 
from AP Spanish to algebra in which they
would<00:04:17.239> have<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.419> broader<00:04:17.780> experience<00:04:18.530> with

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
would have a broader experience with

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.490 
would have a broader experience with
sustainability<00:04:19.639> and<00:04:19.760> food<00:04:19.970> production<00:04:20.500> it

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
sustainability and food production it

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.170 
sustainability and food production it
doesn't<00:04:21.829> matter<00:04:22.010> how<00:04:22.280> long<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:22.729> stand<00:04:23.000> at<00:04:23.090> the

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
doesn't matter how long I stand at the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.719 
doesn't matter how long I stand at the
front<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.630> room<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.080> talk<00:04:24.380> about

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
front of the room and talk about

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.230 
front of the room and talk about
photosynthesis<00:04:25.729> and<00:04:25.850> cellular<00:04:25.910> respiration

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
photosynthesis and cellular respiration

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.570 
photosynthesis and cellular respiration
if<00:04:26.960> they<00:04:27.320> have<00:04:27.500> no<00:04:27.680> context<00:04:28.280> in<00:04:28.430> which<00:04:28.520> to

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
if they have no context in which to

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.550 
if they have no context in which to
think<00:04:28.820> about<00:04:29.090> those<00:04:29.240> things<00:04:29.449> being<00:04:30.260> able<00:04:30.410> to

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
think about those things being able to

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.080 
think about those things being able to
go<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.100> greenhouse<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.580> really<00:04:31.880> see

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
go to the greenhouse and really see

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.570 
go to the greenhouse and really see
those<00:04:32.240> things<00:04:32.600> in<00:04:32.870> action<00:04:33.169> makes<00:04:33.919> the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
those things in action makes the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.210 
those things in action makes the
learning<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.060> much<00:04:35.300> more<00:04:35.600> meaningful

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
learning that much more meaningful

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.510 
learning that much more meaningful
I<00:04:37.250> would<00:04:38.000> encourage<00:04:38.240> teachers<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:39.530> find<00:04:40.160> those

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
I would encourage teachers to find those

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.520 
I would encourage teachers to find those
ties<00:04:40.820> between<00:04:41.750> what<00:04:41.900> they're<00:04:42.080> doing<00:04:42.380> and

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
ties between what they're doing and

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.219 
ties between what they're doing and
someone<00:04:42.830> else's<00:04:43.070> class<00:04:43.310> or<00:04:43.910> curriculum<00:04:44.389> we

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
someone else's class or curriculum we

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.990 
someone else's class or curriculum we
can<00:04:45.470> create<00:04:45.680> these<00:04:45.950> opportunities<00:04:46.430> for<00:04:46.639> each

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
can create these opportunities for each

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.850 
can create these opportunities for each
other<00:04:47.330> as<00:04:47.510> teachers

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
other as teachers
