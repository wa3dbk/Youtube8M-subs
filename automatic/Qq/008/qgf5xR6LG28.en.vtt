lifespan there were two different
cooling<00:03:13.720> systems<00:03:14.230> mine<00:03:15.010> was<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.220> newer

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
cooling systems mine was the newer

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
the little mini games on it i never

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.339 
the little mini games on it i never
really<00:04:10.120> used<00:04:10.419> it<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.900> play<00:04:11.079> many<00:04:11.290> games

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
really used it to play many games

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.740 
really used it to play many games
because<00:04:12.099> um<00:04:12.370> he<00:04:13.329> uses<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.690> CR<00:04:14.260> 2032<00:04:14.530> battery<00:04:15.430> and

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
because um he uses a CR 2032 battery and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.000 
because um he uses a CR 2032 battery and
uses<00:04:16.750> two<00:04:16.959> of<00:04:17.079> them<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:17.470> they're<00:04:17.709> really

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
uses two of them and they're really

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.250 
uses two of them and they're really
expensive<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:19.199> in<00:04:20.199> only<00:04:20.320> last<00:04:20.620> couple<00:04:21.039> hours

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
expensive and in only last couple hours

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.719 
expensive and in only last couple hours
you<00:04:23.260> don't<00:04:23.440> need<00:04:23.560> batteries<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.160> save<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.580> it

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
you don't need batteries to save on it

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.490 
you don't need batteries to save on it
so<00:04:24.880> i<00:04:24.910> don't<00:04:25.240> know<00:04:25.330> i<00:04:25.479> just<00:04:25.570> never<00:04:25.900> really<00:04:26.289> used

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
so i don't know i just never really used

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.500 
so i don't know i just never really used
it<00:04:26.680> for<00:04:26.860> games<00:04:27.450> don't<00:04:28.450> like<00:04:28.630> wasting<00:04:28.990> my<00:04:29.140> money

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
it for games don't like wasting my money

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.610 
it for games don't like wasting my money

face you were playing as a pop-up um
first<00:04:44.980> thing<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.190> also<00:04:45.370> about<00:04:45.700> my<00:04:45.850> 360<00:04:46.660> s<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:46.930> said

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
first thing I also about my 360 s I said

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.740 
first thing I also about my 360 s I said
360<00:04:47.650> not<00:04:47.830> Dreamcast<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.730> that<00:04:49.120> its<00:04:49.300> controller

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
360 not Dreamcast is that its controller

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.170 
360 not Dreamcast is that its controller
looks<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.590> lot<00:04:50.800> like<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.730> Dreamcast

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
looks a lot like the Dreamcast

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.090 
looks a lot like the Dreamcast
controller<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:53.380> buttons<00:04:53.710> are<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:53.890> the<00:04:53.950> same

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
controller the buttons are in the same

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.400 
controller the buttons are in the same
place<00:04:54.280> ABY<00:04:55.150> next<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.810> only<00:04:55.990> difference<00:04:56.170> is

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
place ABY next the only difference is

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.930 
place ABY next the only difference is
the<00:04:56.560> colors<00:04:56.860> are<00:04:57.010> mixed<00:04:57.130> up<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:57.520> it<00:04:57.640> uses<00:04:57.820> the

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
the colors are mixed up but it uses the

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.480 
the colors are mixed up but it uses the
same<00:04:58.180> colors<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:59.410> analog<00:04:59.950> is<00:05:00.160> above<00:05:00.460> the

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
same colors the analog is above the

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.180 
same colors the analog is above the
d-pad<00:05:01.120> on<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.510> right<00:05:01.690> side<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.410> guess<00:05:02.980> it's<00:05:03.130> the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
d-pad on the right side I guess it's the

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.480 
d-pad on the right side I guess it's the
left<00:05:03.790> side<00:05:04.000> if<00:05:04.120> you're<00:05:04.240> holding<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.780> um<00:05:05.490> and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
left side if you're holding it um and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.060 
left side if you're holding it um and
its<00:05:09.490> main<00:05:09.790> color<00:05:10.060> scheme<00:05:10.390> is<00:05:10.630> gray<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.470> white

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
its main color scheme is gray and white

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.120 
its main color scheme is gray and white
like<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.670> Dreamcast<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.660> don't<00:05:13.780> know<00:05:13.840> I<00:05:13.930> just

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
like the Dreamcast I don't know I just

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.150 
like the Dreamcast I don't know I just
thought<00:05:15.130> that<00:05:15.190> was<00:05:15.580> a<00:05:15.610> little<00:05:15.790> too<00:05:15.910> similar

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
thought that was a little too similar

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.860 
thought that was a little too similar
and<00:05:18.160> that<00:05:18.190> thing<00:05:18.490> I<00:05:18.580> forgot<00:05:18.670> to<00:05:18.850> mention<00:05:18.940> is<00:05:19.510> at

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
and that thing I forgot to mention is at

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.500 
and that thing I forgot to mention is at
the<00:05:20.830> AC<00:05:21.040> in<00:05:21.700> on<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.090> back<00:05:23.130> uses<00:05:24.130> your<00:05:24.580> average

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
the AC in on the back uses your average

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.380 
the AC in on the back uses your average
let's<00:05:25.870> see<00:05:26.310> that's<00:05:27.390> 125<00:05:28.390> volts<00:05:28.990> of<00:05:29.140> power<00:05:29.440> cord

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
let's see that's 125 volts of power cord

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.940 
let's see that's 125 volts of power cord
the<00:05:31.390> thing<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.660> liked<00:05:31.840> about<00:05:31.930> that<00:05:32.230> is<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.470> if

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
the thing I liked about that is that if

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.560 
the thing I liked about that is that if
you<00:05:33.100> need<00:05:33.250> a<00:05:33.280> replacement<00:05:33.790> it<00:05:34.180> was<00:05:34.270> really

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
you need a replacement it was really

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.440 
you need a replacement it was really
