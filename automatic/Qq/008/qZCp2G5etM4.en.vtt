the planning phase I like to teach you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340 
the planning phase I like to teach you
guys<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> need<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:15.479> plan<00:01:15.750> out<00:01:16.049> how<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
guys that you need to plan out how the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.870 
guys that you need to plan out how the
hierarchy<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.189> set<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.460> even<00:01:17.700> if

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
hierarchy is going to be set up even if

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
hierarchy is going to be set up even if
you<00:01:17.970> haven't<00:01:18.240> done<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.479> yet<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you haven't done it yet and this is a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.499 
you haven't done it yet and this is a
little<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.189> tricky<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> find<00:01:20.790> an<00:01:20.909> easy<00:01:21.210> tool

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
little bit tricky to find an easy tool

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.929 
little bit tricky to find an easy tool
to<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to do this with if you don't have the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.179 
to do this with if you don't have the
pages<00:01:24.360> yet<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.930> pump<00:01:25.470> into<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.070> these

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
pages yet to pump into one of these

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.580 
pages yet to pump into one of these
online<00:01:26.400> sitemap<00:01:27.180> generators<00:01:27.780> which<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.470> why

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
online sitemap generators which is why

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.249 
online sitemap generators which is why
you<00:01:28.979> should<00:01:29.159> search<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.369> things<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.970> create

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
you should search for things that create

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.149 
you should search for things that create
organizational<00:01:31.259> charts<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> there's<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> lot

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
organizational charts and there's a lot

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.069 
organizational charts and there's a lot
of<00:01:32.189> stuff<00:01:32.460> online<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.030> does<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> think

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of stuff online that does this I think

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.170 
of stuff online that does this I think
an<00:01:34.290> even<00:01:34.500> easier<00:01:34.770> route<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.579> would<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
an even easier route to take would be to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.969 
an even easier route to take would be to
do<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.329> an<00:01:36.540> MS<00:01:36.840> word<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> lot<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.890> are

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
do it an MS word so a lot of you are

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.460 
do it an MS word so a lot of you are
asking<00:01:38.280> me<00:01:38.400> how<00:01:39.299> what's<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> easiest<00:01:40.200> or

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
asking me how what's the easiest or

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.960 
asking me how what's the easiest or
quickest<00:01:40.740> way<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> generate<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> quick<00:01:41.520> sitemap

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
quickest way to generate a quick sitemap

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
quickest way to generate a quick sitemap
and<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> classes<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.710> did

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and in one of the classes I did

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.840 
and in one of the classes I did
demonstrate<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:44.729> into

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
demonstrate that you can go into

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.219 
demonstrate that you can go into
PowerPoint<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.600> use<00:01:45.689> something<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.049> way

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
PowerPoint and use something that way

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.499 
PowerPoint and use something that way
but<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> didn't<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.070> pull<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.430> some<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
but I didn't really pull up some of the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719 
but I didn't really pull up some of the
easier<00:01:48.930> ways<00:01:49.290> using<00:01:49.890> SmartArt<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.670> you

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
easier ways using SmartArt that you

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.069 
easier ways using SmartArt that you
could<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.479> mean<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.689> did<00:01:51.869> use

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
could do this I mean I did use

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.170 
could do this I mean I did use
PowerPoint<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.670> show<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
PowerPoint to show you one of the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.700 
PowerPoint to show you one of the
SmartArt<00:01:54.509> options<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> didn't

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
SmartArt options you have but I didn't

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.020 
SmartArt options you have but I didn't
go<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> category<00:01:56.549> that's<00:01:56.790> called

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
go to the category that's called

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.399 
go to the category that's called
hierarchy<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> much

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
hierarchy and this would be a much

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.289 
hierarchy and this would be a much
better<00:01:58.439> way<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.340> even<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.180> took

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
better way to do it so even if we took

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.539 
better way to do it so even if we took
the<00:02:00.420> first<00:02:00.570> choice<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.140> example<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.340> could

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the first choice for example this could

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.240 
the first choice for example this could
be<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.880> homepage

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
be your homepage

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.270 
be your homepage
you<00:02:04.939> may<00:02:05.150> or<00:02:05.299> may<00:02:05.330> not<00:02:05.450> have<00:02:05.900> a<00:02:06.170> page<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.530> kind

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
you may or may not have a page that kind

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.150 
you may or may not have a page that kind
of<00:02:07.400> just<00:02:07.729> comes<00:02:08.000> off<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.630> home<00:02:08.780> page<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:10.009> home

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
of just comes off the home page the home

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.040 
of just comes off the home page the home
page<00:02:10.340> might<00:02:10.610> only<00:02:10.940> link<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.209> your<00:02:11.390> sub<00:02:11.600> pages

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
page might only link to your sub pages

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.390 
page might only link to your sub pages
so<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.260> could<00:02:12.470> either<00:02:12.560> leave<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.069> or<00:02:13.280> get

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
so you could either leave that or get

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.040 
so you could either leave that or get
rid<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.940> then<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.480> can<00:02:14.630> have<00:02:14.750> your<00:02:14.780> sub

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
rid of it and then you can have your sub

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.020 
rid of it and then you can have your sub
pages<00:02:15.290> here<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.830> can<00:02:15.980> add<00:02:16.160> sub<00:02:16.459> pages<00:02:16.880> by

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
pages here you can add sub pages by

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.790 
pages here you can add sub pages by
right-clicking<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.200> add<00:02:18.319> shape

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
right-clicking and going to add shape

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.360 
right-clicking and going to add shape
let's<00:02:19.700> say<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.480> many<00:02:20.750> 6<00:02:21.319> ok<00:02:22.010> on

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
let's say you have that many 6 ok on

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.630 
let's say you have that many 6 ok on
your<00:02:22.430> sub<00:02:23.090> menu<00:02:23.650> that's<00:02:24.650> 5

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
your sub menu that's 5

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.640 
your sub menu that's 5
ok<00:02:26.239> that's<00:02:26.480> 6<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.900> again<00:02:27.080> I'm<00:02:27.170> doing<00:02:27.410> all<00:02:27.500> this

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
ok that's 6 and again I'm doing all this

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.960 
ok that's 6 and again I'm doing all this
in<00:02:27.800> msword<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.459> might<00:02:28.580> look<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.760> little<00:02:28.790> bit

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
in msword it might look a little bit

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.940 
in msword it might look a little bit
different<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.360> your<00:02:29.510> Mac<00:02:29.690> but<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.319> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
different on your Mac but this is the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.229 
different on your Mac but this is the
easiest<00:02:31.220> way<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.400> start<00:02:31.670> getting<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:31.940> going

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
easiest way to start getting this going

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.800 
easiest way to start getting this going
and<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.950> starting<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.690> starting<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.750> get

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
and this so starting to starting to get

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.520 
and this so starting to starting to get
a<00:02:35.870> site<00:02:36.230> map<00:02:36.410> going<00:02:36.620> sorry<00:02:36.950> my<00:02:38.290> speech<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.500> a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
a site map going sorry my speech is a

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.160 
a site map going sorry my speech is a
little<00:02:39.739> jumbled<00:02:40.130> today<00:02:40.400> so

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.860 

if<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:45.950> use<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.460> little<00:02:47.150> menu<00:02:47.300> option<00:02:47.690> here

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
if you use this little menu option here

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.720 
if you use this little menu option here
with<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.080> arrows<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.410> can<00:02:48.650> actually<00:02:48.830> adjust

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
with the arrows you can actually adjust

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.550 
with the arrows you can actually adjust
the<00:02:50.120> titles<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.660> each<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:50.990> boxes<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.530> the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
the titles of each of the boxes in the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.309 
the titles of each of the boxes in the
organizational<00:02:52.280> chart<00:02:52.340> which<00:02:52.730> which<00:02:53.319> can

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
organizational chart which which can

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.350 
organizational chart which which can
easily<00:02:54.560> be<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> hierarchy<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.090> would<00:02:56.209> set

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
easily be like a hierarchy you would set

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.760 
easily be like a hierarchy you would set
up<00:02:56.480> for<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> site<00:02:56.840> if<00:02:56.990> you<00:02:57.080> build<00:02:57.290> them<00:02:57.410> properly

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
up for a site if you build them properly

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.710 
up for a site if you build them properly
you<00:02:58.430> can<00:02:58.580> adjust<00:02:58.910> these<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.270> here<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.569> this

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
you can adjust these in here so this

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.380 
you can adjust these in here so this
might<00:02:59.959> be<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.170> about<00:03:00.530> page<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.910> could<00:03:02.209> be

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
might be the about page this could be

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.020 
might be the about page this could be
locations<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:03.590> could<00:03:03.800> be<00:03:03.950> services<00:03:04.670> sorry

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
locations this could be services sorry

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.140 
locations this could be services sorry
I'm<00:03:05.180> just<00:03:05.360> coming<00:03:05.690> up<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.900> standard<00:03:07.150> standard

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
I'm just coming up a standard standard

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.550 
I'm just coming up a standard standard
names<00:03:08.420> here<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.690> all<00:03:08.810> depends<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.230> what<00:03:09.440> you're

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
names here it all depends on what you're

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
names here it all depends on what you're
doing<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:09.950> could<00:03:10.160> be<00:03:12.400> contact<00:03:14.110> perhaps<00:03:15.580> so

doing this could be contact perhaps so

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.949 
doing this could be contact perhaps so
by<00:03:16.819> using<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.330> does<00:03:17.480> make<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.810> bit

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
by using this it does make it a bit

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.620 
by using this it does make it a bit
easier<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.709> either<00:03:19.040> on<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:20.090> item<00:03:20.450> in<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
right next to it like we did with the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
few along this hierarchy level but you

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.870 
few along this hierarchy level but you
can<00:03:31.640> add<00:03:31.820> below<00:03:32.530> ok<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.800> then<00:03:34.400> if<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:34.640> want<00:03:34.790> to

can add below ok and then if you want to
add<00:03:34.970> another<00:03:35.180> one<00:03:35.269> below<00:03:35.660> but<00:03:35.870> connected<00:03:36.200> to

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
add another one below but connected to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.990 
add another one below but connected to
the<00:03:36.380> same<00:03:36.560> one<00:03:36.800> you<00:03:36.980> go<00:03:37.100> back<00:03:37.280> up<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.790> top

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
the same one you go back up to the top

the same one you go back up to the top
on<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.480> add<00:03:38.660> below<00:03:38.989> again<00:03:39.320> right<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.890> don't

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
on and add below again right you don't

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.530 
on and add below again right you don't
click<00:03:40.340> on<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.519> one<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:40.760> just<00:03:40.880> made<00:03:41.060> net<00:03:41.360> below

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
click on the one you just made net below

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.600 
click on the one you just made net below
or<00:03:41.750> it's<00:03:41.840> gonna<00:03:41.989> be<00:03:42.110> below<00:03:42.230> off<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.680> one<00:03:42.890> so

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
or it's gonna be below off that one so

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.280 
or it's gonna be below off that one so
from<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.269> you<00:03:44.330> can<00:03:44.510> see<00:03:44.630> how<00:03:45.080> you<00:03:45.140> could

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
from this you can see how you could

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.290 
from this you can see how you could
continue<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:46.220> create<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:46.940> add<00:03:47.120> the

to<00:04:06.530> work<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:06.950> in<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.190> planning<00:04:07.400> phase<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.940> would

to work so in the planning phase I would

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.060 
to work so in the planning phase I would
use<00:04:08.450> something<00:04:08.780> like<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:09.140> in<00:04:09.350> ms<00:04:09.620> word<00:04:09.799> and

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
use something like this in ms word and

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.430 
use something like this in ms word and
as<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.640> can<00:04:10.760> see<00:04:10.820> there<00:04:11.570> are<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.780> variety<00:04:12.019> of

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
as you can see there are a variety of

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.710 
as you can see there are a variety of
types<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.549> you<00:04:13.700> can<00:04:13.850> choose<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.450> the

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
types that you can choose in the

types that you can choose in the

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
hierarchy category and you can actually

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.539 
hierarchy category and you can actually
switch<00:04:17.320> that<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.470> design<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.250> used

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
switch that the design that you used

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.060 
switch that the design that you used
even<00:04:19.910> after<00:04:20.390> it's<00:04:20.570> built<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.109> that's<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.829> really

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
even after it's built so that's a really

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.710 
even after it's built so that's a really
easy<00:04:22.100> way<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:22.430> crank<00:04:22.820> out<00:04:22.910> your<00:04:23.060> site<00:04:23.270> map<00:04:23.450> I

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
easy way to crank out your site map I

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.120 
easy way to crank out your site map I
know<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.290> lot<00:04:24.470> of<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.650> are<00:04:24.740> making<00:04:24.919> your

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
know a lot of you are making your

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.800 
know a lot of you are making your
project<00:04:25.520> plans<00:04:25.700> in<00:04:25.910> Microsoft<00:04:26.419> Word<00:04:26.600> which

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
project plans in Microsoft Word which

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.450 
project plans in Microsoft Word which
means<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.140> could<00:04:27.260> just<00:04:27.440> add<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:27.890> it<00:04:28.250> and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
means you could just add this to it and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.969 
means you could just add this to it and
this<00:04:29.450> would<00:04:29.630> probably<00:04:29.810> take<00:04:30.169> up<00:04:30.380> half<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.770> page

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
this would probably take up half a page

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.040 
this would probably take up half a page
to<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.250> page<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.910> that<00:04:32.060> five<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.450> seven<00:04:32.720> pages

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
to a page in that five to seven pages

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.940 
to a page in that five to seven pages
that<00:04:33.200> I'm<00:04:33.289> requiring<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:35.120> are<00:04:35.210> not<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:36.680> count

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
that I'm requiring you are not to count

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.980 
that I'm requiring you are not to count
the<00:04:37.130> concept<00:04:37.820> map<00:04:38.000> which<00:04:38.419> should<00:04:38.660> be<00:04:38.810> just

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
the concept map which should be just

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.779 
the concept map which should be just
added<00:04:39.470> afterwards<00:04:40.039> that<00:04:40.310> assignment<00:04:40.580> you

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
added afterwards that assignment you

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.370 
added afterwards that assignment you
already<00:04:41.030> did<00:04:41.180> as<00:04:41.360> one<00:04:41.660> of<00:04:41.690> your<00:04:41.840> five<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.140> seven

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
already did as one of your five to seven

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.840 
already did as one of your five to seven
pages<00:04:42.740> but<00:04:42.919> it<00:04:43.010> should<00:04:43.190> be<00:04:43.220> included<00:04:43.520> in<00:04:43.760> the

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
pages but it should be included in the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.940 
pages but it should be included in the
same<00:04:44.000> file<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.720> quick<00:04:45.320> little<00:04:45.590> note<00:04:45.620> there

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
same file so a quick little note there

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.880 
same file so a quick little note there
so<00:04:46.220> just<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.060> recap<00:04:47.419> this<00:04:48.289> was<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.470> really<00:04:48.710> quick
