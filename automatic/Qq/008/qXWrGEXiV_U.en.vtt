00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.460
 hello friends how are we on this occasion 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.860
 I bring you the little tutorial of how 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.840
 install the new iwork suite 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.160
 completely free from the app store 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.660
 okay 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
 well many had not asked for good is 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.410
 ending the apple conference 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.689
 they said they were going to have all this 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.340
 free software but many I have 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.990
 been sending emails that they did not 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.640
 it leaves them completely free good that 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.160
 you do not leave them completely free 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.160
 and that has a good price we are going to 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.079
 do it completely fast so that 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.239
 see how it can be downloaded from the 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.370
 app store and you can update and all 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.199
 no problem the good thing I'm going 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.379
 to leave in the description of the video a 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.899
 link with the iwork 09 ok we have to 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.500
 have it installed input does not weigh 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.120
 as much as 250 megs there is no 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.010
 problem just already once it's 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.930
 here we open the small this disk and 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.020
 he implored because I do not want to open it 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.410
 because I've already asked for it here and it's 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.500
 good here we have the small the 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.350
 instructions that if you work and install 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.050
 iwork before you start if you are new to 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.980
 mac I recommend you go to security 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.880
 and privacy 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.870
 and here we just go 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.220
 where is where are you where are you 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.940
 general here we remove the candadito 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.120
 we put the password and put any 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.580
 This way you will leave by default in 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.920
 maxtor then you will leave maxtor 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.170
 identified developers and you 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.780
 put any place here so that 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.910
 so you can activate any 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.330
 program in case this one in case of iwork 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.490
 09 will force you to be in 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.860
 any place if you are not going to leave a 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.530
 mistake and it will not leave you 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.150
 continue ok here we simply give it 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.789
 continue to read me and we choose to continue the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.659
 leave continue 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.659
 continue 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.600
 installation type install 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.600
 again we put our password 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.409
 and it's going to be here validating packages here 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.110
 I'm going to put the camera fast so it does not 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.620
 be so slow and come back in an instant 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.620
 friends 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.900
 very good friends we can see that he has 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.600
 finished the installation now if 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.570
 we enter our applications 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.030
 here we can find that there is no 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.780
 names and page now we have not 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.560
 we close here we go to the app store 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.540
 and if we are right we would have 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.020
 that leave with price still the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.240
 applications ok but do not despair this 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.870
 it's part of what we can see here 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.450
 it comes out that has a price yet 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.209
 we just close and now once 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.700
 installed we go to preferences of 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.020
 System System Preferences us 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.560
 let's go to language and region 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.170
 once being in language and region 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.040
 we will have to change 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.890
 to our our region and to our 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.700
 language to our language forgiveness we're going to 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.370
 add english language 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.959
 well predetermined ok there will not be 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.730
 no problem here is simply in 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.000
 Spanish we give here 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.490
 and we put English here this is the 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.730
 First 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:01.980
 here he will ask us once we do 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:05.140
 this we restart our computer 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.670
 necessarily ok I'm going to stop here the 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.620
 video because I will ask 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.150
 restart and I will not be able to render 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.990
 this and I will lose everything 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.910
 we have done 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.870
 I'm going to render or you have to give 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.959
 here to use English and ready or allowing 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.510
 the restart this and come back good friends 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.180
 Well, we reboot the machine and we can 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.880
 see that our configurations now 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.310
 they are in English we go in there there is no cough 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.490
 or forgiveness finger error 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:38.440
 we went to the pastor 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:42.860
 and we can see that page keynote and numbers 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.110
 they give us now in the update we 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.030
 they say now that we update and what not 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.180
 let's just buy nothing else 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.740
 we update and ready 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.130
 here it seems to me that he is going to ask us for a 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.430
 US account to be able to update to 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.480
 see let's put my password here 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.810
 but I 'm afraid this is not this 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:10.360
 that of having many passwords 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.360
 In truth, sometimes he despairs 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.630
 is this 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.120
 ok if I'm not yearly if we can 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.430
 download with any account ok with the 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.460
 you have on your device at home 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.950
 You can see that the account is from Mexico and 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.830
 we will not have any problem and with 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.330
 that we finished the tutorial friends ok it's 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.449
 very easy to do can see that what 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.889
 we did it 's good we did it together 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:39.010
 completely easy I did not find any 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.830
 problem in truth that was quite 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.410
 easy enough not 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.500
 we did not have any mistakes just 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.600
 follow the video friends so they can 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.020
 do it without any problem and can see 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.879
 that are already downloading 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.190
 here we already have two is not going to have 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.690
 no problem and good friends 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.099
 I say goodbye I do not have anything more than 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.590
 tell them many have asked me to do 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.940
 the review of mavericks but I would ask 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.159
 at least give me some in one 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.520
 week to occupy mavericks since not 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:11.220
 I'll give you a review because without trying it 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.620
 before the entrance I tell them mavericks me 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.840
 has caused problems with final cut pro and 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.610
 with screen flow screen flow I do not know 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.949
 I had updated what I had to update 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.720
 since he would not let me record the screen 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:25.050
 update it and that solves the 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.650
 problem with the pro update it to your 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.810
 most recent version and from time to time 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.270
 when render did he keeps giving me a 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.840
 error there with quick time and says no 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.069
 I can not let me render 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.569
 just what I do is go back to 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.389
 try it and try again until 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.520
 to leave ok but I'll see some 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.530
 more mistakes there that you find and 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.880
 I bring with pleasure the video review of 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.409
 Mavericks, I do not have anything else 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.879
 tell you friends thank you very much for your 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.960
 preference for your d'aix for your 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.780
 thumbs up 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.930
 and I have the video today on the internet 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.820
 I think this is going to replace it 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.580
 what would you like if we upload the two 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.479
 today's videos this and the one I already had 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:08.789
 prepared is about whether it's worth it 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:10.650
 update your ipad 4 by the ipad 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:13.500
 and if it's worth updating your ipad 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.720
 mini for your ipad mini 2 ok is a video 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.070
 about 10 minutes, but 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.389
 posts and less if you want what 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.000
 let's go up or do not want to be climbed 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.830
 remember your best way of telling us 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.330
 want us to come up with more videos it is to 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.160
 live with your thumb up and logically 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.780
 with your comments because you do not have 

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.460
 nothing more than to say friends and see you 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.460
 in the next bye bye
