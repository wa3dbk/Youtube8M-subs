00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.780 

question<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.319> that<00:03:43.470> way<00:03:43.650> sometimes<00:03:44.099> like<00:03:44.400> when

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
question is that way sometimes like when

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.070 
question is that way sometimes like when
they<00:03:44.970> when<00:03:45.300> they're<00:03:45.390> doing<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.750> shoulder

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
so that when you grab it slides exhaust

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.100 
so that when you grab it slides exhaust
so<00:03:50.700> they<00:03:50.790> can<00:03:50.940> get<00:03:51.030> away<00:03:51.150> from<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:51.989> that

used to do what do without back in the
orbit<00:03:57.630> ion<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.130> has<00:03:59.310> helped<00:03:59.610> Jersey<00:04:00.060> come

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
orbit ion so it has helped Jersey come

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.790 
orbit ion so it has helped Jersey come
right<00:04:00.420> off<00:04:00.569> everything<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:01.500> it's<00:04:01.650> like

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
right off everything so if it's like

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.070 
right off everything so if it's like
let's<00:04:02.160> go<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.819> exactly<00:04:03.270> that's<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.750> grand

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
let's go get it exactly that's a grand

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.350 
let's go get it exactly that's a grand
wazoo<00:04:04.250> 8-bit<00:04:05.250> exactly<00:04:05.819> there's<00:04:06.030> nothing<00:04:06.269> to

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
wazoo 8-bit exactly there's nothing to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.640 
wazoo 8-bit exactly there's nothing to
grab<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.110> have<00:04:07.200> nothing<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.530> grab

grab on to so you have nothing to grab

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.199 
grab on to so you have nothing to grab
and<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.250> think<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:08.519> has<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.760> advantage

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
and you think it has the advantage

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.540 
and you think it has the advantage
because<00:04:09.810> actor<00:04:10.230> right<00:04:10.380> guys<00:04:10.980> don't<00:04:11.190> doctor

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
because actor right guys don't doctor

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.430 
because actor right guys don't doctor
