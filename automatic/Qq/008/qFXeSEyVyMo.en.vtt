00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 Boys 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.830
 two 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.470
 hi my name is sonia i like a 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.510
 I teach you how to do these 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.510
 beautiful hair ties 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.130
 to make these ties we need tape 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.980
 of cloth a small pliers thread 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.980
 silicone liquid scissor and lighter 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.750
 to make these ties serves us 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.000
 any ribbon or ribbon I have 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.040
 chosen this type but it can serve us 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.780
 Anybody that we want, I will work 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.270
 with one that has a width of 2 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.000
 centimeters and a half wide and I have 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.430
 cut two segments of 18 centimeters 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.500
 long it can also be longer or 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.420
 It may be shorter than your liking 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.120
 everyone the next thing we're going to 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.760
 to do is take the tape and let's put 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.120
 the two ends like that and with a lighter 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 let's burn the edge so it does not 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.200
 undo us 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.240
 the next thing is to take the strip of tape and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.820
 put it together in this way as a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.150
 centimeter mounted one on top of the other 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.310
 let's grab like this below and the part 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.460
 from above we are going to twist this 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.450
 way and we're going to put it on the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.950
 down we are left like this we are going to look for them 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.400
 with small tweezers we are going to 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.690
 hold this part and this is here the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.350
 we are going to fold and we are going to take out here 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.020
 as a tip in this part we are going to 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.990
 put a droplet of liquid silicone or 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.090
 hot silicone we put it together and 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.430
 we hold with a clamp so that it 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.900
 can dry like this let's repeat for the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.920
 another side we go around 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.310
 we give that form we put glue 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.350
 we close and hold with a clamp and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.210
 let's do exactly the same with 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.280
 the other piece of tape 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.280
 once dry we remove the tweezers 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.750
 and we are left with the following is to take it 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.750
 by the sides 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.540
 sink well in the center and bring the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.540
 sides out 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.090
 in this way we calculate the center and 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.710
 with thread of the same color we are going to put it 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.160
 here we hold it with your finger and 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:45.340
 we started to spin around squeezing 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.590
 At the end we pull the thread and we have 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.590
 the first part we will repeat what 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.750
 same with the other piece now we take 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.250
 these two parts we make them coincide 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.250
 In the center 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.850
 we hold it like this and we're going to do it with him 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.200
 and what we have done previously what 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.450
 hold and rotate to join it 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.790
 we cut the thread left over now 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.700
 we need thin tape to put 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.370
 here in the center so we cut a 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.129
 little bit like this and we're going to 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.670
 burn the ends we put glue 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.670
 and we stick it, we start from behind 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.560
 We can hold it with a clamp up 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:42.530
 to dry let's see below how 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.530
 put a hook on the back 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.650
 if we want to put a hook of this 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.480
 type behind those that open like this 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.040
 The first thing we are going to do is take it 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.219
 this part 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.549
 we take it off and we are going to cut a piece 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:04:00.040
 of thin tape of the same width 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:03.190
 hook we put glue on the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.190
 hook we stick the ribbon 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.910
 we put more glue here we stick to 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.670
 inside we turn around we put 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.670
 glue and paste the centered loop 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.680
 when it is well stuck we will take a 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.709
 piece of thin tape to put it on 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.210
 the center we put glue and from 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.210
 back we started to paste 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.000
 Once it is thoroughly dry this part will 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.180
 let's turn we put here 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.710
 this part of inside glue 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.710
 we put the tape 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.950
 we can help ourselves with a stick 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.230
 to finish putting it when it's 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.860
 well stuck this tape we can already put 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.860
 this part 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.150
 and they have already seen how quickly it 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.770
 they make these ties and the spectacular ones 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.680
 that are left here I have a good variety 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.480
 to show you I have some that are a 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.480
 little smaller than what I've done 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.940
 now and it's because the tape the long has 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.490
 been 16 centimeters why I say 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.800
 that can be longer or shorter and the 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.290
 tape of the width that we want this has 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.389
 been in organza ribbon is very 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.490
 nice and very delicate this here 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.980
 I just put some accounts 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.050
 small here in the middle what 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.950
 we can decorate as we want the center 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.419
 or the sides have already seen what good is left 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:37.430
 finished the tie inside impeccable 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.849
 this also has a hook inside 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.339
 and it's lined too 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.099
 we can put them on tiaras in 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:47.389
 hairpins in whatever we want as 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.649
