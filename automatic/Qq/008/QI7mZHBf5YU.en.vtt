I<00:02:21.050> used<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.350> land<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.709> lot<00:02:22.890> at<00:02:23.100> 75<00:02:23.790> millimeter

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
I used the land a lot at 75 millimeter

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.870 
I used the land a lot at 75 millimeter
and<00:02:24.450> at<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.170> focal<00:02:25.709> length<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.220> performs

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and at that focal length it performs

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.540 
and at that focal length it performs
quite<00:02:27.060> well<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:28.230> colors<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.800> contrast<00:02:29.040> are

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
quite well the colors and contrast are

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.370 
quite well the colors and contrast are
nice<00:02:29.730> enough<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.959> see<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.260> these

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
nice enough as you can see in these

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
surprisingly narrow depth of field so

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.810
