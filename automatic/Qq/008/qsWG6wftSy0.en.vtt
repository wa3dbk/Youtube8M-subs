00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.250
 not subscribed to the channel by running into 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.980
 this page has suddenly appeared 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.810

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.789

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.259
 to ask you to give me a minute or two 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.929
 from your precious free time for 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.119

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:34.150

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.150
 and why you should sign up my name 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.790
 it was er emblaze as my channel was 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.440
 in place it is mainly I deal with 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.410
 this beautiful game is to say 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.570
 minecraft I know that in Italy and in the 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.880
 world there are already many youtuber 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.860
 who deal with minecraft but me 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.720
 I will try to be more original if 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.090
 we will try to distinguish myself 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.160
 modeling youtubers 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.079
 Americans ie the most talented e 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.820
 definitely the most successful ones in 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.890
 Worldwide 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.119
 one of the first goals of my channel is 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.520
 that of abolishing 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.790
 the idea of â€‹â€‹youtuber as a kind 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.310
 of fip away from the members and that yes 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.350
 places above all I do not want 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 that my channel if of this type but 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.430
 I want to create a kind of community 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.010
 a community where youtuber 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 interact with registered and registered members 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.690
 in turn they interact with the youtuber 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.600
 and also with other registered members 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.180
 to know each other and also make friends with 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.820
 new people to carry on and 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.920
 to reinforce my ideal not much 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.680
 long ago organized the first great 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.930
 gathering of the writings of harem blaze a 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.750
 event that brought a horde of more than 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.140
 fifty players on the server chosen a 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.030
 horde that at first tried to at all 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.880
 costs to talk to me to ask me 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.590
 screen and ask me questions but plan 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.720
 plan has taken the right direction 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.210
 ie play together and we have 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.729
 we built a base all together we have 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.560
 collected resource we dug there 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.150
 we have fun we have fun 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.640
 struggled side by side 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.900
 this is the purpose of the channel to do 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.119
 friendships between us 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.340
 this is the main purpose in 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.240
 that occasion was also born ours 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.060
 faction the so-called 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.700
 blazers a name that will identify us 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.250
 as a community as a group of players 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.530
 friends who want to play together and who 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.020
 surely he will also represent us in 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.210
 future events that I will organize but 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.370
 obviously the channel is not only this 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.380
 in addition to the purpose of making friends there is 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.090
 also to have fun with videos and 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.970
 to inform you 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.460
 in this regard I will propose you several 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.530
 series and different types of videos a 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.180
 starting from the most classic of the series 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.160

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.420

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.670

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.990
