guys<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.310> been<00:01:41.340> wondering<00:01:41.850> why<00:01:42.360> didn't<00:01:42.810> I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
guys have been wondering why didn't I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.710 
guys have been wondering why didn't I
show<00:01:43.439> any<00:01:43.649> walls<00:01:44.369> for<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.909> particular

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
show any walls for this particular

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.050 
show any walls for this particular
account<00:01:46.350> was<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.369> couldn't<00:01:47.549> find<00:01:47.820> any

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
account was because I couldn't find any

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.969 
account was because I couldn't find any
war<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.420> were<00:01:48.540> searching<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.140> 5<00:01:49.380> days<00:01:49.409> 6

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
war we were searching for like 5 days 6

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.219 
war we were searching for like 5 days 6
days<00:01:50.100> straight<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> there<00:01:51.960> weren't<00:01:52.110> any

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
days straight and there weren't any

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.039 
days straight and there weren't any
awards<00:01:53.040> for<00:01:53.100> us<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.579> attack<00:01:54.509> there<00:01:54.899> weren't

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
awards for us to attack there weren't

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.469 
awards for us to attack there weren't
any<00:01:55.229> wars<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.180> it's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
any wars at all so like I think it's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.899 
any wars at all so like I think it's
because<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.140> base<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.219> strengh<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> our

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
because of the base the strengh of our

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
because of the base the strengh of our
base<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.450> mean<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.750> impossible<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.740> us<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
base that mean it impossible for us to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.539 
base that mean it impossible for us to
find

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
find

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.060 
find
walls<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.810> attack<00:02:04.110> however<00:02:04.680> last

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
walls to actually attack however last

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
walls to actually attack however last
time<00:02:05.310> when<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:06.270> started<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.689> kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
time when we started this kind of the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.070 
time when we started this kind of the
time<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:08.340> were<00:02:08.459> able<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:09.179> our<00:02:09.209> walls<00:02:09.629> pretty

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
time we were able to do our walls pretty

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.559 
time we were able to do our walls pretty
well<00:02:10.349> sometimes<00:02:10.770> even<00:02:11.129> one<00:02:11.940> war<00:02:12.209> after<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
well sometimes even one war after the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.400 
well sometimes even one war after the
next

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
next

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.170 
next
after<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.400> keep<00:02:14.550> worrying<00:02:15.000> and

after that you just keep worrying and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.360 
after that you just keep worrying and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
bought the exp level being shown over

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.000 
bought the exp level being shown over
there<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.170> look<00:02:31.320> at<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> scores<00:02:31.800> like

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
there so if you look at the scores like

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.300 
there so if you look at the scores like
24<00:02:32.640> 10<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.570> as<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.960> can<00:02:34.080> see<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.740> trees<00:02:35.040> start

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
24 10 so as you can see the trees start

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.850 
24 10 so as you can see the trees start
like<00:02:35.460> virtually<00:02:35.940> most<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.870> business<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
like virtually most of the business and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.530 
like virtually most of the business and
other<00:02:38.160> than<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.490> last<00:02:38.700> two<00:02:38.910> which<00:02:39.060> they<00:02:39.240> just

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
other than the last two which they just

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.810 
other than the last two which they just
left<00:02:39.750> them<00:02:40.020> untouched<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.190> if<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.430> look<00:02:41.580> at<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
left them untouched so if we look at the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.120 
left them untouched so if we look at the
first<00:02:42.060> one<00:02:42.270> done<00:02:42.660> by<00:02:42.690> no<00:02:42.960> defense<00:02:43.590> no<00:02:43.680> defense

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
first one done by no defense no defense

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.310 
first one done by no defense no defense
he<00:02:44.820> was<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:45.030> pretty<00:02:45.540> strong<00:02:45.780> attacker<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
he was a pretty strong attacker is a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.250 
he was a pretty strong attacker is a
townhall<00:02:46.760> 10<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.420> he's<00:02:48.750> pretty<00:02:48.930> strong

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
townhall 10 so he's pretty strong

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.440 
townhall 10 so he's pretty strong
however<00:02:49.530> he's<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.160> number<00:02:50.520> 8<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.330> our

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
however he's like the number 8 in our

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.680 
however he's like the number 8 in our
clan<00:02:51.810> because<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.860> do<00:02:53.490> not<00:02:53.640> have<00:02:53.760> any<00:02:53.940> traps<00:02:54.330> you

yeah<00:03:21.930> that's<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.410> for<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:23.070> particular<00:03:23.430> war

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
yeah that's it for this particular war

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.140 
yeah that's it for this particular war
you<00:03:24.120> can<00:03:24.300> see<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:24.810> we<00:03:25.380> did<00:03:25.740> really<00:03:25.950> well<00:03:26.190> 2410

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
you can see that we did really well 2410

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.210 
you can see that we did really well 2410
although<00:03:27.630> most<00:03:27.990> of<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.170> leaders<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.560> inside<00:03:29.070> I

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
although most of the leaders in inside I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.520 
although most of the leaders in inside I
myself<00:03:29.459> couldn't<00:03:30.090> participate<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.350> war

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
myself couldn't participate in the war

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.140 
myself couldn't participate in the war

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
but hopefully as now we are searching

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.120 
but hopefully as now we are searching
for<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.540> war<00:03:33.810> as<00:03:34.020> currently<00:03:34.709> now<00:03:34.890> we<00:03:34.950> are

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
for a war as currently now we are

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.640 
for a war as currently now we are
speaking<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.840> looking<00:03:36.840> at<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.050> Warriors<00:03:37.470> and

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
speaking and looking at the Warriors and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.470 
speaking and looking at the Warriors and
especially<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:38.430> was<00:03:38.610> done<00:03:39.120> pretty

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
especially this one was done pretty

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.750 
especially this one was done pretty
crazy<00:03:39.900> with<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.590> many<00:03:40.800> brains<00:03:41.220> even<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.550> whole

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
crazy with so many brains even a whole

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.190 
crazy with so many brains even a whole
entire<00:03:41.910> game<00:03:42.420> actually<00:03:42.810> elect

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
entire game actually elect

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.940 
entire game actually elect
so<00:03:44.360> basically<00:03:45.360> we<00:03:46.140> hope<00:03:46.380> they'll<00:03:46.560> be<00:03:46.590> able<00:03:46.709> to

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
than below 10 V 10 because 10 V 10 is

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.680 
than below 10 V 10 because 10 V 10 is
the<00:04:17.070> minimum<00:04:17.549> number<00:04:17.730> of<00:04:17.940> people<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.419> can<00:04:18.540> go

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690
