00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070
 now we do not find with jara puyol that the one in charge of selecting the people of the 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:05.600
 jury is like that 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.750
 a lot of work on what you rely on to be able to select all these good people 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.459
 mainly in what is inside what in the show 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.759
 within the world of dance, both in the theater and in the cinema 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.070
 they are very important people in what the world is 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.140
 of the dance season 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.279
 number one inside monash akenatón escartín 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.090
 who is also a choreographer would end part of a dancer here 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.900
 the forests all night need streets retransmit well show 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.700
 ace civis cione 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.830
 percent we also have the cd valderrama a gentleman who wore the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.400
 choreographer and she puts a very important trajectory 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.160
 professionally 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.890
 percent we have also had people from the dance conservatory both process 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.270
 of debate as a drama teacher and that the jury is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.330
 made up of people when assessing what happens they arrived pp 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.290
 we are in worthy championship always come out to the scores 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.600
 everybody likes the shirt because they think it is 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.520
 one candle the posts 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.119
 more and more ungrateful not because you have to win does not say anything but the loser 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.150
 always some point for the jury 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.120
 if they win everything is fine but what happens if they lose then in how they 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.780
 they are a bit and that gets a little angry with 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.360
 the decorated in that aspect has received many complaints after all 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.270
 the year complaints are received in that aspect 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.920
 it is known who what he just quoted himself if we win we are all happy 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 if we lose 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.890
 although inside also of people who 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.320
 that they are satisfied and that really good that there are people who have 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.060
 done better or that at that time you will see does not mean that because I go very 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.040
 fine and then 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.490
 that day of health 10 same as in home processing the same there is public that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.920
 I have there comes 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.410
 clinton is seeing support do not act with enough encouragement to 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.950
 give everything I've been asking you to carry inside that is not the dancer 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.479
 always never when he goes on stage 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.840
 percent there are times that it was the maximum that you feel great 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.820
 and there are times that it also does not go down and it's not in the air it's bigger than it has to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.420
 go out 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.090
 and without giving names and finally have you ever found in the situation of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.750
 suddenly 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.460
 of someone from the jury who notes autonomous has scored that you 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.310
 seemed like something strange and that you had that bad attention or suddenly there 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.779
 he flew the loves 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.979
 Well, the truth is that up to now I can honestly say that I do not 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:28.480
 percent was the criteria of the jury and very variable very different everyone 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.950
 has the same criteria 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.209
 the park technically tells only that there is so much happiness that the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.970
 older for example has less technique to young people to whom it has more 13 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.879
 It's hard to rate that also because these gentlemen have to 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.750
 score there is not so much that technique not because in reality they do not have 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.459
 greater 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.649
 are people who have learned to dance better than watching video oo 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.929
 at the same time it happens that he sees a difference when he sees the young woman and there is no technique and 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.829
 there is more more wealth at bath time 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.229
 what will this end in 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.689
 mcqueen kirk in account with a situation that you can not go to jury 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.630
 food is the one who has to score technically they make you jury has to 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.740
 he does a little bit of ronaldo sent, not to be told, look at the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.490
 rapport between the couple 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.689
 I want a figured cataclysm to win a figure 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.889
 to finish the figure and to bring the time they want to contribute 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.809
 in third place she has a really a bit of rhythm work 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:27.599
 difficult not because they made jury I would like to score in my case 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.459
 uribarri I had my passion 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.699
 Although he has not had any member of the jury until now that I can 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.299
 suppress of areco tie 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.290
 and state have done everything very well and guillén punctuated reality as 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.519

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.300
 success of what is the dance europe 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.540
 and in a lot of luck and that everything has been organized as well 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.540
 done so far the graceful other unfortunate 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.889
 to find with the jurors a living being in the branch 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.509
 manly chosen hello like they are stomach elite cycling I superbly 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.899

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:09.429
 we are tip 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:13.209
 there are barely twenty minutes to start the gala very quiet very 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.640
 relaxed and calm in its structure I come every year 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.390

 also in goal and good I have a great time 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.830
 also a wonder you have to recognize 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.569
 that the valle riestra of torremolinos a 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.979
 an amazing thing that suits 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.650
 what a way is going to come without light with a truly staging 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.520
 international let's go to the people 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.590
 with this since they have to pay 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.680
 it's not that there is no goal 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.809
 you had Torremolinos challenge valley there is not even 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.030
 all the world 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.840
 there are those who make it better their fabulous costumes with great taste and titanic 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.719
 they are giving 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.300
 but well I'm sure 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.669
 and some new year because they did not exchange in the role is not debugged 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.199
 go more did not stop in the mouth for many years something runs with the 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.370
 advantage of knowing the rest of the jury was not the best some point of view 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:09.159
 do not 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.620
 I have not left 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.599
 my profession definitely 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.099
 I do things with multiple creations 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.949
 I do things when nissan was given because in a better world already with a selection 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.530
 older I do it but professionally entity 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.460
 I have left it because I have been with my whole life since I was a child, that company works with 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.580
 eight years 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.620
 so boy there was a child but that is why they fly and snow 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.970
 this competent man contrasts with what he achieved with his victory a minor 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.090
 but well this is amazing john morton I was coming a little bit your job 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.050

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.469
 ji bribing jury can not bribe 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.830
 the jury has to be correct 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.680
 in your scores 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.930
 that is, in the municipality of manresa they can not work 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.750
 if you are a very good friend of mine, no matter how much I love you but it is very bad 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.880
 I can not put a foot that would put 1 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.070
 that's right when you're on jury and at least I 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.400
 that has always been 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.400

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.490
 difficult to enter because it is so difficult in its entirety as young as little 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.319
