00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello to your vilsack for 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.700
 recently released assassin's creed 4 black 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.099
 flag and you only know only 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.260
 reached out his hands and the game specifically 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.150
 hooked maybe because all the time 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.549
 did not try the third part may due 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 the fact that I play on the next-gene do not like 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.460
 everything starting from a chart of some kind 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.400
 colossal amount of content 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.890
 ubisoft does not relax release dlc and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.990
 what else is important is expanding the universe and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.510
 wide and deep intro assassin's 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.460
 creed sings for mobile devices if 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.590
 do you like this universe do you like 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 pirates for example and generally respect 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.090
 serious mobile projects then this game 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 for you but let's tell more in detail 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.129
 what is there with what it all eat 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.710
 Apple discounts went to all subscribers 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.590
 from partner and apple store just.ru 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.020
 cinnamon black flag different plot though 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.940
 one time one place is even 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.100
 cross characters so if you 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 have already passed the fourth part for you here 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.420
 there will be a huge amount of pleasant 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.539
 references and some easter eggs 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.120
 plot plot is the same as in black 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.320
 flag you are the new captain 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.979
 almost accidentally get your 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.560
 ship and go in search 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.600
 zolotishko adventure and in general the fact that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.920
 there is still a pirate love and not knowing the rum 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.619
 girls 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.509
 and fair wind for example first 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.310
 probably 20 minutes to introduce you to 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.869
 capabilities of the game with control she 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.000
 get up here as simple as possible 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.130
 intuitive, and this is the case 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.840
 when the game was done specifically for 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.210
 mobile devices and accordingly 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.399
 this aspect was originally thought out 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.770
 so no problems will not be any 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.970
 iphone and ipad on last play 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.250
 Of course, more comfortable 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.619
 but in general it is convenient to play at all 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.030
 devices and assassin's creed fires 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.069
 will go on iphone 4s 5 5c 5s and also ipod 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.319
 touch fifth generation and all models 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.539
 ipad except for the first version 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.330
 graphics in the game you can watch very 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.069
 good declared next-gene for mobile 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.229
 devices probably do not agree 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.569
 not even the most beautiful project 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.759
 assassin's creed will appear but above the graphics 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.350
 also worked you can see that well, everything is straight 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.890
 cool despite the fact that the game will take on your 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 device 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.750
 only 500 megabytes i'm talking about you without 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.830
 sarcasm because mobile games by 2 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.830
 the giant is already the norm 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.489
 the game uses black flag 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.829
 create on a mobile device such 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.569
 Ultimate pirate simulator though there is 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.340
 of course and arcade elements for example 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.069
 shooting and generally fight with opponents 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.540
 simple enough and to be honest 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.700
 then this is the only complaint that 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.250
 I have the game and the number of years and 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.709
 general theater can then slightly pump 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.659
 develop and so on but still gives 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.790
 very arcade very unpretentious 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.400
 again i'm not married in the future there 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.680
 something will change but for now two stages 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.290
 first shoot and then shoot at us 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.060
 and everything is quite simple but wanted 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.340
 would be some more creative approach 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.990
 may be related to the fact that we 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.510
 seen in black flag on mobile 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.710
 easier to achieve impossible but it seems to me 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.270
 could invent 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.270
 which bike is cooler 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.120
 the plot in the game is divided into chapters inside 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.890
 each of them are very extensive 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.170
 map travel on it is possible 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.180
 absolutely in your shoulder 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.459
 choose those tasks that you more 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.590
 like Akit murder contracts 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.720
 random assignments or maybe you 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.889
 just want to pirate why not and for 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.230
 order to move on to the next chapter 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.910
 to move through the plot you need to grow in 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.060
 level comes with it respectively and 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.530
 new skills command ship capabilities 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.510
 and so on so we all the time 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.760
 move forward both in plot and in 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.410
 the capabilities of the ship and the activities 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.540
 which become available for example 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.919
 sailing ships appear 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.440
 when needed in the allotted time 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.510
 move on checkpoints is all very 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.040
 it looks funny there is even a farce 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.470
 I honestly do not know how it is 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.330
 in life can be realized but in the game 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.430
 quite funny due to the fact that 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.860
 convenient control in general in general 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.229
 no difficulties with these tasks 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.840
 there is a reverse solid fan but they 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.610
 also divided into categories and if 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.470
 at first everything is quite simple then with 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.610
 time to pass the race is already 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.830
 particular member 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.050
 separately liked the fact that the tasks themselves 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.850
 quite transient minute or two three 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.789
 maximum despite the fact that the game 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.620
 deep tasks themselves pass quickly 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.780
 that is, have a minute got the phone out 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.270
 pockets drowned some brick and 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.370
 ran further on his business it does 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.470
 the game is really affordable I think that 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.229
 it will return to the time from 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.060
 time is the most important because it 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.520
 premium projects cost 169 rubles 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.470
 there is no Donatha evil 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.050
 it is clear that the modern game is really quite 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.240
 without and not read will not do but I 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.310
 spent not a few hours and desire 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.800
 I pay the coin does not appear 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.040
 the game of me lived it is not pulled out 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.960
 what am I doing a positive conclusion in general 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.680
 169 rubles plus minus another thirty on 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.590
 any 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.510
 firewood is the price tag that you 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.530
 pay for the pleasure of pubs with 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.530
 mobile pirates 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.840
 for February in height he was offended 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.840
 at 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.960
 promised quality projects we have it 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.150
 got thanks for this ubisoft can 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.640
 be someone upset and he would like 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.860
 run and jump and kill people like in 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.200
 original game but here such 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.850
 spin-offs can be said and you know 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.220
 made very high quality that 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.080
 the guys are crazy about the pirate theme 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.900
 these are all you have a and a bottle of rum 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.640
 thank them for that thanks for playing 169 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.850
 rubles seems to me very very 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.490
 the right price and if you want to wear 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.680
 hat beard know that he is there more 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.140
 I like to be a pirate for the better 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.669
