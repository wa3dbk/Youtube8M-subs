to<00:03:08.730> normal<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.210> decide<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.780> go<00:03:09.900> for<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.200> outrage

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
to normal I decide to go for the outrage

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.070 
to normal I decide to go for the outrage
because<00:03:11.190> it's<00:03:11.490> stab<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.030> cream<00:03:12.750> gan<00:03:12.930> has<00:03:13.050> a

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
because it's stab and cream gan has a

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.190 
because it's stab and cream gan has a
pretty<00:03:13.350> good<00:03:13.620> base<00:03:13.980> attack<00:03:14.960> Victini<00:03:15.960> gets

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
pretty good base attack Victini gets

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.510 
pretty good base attack Victini gets
death<00:03:16.410> fodder<00:03:16.709> um<00:03:17.570> whatever<00:03:18.570> that's<00:03:19.440> cool<00:03:19.650> he

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
death fodder um whatever that's cool he

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.250 
death fodder um whatever that's cool he
gets<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.180> have<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.330> life<00:03:21.570> orb<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.080> he

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
gets to see that I have a life orb so he

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.050 
gets to see that I have a life orb so he
goes<00:03:22.380> into<00:03:22.560> cachondo<00:03:23.160> which<00:03:23.400> I'm<00:03:23.580> afraid<00:03:23.910> of

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
to be off the bat there just because I

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.790 
to be off the bat there just because I
know<00:03:44.040> cream<00:03:44.340> guns<00:03:44.520> got<00:03:44.760> pretty<00:03:45.000> bad<00:03:45.180> defenses

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
up another trick room I knew that I

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
could set up that free trick room there

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.780 
could set up that free trick room there
