let's<00:00:22.940> look<00:00:23.000> at<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:23.270> co-wash<00:00:23.660> as<00:00:23.930> you<00:00:24.500> can<00:00:24.620> see

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
let's look at the co-wash as you can see

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.410 
let's look at the co-wash as you can see
there<00:00:24.950> are<00:00:25.040> no<00:00:25.190> sulfates<00:00:25.610> or<00:00:25.700> silicones<00:00:26.150> but

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
there are no sulfates or silicones but

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.940 
there are no sulfates or silicones but
the<00:00:26.540> other<00:00:26.660> thing<00:00:26.900> that<00:00:27.050> kind<00:00:27.260> of<00:00:27.320> upsets<00:00:27.740> me

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
the other thing that kind of upsets me

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.890 
the other thing that kind of upsets me
is<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:28.400> there<00:00:28.700> are<00:00:28.790> no<00:00:28.970> natural<00:00:29.150> extracts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
is that there are no natural extracts

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.319 
is that there are no natural extracts
either<00:00:30.110> so<00:00:30.590> yeah<00:00:31.100> so<00:00:31.640> let's<00:00:31.820> get<00:00:31.940> started<00:00:32.239> on

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
either so yeah so let's get started on

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.389 
either so yeah so let's get started on
using<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:32.780> like<00:00:33.019> I<00:00:33.199> said<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:33.620> is<00:00:33.769> a<00:00:33.800> co-wash

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
using it like I said this is a co-wash

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.430 
using it like I said this is a co-wash
and<00:00:34.640> not<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:34.940> shampoo<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:35.809> it<00:00:35.839> looks<00:00:36.350> like

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
and not a shampoo so it looks like

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.169 
and not a shampoo so it looks like
conditioner<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.249> it's<00:00:37.489> extremely<00:00:38.329> creamy<00:00:40.179> as

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
I'm also going to use my shampoo brush

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.729 
I'm also going to use my shampoo brush
for<00:00:54.409> better<00:00:54.559> cleansing<00:00:56.109> so<00:00:57.109> I<00:00:57.140> just<00:00:57.409> rinsed

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
for better cleansing so I just rinsed

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.529 
for better cleansing so I just rinsed
out<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:58.010> co-wash<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:58.699> honestly<00:00:59.120> my<00:00:59.359> hair

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
out the co-wash and honestly my hair

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.270 
out the co-wash and honestly my hair
doesn't<00:00:59.719> feel<00:00:59.989> very<00:01:00.019> clean<00:01:00.499> it<00:01:00.739> feels<00:01:00.979> kind<00:01:01.219> of

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
doesn't feel very clean it feels kind of

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.969 
doesn't feel very clean it feels kind of
gunky<00:01:01.969> but<00:01:02.870> then<00:01:02.989> again<00:01:03.109> I<00:01:03.319> understand

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
gunky but then again I understand

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.340 
gunky but then again I understand
because<00:01:04.370> it's<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.699> co-wash<00:01:05.149> not<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.449> shampoo<00:01:05.930> so

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
because it's a co-wash not a shampoo so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.870 
because it's a co-wash not a shampoo so
now<00:01:06.500> let's<00:01:06.710> go<00:01:06.829> on<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.100> detangling<00:01:07.640> rinse
