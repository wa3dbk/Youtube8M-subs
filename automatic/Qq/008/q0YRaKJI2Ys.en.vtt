one<00:01:29.220> time<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.939> know<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.270> something<00:01:30.659> my

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
one time you know that something my

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
one time you know that something my
thought<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.350> cool<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.770> nobody's<00:01:32.159> ever

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
thought would be cool that nobody's ever

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
thought would be cool that nobody's ever
done<00:01:32.430> before<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.900> know<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.229> gonna<00:01:34.320> take

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
done before and you know it's gonna take

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.840 
done before and you know it's gonna take
a<00:01:34.530> lot<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> work<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.220> gonna<00:01:35.400> take<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> lot<00:01:35.729> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
a lot of work it's gonna take a lot of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.960 
a lot of work it's gonna take a lot of
research<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.540> time<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.610> you<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> figured

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
research and time but you know I figured

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.310 
research and time but you know I figured
I<00:01:39.030> could<00:01:39.180> pull<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.360> off

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
I could pull it off

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.620 
I could pull it off
so<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.740> did<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> did<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.400> research<00:01:41.820> did<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
so I did the did the research did the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.760 
so I did the did the research did the
work<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.170> there's<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> lot<00:01:43.590> of

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
work you know and there's a lot of

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.380 
work you know and there's a lot of
physics<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.220> play<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:44.460> man<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.909> mean<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
physics at play here man I mean this is

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.539 
physics at play here man I mean this is
some<00:01:45.540> Isaac<00:01:45.840> Newton<00:01:46.140> level<00:01:46.439> stuff<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
some Isaac Newton level stuff like the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.710 
some Isaac Newton level stuff like the
way<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.850> has<00:01:48.000> all<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.360> come<00:01:48.570> together

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
way this has all got to come together

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.539 
way this has all got to come together
it's<00:01:49.020> got<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.470> perfect<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.399> not

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it's got to be perfect and it's just not

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's got to be perfect and it's just not
meant<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.960> I'm<00:01:52.110> asking<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.920> God

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
meant to do what I'm asking it to do God

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.310 
meant to do what I'm asking it to do God
knows<00:01:54.060> only<00:01:54.270> how<00:01:54.509> long<00:01:54.689> he<00:01:54.840> had<00:01:54.930> really

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
knows only how long he had really

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.999 
knows only how long he had really
thought<00:01:55.500> about<00:01:55.560> it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
thought about it

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.219 
thought about it
so<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.299> took<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.540> lot<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> effort<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
so it took a lot of effort you know a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.990 
so it took a lot of effort you know a
lot<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> math<00:01:58.619> figure<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.369> part<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.820> out

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
lot of math figure that part of it out

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.880 
lot of math figure that part of it out
but<00:02:00.240> once<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.689> got<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.049> figured<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.500> knew<00:02:01.860> I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
but once I got that figured out I knew I

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
but once I got that figured out I knew I
needed<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.700> know<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> team<00:02:03.270> sport<00:02:03.299> you

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
needed you know this is a team sport you

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.350 
needed you know this is a team sport you
know<00:02:04.049> team<00:02:04.439> sport<00:02:04.770> gotta<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:05.490> help<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
know team sport gotta have help so I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.999 
know team sport gotta have help so I
called<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.229> only<00:02:07.350> guy<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> thought<00:02:07.799> could

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
called up the only guy I thought could

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.680 
called up the only guy I thought could
pull<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.310> off<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.940> know<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> called<00:02:09.479> him<00:02:09.599> up

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
pull this off you know I called him up

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
know I want to be epic - epic and I feel

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:25.069 
know I want to be epic - epic and I feel
like<00:02:19.230> we<00:02:19.379> can<00:02:19.530> be<00:02:19.739> epic<00:02:19.980> together<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> after

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
like we can be epic together so after

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.349 
like we can be epic together so after
after<00:02:25.349> we<00:02:25.590> had<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.920> conversation<00:02:26.129> he<00:02:27.030> says<00:02:27.239> I

after we had that conversation he says I

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.330 
after we had that conversation he says I
know<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.840> place<00:02:27.959> if<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.829> can<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.280> if

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
know just the place if you can do it if

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.949 
know just the place if you can do it if
you<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.609> sling<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.209> know<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.780> place

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
you can sling it I know the place

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.050 
you can sling it I know the place
they'll<00:02:31.200> eat<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.549> got<00:02:32.670> up<00:02:32.849> it<00:02:32.939> like

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
they'll eat it so we got up it like

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.699 
they'll eat it so we got up it like
crack<00:02:33.359> of<00:02:33.510> dawn<00:02:33.629> I<00:02:33.930> mean<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.319> must<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.650> been

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
crack of dawn I mean it must have been

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.410 
crack of dawn I mean it must have been
like<00:02:34.829> before<00:02:35.670> crack<00:02:35.909> it<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> don't<00:02:36.359> even

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
like before crack it on I don't even

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.000 
like before crack it on I don't even
know<00:02:36.540> what<00:02:36.629> time<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.959> wasn't<00:02:37.109> we<00:02:37.260> met<00:02:37.769> at<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
know what time it wasn't we met at the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.099 
know what time it wasn't we met at the
boat<00:02:38.250> landing<00:02:38.430> about<00:02:38.879> noon<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.540> came<00:02:39.900> down<00:02:40.049> to

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
boat landing about noon we came down to

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.890 
boat landing about noon we came down to
this<00:02:40.290> rant<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.739> we<00:02:41.220> put<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.639> and<00:02:41.909> we<00:02:42.359> ran<00:02:42.569> way

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
this rant and we put in and we ran way

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.470 
this rant and we put in and we ran way
up<00:02:43.650> into<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.129> really<00:02:44.549> remote<00:02:45.000> area<00:02:45.359> I'd

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
up into this really remote area I'd

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.399 
up into this really remote area I'd
never<00:02:45.659> even<00:02:45.780> seen<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.139> before

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
never even seen it before

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.339 
never even seen it before
Plum<00:02:47.099> Island<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.389> know<00:02:48.510> being<00:02:48.840> awesome<00:02:48.989> I

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
Plum Island and you know being awesome I

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.099 
Plum Island and you know being awesome I
thought<00:02:49.739> I'd<00:02:49.889> seen<00:02:50.099> everything<00:02:50.689> but<00:02:51.689> I<00:02:51.750> hadn't
