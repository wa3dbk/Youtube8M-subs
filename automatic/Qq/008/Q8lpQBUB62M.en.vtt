cruiser conversion yeah it's it's got a
lot<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.780> potential<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.640> could<00:02:16.640> go<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.819> lot<00:02:17.000> of

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
lot of potential and could go a lot of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.360 
lot of potential and could go a lot of
different<00:02:17.180> directions<00:02:17.510> from<00:02:17.900> here<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.190> it's<00:02:19.340> a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
different directions from here so it's a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.000 
different directions from here so it's a
neat<00:02:19.520> little<00:02:19.610> bike

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.589 

think<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.590> pretty<00:02:40.769> much<00:02:40.920> sums<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:41.599> so

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
think that pretty much sums it up so

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.319 
think that pretty much sums it up so
