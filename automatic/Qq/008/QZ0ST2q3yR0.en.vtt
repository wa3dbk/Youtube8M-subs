00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.700
[beep]

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:22.703
- Need gas.

00:00:55.903 --> 00:00:58.372
Oh, come on!
Where's the gas station?

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:12.920
Uh, excuse me.  Do you know
where there's a gas station?

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.391
- Yeah, uh, just take a left a block
from here, then the second right,

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:20.661
that road will take you to the one;
it's about five minutes away.

00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:22.229
- Great, thank you.

00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:42.616
Whoa...

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.061
Where's the road?

00:01:56.797 --> 00:01:57.865
Ugh...

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:18.085
'scuse me.

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:23.057
I heard there's a gas station around here,
but I think I took a wrong turn somewhere.

00:02:23.057 --> 00:02:24.558
Do you know where one is?

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:26.994
- Sure! I know where one is!

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:34.368
Well, you take a right up here,

00:02:34.368 --> 00:02:37.905
and then another right and
that'll take care of ya good!

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:39.373
- So, two rights--

00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:40.741
- YEH-HEAH!

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:43.277
- Uh, all right...

00:02:43.277 --> 00:02:45.379
Uh... much obliged.

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:50.484
- TURN RIGHT!

00:02:51.552 --> 00:02:53.220
- Yeah, I heard you.

00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:05.399
Now, what is this?!

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.311
Aw, hell no!

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.533
Uh, pardon me.
Uh... I'm having some trouble.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:40.601
Could you tell me where I could find--

00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:42.169
- Did you try the south road?

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.170
- What?

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.708
I'm just looking for--

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:49.743

00:03:57.651 --> 00:04:00.020
- Why not? The south road.

00:04:00.654 --> 00:04:02.523
Hold on, which way is south?

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.368
What the hell?

00:04:55.342 --> 00:04:58.178
Please, do you either of you
know where I can get some gas?

00:05:00.347 --> 00:05:04.418

00:05:26.907 --> 00:05:28.342
I'll find another town.

00:05:29.276 --> 00:05:30.444
- Take a left at the next--

00:05:30.444 --> 00:05:31.278
- JESUS!

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:14.321

there's a gas station nearby?

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:17.791
