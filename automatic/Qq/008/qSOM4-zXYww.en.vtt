00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.010
 Celta de Vigo and Levante faced each other 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.629
 in balaídos at the premiere of lucas 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.850
 alcaraz as the new coach of the 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.369
 granota set after the dismissal of 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.980
 josé luís mendílibar the levante arrived 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.700
 to the celestial stadium in a very position 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.500
 engaged in relegation posts and 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.820
 being the team most scored and least 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.430
 first division scorer 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.870
 he made some changes lucas alcaraz that 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.100
 changed the system bet for a 4-3-3 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.700
 introducing men like andreas 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.710
 ivanschitz 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.950
 or if mahoma you had told more 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.930
 well little for jose luis mendílibar this 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 It was one of the few arrivals of the Levante 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.800
 in the first half but it was the central 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.020
 that went ahead with this opening of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.790
 krohn dehli for sant and bina made a 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.750
 great personal action to deliver the 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.850
 ball to pablo hernández and this one the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.790
 they gave joaquin oscar larrivey that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.309
 returned to score one more day in 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.730
 balaidos to overtake the Celtic five 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.100
 matches have played in this stadium 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.020
 joaquin oscar larrivey with the shirt 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.210
 of the Celtic and in all of them written down without 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.690
 But in this action there was no 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.820
 game the forward of the Galician team 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.050
 However neither the assistant nor the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.090
 college 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.160
 they perceived that advanced position of 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.290
 the riva and ended up going up to the score that 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.940
 both minute 27 of match he put 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.090
 ahead to the celta de vigo 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.590
 Celtic seeking a victory that 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.590
 be placed back in European positions 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.399
 in this nolito driving action that 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.350
 it would end with the shot too 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:48.120
 crusader of joaquin oscar larrivey and there 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.660
 he had it for the second ray erase 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.400
 great nolito action and in the end there you 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.520
 it is necessary to adjust a tad more to the riva and 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.360
 to increase the income of your team 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.610
 day images of the second half 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.020
 introduced changes lucas alcaraz entered 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.750
 Victor casadesús and jordi xumetra 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 precisely víctor centered so that 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.990
 there was not able to go without being finished 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.509
 he hit him with his right leg less 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.090
 good 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.010
 and was not able to hit with the ball 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.540
 Andreas Ivanschitz is however it would be 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.240
 the protagonist of the best occasion of 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.970
 lift in the match 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.460
 but back up that goes down to 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.250
 barral and there came the shot of the 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.480
 Austrian only wood avoided what 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.230
 it would have been the tie to one for the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.510
 lift from having entered that zurriagazo 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.100
 by andreas ivanschitz could have 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.110
 changed a lot things could have 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.600
 changed the sign of the party 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.810
 but it would be only a few minutes after 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.260
 that action when with hector rodas 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.100
 injured with a muscle break and 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.410
 out of area this action would come 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.540
 nikos delivers for nolito in a bad 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.050
 clear the first shot of the gaditano 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.400
 it gets it clear diego mariño but 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.920
 I can not do anything to avoid the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.100
 second goal of the riva and minute 83 that 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.140
 it came in this action alex prolonga 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.180
 lopez there wants to let the riva pass 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.640
 for the entrance of madina the rebound 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.140
 favors nolito shoots the gaditano 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.480
 riveted the Argentine joaquin Oscar 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.209
 larrivey 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.730
 sixth goal of the season for the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.019
 South American striker who already 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.629
 becomes the maximum gunner of the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.810
 Celta surpasses by a goal to nolito that has 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.150
 5 this campaign and already in the 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.459
 last match minutes 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.160
 come this shot from álex lópez that 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.200
 apparently did not involve much danger 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.660
 but he ate it he swallowed it diego 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.670
 Mariño and in that way came the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.310
 third for the Celtic first goal in the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.159
 Liga BBVA in the current course for Álex 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.569
 lopez who entered the second part 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.849
 replacing pablo hernández 3 to 0 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.760
 for the Celtic who achieves three more points 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.500
 and that continues to consolidate in the area 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.230
 new line of the table follows 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.930
 The process of the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.290
