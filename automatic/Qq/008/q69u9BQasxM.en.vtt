all<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.799> much<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.460> specifications<00:00:15.240> but

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
all that much about specifications but

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.310 
all that much about specifications but
except<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:16.800> its<00:00:17.160> thin<00:00:17.400> profile<00:00:17.970> there<00:00:18.869> isn't

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
except for its thin profile there isn't

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
except for its thin profile there isn't
anything<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.770> actually<00:00:20.310> sets<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.730> apart

from<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.960> know<00:00:22.050> its<00:00:22.439> competition<00:00:22.910> with<00:00:24.590> that

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
from you know its competition with that

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.290

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
being said actually there are a few

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.089 
being said actually there are a few
things<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.810> didn't<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:28.949> it

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
things that I didn't like like about it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.910 
things that I didn't like like about it
and<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.789> let's<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.210> check<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> out

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.040 

the<00:00:35.920> design<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.730> solid<00:00:37.120> although<00:00:37.510> I'm<00:00:37.809> not

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
the design is solid although I'm not

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.900 
the design is solid although I'm not
really<00:00:38.230> sure<00:00:38.530> how<00:00:38.739> I<00:00:38.800> feel<00:00:39.100> about<00:00:39.220> this<00:00:39.550> and

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
really sure how I feel about this and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.750 
really sure how I feel about this and
these<00:00:40.239> plastic<00:00:40.809> edges<00:00:41.200> other<00:00:42.160> than<00:00:42.550> that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
these plastic edges other than that

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.210 
these plastic edges other than that
another<00:00:43.329> thing<00:00:43.600> which<00:00:43.900> I<00:00:44.050> don't<00:00:44.230> like<00:00:44.440> is<00:00:44.620> this

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
another thing which I don't like is this

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.939 
another thing which I don't like is this
the<00:00:46.180> separate<00:00:46.600> part<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.170> top<00:00:47.379> I<00:00:47.559> like<00:00:47.800> it

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
the separate part on the top I like it

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.439 
the separate part on the top I like it
when<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.220> screen<00:00:48.489> is<00:00:48.520> covering<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.239> whole

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
when the screen is covering the whole

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.410 
when the screen is covering the whole
top<00:00:49.809> part<00:00:49.989> but<00:00:50.620> that's<00:00:50.949> just<00:00:51.100> my<00:00:51.280> opinion

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
top part but that's just my opinion

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.180 
top part but that's just my opinion
except<00:00:52.420> for<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:53.080> is<00:00:53.110> designed<00:00:53.589> very

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
except for that it is designed very

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.520 
except for that it is designed very

itself<00:01:37.929> as<00:01:38.229> stable<00:01:39.069> it<00:01:40.030> shakes<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.539> bit<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.289> I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
itself as stable it shakes a bit and I

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.809 
itself as stable it shakes a bit and I
think<00:01:41.679> it<00:01:41.800> could<00:01:41.920> be<00:01:41.950> more<00:01:42.190> stable<00:01:42.550> but<00:01:42.670> it

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:42.819 
think it could be more stable but it

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:44.609 
think it could be more stable but it
it's<00:01:43.179> alright<00:01:43.509> all<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:43.990> know<00:01:44.110> it's<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.500> really
