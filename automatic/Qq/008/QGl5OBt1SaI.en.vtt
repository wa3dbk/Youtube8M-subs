on<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.030> power<00:03:40.269> plane

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
on a power plane

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.210 
on a power plane
so<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.380> need<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.650> get<00:03:41.800> rid<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.070> that

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
so you need to get rid of that

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.759 
so you need to get rid of that
particular<00:03:42.489> penalty<00:03:43.410> what<00:03:44.410> you're<00:03:44.560> going<00:03:44.739> to

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
particular penalty what you're going to

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.199 
particular penalty what you're going to
do<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.130> home<00:03:46.120> penalty<00:03:46.950> it'll<00:03:47.950> be<00:03:48.040> clear<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.820> it

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
do is home penalty it'll be clear and it

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.699 
do is home penalty it'll be clear and it
asks<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.540> do<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.810> really<00:03:50.049> want<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.290> clear<00:03:50.470> yes

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
asks you do you really want to clear yes

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.990 
asks you do you really want to clear yes
or<00:03:50.890> no<00:03:51.090> yes<00:03:52.090> at<00:03:52.720> least<00:03:52.930> clear<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.920> now<00:03:54.760> if<00:03:54.880> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
or no yes at least clear and now if the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.310 
or no yes at least clear and now if the
other<00:03:55.120> team<00:03:55.360> were<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.510> score<00:03:55.840> on<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:56.049> power<00:03:56.230> play

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
other team were to score on a power play

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.920 
other team were to score on a power play
will<00:03:56.739> be<00:03:56.860> guest<00:03:57.160> penalty<00:03:57.519> and

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
will be guest penalty and

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.430 
will be guest penalty and
and<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.810> other<00:04:03.959> interesting

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
and that's it the other interesting

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.960 
and that's it the other interesting
challenge<00:04:04.830> happens<00:04:05.010> when<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.610> when

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
challenge happens when you when

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.880 
challenge happens when you when
penalties<00:04:06.360> run<00:04:06.569> over<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.900> period<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.740> the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
penalties run over the period so the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.610 
penalties run over the period so the
period<00:04:08.520> ends<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.240> there's<00:04:09.450> still<00:04:09.630> time<00:04:09.959> so

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
period ends but there's still time so

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.190 
period ends but there's still time so
you<00:04:11.250> use<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.610> penalty<00:04:12.000> on/off<00:04:12.420> button<00:04:12.810> to

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
you use the penalty on/off button to

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.830 
you use the penalty on/off button to
change<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.819> now<00:04:14.819> by<00:04:15.030> pressing<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.510> penalty

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
change that now by pressing the penalty

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.780 
change that now by pressing the penalty
on/off<00:04:16.230> button<00:04:18.290> now<00:04:19.290> it's<00:04:19.500> off<00:04:19.709> now<00:04:20.489> when<00:04:20.700> you

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
on/off button now it's off now when you

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.700 
on/off button now it's off now when you
run<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.120> clock<00:04:21.390> and<00:04:21.959> usually<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.470> run<00:04:22.590> it

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
run the clock and usually you run it

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.860 
run the clock and usually you run it
from<00:04:22.860> one<00:04:23.040> minute<00:04:23.310> between<00:04:23.580> periods<00:04:23.870> the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
from one minute between periods the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.930 
from one minute between periods the
penalty<00:04:25.290> that<00:04:25.500> penalty<00:04:25.800> clock<00:04:26.100> does<00:04:26.400> not<00:04:26.430> run

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
penalty that penalty clock does not run

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.060 
penalty that penalty clock does not run
down<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.870> way<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.110> keep<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.470> same<00:04:28.710> time<00:04:28.950> on

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
down that way you keep the same time on

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.650 
down that way you keep the same time on
the<00:04:29.160> penalty<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.030> start<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.419> next

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
the penalty for the start of the next

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.080 
the penalty for the start of the next
period<00:04:30.900> you've<00:04:31.710> also<00:04:31.860> got<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.190> remember<00:04:32.490> to

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
period you've also got to remember to

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.890 
period you've also got to remember to
turn<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.390> back<00:04:33.570> on

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
turn it back on

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.250 
turn it back on
when<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.500> penalty<00:04:34.710> starts<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:36.750> remember<00:04:37.140> if

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
when the penalty starts and remember if

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.840 
when the penalty starts and remember if
you<00:04:37.380> make<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.560> mistake<00:04:37.770> with<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.340> penalty<00:04:38.610> you

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
you make a mistake with a penalty you

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.180 
you make a mistake with a penalty you
can<00:04:39.000> always<00:04:39.180> set<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.050> new<00:04:40.230> penalty<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:41.040> can

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
can always set a new penalty you can

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.850 
can always set a new penalty you can
also<00:04:41.370> by<00:04:41.910> penalty<00:04:42.360> edit<00:04:42.660> some<00:04:43.230> guest<00:04:43.470> penalty

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
also by penalty edit some guest penalty

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.100 
also by penalty edit some guest penalty
penalty<00:04:44.460> edit<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.300> that's<00:04:45.510> an<00:04:45.660> error<00:04:45.810> because

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
penalty edit and that's an error because

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.880 
penalty edit and that's an error because
there<00:04:46.200> is<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.380> penalty<00:04:46.680> up<00:04:46.919> there<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:49.620> want<00:04:49.800> to

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
there is a penalty up there you want to

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.480 
there is a penalty up there you want to
have<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.160> yes<00:04:51.150> time<00:04:51.960> let's<00:04:52.620> say<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:53.010> really

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
have it yes time let's say that really

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.580 
have it yes time let's say that really
should<00:04:53.669> be<00:04:53.700> a<00:04:54.150> five-minute<00:04:54.930> penalty<00:04:57.590> and

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
should be a five-minute penalty and

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.830 
should be a five-minute penalty and
that's<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:59.060> so<00:05:00.060> all<00:05:00.210> of<00:05:00.300> these<00:05:00.390> things<00:05:00.630> can<00:05:00.750> be

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
that's it so all of these things can be

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.310 
that's it so all of these things can be
changed<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.380> always<00:05:02.070> right<00:05:02.520> beside<00:05:02.850> this<00:05:03.320> is

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
changed and always right beside this is

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.560 
changed and always right beside this is
the<00:05:04.470> scoreboard<00:05:04.919> operations<00:05:05.460> manual<00:05:05.880> so

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
the scoreboard operations manual so

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.540 
the scoreboard operations manual so
refer<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.320> if<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.530> have<00:05:07.650> any<00:05:07.800> questions

refer to it if you have any questions

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.430 
refer to it if you have any questions
when<00:05:08.700> you're<00:05:08.760> sitting<00:05:09.090> in<00:05:09.180> here<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.290> gives

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
when you're sitting in here and it gives

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.290 
when you're sitting in here and it gives
you<00:05:10.560> all<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.280> instructions<00:05:11.550> on<00:05:11.940> how<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.120> run

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
you all the instructions on how to run

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.930 
you all the instructions on how to run
up<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:12.600> on<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.750> clock<00:05:13.280> so<00:05:14.280> that's<00:05:14.430> basically

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
up and on the clock so that's basically

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.000 
up and on the clock so that's basically
it<00:05:15.060> for<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.600> for<00:05:15.870> running<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.169> clock<00:05:16.380> it's

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
it for it for running the clock it's

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.340 
it for it for running the clock it's
really<00:05:17.250> quite<00:05:17.490> quite<00:05:18.000> straightforward<00:05:18.720> you

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
really quite quite straightforward you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.780 
really quite quite straightforward you
have<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.620> deal<00:05:19.800> with<00:05:20.000> time<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:22.500> goals<00:05:22.790> shots

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
have to deal with time the goals shots

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.630 
have to deal with time the goals shots
on<00:05:24.000> goals<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.540> penalties<00:05:25.530> remember<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.490> couple

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
on goals and penalties remember a couple

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.950 
on goals and penalties remember a couple
of<00:05:26.790> things<00:05:26.970> about<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.330> rules<00:05:27.510> of<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.750> game

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
of things about the rules of the game

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.020 
of things about the rules of the game
things<00:05:28.410> like<00:05:28.560> offsetting<00:05:29.130> penalties<00:05:29.160> don't

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
things like offsetting penalties don't

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.760 
things like offsetting penalties don't
go<00:05:30.330> on<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.660> clock<00:05:30.780> they're<00:05:31.169> only<00:05:31.380> on<00:05:31.560> the

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
go on the clock they're only on the

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.800 
go on the clock they're only on the
score<00:05:32.070> sheet<00:05:32.100> so<00:05:32.760> you<00:05:32.820> don't<00:05:33.060> put<00:05:33.300> too<00:05:33.479> many

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
score sheet so you don't put too many

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.719 
score sheet so you don't put too many
penalties<00:05:34.110> for<00:05:34.530> the<00:05:34.650> same<00:05:34.830> four<00:05:35.100> players<00:05:35.400> when
