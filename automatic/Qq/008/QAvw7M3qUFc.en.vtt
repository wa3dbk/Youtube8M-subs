just<00:03:04.280> going<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.549> work<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.319> this<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.500> on

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
just going to work and this is on

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.539 
just going to work and this is on
compression<00:03:08.900> molded<00:03:09.829> Eva<00:03:11.290> sole<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.590> pound<00:03:13.430> on

compression molded Eva sole and pound on

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.610 
compression molded Eva sole and pound on
but<00:03:14.269> what<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:14.599> is<00:03:14.750> basically<00:03:15.530> um<00:03:17.290> it's<00:03:18.290> it's

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
but what this is basically um it's it's

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.030 
but what this is basically um it's it's
like<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.549> cops<00:03:19.849> onto<00:03:20.060> each<00:03:20.329> you<00:03:20.599> it<00:03:21.410> comes<00:03:21.859> like

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
like it cops onto each you it comes like

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.189 
like it cops onto each you it comes like
you<00:03:22.220> hear<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.579> packing<00:03:22.970> angle<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:23.989> that's

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
you hear on the packing angle so that's

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.170 
you hear on the packing angle so that's
another<00:03:24.440> reason<00:03:24.769> why<00:03:24.949> I<00:03:25.160> good<00:03:25.639> when<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.030> put

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
another reason why I good when you put

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.960 
another reason why I good when you put
