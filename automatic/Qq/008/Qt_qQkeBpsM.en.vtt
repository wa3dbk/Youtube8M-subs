precision it takes us about a week or
two<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.830> get<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.190> radiation<00:01:00.490> plan<00:01:00.820> ready

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
two to get the radiation plan ready

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.910 
two to get the radiation plan ready
because<00:01:01.330> every<00:01:01.690> radiation<00:01:02.050> plan<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.350> specific

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
because every radiation plan is specific

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.740 
because every radiation plan is specific
for<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.250> individual<00:01:03.700> patients<00:01:04.089> anatomy<00:01:04.570> so

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
for the individual patients anatomy so

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.140 
for the individual patients anatomy so
it's<00:01:04.869> not<00:01:05.019> kind<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.439> one<00:01:06.040> mold<00:01:06.580> fits<00:01:06.970> all

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
it's not kind of a one mold fits all

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.029 
it's not kind of a one mold fits all
it's<00:01:07.450> really<00:01:07.630> individualized<00:01:08.530> based<00:01:08.770> on<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
it's really individualized based on the

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.440 
it's really individualized based on the
person's<00:01:09.369> Anatomy<00:01:09.640> because<00:01:09.880> everyone<00:01:10.240> looks

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
person's Anatomy because everyone looks

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.480 
person's Anatomy because everyone looks
different<00:01:10.810> on<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:10.990> inside<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:12.159> then<00:01:12.340> when

patients do come every day they have a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.980 
patients do come every day they have a

mini cat scan before each radiation to

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.209

or 20 minutes it's in an open-air area
it's<00:01:33.310> not<00:01:33.460> that's<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:33.819> a<00:01:33.880> tube<00:01:34.179> there's<00:01:34.450> no

it's not that's in a tube there's no

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.330 
it's not that's in a tube there's no
tunnels<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:35.530> essentially<00:01:35.950> just<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.159> big

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
tunnels it's essentially just a big

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.800 
tunnels it's essentially just a big
x-ray<00:01:36.670> arm<00:01:36.819> it's<00:01:36.999> a<00:01:37.030> bit<00:01:37.149> fancier<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.600> next

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
x-ray arm it's a bit fancier the next

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.510 
x-ray arm it's a bit fancier the next
round<00:01:37.960> with<00:01:38.079> a<00:01:38.170> fancier<00:01:38.530> bed<00:01:38.740> but<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.100> more<00:01:39.429> or

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
round with a fancier bed but it more or

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.190 
round with a fancier bed but it more or
less<00:01:39.609> is<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.880> same<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.450> then<00:01:40.810> there's

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
less is the same and then there's

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.779 
less is the same and then there's
different<00:01:41.350> regimens<00:01:41.950> we<00:01:42.069> use<00:01:42.189> with<00:01:42.340> radiation

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
different regimens we use with radiation

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.760 
different regimens we use with radiation
so<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.270> standard<00:01:43.929> if<00:01:44.109> men<00:01:44.319> are<00:01:44.350> having<00:01:44.679> their

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
so the standard if men are having their

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.730 
so the standard if men are having their
prostate<00:01:45.280> treated<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.819> a<00:01:46.170> daily<00:01:47.170> dose<00:01:47.319> Monday

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
prostate treated is a daily dose Monday

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.109 
prostate treated is a daily dose Monday
to<00:01:47.859> Friday<00:01:48.009> for<00:01:48.520> eight<00:01:48.670> weeks

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
to Friday for eight weeks

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.510 
to Friday for eight weeks
so<00:01:49.420> 39<00:01:49.810> treatments<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.319> full<00:01:50.649> and<00:01:50.950> in<00:01:51.310> full

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
so 39 treatments in full and in full

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.129 
so 39 treatments in full and in full
some<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.030> our<00:01:52.149> centers<00:01:52.509> have<00:01:52.719> more

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
some of our centers have more

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:54.629 
some of our centers have more

lower grade disease to be treated in

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.300 
lower grade disease to be treated in

everyday which is very tiresome most men
do<00:02:21.560> very<00:02:21.740> well<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.360> with<00:02:23.480> external<00:02:23.870> radiation

to<00:02:24.410> two<00:02:24.620> main<00:02:24.830> issues<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.400> side-effects<00:02:25.940> are

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
to two main issues with side-effects are

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.910 
to two main issues with side-effects are
that<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.390> bladder<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.870> prostate<00:02:27.500> sits<00:02:27.740> here

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
that the bladder the prostate sits here

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.350 
that the bladder the prostate sits here
the<00:02:28.070> bladders<00:02:28.490> right<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:28.790> front<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.210> that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
the bladders right in front of it that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.450 
the bladders right in front of it that
the<00:02:29.960> rectum<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.440> right<00:02:30.620> behind<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.280> there's

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
the rectum is right behind it so there's

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.310 
the rectum is right behind it so there's
a<00:02:31.520> small<00:02:31.700> rim<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.270> those<00:02:32.420> tissues<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.050> get<00:02:33.290> a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
a small rim of those tissues that get a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.440 
a small rim of those tissues that get a
high<00:02:33.620> dose<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:33.980> radiation<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.030> regards<00:02:35.360> to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
high dose of radiation so in regards to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.150 
high dose of radiation so in regards to
the<00:02:35.600> bladder<00:02:35.840> men<00:02:36.170> will<00:02:36.290> pee<00:02:36.440> more<00:02:36.650> often<00:02:36.980> it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
the bladder men will pee more often it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.200 
the bladder men will pee more often it
takes<00:02:37.280> several<00:02:37.580> weeks<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:37.880> they<00:02:37.970> start<00:02:38.180> to

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
takes several weeks but they start to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.280 
takes several weeks but they start to
pee<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> little<00:02:38.570> more<00:02:38.750> often<00:02:38.990> during<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
pee a little more often during the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.720 
pee a little more often during the
radiation<00:02:39.590> they<00:02:39.890> may<00:02:40.010> slow<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.280> water<00:02:40.550> down

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
radiation they may slow the water down

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.790 
radiation they may slow the water down
about<00:02:41.570> one<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:41.900> ten<00:02:42.080> will<00:02:42.200> need<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> medication

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
about one in ten will need a medication

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.500 
about one in ten will need a medication
to<00:02:42.980> make<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.370> water<00:02:43.640> flow<00:02:43.760> better<00:02:44.180> just

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
to make the water flow better just

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.820 
to make the water flow better just
because<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> prostate<00:02:45.290> gets<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.500> little<00:02:45.740> bit

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
because the prostate gets a little bit

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.080 
because the prostate gets a little bit
swollen<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.340> guys<00:02:46.490> don't<00:02:46.640> empty<00:02:46.940> their

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090

prostate because there's a little bit of

over<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:02.320> think<00:04:03.320> like<00:04:04.190> any<00:04:04.430> treatment<00:04:04.940> Rennell

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
over I think like any treatment Rennell

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.449 
over I think like any treatment Rennell
think<00:04:05.330> radiation<00:04:05.690> is<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:06.140> unique<00:04:06.650> in<00:04:06.800> that<00:04:06.950> for

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
think radiation is is unique in that for

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.640 
think radiation is is unique in that for
every<00:04:07.880> treatment<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.900> very<00:04:09.110> rare<00:04:09.380> side

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
every treatment the very rare side

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.410 
every treatment the very rare side
effects<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.070> ones<00:04:10.220> that<00:04:10.370> people<00:04:10.640> think<00:04:11.300> are

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
effects the ones that people think are

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.000 
effects the ones that people think are
gonna<00:04:11.600> happen<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.110> for<00:04:12.260> example<00:04:12.590> radiation

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
gonna happen so for example radiation

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.640 
gonna happen so for example radiation
the<00:04:13.100> main<00:04:13.250> issue<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.580> there's<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.030> small<00:04:14.360> chance

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
the main issue is there's a small chance

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.990 
the main issue is there's a small chance
decades<00:04:15.650> after<00:04:16.010> radiation<00:04:16.280> that<00:04:16.580> people<00:04:16.910> will

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
decades after radiation that people will

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.550 
decades after radiation that people will
develop<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.450> cancer<00:04:17.840> because<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.500> the

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
develop a cancer because of the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.810 
develop a cancer because of the
radiation<00:04:18.739> which<00:04:18.980> is<00:04:19.010> a<00:04:19.130> real<00:04:19.340> risk<00:04:19.549> it's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
radiation which is a real risk it's

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.430 
radiation which is a real risk it's
small<00:04:20.090> but<00:04:20.239> it's<00:04:20.390> real<00:04:20.600> but<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.170> think<00:04:21.320> one<00:04:21.410> of

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
small but it's real but I think one of

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.810 
small but it's real but I think one of
the<00:04:21.560> biggest<00:04:21.680> misconceptions<00:04:21.920> people<00:04:22.430> get<00:04:22.730> is

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
the biggest misconceptions people get is

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.130 
the biggest misconceptions people get is
that<00:04:22.910> if<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.150> have<00:04:23.300> radiation<00:04:23.510> I'm<00:04:23.900> going<00:04:24.080> to

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
that if I have radiation I'm going to

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.420 
that if I have radiation I'm going to
get<00:04:24.260> cancer<00:04:24.620> from<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.160> think<00:04:25.280> that's

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
get cancer from it and I think that's

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.159 
get cancer from it and I think that's
just<00:04:25.520> something<00:04:25.729> that<00:04:25.880> people<00:04:26.870> need<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.020> be

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
just something that people need to be

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.700 
just something that people need to be
aware<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:28.400> possible<00:04:29.030> but<00:04:29.180> in<00:04:29.330> fact

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
aware of it's possible but in fact

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.380 
aware of it's possible but in fact
a very<00:04:30.010> rare<00:04:30.370> scientific<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:31.060> happens

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
a very rare scientific that happens

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.640 
a very rare scientific that happens
decades<00:04:31.780> later<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.260> think<00:04:32.350> it's<00:04:32.500> more

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
decades later so I think it's more

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.800 
decades later so I think it's more
reassuring<00:04:33.640> people<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.420> there<00:04:34.690> are

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
reassuring people that that there are

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.930 
reassuring people that that there are
small<00:04:35.080> risk<00:04:35.290> but<00:04:35.410> they<00:04:35.530> are<00:04:35.650> small<00:04:36.070> and

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
small risk but they are small and

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.900 
small risk but they are small and
they're<00:04:37.060> not<00:04:37.210> definitely<00:04:37.900> going<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.080> happen

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.970
