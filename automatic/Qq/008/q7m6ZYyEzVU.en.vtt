00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
actually watch the e-track that we're

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.090 
actually watch the e-track that we're
going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.090> being<00:00:36.630> built<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.920> through

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
going to get being built going through

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.190 
going to get being built going through
the<00:00:38.160> final<00:00:38.550> testing<00:00:39.149> phases<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:39.899> this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the final testing phases right now this

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.069 
the final testing phases right now this
is<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.250> e<00:00:41.280> truck<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.300> we're<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> get

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
is the e truck that we're going to get

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.119 
is the e truck that we're going to get
so<00:00:44.090> how<00:00:45.090> long<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.920> the

so how long can I go with just the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.310 
so how long can I go with just the
batteries<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.120> charge<00:00:48.480> how<00:00:48.780> long<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
batteries and the charge how long can I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.220 
batteries and the charge how long can I
camp<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> nice<00:00:50.070> thing<00:00:50.870> if<00:00:51.870> you're<00:00:52.050> running

how does e track do with power the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010 
how does e track do with power the
fastest<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> charge<00:01:15.420> back<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.869> if

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
fastest way to get a charge back up if

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
fastest way to get a charge back up if
you<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.320> anywhere<00:01:16.680> else<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.250> just

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
watts of inversion so that you can

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.080 
watts of inversion so that you can
handle<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> peaks<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> everything<00:01:39.000> else

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090

a little bit of both we do keep propane
out<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.459> there's<00:02:38.640> less<00:02:38.790> fossil<00:02:39.239> fuel
