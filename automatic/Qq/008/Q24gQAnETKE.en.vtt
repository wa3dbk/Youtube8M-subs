00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello to all and welcome to 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.769
 the digital and digital focus we 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.969
 are still at the photokina and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.650
 today we are with Fujifilm 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.000
 who presented these two new 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 compact experts 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 the fujifilm x100 t and his little brother the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.699
 fujifilm ex 30 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.039
 both are very similar to their 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.689
 predecessors always had on the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.160
 x30 the zoom 28 112 and extra years to two 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.640
 third of an inch that there was on higuain 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.399
 is always on the health hike the opposite 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.340
 a sensor aps c ex trans of course and a 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.860
 35 mm f2 let's start with the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.930
 hic health whose design was reviewed at 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.760
 some details he has very 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.899
 slightly refined but especially the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.870
 two novelties that interest us 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.320
 are that 1 the viewfinder that is always 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.180
 the optical and electronic hybrid allows 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.809
 today to see both 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.840
 simultaneously 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.059
 it means for example that while 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.379
 watching your scene through the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.270
 optical viewfinder you can have 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.540
 electronic assistance 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.630
 point 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.400
 like the pikine focus where the dsp what 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.020
 is impossible to do so far 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.850
 you can of course work 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 optical canes or when electronic 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.890
 the second novelty dulic health is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.070
 the arrival of wifi finally who is expected 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.350
 since the xmb and that little by little has been 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.330
 integrated into the premium xe the little 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.930
 x30 evolves much more frankly than 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.340
 his big brother loÃ¯c health he lady is 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.560
 anyway not the choice because 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.750
 currently at the end of 2014 the competition is going 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.909
 to be very very high early in the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.549
 photokina cannon introduced the g 7 x 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.860
 with a 20 inch panasonic sensor has 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.520
 presented two experts one with a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.409
 4/3 fixed-lens fixed -day sensor and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.909
 the second with integrated vision 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.979
 always my interchangeable lenses 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.040
 the helix years and the gm 5 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.800
 here we stay on 2/3 of an inch with 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.720
 in a big evolution there 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.220
 the transition the optical sensors to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.830
 fully electronic sensor 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.870
 always in the middle however second 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.990
 big ergonomic evolutions 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.690
 the screen finally becomes orientable by 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.370
 against it is not yet acquired finally 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.940
 and it will be less visible for 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.250
 Photographers 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.560
 although very useful the wifi is doing its 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.280
 appearance what I find nice and 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.320
 its new products 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.450
 it's not their pure technical aspect 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.520
 and hard it's rather the fact that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.500
 fujifilm and managed to bounce simplify 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.730
 still a little bit about ergonomics for 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.230
 get closer to a practice 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.570
 photographic photographic book 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.650
 much more pure for all 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.000
 compact devices 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.980
 there should be only one ring of 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.900
 diaphragm and a speed ring at the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.000
 limit a high tag and all the rest 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.000
 it should be via the touch screen
