00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.179
 my intention is that the project is the first game of the travel award in the 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.820
 Broadcast is No because that knows that's what it's like to be on one 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.619
 Road, for example, is the fourth son 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.890
 continue to bring in the holy halls 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.890
 what the youth on the street 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.469
 the significance of what music this year is counterproductive and minute art 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.530
 finally motivating the turnaround 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.140
 against others to put individual mistakes too much 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.120
 we try in this project with the smallest Epson the actual motives 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.969
 exactly in the visual 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.400
 to translate 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.910
 Bach has relatively early modern interpretation of new birds 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.810
 quite simply the principle of the bird 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.430
 demonstrated 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 with the bird the market 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.620
 and especially this silver before he tried them also he has them little 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.890
 they put their archives 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.900
 Sbisa 3 voices are three dancers all of our students learning this topic 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.660
 over with hand movements 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
 this 3 0 percent 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.320
 the bottom of the list 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.970
 then each student is after and so creates a three-part 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.690
 visualization 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.090
 the find of Bach 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.560
 an academic i gives is very clear 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 which is a pleasure 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.430
 at normal births and breakbeats they have to have them anyway the stores 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.980
 the whole she just had to insert it added that the whole at 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.380
 It's different in Bach's works, it's the game now 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.990
 not only the music the dancing and singing and building yard on the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.140
 Single games 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.440
 Normally you should only briefly grab what gives three minutes 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.800
 within 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.350
 ten to fifteen minutes 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.360
 Vancouver still out the window sometimes failing them at times 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.289
 30 days also needs to understand the music 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.239
 it did not suffice to understand 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.819
 We also teach locally to implement percent
