 end the week it's finally Friday 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.430
 let's do the tour of the best 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.590
 applications for mobile devices 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.510
 today's free for a limited time no 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.250
 Well the truth is that if you want to support 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.080
 this program so free you can do it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.089
 from already clicking on the little button of me 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.739
 Thank you very much to all those who 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.239
 you are there always supporting and healthy school 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.670
 well let's start let's start 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 with an application called hay play 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.020
 club has two versions one version 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.579
 for iphone and another version for ipad are 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 separate applications let's get ourselves 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 and notice that the application is a 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.100
 very very very simple interface very 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.410
 simple but does something quite 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.140
 powerful we can emit all the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.960
 photographs music videos that we have 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.369
 on our device by dlna and this 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.869
 It's fantastic because you know there's 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.940
 televisions for example that have of 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.009
 lma and no need for any receiver 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.140
 be it a chroma carl be it an apple tv 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.360
 We can send directly with this 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.500
 application and this device all the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.750
 content that we have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.310
 and of photographs as you see music 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.160
 music we have the native application of 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.600
 music or videos not as added 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.880
 we say that this application also 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.229
 has a dlna receiver therefore 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.490
 we here are going to see all the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.320
 content that we have in our 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.970
 hard disks in network but not what we're going 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.280
 to do is to transmit for example these 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.020
 photographs and to use the receiver 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640
 well I'm going to take the iphone from take a 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.920
 very popular application that is this one 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.200
 vlc and note that from here then in 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.220
 retouch at the end we would go to local network 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.530
 let's say that here flame appears 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.240
 directly the eye play to the life and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 2 so I'm just going to get in 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.899
 him and from here you can see that we are going to see 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.340
 all the content of video images and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.500
 music that we have in this application 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 let's go to the images and see that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.740
 here we will see the same content that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.360
 we have left on the left 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.100
 example in the similarities of the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.509
 streams we will follow the one of ferrari that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.610
 tomorrow the formula starts some guys and 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.869
 girls and good to see you in the end as 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.640
 you see we will be able to see all the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.430
 images in this simple way 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.670
 images videos and music an application 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.650
 super recommended and we continue 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.240
 we have with an application for iphone 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.130
 which is called photo fusion an application 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.660
 to edit photographs but super 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.310
 powerful because it allows us especially 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.660
 work with layers that what to me 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.190
 more I like about this application 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.930
 good to see that to begin with we are going to 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.610
 Click on the button quoted more and we will 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.709
 add a photograph to the reel 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.150
 let's choose for example this 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.800
 photography that I think is easy to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.480
 cut and such and you will see a little 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.220
 Well, how does this great work? 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.050
 good application tell you that we are going to 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.090
 Click on the button cited pencil red 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.130
 to start editing and we now 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.959
 What we can do is apply a filter 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.580
 crop the image or else make a 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.200
 selection with the option below the 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.060
 everything and from here we can do 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.560
 selections by geometric figures or 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.959
 perhaps the highlight is this from 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.540
 do it for points we are going to go 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.010
 painting points this way and then 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.560
 we are going to go then for example 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.480
 adjusting all these points of this 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.239
 way we are going to adjust fix that by 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.250
 here we are going to adjust this here and with 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.049
 the points these intermediate blacks at 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.810
 final we could make a 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.220
 practically perfect selection of what 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.200
 that we would like even 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.970
 we can now add more 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.040
 points to select in a way a 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.270
 little bit more precise once we have it 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.370
 we simply give it 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.650
 we give to the fact and we for example 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.680
 we could apply filters 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.270
 at the end to no layer to the area that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.070
 we have selected fixed those that 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.510
 we could apply any filter 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.310
 only to the area selected by 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.870
 example we are going to apply apply this 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.340
 here for you to see either 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.140
 we could apply the filter to the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.160
 reverse zone and the selected one would be 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.480
 Unfiltered 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.160
 let's leave it like this for example because 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.930
 we are also going to be able to cut 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.940
 we can cut any part or well 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.770
 we can simply cut out what 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.810
 we have selected or the inverse in this 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.820
 case we are going to cut this part of here 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.260
 original dimensions and one thing that I 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.970
 like it is also very powerful 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.130
 this application is that we can 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.200
 work by layers and we could add 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.390
 so any layer adding then a 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.740
 more spool photography not good 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.390
 little bit more is an application like os 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.070
 I say super powerful already when we have the 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.650
 creation we can share or save in 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.880
 the reel our edition I think that 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.560
 an application that if you do not have any 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.690
 photo editor can be very 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.459
 advisable always girls we continue 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.380
 and good good good we got to the area 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.390
 gaming and we are going to finish the tour of 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.340
 today with two video games really very 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.800
 we will continue with books of 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.960
 king union of doom is a video game 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.850
 super addictive casual divided by 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.760
 different missions but that is a 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.470
 enjoyment date let's play this 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.170
 fixed round those in each of these 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.510
 worlds or sections we have a lot of 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.130
 levels to play it good rogues 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.050
 that this is the video game we have to 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.880
 get all the keys with each 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.160
 key let's open one thing and in the end 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.630
 we have to open a portal to pass 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.040
 to the next level but as you can see 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.320
 we have to dodge the different 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.790
 obstacles sometimes there are enemies sometimes 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.170
 throw balls as you are watching now 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.150
 they are hitting us with cannon fire 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.100
 notice that we can move the 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.230
 world this way to the end and go 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.970
 taking all the keys these two were 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.710
 pretty easy let's see if I get it 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.870
 pass good this is one of the first 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.460
 missions has not been very complicated that 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.199
 let's say but notice that now 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.050
 that has already been opened but we are going to 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:18.080
 try to take this key and so we take 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.000
 in the chest and we will try to go through 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.650
 here perfect we have not passed this is 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.380
 the videogame guys and girls if you want 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.199
 a casual eye super fun to spend 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.729
 those short periods of time at 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.760
 final with a maximum enjoyment os 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.740
 I recommend this video game we continue 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.660
 well now if we get to the end we're going to 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.880
 end with a video game called 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.770
 darling is the app of the week in the 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.720
 appstore so it will be throughout the 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.400
 free week for all of you guys 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.600
 and girls good is a pretty video game 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.120
 pimp let's give him to play a 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.470
 video game quite curious and that 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.850
 integrates perfectly with a screen 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.430
 tactile because in the end what we have 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.250
 what to do is interact with gestures 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.170
 we are a possessor of soul we are 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.210
 a ghost and we have to own the 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.950
 souls of all the enemies that we are 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.780
 they are getting closer and as we have them 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.030
 notice that we have to do as we 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.980
 indicates on the screen the gesture of the symbol 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.210
 who has a very video game in his head 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.040
 fun that the truth is that it is 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.780
 quite francisco because we have time 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.370
 we have to go pretty fast we have 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.500
 to go with collecting different 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.000
 you are little stars because in the end if we 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.700
 we run out of time we lose the game 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.130
 not when we go overcoming different 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.450
 rounds waves at the end of enemies we 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.340
 let's face against enemies 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.500
 pretty cool finals to fight 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.330
 where each one of them will mark us 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.190
 some challenges sometimes simply because 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.140
 we will have to make gestures in gestures in 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.940
 screen from these geometric figures 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.620
 or whatever it is in the end we're going to 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.390
 have to always do and what else 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.710
 made to notice that they touch us 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.820
 we lose the party we are talking 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.620
 continue that I have enough 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.450
 little stars and see how good we are going to 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.770
 catch all these little stars like you 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.960
 I say the final bad guys maybe it's the 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.280
 partly because we as coolest 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.380
 making gestures on the screen at the end 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.570
 we are going to fight with all of them and we are going 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.490
 to try then to win and it's going to be a whole 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.410
 challenge to really eliminate or win at 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.580
 end some final bad not to see if 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.110
 we managed to get to one so that 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.610
 you can see that we have reached a 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.440
 bad final let's see what we have to 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.240
 do to fight this are pretty 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.130
 complicated to spend note that here 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.360
 we have to do the gestures on the screen 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.370
 that you are seeing the ones that are going 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.020
 appearing in the runes and good 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.610
 simply in this way then we are going to 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.710
 I try to fight uy not made me 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.300
 well today I have not done it well it's going to 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.950
 annihilate the friend not to notice that now 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.660
 I have to make this gesture this other 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.370
 good gesture this is the video game 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.230
 it is simply to make these in 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.550
 screens but do them in the moment 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.140
 adequate because sometimes when we 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.120
 they attack different enemies they have killed me 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.410
 it is quite complicated the truth is 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.120
 which is a very addictive video game that 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.590
 I recommend and good guys girls like you 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.020
 I say it's already Friday I hope you enjoy it 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.460
 this weekend and what better than 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.110
 use these video games and these 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.850
 applications at the end to spend some time 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.170
 pretty nice leisure here I 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.550
 dismiss many thanks for the 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.060
 attention and until next time 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.060
 bye
