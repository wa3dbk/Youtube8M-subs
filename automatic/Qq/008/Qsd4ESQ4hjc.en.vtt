00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
think it's easier because Italy haven't

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.670 
think it's easier because Italy haven't
got<00:06:22.520> much<00:06:22.669> history<00:06:23.029> in<00:06:23.120> the<00:06:23.210> Six<00:06:23.419> Nations<00:06:23.680> but

got much history in the Six Nations but

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.709 
got much history in the Six Nations but

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
it's not the Italian pack is very strong

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.179 
it's not the Italian pack is very strong
and<00:06:26.930> it's<00:06:27.439> going<00:06:27.560> to<00:06:27.650> be<00:06:27.740> a<00:06:27.770> tough<00:06:27.979> encounter

00:06:28.179 --> 00:06:28.189

just need to work out a way of gaining
fast<00:07:11.599> ball<00:07:11.839> now<00:07:12.050> England<00:07:12.560> often<00:07:12.919> played<00:07:13.099> best

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:13.399 
fast ball now England often played best

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.920 
fast ball now England often played best
when<00:07:13.639> they<00:07:13.729> hit<00:07:13.939> the<00:07:14.000> midfield<00:07:14.449> hard<00:07:14.689> with

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
when they hit the midfield hard with

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.269 
when they hit the midfield hard with
someone<00:07:15.110> like<00:07:15.199> Barrett<00:07:15.589> we<00:07:15.740> saw<00:07:15.889> him<00:07:16.039> carry

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
the ball really well I thought think he

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.869 
the ball really well I thought think he
was<00:07:18.139> a<00:07:18.199> big<00:07:18.409> impact<00:07:18.740> for<00:07:18.889> England<00:07:19.279> and<00:07:19.399> then

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 
was a big impact for England and then

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:21.339

prediction<00:07:26.509> I<00:07:26.689> think<00:07:27.589> England<00:07:27.919> will<00:07:28.219> at<00:07:28.520> some

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.580 
prediction I think England will at some

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.490 
prediction I think England will at some
stage<00:07:29.180> be<00:07:29.389> behind<00:07:29.689> in<00:07:29.810> this<00:07:29.899> game<00:07:30.139> Italy

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
stage be behind in this game Italy

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.950 
stage be behind in this game Italy
always<00:07:30.649> start<00:07:31.099> well<00:07:31.279> I<00:07:31.729> think<00:07:32.330> the<00:07:32.569> Italians

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
always start well I think the Italians

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.719 
always start well I think the Italians
will<00:07:33.050> lead<00:07:33.289> possibly<00:07:33.949> for<00:07:34.099> long<00:07:34.279> periods<00:07:34.310> this

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:34.729 
will lead possibly for long periods this

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:36.249 
will lead possibly for long periods this
game<00:07:34.909> but<00:07:35.060> I<00:07:35.120> do<00:07:35.210> feel<00:07:35.569> that<00:07:35.629> will<00:07:35.899> break<00:07:36.080> them

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:36.259 
game but I do feel that will break them

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:37.629 
game but I do feel that will break them
down<00:07:36.289> and<00:07:36.620> I<00:07:36.649> think<00:07:36.830> England<00:07:37.099> will<00:07:37.310> win<00:07:37.460> by

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639 
down and I think England will win by

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:39.700 
down and I think England will win by
