00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:49.620
 Let's just leave it at that 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:52.789
 damned sick otherwise they would have 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.789
 maybe done away with here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.830
 Of course, only the best company 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.270
 hold the against to admit these things 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.270
 I have to remember because I can on it 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:46.160
 let us arrive our motto is something 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.160
 has a soldier like mario to say 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.010
 Well, here's a ball hail like that 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.010
 as a small welcome gift 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:07.490
 Firestorm do nothing further 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:19.280
 less weak up there so the 4 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.720
 because the cover from the front and then 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.480
 shoot one the next big one 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.019
 Colleagues can not die 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.359
 probably like in call of duty that 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.680
 you find your scanned two so because the 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.450
 of course, also for the story 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.959
 can use so that the cover 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.959
 apart 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:54.579
 I think that 's it or guys ok then 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.579
 let's go ahead 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.840
 I have a bit wild around first 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.840
 but then I did not fire 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.560
 win over it 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.319
 he was 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.540
 where is that up there? 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.360
 Okay, I'll go back a bit 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.180
 back straight and then I'll look 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.590
 I probably have to go there before the guy 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.700
 I just rented it around the 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.700
 to provide for the tank 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:53.450
 I hope you surprise me now 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:04:02.360
 no one shit you the karate here 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:03.950
 thrown a russian model though 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.480
 after all, wanted to briefly first 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.480
 bit out with you right now 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.150
 Great has not been around yet 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.760
 died without realizing it i know 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.480
 not what if you all this 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.590
 explosion the senior living are there 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.590
 on darkness 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:36.920
 apa 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:40.520
 disadvantaged statistics always without gage 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.100
 to throw but now look where is 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.420
 the patrol boat how can you do that 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.420
 off and paths 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.700
 that will not take any real part until the part of 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.700
 insisted on martial arts 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.530
 Can I still think about the rocket? 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.350
 I do not know if that one left 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:11.570
 idea or just go straight 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:29.180
 drives so that would be it with the 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:30.710
 patrol boat finds upstream one 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.150
 transport but I take the wumme with 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.550
 I really liked it 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.940
 promised and also seems the special 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.350
 to be child-ops's a Chefchen 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.790

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:57.340
 amazon roar rises a friend I 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.340
 I'm not a special ops 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:20.810
