boots too um I think the popular choice
is<00:00:44.359> the<00:00:44.600> pink<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.499> think<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.249> pink<00:00:46.519> mercurials

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
is the pink I think the pink mercurials

is the pink I think the pink mercurials
because<00:00:48.379> apparently<00:00:48.829> that's<00:00:48.949> what<00:00:49.489> he<00:00:49.879> you<00:00:49.999> is

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149

course it would be a near-post goal but

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.160 
course it would be a near-post goal but
yeah<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.700> was<00:01:58.969> saying<00:01:59.179> that<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.689> is<00:01:59.899> kind<00:02:00.140> of

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
yeah I was saying that it is kind of

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.080 
yeah I was saying that it is kind of
lucky<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.710> we<00:02:00.890> are<00:02:01.070> not<00:02:01.310> used<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:01.880> left

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
lucky that we are not used to the left

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.870 
lucky that we are not used to the left
wing<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:02.509> we<00:02:02.570> would<00:02:02.840> rather<00:02:03.320> prefer<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:04.640> be<00:02:04.850> a

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
wing and we would rather prefer to be a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.880 
wing and we would rather prefer to be a
striker<00:02:05.539> but<00:02:05.929> when<00:02:06.079> mess<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:06.409> on<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.649> pitch

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
striker but when mess is on the pitch

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.800 
striker but when mess is on the pitch
you<00:02:07.039> cannot<00:02:07.369> take<00:02:07.789> that<00:02:07.999> position<00:02:08.179> from<00:02:08.570> him

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
you cannot take that position from him

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.920 
you cannot take that position from him
because<00:02:08.960> he<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.860> past<00:02:10.160> there<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:11.750> it's

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
because he is the past there but it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.870 
because he is the past there but it's
still<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.860> imagine<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.490> in<00:02:13.610> fifa

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
still a can can you imagine that in fifa

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.640 
still a can can you imagine that in fifa
14<00:02:14.120> people<00:02:14.960> will<00:02:15.050> probably<00:02:15.230> play<00:02:15.560> with

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
14 people will probably play with

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.980 
14 people will probably play with
barcelona<00:02:16.310> again<00:02:16.610> in<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.420> head<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.810> head

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
barcelona again in the head to head

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.350 
barcelona again in the head to head
seasons<00:02:18.230> because<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.129> messy<00:02:19.610> Neymar<00:02:20.150> and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
seasons because the messy Neymar and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.070 
seasons because the messy Neymar and
probably<00:02:21.700> Sanchez<00:02:22.700> on<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.090> right<00:02:23.300> wing<00:02:23.629> it

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
probably Sanchez on the right wing it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.370 
probably Sanchez on the right wing it
it's<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.350> very<00:02:24.820> tough<00:02:25.820> attacking<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.780> trio<00:02:27.140> there

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
it's a very tough attacking a trio there

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.620 
it's a very tough attacking a trio there
and<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.860> name<00:02:28.160> ro<00:02:28.340> terrebonne<00:02:28.910> across<00:02:29.300> there

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
and the name ro terrebonne across there

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.930 
and the name ro terrebonne across there
and<00:02:29.660> then<00:02:30.080> some<00:02:30.740> stuff<00:02:31.010> happens<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.700> box

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and then some stuff happens in the box

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.480 
and then some stuff happens in the box
and<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.480> referee<00:02:32.930> says<00:02:33.260> that's<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.800> penalty<00:02:33.980> so

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
and the referee says that's a penalty so

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.240 
and the referee says that's a penalty so
I<00:02:34.520> guess<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.630> it's<00:02:35.960> a<00:02:36.170> mess<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
I guess it is but it's a mess is on the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.760 
I guess it is but it's a mess is on the
pitch<00:02:37.490> Messi<00:02:38.360> will<00:02:38.720> be<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.170> one<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.500> take<00:02:39.710> a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
pitch Messi will be the one to take a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.580 
pitch Messi will be the one to take a
not<00:02:40.100> Neymar<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.360> messy<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.110> going<00:02:42.440> to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
not Neymar and the messy is going to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.440 
not Neymar and the messy is going to
stutter<00:02:42.860> penalty<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:44.000> means<00:02:44.240> he's

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
stutter penalty and that means he's

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.270 
stutter penalty and that means he's
going<00:02:44.630> down<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.990> middle<00:02:45.170> keeper<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.100> should

going down the middle keeper you should

him off the ball but could not get him

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.670 
him off the ball but could not get him
off<00:05:24.240> balance<00:05:24.450> because<00:05:24.930> name<00:05:25.110> or<00:05:25.260> has<00:05:25.410> like

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
off balance because name or has like

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.280 
off balance because name or has like
close<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.370> 90<00:05:26.820> maybe<00:05:27.000> even<00:05:27.210> 90<00:05:27.660> something

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
close to 90 maybe even 90 something

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.379 
close to 90 maybe even 90 something
balance<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.070> that<00:05:29.550> shows<00:05:29.850> there<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.240> course

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
balance and that shows there of course

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.570 
balance and that shows there of course
not<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:31.020> ball<00:05:31.229> gets<00:05:31.440> knocked<00:05:31.740> into<00:05:31.979> space<00:05:32.340> but

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
not the ball gets knocked into space but

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.879 
not the ball gets knocked into space but
that<00:05:32.610> just<00:05:33.060> works<00:05:33.990> out<00:05:34.200> well<00:05:34.380> for<00:05:34.440> Neymar

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
that just works out well for Neymar

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.440 
that just works out well for Neymar
because<00:05:35.190> he<00:05:35.310> takes<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.669> powerful<00:05:36.090> shot<00:05:36.270> and

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
because he takes a powerful shot and

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.110 
because he takes a powerful shot and
then<00:05:36.540> look<00:05:36.720> at<00:05:36.840> this<00:05:36.960> iconic<00:05:37.860> scene<00:05:38.120> here
