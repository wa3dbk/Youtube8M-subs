language<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:01.230> pretty<00:00:01.560> fundamental<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.669> who<00:00:03.120> we

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
language is pretty fundamental to who we

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.670 
language is pretty fundamental to who we
are<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.689> there<00:00:03.810> are<00:00:03.870> obviously<00:00:04.140> differences

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
are and there are obviously differences

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.260 
are and there are obviously differences
between<00:00:04.859> languages<00:00:05.430> but<00:00:05.549> it<00:00:05.670> turns<00:00:05.819> out<00:00:06.029> there

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
between languages but it turns out there

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.089 
between languages but it turns out there
are<00:00:06.420> some<00:00:06.480> similarities<00:00:07.230> between<00:00:07.350> wildly

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
are some similarities between wildly

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.009 
are some similarities between wildly
different<00:00:08.429> languages<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> I'm<00:00:09.570> here<00:00:09.840> at<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
different languages and I'm here at the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.990 
different languages and I'm here at the
Department<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.530> linguistics<00:00:10.710> at<00:00:11.250> MIT<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.820> talk

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
Department of linguistics at MIT to talk

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.730 
Department of linguistics at MIT to talk
to<00:00:12.120> David<00:00:12.330> possess<00:00:12.690> key<00:00:12.870> about<00:00:13.200> what<00:00:13.559> those

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
to David possess key about what those

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.040 
to David possess key about what those
similarities<00:00:14.519> are

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.840 

so<00:00:21.050> languages<00:00:21.950> are<00:00:22.040> obviously<00:00:22.370> very

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
so languages are obviously very

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.150 
so languages are obviously very
different<00:00:23.720> you<00:00:24.230> know<00:00:24.350> I<00:00:24.380> can't<00:00:24.770> understand

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
different you know I can't understand

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.500 
different you know I can't understand
somebody<00:00:25.460> speaking<00:00:25.730> Russian<00:00:26.119> that's<00:00:26.330> right

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
somebody speaking Russian that's right

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.269 
somebody speaking Russian that's right
but<00:00:26.960> you<00:00:27.530> look<00:00:27.680> at<00:00:27.770> how<00:00:27.830> they're<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.040> same

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
but you look at how they're the same

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.580 
but you look at how they're the same
right<00:00:28.610> well<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:29.210> words<00:00:29.390> are<00:00:29.600> different<00:00:29.930> right

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
right well the words are different right

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.549 
right well the words are different right
but<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.520> laws<00:00:32.000> that<00:00:32.390> make<00:00:32.780> that<00:00:33.080> make<00:00:33.290> up<00:00:33.410> the

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
but the laws that make that make up the

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.320 
but the laws that make that make up the
words<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.130> laws<00:00:34.309> that<00:00:34.790> combine<00:00:35.180> the

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
words and the laws that combine the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.270 
words and the laws that combine the
words<00:00:35.510> into<00:00:35.930> sentences<00:00:36.080> that<00:00:36.440> we<00:00:36.800> use<00:00:36.950> to

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
words into sentences that we use to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.060 
words into sentences that we use to
express<00:00:37.700> thoughts<00:00:38.350> many<00:00:39.350> of<00:00:39.500> them<00:00:39.620> turn<00:00:40.010> out

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
express thoughts many of them turn out

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.369 
express thoughts many of them turn out
to<00:00:40.250> be<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.489> same<00:00:40.670> across<00:00:40.879> languages<00:00:41.360> if<00:00:42.050> I

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
to be the same across languages if I

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.110 
to be the same across languages if I
said<00:00:43.100> hello<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.340> you<00:00:43.489> in<00:00:43.640> English<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.030> you

said hello to you in English and you

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.299 
said hello to you in English and you
answered<00:00:44.570> in<00:00:44.780> Russian<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:46.010> wouldn't

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
answered in Russian I wouldn't

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.770 
answered in Russian I wouldn't
understand<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.090> you're<00:00:47.449> saying<00:00:47.660> that

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780

understand you but you're saying that
the<00:00:48.350> way<00:00:48.379> that<00:00:48.739> you're<00:00:48.860> answering<00:00:49.309> is<00:00:49.460> not<00:00:49.610> so

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
the way that you're answering is not so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.160 
the way that you're answering is not so
different<00:00:50.210> from<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.510> way<00:00:50.600> that<00:00:50.750> I'm<00:00:50.840> asking

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
different from the way that I'm asking

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.500 
different from the way that I'm asking
exactly<00:00:51.559> or<00:00:52.010> if<00:00:52.100> even<00:00:52.699> if<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.030> know<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.330> words

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
exactly or if even if you know the words

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.630 
exactly or if even if you know the words
right<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.199> order<00:00:54.710> in<00:00:54.800> which<00:00:54.949> they<00:00:55.129> come<00:00:55.370> the

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
right the order in which they come the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.369 
right the order in which they come the
ways<00:00:55.790> in<00:00:55.970> which<00:00:56.000> they<00:00:56.239> combine<00:00:56.570> are<00:00:56.989> somewhat

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
ways in which they combine are somewhat

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.829 
ways in which they combine are somewhat
different<00:00:57.409> you<00:00:58.280> know<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.550> was<00:00:59.300> sentence<00:00:59.570> like

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
different you know it was sentence like

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.229 
different you know it was sentence like
you<00:01:00.080> know<00:01:00.199> John<00:01:00.800> has<00:01:01.129> written<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.030> letter

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
you know John has written the letter

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.360 
you know John has written the letter
would<00:01:02.930> come<00:01:03.229> out<00:01:03.290> in<00:01:03.559> Japanese<00:01:03.979> even

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
would come out in Japanese even

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.800 
would come out in Japanese even
forgetting<00:01:04.699> about<00:01:05.000> you<00:01:05.239> know<00:01:05.330> what<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:05.659> words

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
forgetting about you know what the words

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.050 
forgetting about you know what the words
are<00:01:06.049> is<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:06.590> know<00:01:06.740> John<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.310> letter<00:01:07.729> written

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
are is you know John the letter written

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.590 
are is you know John the letter written
has<00:01:08.420> right<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:10.010> laws<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:11.000> tell<00:01:11.450> you

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
has right so the laws that that tell you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.940 
has right so the laws that that tell you
the<00:01:11.750> order<00:01:11.960> in<00:01:12.049> which<00:01:12.170> words<00:01:12.350> come<00:01:12.620> in<00:01:12.710> English

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
the order in which words come in English

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.560 
the order in which words come in English
they're<00:01:13.159> different<00:01:13.430> from<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.700> ones<00:01:13.880> that

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
they're different from the ones that

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.810 
they're different from the ones that
govern<00:01:14.870> Japanese<00:01:15.310> but<00:01:16.310> it<00:01:16.400> turns<00:01:16.549> out<00:01:16.760> that

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
govern Japanese but it turns out that

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.330 
govern Japanese but it turns out that
they<00:01:17.120> differ<00:01:17.720> in<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:18.140> very<00:01:18.470> systematic<00:01:18.710> way<00:01:19.130> so

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
they differ in a very systematic way so

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.640 
they differ in a very systematic way so
there<00:01:19.940> are<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.510> know<00:01:20.570> lots<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:20.990> variations<00:01:21.500> in

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
there are you know lots of variations in

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.289 
there are you know lots of variations in
word<00:01:21.830> order<00:01:22.010> across<00:01:22.369> languages<00:01:22.909> but<00:01:23.119> there

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
word order across languages but there

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.580 
word order across languages but there
are<00:01:23.390> lots<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.690> variations<00:01:23.930> you<00:01:24.230> don't<00:01:24.440> get

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
are lots of variations you don't get

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.080 
are lots of variations you don't get
lots<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.070> kinds<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.400> languages<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:25.970> might

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
lots of kinds of languages you might

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.060 
lots of kinds of languages you might
imagine<00:01:26.300> exist<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:27.050> don't<00:01:27.200> exist<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:27.890> if<00:01:27.980> you

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
imagine exist that don't exist so if you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.410 
imagine exist that don't exist so if you
were<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.250> take<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.400> sentence<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.030> rearrange

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
were to take that sentence and rearrange

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.120 
were to take that sentence and rearrange
it<00:01:29.510> in<00:01:29.630> all<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.780> possible<00:01:30.140> ways<00:01:30.200> only<00:01:30.650> a<00:01:30.800> small

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
it in all the possible ways only a small

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.470 
it in all the possible ways only a small
set<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.400> them<00:01:31.550> are<00:01:31.730> actually<00:01:32.000> used<00:01:32.180> anywhere

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
set of them are actually used anywhere

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.690 
set of them are actually used anywhere
exactly<00:01:33.110> right<00:01:33.290> yeah<00:01:33.590> precisely<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.400> at<00:01:34.520> some

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
exactly right yeah precisely but at some

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.670 
exactly right yeah precisely but at some
point<00:01:34.750> in<00:01:35.750> everybody's<00:01:36.170> life<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.410> don't<00:01:36.560> have

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
point in everybody's life you don't have

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.560 
point in everybody's life you don't have
a<00:01:36.710> language<00:01:37.010> you're<00:01:37.100> learning<00:01:37.330> these<00:01:38.330> things

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
a language you're learning these things

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.870 
a language you're learning these things
for<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.780> first<00:01:38.990> time<00:01:39.230> is<00:01:40.040> is<00:01:40.340> there<00:01:40.520> something

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
for the first time is is there something

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.700 
for the first time is is there something
inherent<00:01:41.330> there<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.720> why<00:01:41.930> we<00:01:42.470> have

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
inherent there that why we have

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.500 
inherent there that why we have
similarities<00:01:43.430> in<00:01:43.790> all<00:01:43.880> languages<00:01:44.270> or<00:01:44.390> do<00:01:44.450> we

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
similarities in all languages or do we

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.540 
similarities in all languages or do we
even<00:01:44.630> know<00:01:44.810> well<00:01:45.620> let<00:01:45.830> me<00:01:45.860> know<00:01:45.980> on<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.310> one

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
even know well let me know on the one

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.310 
even know well let me know on the one
hand<00:01:46.760> it<00:01:46.970> looks<00:01:47.150> like<00:01:47.390> all<00:01:47.660> languages<00:01:48.170> are

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
hand it looks like all languages are

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.900 
hand it looks like all languages are
similar<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.070> speculate<00:01:49.550> that<00:01:49.580> that's

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
similar and so we speculate that that's

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.910 
similar and so we speculate that that's
because<00:01:50.270> there's<00:01:50.480> a<00:01:50.540> kind<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.930> master<00:01:51.710> plan

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
because there's a kind of a master plan

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.590 
because there's a kind of a master plan
or<00:01:51.950> blueprint<00:01:52.490> for<00:01:52.730> language<00:01:53.120> that<00:01:53.330> we<00:01:53.450> all

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
or blueprint for language that we all

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.810 
or blueprint for language that we all
have<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.470> then<00:01:54.590> what<00:01:54.680> we<00:01:54.800> expect<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.190> find<00:01:55.280> is

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
have and then what we expect to find is

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.430 
have and then what we expect to find is
that<00:01:55.850> when<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.390> look<00:01:56.750> at<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:56.990> process<00:01:57.170> of

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
that when you look at the process of

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.770 
that when you look at the process of
language<00:01:57.620> acquisition<00:01:58.070> by<00:01:58.640> by<00:01:59.270> children<00:01:59.660> by

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
language acquisition by by children by

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.600 
language acquisition by by children by
very<00:01:59.960> young<00:02:00.140> children<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.800> expect<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.460> find

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
very young children you expect to find

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.399 
very young children you expect to find
signs<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.150> that<00:02:02.240> loop<00:02:02.450> rent<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:02.870> you<00:02:02.900> expected

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
signs of that loop rent so you expected

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.520 
signs of that loop rent so you expected
to<00:02:04.070> find<00:02:04.550> children<00:02:04.870> acting<00:02:05.870> as<00:02:06.020> if<00:02:06.170> they<00:02:06.290> know

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
to find children acting as if they know

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.020 
to find children acting as if they know
things<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.040> they<00:02:07.190> haven't<00:02:07.400> actually<00:02:07.670> been

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
things that they haven't actually been

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.309 
things that they haven't actually been
taught<00:02:08.269> they<00:02:08.509> just<00:02:08.659> know<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:08.989> because<00:02:09.170> they're

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
taught they just know it because they're

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.140 
taught they just know it because they're
human<00:02:09.500> beings<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:10.069> way<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:10.250> know<00:02:10.459> bees<00:02:10.729> know

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
human beings the way you know bees know

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.940 
human beings the way you know bees know
you<00:02:11.780> know<00:02:11.900> how<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.110> behave<00:02:12.379> when<00:02:12.560> they<00:02:12.709> find

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
you know how to behave when they find

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.759 
you know how to behave when they find
honey<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.480> expect<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.170> kinds<00:02:15.620> of

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
honey and you expect that the kinds of

honey and you expect that the kinds of
evidence<00:02:16.730> from<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> linguistic

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
evidence from the linguistic

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.660 
evidence from the linguistic
environments<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.349> children<00:02:18.830> pay<00:02:19.220> attention

environments that children pay attention

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.030 
environments that children pay attention
to<00:02:19.879> will<00:02:20.330> also<00:02:20.629> be<00:02:20.750> limited<00:02:21.200> by<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.440> ways<00:02:21.800> in

research into language acquisition by
children<00:02:26.360> has<00:02:26.510> confirmed<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.959> my<00:02:27.739> children

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
children has confirmed that my children

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.890 
children has confirmed that my children
know<00:02:28.189> things<00:02:28.579> that<00:02:28.969> there's<00:02:29.209> no<00:02:29.420> evidence<00:02:29.840> for

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
know things that there's no evidence for

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.140 
know things that there's no evidence for
and<00:02:30.260> they<00:02:30.349> also<00:02:30.499> interestingly<00:02:30.980> fail<00:02:31.909> to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
and they also interestingly fail to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.890 
and they also interestingly fail to
learn<00:02:32.299> things

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
learn things

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.080 
learn things
that<00:02:33.140> there<00:02:33.769> might<00:02:33.920> be<00:02:33.950> evidence<00:02:34.430> for<00:02:34.519> because

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
that there might be evidence for because

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.819 
that there might be evidence for because
it's<00:02:35.239> not<00:02:35.450> part<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.019> what<00:02:36.170> they're<00:02:36.290> put<00:02:36.620> to

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
it's not part of what they're put to

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.470 
it's not part of what they're put to
learn<00:02:37.010> its<00:02:37.280> language<00:02:37.549> leaders<00:02:38.060> as<00:02:38.239> human

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
learn its language leaders as human

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.500 
learn its language leaders as human
beings<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.519> if<00:02:40.519> you<00:02:40.670> look<00:02:40.819> at<00:02:40.909> someone's<00:02:41.209> brain

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
beings so if you look at someone's brain

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.240 
beings so if you look at someone's brain
when<00:02:42.349> they're<00:02:42.500> learning<00:02:42.650> language<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.129> are

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
when they're learning language and are

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.569 
when they're learning language and are
using<00:02:43.519> language<00:02:43.849> can<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.390> see<00:02:44.569> any<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:44.810> this

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
using language can you see any of this

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.990 
using language can you see any of this
well<00:02:46.579> someday<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.560> answer<00:02:48.950> might<00:02:49.159> be<00:02:49.189> yes<00:02:49.430> so

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
well someday the answer might be yes so

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.970 
well someday the answer might be yes so
you<00:02:50.720> know<00:02:50.840> we<00:02:51.140> are<00:02:51.260> learning<00:02:51.470> more<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.920> more

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
you know we are learning more and more

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.539 
you know we are learning more and more
about<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.819> ways<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.090> which<00:02:53.359> language<00:02:54.109> is

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
about the ways in which language is

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.030 
about the ways in which language is
computed<00:02:55.549> in<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.760> brain<00:02:55.970> everyday<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.890> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
computed in the brain everyday but the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.589 
computed in the brain everyday but the
nitty-gritty<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.549> it<00:02:58.849> still<00:02:59.180> remains<00:02:59.450> a

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
nitty-gritty of it still remains a

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.690 
nitty-gritty of it still remains a
mystery<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.799> kinds<00:03:01.099> of<00:03:01.220> things<00:03:01.549> that

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
mystery so the kinds of things that

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.640 
mystery so the kinds of things that
linguists<00:03:02.420> discover<00:03:02.930> about<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.290> structure

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
linguists discover about the structure

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.129 
linguists discover about the structure

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.890 
know yet they don't have the answers to
that<00:03:18.530> yet<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.459> does<00:03:19.939> it<00:03:20.060> seem<00:03:20.269> like<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.750> work

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
that yet but does it seem like the work

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.089 
that yet but does it seem like the work
that<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.139> do<00:03:21.319> and<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.650> work<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:21.799> they<00:03:22.040> do

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
that you do and the work that they do

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.699 
that you do and the work that they do
are<00:03:22.519> moving<00:03:23.180> toward<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.450> same<00:03:23.599> goal<00:03:23.780> they

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
are moving toward the same goal they

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.890 
are moving toward the same goal they
said<00:03:24.889> I<00:03:24.920> have<00:03:25.099> to<00:03:25.340> write<00:03:25.970> ideas<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.599> extent

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
said I have to write ideas to the extent

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.839 
said I have to write ideas to the extent
to<00:03:26.959> which<00:03:27.049> we're<00:03:27.349> discovering<00:03:27.730> at<00:03:28.730> an

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
to which we're discovering at an

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.460 
to which we're discovering at an
abstract<00:03:29.090> level<00:03:29.329> how<00:03:29.720> languages<00:03:30.170> are<00:03:30.230> put

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
abstract level how languages are put

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.440 
abstract level how languages are put
together<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:31.220> we<00:03:31.400> know<00:03:31.579> that<00:03:31.879> you<00:03:32.180> know<00:03:32.299> it's

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
together and we know that you know it's

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.500 
together and we know that you know it's
the<00:03:32.599> brain<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.889> computes<00:03:33.889> that<00:03:34.069> stuff<00:03:34.510> we

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
the brain that computes that stuff we

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.059 
the brain that computes that stuff we
have<00:03:35.629> to<00:03:35.659> be<00:03:35.870> convergent<00:03:36.319> in<00:03:36.409> that<00:03:36.530> goal<00:03:36.739> when

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
have to be convergent in that goal when

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.379 
have to be convergent in that goal when
the<00:03:37.190> convergence<00:03:37.639> will<00:03:37.760> happen<00:03:38.090> well<00:03:38.209> that's

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
the convergence will happen well that's

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.339 
the convergence will happen well that's
the<00:03:38.480> mystery<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.930> me<00:03:39.019> too

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
the mystery to me too

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.960 
the mystery to me too
well<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.889> think<00:03:40.069> it's<00:03:40.280> really<00:03:40.370> exciting<00:03:40.669> and<00:03:40.879> I

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
well I think it's really exciting and I

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.789 
well I think it's really exciting and I
appreciate<00:03:41.419> you<00:03:41.510> telling<00:03:41.720> me<00:03:41.930> about<00:03:42.139> how<00:03:42.739> it

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
appreciate you telling me about how it

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.199 
appreciate you telling me about how it
works<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.160> think<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:43.489> very<00:03:43.549> exciting<00:03:43.669> -<00:03:44.000> thank

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
works I think it's very exciting - thank

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:53.130 
works I think it's very exciting - thank
you<00:03:44.269> very<00:03:44.299> much

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140
