00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.460
 Young people 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.869
 welcome guys in this new video 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 is it logical starter that I am here on gta 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.220
 line indeed today I want to talk about citi 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.259
 online and new updates that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 will put online subjects shortly and or 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.289
 that they put or the updates 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.480
 of crime pays part 1 and part ii 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.170
 or the crime pays part 1 is already 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 It was put this month while I think the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.990
 crime pays separately 2 will be put more into 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.680
 there indeed precisely the eighth of July of 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.020
 2015 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.580
 in a few days practically then 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.090
 guys I want to talk calmly for 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.340
 make you understand what I think 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.470
 so follow me carefully then 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.330
 guys how could you see who 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.860
 decides the crime pay part 1 ha 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.460
 added practically several vehicles 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.320
 that cost a fuck they cost a lot 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.199
 cars that cost more than a million i 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.689
 pegasus vehicles or the plane that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.749
 it costs 10 million only because it is golden 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.820
 and the helicopter that costs 5 million that 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:13.710
 before that it is gilded doing the calculation 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.189
 altogether of the food to cost on 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.979
 20 million more or less then is not accurate 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.109
 the calculation then boys will add 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.600
 also the second dlc of the crime pays 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.759
 part ii where others will add 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.289
 vehicles that will cost a lot 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.130
 then guys I think there are two 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.139
 reasons two valid reasons for me 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 for which they put these tools 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:39.630
 these gizmos let's call them that the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.240
 until the end vehicles and weapons and so on 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.020
 etc. that cost so in this way 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.119
 much 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 or the first reason is that the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.590
 rockstar wants to consume more money 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.149
 to people buying them jacques card 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.219
 doing so spending more money at 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.529
 people plus big money la knox 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.319
 will collect more money than it is 

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:04.590
 already earned and honest players between 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.450
 quotes will buy shark cards e 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.149
 you will never get a recovery done 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.860
 mod recovery would be those fashions that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.480
 commit more money than increase in the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.099
 rank etcetera etc. 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.300
 either because they are afraid of ban or 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.400
 because they don't want to give us 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.720
 5 euros a modem I prefer to go in 60 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.550
 the rock star to receive a million e 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.610
 enough while the second boys 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.910
 motivation is that the rockstar remove 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.330
 all menu modes of gt5 online for old 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.340
 January 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.530
 you will say what the fuck you care about 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.470
 rockstar of the old gen and so now yes 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.270
 is moved to next gen and pc no boys 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.600
 because it is not so 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.070
 practically with the u2 nu of the degen 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.990
 you can put the money to anoint 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.700
 etc. etc. is a bit of the can do 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.990
 the covip practically also on next 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.730
 gen who can create an account on old gen 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.120
 create it by putting rank established by 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.890
 buyer etc. etc. put i 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.090
 set money etc etc for 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.950
 then transfer it both to pc on next gen 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.200
 so the rock star loses us all in 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.030
 all categories or jane pc e 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.590
 next gen 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.630
 so it doesn't go much for the benefit of 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.920
 rockstar here is the rock star has indeed 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.080
 maybe he wants to remove 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.210
 I think it's a first thought is with 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.490
 these updates want to remove the 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.720
 fashions menu you say but what the fuck 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.680
 these updates have to do with that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.140
 they cost so much 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.640
 well guys as you know so far there are 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.370
 There are so many people who have 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.130
 purchased recovery on the consoles then 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.620
 consequently they have a lot of money and 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.910
 lots of money to spend 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.750
 then the rockstar wall and put these 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.850
 vehicles that cost so much so 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.260
 let people spend and make them stay 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.300
 dry making it remain dry then 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.640
 they will have to buy on a recovery 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.880
 but if in the next update i 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.510
 recovery mode menu will not work not 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.970
 there will be 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.730
 this player who will remain without money 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.540
 will have to buy a shark card 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.400
 to move forward 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.160
 maybe the state can't do in 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.470
 so all the players dry but there 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.239
 can decrease the money and with 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.970
 the time will end sooner or later 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.440
 cases of money if we do not there will be 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.600
 a fucking shelter 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.860
 the rock star wants to have everyone removed 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.169
 how much less does it always do so 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.540
 buy the shark card and come back 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.430
 always at that point it is buying the charts 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.370
 card the rock star will become more and more 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.289
 rich that I will put then will earn e 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.600
 boys so take it as mine 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.320
 thought my notice because if there 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.220
 take a day 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.620
 in other words, technology is there too 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.020
 works as reasoning 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.420
 while the third reason let's call it 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.970
 optional and that after the exit of the 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.920
 robbery has become a criminal 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.630
 virtually no offenses 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.000
 because they have to rob several banks 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.890
 and so on and so on 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.840
 crime pay is called the title and not 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.060
 for this the title is called the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.410
 therefore the crime pays the criminal he has 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.850
 given to do robberies if you want 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.680
 let's say get cool maybe he has to pay 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.520
 shell out broke brooches in beasts that 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.890
 fuck jackpot pays so he must shell out 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.020
 to be cool, well guys anyway 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.180
 this my thought let me know that 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.210
 what do you think if my thought 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.120
 according to you it works which of the three 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.340
 reasons according to you is more valid than 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.960
 what do you think about the veto because it is 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.580
 important for me to know what 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.260
 think you exist for this in 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.000

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.420

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.430
 and tell me later I liked it or not

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.450
