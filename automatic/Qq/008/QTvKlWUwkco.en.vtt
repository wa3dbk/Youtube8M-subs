00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
it's still in a 38 KO range so / that's
going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.369> right<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.420> an

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
going to be it right there is it an

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.719 
going to be it right there is it an
immobilization<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:59.159> clutch<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
immobilization that clutch from of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.490 
immobilization that clutch from of
mobilization<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.049> make<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.350> to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
mobilization is going to make it to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.940 
mobilization is going to make it to
where<00:02:01.649> /<00:02:01.890> ugly<00:02:02.329> it<00:02:03.329> only<00:02:03.600> knows<00:02:03.840> /<00:02:04.140> how<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
where / ugly it only knows / how is this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.719 
where / ugly it only knows / how is this
so<00:02:05.189> effective<00:02:06.590> it's<00:02:07.590> also<00:02:07.829> going<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.340> speed

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
so effective it's also going out speed

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
so effective it's also going out speed
the<00:02:08.849> Andy<00:02:09.179> palm<00:02:09.360> i'm<00:02:09.539> pretty<00:02:09.780> sure<00:02:09.989> cuz<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.289> i

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the Andy palm i'm pretty sure cuz like i

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.110 
the Andy palm i'm pretty sure cuz like i
think<00:02:10.739> probably<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.370> has<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> higher<00:02:11.910> base

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
think probably it has a higher base

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.160 
think probably it has a higher base
speed<00:02:12.360> right

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
speed right

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.410 
speed right
so<00:02:13.590> probably<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.670> use<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.060> attract

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so probably is going to use the attract

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.400 
so probably is going to use the attract
