00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
stationary so I'm not going to pull that

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.620 
stationary so I'm not going to pull that
back<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:15.100> stays<00:03:15.370> stationary<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:16.120> feel<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
back that stays stationary I feel the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.060 
back that stays stationary I feel the
hand<00:03:16.810> on<00:03:16.930> my<00:03:17.019> back<00:03:17.200> we<00:03:17.650> want<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:17.890> make<00:03:18.040> sure

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
hand on my back we want to make sure

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.390 
hand on my back we want to make sure

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
that we turn completely to fill that out

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.319 
that we turn completely to fill that out
fill<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.609> frame<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.090> was<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.239> good

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
fill the frame so it was a good

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.030 
fill the frame so it was a good
connection<00:03:22.630> in<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.049> hand<00:03:23.260> she's<00:03:23.440> pressing

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
connection in that hand she's pressing

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.800 
connection in that hand she's pressing
against<00:03:24.400> my<00:03:24.430> hand<00:03:24.760> without<00:03:25.000> pulling<00:03:25.299> my<00:03:25.600> arm

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
against my hand without pulling my arm

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.599 
against my hand without pulling my arm
out<00:03:26.079> of<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.650> position<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:27.250> it's<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.549> to

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
out of the position so it's you have to

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.460 
out of the position so it's you have to
understand<00:03:28.090> how<00:03:28.180> much<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.540> use<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.930> at<00:03:29.320> first

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
understand how much to use and at first

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.509 
understand how much to use and at first
you're<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:29.890> be<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.040> little<00:03:30.160> bit<00:03:30.340> heavy

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
you're going to be a little bit heavy

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.460 
you're going to be a little bit heavy
and<00:03:30.670> then<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:30.940> k-q<00:03:31.269> figuring<00:03:31.630> things<00:03:31.780> up<00:03:32.079> but

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
and then so k-q figuring things up but

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.900 
and then so k-q figuring things up but
if<00:03:32.560> I<00:03:32.650> release<00:03:32.950> her<00:03:33.130> she<00:03:33.280> won't<00:03:33.459> fall<00:03:33.670> she

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
if I release her she won't fall she

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.819 
if I release her she won't fall she
won't<00:03:34.090> even<00:03:34.239> move<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.170> if<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.530> were<00:03:35.620> putting

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
won't even move so if you were putting

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.380 
won't even move so if you were putting
too<00:03:36.100> much<00:03:36.250> pressure<00:03:36.459> on<00:03:36.700> my<00:03:36.940> shoulder<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.329> I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
too much pressure on my shoulder and I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.030 
too much pressure on my shoulder and I
pulled<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.720> then<00:03:37.900> you'd<00:03:38.049> see<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.350> pop<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
pulled it then you'd see that pop of the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.160 
pulled it then you'd see that pop of the
body<00:03:39.220> that's<00:03:39.459> too<00:03:39.700> much<00:03:39.820> boy<00:03:40.060> okay<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:40.930> let's
