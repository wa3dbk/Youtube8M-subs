00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:08.820
 and driving a motorcycle city is not any 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.010
 game to guarantee our integrity 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:21.480
 it is necessary that we take into account a 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:23.939
 caution series our best way to 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.099
 passive safety is the precaution you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.019
 speed of analysis of the situation of 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.730
 anticipation of the events of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.089
 capital to keep you standing on the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089
 motorcycle 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.230
 between your senses the ear to listen 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.660
 noises around you that alert you to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.900
 possible emergency situations 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.900
 trained horn sirens sudden turns 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.900
 overtaking 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.210
 and the view to see movements 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.190
 unexpected around you not only 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.870
 you must have everything under control to the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.760
 controls of your model but also 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.760
 you should see that in the other vehicles 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.400
 the touch to drive safely 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.240
 and gradually slow down the fort in case 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.890
 necessary without losing balance 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.729
 ah 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.930
 and try to always stop in a straight line 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.940
 gradually and combining the brake 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.260
 front with the back to avoid 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.229
 loss of grip on the train 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.780
 previous maximum concentration in 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.240
 intersections intersections traffic lights 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.700
 and give way at the entire intersection 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.300
 we will have to be careful 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.920
 regardless of whether or not 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.900
 controlled by a traffic light 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.790
 in the incorporations on board waves 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.560
 obvious we should keep the distance 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.450
 of security to avoid braking 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.890
 unexpected so much of those who go for 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.990
 in front of us to avoid 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.180
 impact it as for those who come by 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.100
 behind so that they do not overwhelm us 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.110
 Most motorcycle accidents 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.760
 produces on interurban roads increase 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.790
 precautions when driving and you do not 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.790
 play
