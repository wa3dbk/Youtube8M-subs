00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
play these games on the internet I mean

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
play these games on the internet I mean
you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.719> your<00:00:39.870> computer<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.399> need

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you know on your computer are you need

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.150 
you know on your computer are you need
an<00:00:41.790> emulator<00:00:42.480> which<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> basically<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
an emulator which is basically like the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.940 
an emulator which is basically like the
console<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.629> need<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.140> roms<00:00:46.410> which<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
console and you need the roms which is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.360 
console and you need the roms which is
like<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.370> games<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> emulator<00:00:49.500> i<00:00:49.620> use<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
like the games so the emulator i use and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.650 
like the games so the emulator i use and
i<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> best<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.860> project<00:00:52.860> 64

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
i think it's the best one is project 64

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.689 
i think it's the best one is project 64
which<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.110> there<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.699> that's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
which is that one there and that's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.540 
which is that one there and that's
basically<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.329> my<00:00:57.899> console<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:59.309> these

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
basically like my console and then these

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.540 
basically like my console and then these
are<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.910> games<00:01:00.590> but<00:01:01.590> um<00:01:01.800> yeah<00:01:02.520> so

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
are like the games but um yeah so

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.200 
are like the games but um yeah so
basically<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.260> open<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.680> your

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
basically what you do you open up your

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.920 
basically what you do you open up your
console<00:01:06.210> there<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.420> inserting

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
console there you this is like inserting

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.280 
console there you this is like inserting
a<00:01:10.170> thing<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.939> then<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> play<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.689> we'll

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
a thing and then you play it but we'll

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.210 
a thing and then you play it but we'll
get<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:15.409> downloading<00:01:16.409> some<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.920> go

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
get into actually downloading some so go

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.810 
get into actually downloading some so go
on<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.000 

now<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.960> know<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:24.140> could<00:01:24.440> probably<00:01:24.680> just

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
now you know you could probably just

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.690 
now you know you could probably just
type<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.430> into<00:01:25.550> google<00:01:26.120> google<00:01:26.750> if<00:01:27.550> you<00:01:28.550> know

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
type it into google google if you know

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.070 
type it into google google if you know
just<00:01:28.940> emulators<00:01:29.840> or<00:01:30.260> roms<00:01:31.190> or<00:01:31.729> n64<00:01:32.630> arms<00:01:32.930> or

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
just emulators or roms or n64 arms or

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.840 
just emulators or roms or n64 arms or
something<00:01:33.350> but<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:36.619> know<00:01:36.770> we'll<00:01:37.460> go<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.670> these

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
something but you know we'll go to these

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:49.000 
something but you know we'll go to these
funds<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.330> like<00:01:38.510> this<00:01:38.600> one

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.890 

so<00:01:49.730> here<00:01:49.940> we<00:01:50.060> are

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.340 

so<00:01:55.620> as<00:01:55.980> you<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.580> see<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.270> left<00:01:57.990> hand<00:01:58.230> side

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
so as you can see on the left hand side

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.290 
so as you can see on the left hand side
here<00:01:58.560> they've<00:01:59.520> got<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.330> these<00:02:00.750> games

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
here they've got like all these games

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.150 
here they've got like all these games
half<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.050> would<00:02:04.230> need<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.620> pay<00:02:04.830> for

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
half of them you would need to pay for

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.180 
half of them you would need to pay for
but<00:02:05.310> because<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.850> n64<00:02:06.480> is<00:02:06.780> old<00:02:07.050> you<00:02:07.410> can<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
but because the n64 is old you can do it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.070 
but because the n64 is old you can do it
and<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.170> they're<00:02:10.350> roms<00:02:10.680> you<00:02:11.310> said<00:02:12.080> first

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and then so they're roms you said first

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:37.120 
and then so they're roms you said first
you<00:02:13.260> need<00:02:13.700> emulator<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:18.260> for<00:02:19.260> emulators

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.280 

alright<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.570> found<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.960> n64<00:02:39.500> going

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.030 

click<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.129> emulators<00:02:45.849> over<00:02:46.090> there<00:02:47.040> just

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
click on the emulators over there just

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.490 
click on the emulators over there just
wait<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.609> to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:04.250 

blood

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
so there we are we've got emulators so

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.170 
so there we are we've got emulators so
here's<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> list<00:03:09.379> n64

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.610 

and<00:03:14.510> then<00:03:14.870> you've<00:03:15.019> got<00:03:15.170> these<00:03:15.319> emulators<00:03:17.620> so

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
and then you've got these emulators so

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.530 
and then you've got these emulators so
there<00:03:18.799> are<00:03:18.829> different<00:03:19.209> different<00:03:20.209> things
