of sink full of water and I can see
under<00:00:09.840> here<00:00:09.870> there's<00:00:10.290> no<00:00:10.880> no<00:00:11.880> leaking<00:00:13.549> from

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
under here there's no no leaking from

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.970 
under here there's no no leaking from
the<00:00:16.130> seal<00:00:17.130> there<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.660> want<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.740> if<00:00:19.830> it's

the seal there so now I want see if it's

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.590 
the seal there so now I want see if it's
gonna<00:00:20.160> come<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:21.080> for<00:00:22.080> my<00:00:22.380> newly<00:00:23.189> sealed<00:00:23.600> thing

gonna come out for my newly sealed thing

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:35.740 
gonna come out for my newly sealed thing
right<00:00:24.840> there<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:30.500> see<00:00:31.500> how<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.300> I

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:46.720 

pull<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.930> turn<00:00:37.710> this

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:01:39.320 

forget<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.880> plug<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> garbage

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:55.920 

those<00:01:39.450> vibrations

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.300 

the<00:01:56.930> way<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.110> tighten<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:57.710> down<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:58.040> think

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
the way to tighten this down I think

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.750 
the way to tighten this down I think
this<00:01:58.970> would<00:01:59.120> work<00:01:59.270> just<00:01:59.600> like<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.140> but

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
this would work just like it is but

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.820 
this would work just like it is but
here's<00:02:01.760> how<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:01.970> think<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:03.170> really<00:02:03.620> should<00:02:03.800> be

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
here's how I think it really should be

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.230 
here's how I think it really should be
done<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.820> know<00:02:04.940> hang<00:02:05.150> on<00:02:05.270> one<00:02:05.479> second<00:02:07.240> okay

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
done you know hang on one second okay

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.440 
done you know hang on one second okay
here<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:08.869> what<00:02:09.140> uh<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:10.250> removed<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:11.000> thing<00:02:11.240> and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
here is what uh I removed the thing and

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.560 
here is what uh I removed the thing and
there's<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.590> ring<00:02:12.800> up<00:02:12.950> there<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:14.090> I'm<00:02:14.180> sitting

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
there's the ring up there so I'm sitting

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.910 
there's the ring up there so I'm sitting
there<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:14.959> now<00:02:15.520> pull<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.640> down<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.830> know

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
there so now pull this down you know

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.000 
there so now pull this down you know
kind<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.420> well<00:02:20.720> if<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.470> pull<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:24.010> it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
kind of that's like well if I pull it it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.910 
kind of that's like well if I pull it it
goes<00:02:25.190> up<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.670> know<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:27.200> like<00:02:27.560> where<00:02:27.770> it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
goes up you know that's like where it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.570 
goes up you know that's like where it
wants<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.280> be<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:30.070> actually<00:02:31.070> could<00:02:31.459> be<00:02:31.550> a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
wants to be like actually could be a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.979 
wants to be like actually could be a
little<00:02:31.700> higher<00:02:31.940> yes<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.390> don't<00:02:32.540> know

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
little higher yes I don't know

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.080 
little higher yes I don't know
so<00:02:33.890> um<00:02:35.739> I'd<00:02:36.739> say<00:02:36.800> like<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.400> wants<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> be<00:02:37.820> there

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
so um I'd say like it wants to be there

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.400 
so um I'd say like it wants to be there
so<00:02:38.390> no<00:02:38.920> now<00:02:39.920> what<00:02:40.130> I'd<00:02:40.250> say<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:41.260> take<00:02:42.260> this

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
so no now what I'd say is take this

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.670 
so no now what I'd say is take this
plastic<00:02:42.980> ring<00:02:43.130> under<00:02:43.430> here<00:02:44.110> I'm<00:02:45.110> gonna<00:02:45.320> drag

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
plastic ring under here I'm gonna drag

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.680 
plastic ring under here I'm gonna drag
it<00:02:45.830> down<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:47.450> right<00:02:47.840> above<00:02:48.110> there<00:02:49.540> hold<00:02:50.540> on<00:02:50.630> a

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
it down just right above there hold on a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.699 
it down just right above there hold on a
second<00:02:52.720> okay<00:02:53.720> now<00:02:53.900> I've<00:02:54.110> done<00:02:54.320> that<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.500> there

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
second okay now I've done that so there

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.240 
second okay now I've done that so there
it<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.480> like<00:02:59.660> there's<00:02:59.840> no<00:03:00.130> upward<00:03:01.130> or

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
it is so like there's no upward or

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.440 
it is so like there's no upward or
downward<00:03:01.280> pressure<00:03:01.970> on<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:03.560> pipe<00:03:04.450> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
downward pressure on this this pipe the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.380 
downward pressure on this this pipe the
reason<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.840> thought<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:06.709> that<00:03:07.209> I'm<00:03:08.209> you

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
reason I thought of this is that I'm you

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.780 
reason I thought of this is that I'm you
know<00:03:08.480> I'm<00:03:08.570> gonna<00:03:08.690> screw<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.200> down<00:03:09.580> from<00:03:10.580> like

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
know I'm gonna screw it down from like

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.080 
know I'm gonna screw it down from like
where<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.239> right<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.350> then<00:03:13.090> this

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
where it is right here and then this

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.380 
where it is right here and then this
ring<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:16.040> acts<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:17.060> thing<00:03:17.360> that

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
ring this acts like the thing that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.740 
ring this acts like the thing that
secures<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:19.340> know<00:03:19.430> from<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.420> pipe

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
secures it you know from this this pipe

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.670 
secures it you know from this this pipe
from<00:03:21.530> here<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.519> this<00:03:22.700> one<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.180> kind<00:03:23.330> of<00:03:23.480> X<00:03:24.380> to

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
from here to this one it kind of X to

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.380 
from here to this one it kind of X to
secure<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.250> two<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:27.200> that's<00:03:27.410> one<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.680> them

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
secure the two and that's one of them

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.210 
secure the two and that's one of them
I'm<00:03:29.390> thinking<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.200> important<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:31.190> that

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
I'm thinking is important so that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.830 
I'm thinking is important so that
there's<00:03:31.519> no<00:03:32.440> unnecessary<00:03:34.390> pressure<00:03:35.390> on<00:03:35.630> the

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
there's no unnecessary pressure on the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.860 
there's no unnecessary pressure on the
thing<00:03:36.049> up<00:03:36.230> or<00:03:36.380> down<00:03:37.209> okay<00:03:38.209> so<00:03:38.269> here's<00:03:38.630> what<00:03:38.840> it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
thing up or down okay so here's what it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.430 
thing up or down okay so here's what it
looks<00:03:39.110> like<00:03:39.290> now<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:41.150> is<00:03:41.329> what<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:41.900> would

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
looks like now this is what I I would

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.550 
looks like now this is what I I would
say<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:44.180> how<00:03:44.299> it<00:03:44.450> is<00:03:44.600> supposed<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.049> be<00:03:45.140> how

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
say it's how it is supposed to be how

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.910 
say it's how it is supposed to be how
you're<00:03:45.709> supposed<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.100> do<00:03:46.280> that

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.729 

okay<00:03:51.920> here<00:03:52.189> it<00:03:52.340> is<00:03:52.430> I've<00:03:52.870> used<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.049> for<00:03:54.319> a

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
okay here it is I've used this for a

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.509 
okay here it is I've used this for a
couple<00:03:54.859> days<00:03:55.189> now<00:03:55.249> and<00:03:57.159> there<00:03:58.159> is<00:03:58.340> not

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
couple days now and there is not

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.580 
couple days now and there is not
anything<00:03:59.060> leaking<00:03:59.719> under<00:03:59.989> here<00:04:00.230> which<00:04:00.379> is

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
anything leaking under here which is

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.569 
anything leaking under here which is
good<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:01.810> then<00:04:02.810> I<00:04:03.109> don't<00:04:03.980> know<00:04:04.069> if<00:04:04.129> I<00:04:04.219> mention

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
good and then I don't know if I mention

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.270 
good and then I don't know if I mention
it<00:04:04.700> on<00:04:04.849> that<00:04:05.060> for<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.049> washer<00:04:06.829> that's<00:04:06.980> under

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
it on that for that washer that's under

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.830 
it on that for that washer that's under
the<00:04:07.400> white<00:04:08.439> ring<00:04:09.439> there<00:04:10.090> like<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.239> box<00:04:11.540> there

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
the white ring there like the box there

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.849 
the white ring there like the box there
it<00:04:11.930> says<00:04:12.170> that<00:04:12.980> pipe<00:04:13.579> thread<00:04:13.909> compound<00:04:14.859> that

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
it says that pipe thread compound that

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.490 
it says that pipe thread compound that
white<00:04:16.190> junk<00:04:16.639> that<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.090> not<00:04:17.449> required<00:04:17.930> if<00:04:18.259> you

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
white junk that is not required if you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.909 
white junk that is not required if you
have<00:04:19.120> if<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.269> use<00:04:20.479> like<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.079> ring<00:04:21.289> so

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
have if you use like that and ring so

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.939 
have if you use like that and ring so
then<00:04:22.910> like<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.300> know<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.509> the<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:24.710> other<00:04:24.740> side

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
then like you know on the the other side

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.939 
then like you know on the the other side
of<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.310> p-trap<00:04:25.729> there<00:04:26.560> there<00:04:27.560> is<00:04:27.680> one<00:04:27.830> of

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
of the p-trap there there is one of

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.339 
of the p-trap there there is one of
those<00:04:28.070> built<00:04:28.370> into<00:04:28.729> that<00:04:28.910> so<00:04:29.810> I'm<00:04:29.960> thinking

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
those built into that so I'm thinking

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.080 
those built into that so I'm thinking
maybe<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.800> don't<00:04:31.099> need<00:04:31.250> this<00:04:31.430> pipe<00:04:31.699> thread<00:04:32.000> to

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
maybe you don't need this pipe thread to

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.390 
maybe you don't need this pipe thread to
compound<00:04:32.539> for<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:32.900> either<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:34.039> that'll<00:04:34.280> be

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
compound for that either so that'll be

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.850 
compound for that either so that'll be
something<00:04:34.430> I'll<00:04:35.150> try<00:04:35.449> if<00:04:36.289> I<00:04:36.410> ever<00:04:36.530> have<00:04:36.740> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
something I'll try if I ever have to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.430 
something I'll try if I ever have to
take<00:04:37.009> this<00:04:37.160> apart<00:04:37.340> again<00:04:37.699> I'll<00:04:38.210> just<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:39.410> know

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
take this apart again I'll just you know

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.300 
take this apart again I'll just you know
get<00:04:39.710> rid<00:04:39.889> of<00:04:39.919> it

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
get rid of it

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.970 
get rid of it
see<00:04:40.580> if<00:04:40.699> it<00:04:40.789> works
