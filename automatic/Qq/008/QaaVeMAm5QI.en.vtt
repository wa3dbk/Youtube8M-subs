side<00:01:50.259> goes<00:01:50.439> where<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:51.220> when<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.430> put<00:01:51.549> them

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
side goes where so when you put them

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.859 
side goes where so when you put them
back<00:01:51.729> in<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.090> can<00:01:52.210> remember<00:01:52.390> where<00:01:52.630> they<00:01:52.750> are

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
back in you can remember where they are

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.469 
back in you can remember where they are
on<00:01:53.530> our<00:01:53.770> particular<00:01:53.920> style<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.909> wide<00:01:55.150> one<00:01:55.330> is

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
on our particular style the wide one is

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.359 
on our particular style the wide one is
on<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.630> left<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.619> narrow<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.130> on<00:01:57.250> the

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
on the left and the narrow one is on the

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.160 
on the left and the narrow one is on the
right<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:58.150> we<00:01:58.240> need<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.450> take<00:01:58.600> out<00:01:58.780> all<00:01:58.900> four<00:01:59.140> of

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
right so we need to take out all four of

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.929 
right so we need to take out all four of
these<00:01:59.350> all<00:01:59.860> these<00:02:00.130> screws<00:02:00.369> are<00:02:00.549> Phillips

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
these all these screws are Phillips

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.969 
these all these screws are Phillips
screws<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.900> use<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.079> Phillips<00:02:02.470> screwdriver<00:02:02.680> to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
screws so use a Phillips screwdriver to

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.850 
screws so use a Phillips screwdriver to
take<00:02:03.159> them<00:02:03.280> out

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.870 

also<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:09.950> make<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.190> easier<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.550> get<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.760> back

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
also to make it easier to get the back

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.750 
also to make it easier to get the back
panel<00:02:11.270> out<00:02:11.420> we<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.470> take<00:02:12.620> these<00:02:12.830> mounting

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
panel out we can take these mounting

panel out we can take these mounting
clips<00:02:14.030> off<00:02:15.460> they<00:02:16.460> should<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.850> pop<00:02:17.030> off<00:02:17.270> if

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
clips off they should just pop off if
