controlled<00:00:19.470> midfield<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.980> think<00:00:20.160> he's<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
controlled midfield I think he's a

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
controlled midfield I think he's a
fantastic<00:00:20.760> ball<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> way<00:00:21.630> he<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.900> handed

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
fantastic ball on the way he just handed

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.679

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
himself if every Arsenal player was

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.330 
himself if every Arsenal player was
playing<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> passion<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.830> desire<00:00:26.010> that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
playing with the passion and desire that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.620 
playing with the passion and desire that
Jack<00:00:26.760> Wilshere<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.180> playing<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.510> today

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
Jack Wilshere was playing with today

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.790 
Jack Wilshere was playing with today
then<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:27.990> wouldn't<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.349> problem<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
then we wouldn't have a problem as a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.640 
then we wouldn't have a problem as a
club<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.539> other<00:00:30.689> talking<00:00:30.929> point<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.410> think

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
club but the other talking point I think

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.990 
club but the other talking point I think
it's<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.160> decision<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> referee

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's really the decision that a referee

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330 
it's really the decision that a referee
made<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.390> at<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> start<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> game<00:00:34.340> for

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
made right at the start of the game for

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.680 
made right at the start of the game for
me<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.090> where<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.270> seemed<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
me I was right that's where I seemed I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.389 
me I was right that's where I seemed I
sit<00:00:36.989> right<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> could<00:00:37.829> see<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:37.950> had

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
sit right there so I could see very had

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.490 
sit right there so I could see very had
a<00:00:38.430> very<00:00:38.700> clear<00:00:38.940> view<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.050> was<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.350> on

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
a very clear view of what was going on

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770 
a very clear view of what was going on
and<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:40.829> definitely<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> penalty<00:00:41.969> Rob<00:00:42.629> be

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
and it was definitely a penalty Rob be

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
and it was definitely a penalty Rob be
tackled<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> man<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.590> floor<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.700> I'm<00:00:44.789> not

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
tackled a man to the floor but I'm not

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.100 
tackled a man to the floor but I'm not
sure<00:00:45.120> about<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.450> send<00:00:45.629> enough<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.899> couldn't

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
sure about to send enough I couldn't

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020 
sure about to send enough I couldn't
quite<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.649> he<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> last<00:00:47.250> man<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.730> I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
quite see if he was the last man and I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.790 
quite see if he was the last man and I
think<00:00:48.239> they're<00:00:48.360> sending<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.559> just

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
think they're sending off kind of just

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.889 
think they're sending off kind of just
made<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> end<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> game<00:00:51.300> or<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> result<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
made the end of the game or a result of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.630 
made the end of the game or a result of
the<00:00:52.020> game<00:00:52.140> inevitable<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.309> point<00:00:53.550> was

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the game inevitable from that point was

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.729 
the game inevitable from that point was
gonna<00:00:53.760> lose<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.660> why<00:00:54.870> did<00:00:55.110> he<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.559> mean

the the new year off to a good start and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.390 
the the new year off to a good start and
I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.710> he's<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.070> bit<00:01:17.250> nervous

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I think he's just a little bit nervous

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.770 
I think he's just a little bit nervous
that's<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.119> say<00:01:18.240> look<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.540> nervous

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that's all like I say look we nervous

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.969 
that's all like I say look we nervous
that<00:01:18.900> started<00:01:19.200> gave<00:01:19.290> me<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> lack<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> composure

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
that started gave me a lack of composure

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.499 
that started gave me a lack of composure
that<00:01:20.670> he<00:01:20.759> needed<00:01:20.970> right<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.450> point

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that he needed right at that point

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.910 
that he needed right at that point
against<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> good<00:01:22.259> player<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> think

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
against a good player like well I think

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.320 
against a good player like well I think
it<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.189> Jack<00:01:23.340> Oleg<00:01:23.610> pulled<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> can't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it was Jack Oleg pulled down I can't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.030 
it was Jack Oleg pulled down I can't
quite<00:01:24.479> remember<00:01:24.630> his<00:01:24.900> echoed<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> pulldown<00:01:25.590> bit

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
quite remember his echoed a pulldown bit

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.320 
quite remember his echoed a pulldown bit
more<00:01:26.189> composure<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.000> he<00:01:27.090> would<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.299> been

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
more composure and he would have been

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.030 
more composure and he would have been
