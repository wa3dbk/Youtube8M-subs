welcome back settling here today I've
got<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.550> cool<00:00:02.730> commandblock<00:00:03.300> contraption<00:00:03.810> for

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
got a cool commandblock contraption for

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.140 
got a cool commandblock contraption for
you<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.130> way<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.310> create<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.730> speedometer

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
you it's a way to create a speedometer

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.360 
you it's a way to create a speedometer
out<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.930> your<00:00:07.109> experience<00:00:07.319> bar<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:08.220> if<00:00:08.309> you

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
out of your experience bar so if you

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.250 
out of your experience bar so if you
look<00:00:08.519> at<00:00:08.610> my<00:00:08.700> experience<00:00:09.150> bar<00:00:09.360> you'll<00:00:09.960> notice

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
look at my experience bar you'll notice

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.259 
look at my experience bar you'll notice
when<00:00:10.410> I'm<00:00:10.530> not<00:00:10.710> moving<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.280> at<00:00:11.610> zero<00:00:11.910> when<00:00:12.210> I

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
when I'm not moving it's at zero when I

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.330 
when I'm not moving it's at zero when I
start<00:00:12.660> moving<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:13.290> goes<00:00:13.500> up<00:00:13.710> about<00:00:13.920> half<00:00:14.130> way

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
start moving it goes up about half way

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.129 
start moving it goes up about half way
if<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.910> go<00:00:15.000> ahead<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.240> hold<00:00:15.330> shift<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.960> start

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
if I go ahead and hold shift and start

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.160 
if I go ahead and hold shift and start
moving<00:00:16.289> notice<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:16.949> very<00:00:17.220> low<00:00:17.520> if<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.600> sprint

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
moving notice it's very low if I sprint

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.740 
moving notice it's very low if I sprint
around<00:00:19.470> goes<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.789> lot<00:00:21.000> higher<00:00:21.180> there's<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
around goes up a lot higher there's a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.029 
around goes up a lot higher there's a
little<00:00:21.900> bit<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.050> jitter<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> experience

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
little bit of jitter in the experience

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.800 
little bit of jitter in the experience
bar<00:00:23.279> speedometer<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.420> works<00:00:24.570> pretty<00:00:24.720> well

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
bar speedometer but it works pretty well

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.150 
bar speedometer but it works pretty well
and<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.910> basically<00:00:27.420> made<00:00:27.689> possible<00:00:28.140> by<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and it's basically made possible by the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.410 
and it's basically made possible by the
fact<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.519> Mojang<00:00:30.029> fixed<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.420> bug<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
fact that Mojang fixed a bug with the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.490 
fact that Mojang fixed a bug with the
static<00:00:33.420> walk<00:00:33.989> 1cm<00:00:35.210> objective<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.320> most

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
static walk 1cm objective in the most

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830 
static walk 1cm objective in the most
recent<00:00:37.770> snapshot<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:39.360> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> cool<00:00:39.750> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
recent snapshot but it's kind of cool to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.959 
recent snapshot but it's kind of cool to
play<00:00:39.930> around<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.290> actually<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.820> walk

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
play around with actually so if I walk

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.569 
play around with actually so if I walk
around<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.440> saw<00:00:43.620> before<00:00:43.829> I'll<00:00:44.430> have

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
around like like we saw before I'll have

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.700 
around like like we saw before I'll have
about<00:00:45.120> half<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.780> bar<00:00:45.930> filled<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
about half of the bar filled up and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290 
about half of the bar filled up and
there's<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> little<00:00:47.550> bit<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.789> jitter<00:00:48.030> just

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
there's a little bit of jitter just

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.540 
there's a little bit of jitter just
because<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.809> client<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> server<00:00:49.550> aren't

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
because the client and the server aren't

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.189 
because the client and the server aren't
perfectly<00:00:51.239> synchronized<00:00:51.510> even<00:00:52.110> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
perfectly synchronized even in

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.319 
perfectly synchronized even in
single-player<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.180> walk

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
single-player but if you just walk

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.770 
single-player but if you just walk
straight<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:54.930> pretty<00:00:55.170> good<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.660> can

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
straight it's pretty good and so you can

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
straight it's pretty good and so you can
send<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> difference

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
send it kind of see the difference

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.709 
send it kind of see the difference
between<00:00:58.949> different<00:00:59.489> modes<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.910> moving<00:01:00.539> around

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
between different modes of moving around

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.200 
between different modes of moving around
so<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.109> Sprint's<00:01:01.649> you'll<00:01:02.280> see<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.730> gets

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
so if I Sprint's you'll see it gets

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.520 
so if I Sprint's you'll see it gets
about<00:01:03.449> three-quarters<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> bar<00:01:04.320> rather

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
about three-quarters of the bar rather

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
about three-quarters of the bar rather
than<00:01:04.680> half<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.489> guess<00:01:06.180> sprinting<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.780> about

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
than half so I guess sprinting is about

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.160 
than half so I guess sprinting is about
50%<00:01:07.650> faster<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.659> don't<00:01:09.659> know<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:09.869> know

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
50% faster I don't know actually know

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.719 
50% faster I don't know actually know
the<00:01:10.290> numbers<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.280> that's<00:01:11.580> probably

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the numbers so I think that's probably

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760 
the numbers so I think that's probably
true<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.590> sure

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
true but I don't know for sure

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
true but I don't know for sure
holding<00:01:14.580> shift<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.939> very<00:01:15.119> slow<00:01:15.500> one<00:01:16.500> cool

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
holding shift is very slow one cool

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.410 
holding shift is very slow one cool
thing<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.220> I've<00:01:17.700> known<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> while<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
thing is I've known this for a while I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.969 
thing is I've known this for a while I
don't<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.630> how<00:01:18.780> commonly<00:01:19.140> known<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
don't know how commonly known this is

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
don't know how commonly known this is
but<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.790> actually<00:01:21.119> hold<00:01:21.659> both<00:01:21.930> forward

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
but if you actually hold both forward

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.350 
but if you actually hold both forward
and<00:01:22.740> strafe<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.549> left<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.030> as

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and strafe to the left or the right as

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.109 
and strafe to the left or the right as
you're<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.939> sneaking<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.060> know

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
you're as you're sneaking you know

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.030 
you're as you're sneaking you know
shifting<00:01:27.540> whatever<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.590> quite

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
shifting whatever you actually go quite

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.620 
shifting whatever you actually go quite
a<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.220> faster<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:30.060> about<00:01:30.210> two<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
a bit faster so I have about two and a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
a bit faster so I have about two and a
half<00:01:30.659> bars<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.560> experience<00:01:31.979> part<00:01:32.159> filled

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
half bars of my experience part filled

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.780 
half bars of my experience part filled
up<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.270> press<00:01:33.540> both<00:01:33.869> D<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> W<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.759> can

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
up now if I press both D and W you can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.920 
up now if I press both D and W you can
see<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.090> about<00:01:36.180> three<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> half<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
see it's about three and a half and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.480 
see it's about three and a half and
sometimes<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.439> jump<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.250> too

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
sometimes will jump up a little bit too

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.149 
sometimes will jump up a little bit too
so<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> actually<00:01:39.600> go<00:01:39.750> quite<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.439> faster<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
so you actually go quite a bit faster I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
so you actually go quite a bit faster I
think<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.509> less<00:01:42.630> than

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
think it's about a little bit less than

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.370 
think it's about a little bit less than
50%<00:01:43.079> faster<00:01:43.530> by<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.700> holding<00:01:45.180> both<00:01:45.570> forward

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
50% faster by I'm holding both forward

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.050 
50% faster by I'm holding both forward
and<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> right<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.549> forward<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and to the right or forward in to the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
and to the right or forward in to the
left<00:01:48.240> while<00:01:48.810> you're<00:01:48.960> holding<00:01:49.380> shift<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
left while you're holding shift so

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.530 
left while you're holding shift so
that's<00:01:50.070> something<00:01:50.250> cool<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.000> see

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that's something cool that you can see

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.469 
that's something cool that you can see
very<00:01:51.810> easily<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> speedometer<00:01:53.119> if<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.299> go

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
very easily with a speedometer if I go

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.429 
very easily with a speedometer if I go
ahead<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.659> drink<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.960> potion<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.320> swiftness

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
ahead and drink this potion of swiftness

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.399 
ahead and drink this potion of swiftness
and<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:57.240> start<00:01:57.540> running<00:01:57.630> around<00:01:58.020> you'll<00:01:58.350> see

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and I start running around you'll see

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.420 
and I start running around you'll see
even<00:01:58.979> without<00:01:59.219> sprinting<00:02:00.229> obviously<00:02:01.229> my

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
even without sprinting obviously my

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.170 
even without sprinting obviously my
speedometer<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.549> showing<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:02.969> higher

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
speedometer is showing a little higher

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.160 
speedometer is showing a little higher
if<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.509> sprints

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
if I do sprints

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.889 
if I do sprints
it<00:02:04.649> goes<00:02:04.829> up<00:02:05.070> almost<00:02:05.670> full<00:02:05.850> I've<00:02:06.360> got<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> potion

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it goes up almost full I've got a potion

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.919 
it goes up almost full I've got a potion
of<00:02:06.930> swiftness<00:02:07.369> this<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.580> speed<00:02:08.879> two<00:02:09.209> right

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
of swiftness this one speed two right

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.790 
of swiftness this one speed two right
now<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.170> speed<00:02:10.379> one

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
now I have speed one

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.420 
now I have speed one
speed<00:02:12.070> too<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:13.180> let's<00:02:13.390> see<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.690> one

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
speed too so let's see this one

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.160 
speed too so let's see this one
obviously<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:15.940> gonna<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.180> even<00:02:16.420> faster<00:02:16.600> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
obviously it's gonna be even faster and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.350 
obviously it's gonna be even faster and
if<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.500> go<00:02:17.740> ahead<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.890> sprint<00:02:18.250> sometimes<00:02:18.760> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
if I go ahead and sprint sometimes the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.450 
if I go ahead and sprint sometimes the
experience<00:02:19.570> bar<00:02:19.930> will<00:02:20.260> even<00:02:20.530> wrap<00:02:20.680> over<00:02:20.890> to

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
experience bar will even wrap over to

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.620 
experience bar will even wrap over to
level<00:02:22.360> five<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.460> you'll<00:02:24.460> hear<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.790> sound<00:02:25.000> that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
level five so you'll hear the sound that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.340 
level five so you'll hear the sound that
it's<00:02:25.810> associated<00:02:26.110> with<00:02:26.380> leveling<00:02:26.740> up<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.540> kind

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
it's associated with leveling up so kind

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.260 
it's associated with leveling up so kind
of<00:02:29.470> speed<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.310> is<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.670> limit<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.060> what<00:02:31.240> the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
of speed to is the limit of what the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.140 
of speed to is the limit of what the
speedometer<00:02:31.870> will<00:02:32.170> accurately<00:02:32.470> read<00:02:32.920> out

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
speedometer will accurately read out

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.430 
speedometer will accurately read out
let's<00:02:34.150> go<00:02:34.360> ahead<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.810> take<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.050> look<00:02:35.230> at<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.780 
let's go ahead and take a look at the
commands<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.980> I'm<00:02:36.070> using<00:02:36.250> here<00:02:36.610> to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
commands that I'm using here to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.610 
commands that I'm using here to
accomplish<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.540> effect<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.380> all<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
accomplish this effect this is all the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.780 
accomplish this effect this is all the
Redstone<00:02:38.770> there's<00:02:39.160> not<00:02:39.280> much<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.610> it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
Redstone there's not much to it

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.690 
Redstone there's not much to it
and<00:02:40.470> it's<00:02:41.470> pretty<00:02:41.650> simple<00:02:41.860> how<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.220> works<00:02:42.430> but

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
and it's pretty simple how it works but

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.340 
and it's pretty simple how it works but
it<00:02:42.850> does<00:02:43.000> take<00:02:43.240> advantage<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.900> some<00:02:44.140> cool

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
it does take advantage of some cool

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.790 
it does take advantage of some cool
aspects<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.130> way<00:02:45.280> redstone<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.590> ordered<00:02:47.590> or

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
aspects the way redstone is ordered or

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.620 
aspects the way redstone is ordered or
the<00:02:48.010> way<00:02:48.100> command<00:02:48.430> blocks<00:02:48.640> are<00:02:48.850> ordered<00:02:49.360> first

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
the way command blocks are ordered first

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.470 
the way command blocks are ordered first
of<00:02:49.810> all<00:02:50.610> I'm<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> go<00:02:51.910> ahead<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.210> clear

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
of all I'm going to go ahead and clear

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.180 
of all I'm going to go ahead and clear
my<00:02:52.570> effects<00:02:52.900> because<00:02:53.320> those<00:02:53.710> particles<00:02:54.130> are

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
my effects because those particles are

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.260 
my effects because those particles are
knowing<00:02:54.900> okay<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.860> clock<00:02:57.160> here<00:02:57.460> is<00:02:57.730> what

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
knowing okay so the clock here is what

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.260 
knowing okay so the clock here is what
runs<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.990> whole<00:02:59.200> thing<00:02:59.620> this<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:01.060> two

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
runs the whole thing this is just two

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.820 
runs the whole thing this is just two
repeaters<00:03:01.630> pointing<00:03:02.140> at<00:03:02.230> each<00:03:02.260> other<00:03:02.560> and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
repeaters pointing at each other and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.740 
repeaters pointing at each other and
they<00:03:03.040> form<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.340> little<00:03:03.520> clock<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.570> first

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
they form a little clock so the first

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.210 
they form a little clock so the first
thing<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:04.930> happens<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.380> we<00:03:05.560> fill<00:03:05.830> up<00:03:05.950> an<00:03:06.070> area

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
thing that happens is we fill up an area

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.510 
thing that happens is we fill up an area
with<00:03:06.400> redstone<00:03:06.700> blocks<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.390> then<00:03:07.870> after<00:03:08.710> two

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
with redstone blocks and then after two

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.270 
with redstone blocks and then after two
game<00:03:09.760> ticks<00:03:10.030> or<00:03:10.210> one<00:03:10.330> redstone<00:03:10.510> tick<00:03:10.990> we<00:03:11.890> fill

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
game ticks or one redstone tick we fill

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.950 
game ticks or one redstone tick we fill
up<00:03:12.460> that<00:03:12.490> same<00:03:12.910> area<00:03:13.210> with<00:03:13.330> wool<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:13.810> can

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
up that same area with wool so we can

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.600 
up that same area with wool so we can
see<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.260> going<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.590> here<00:03:14.890> it's<00:03:15.250> filling<00:03:15.520> up

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
see that going on here it's filling up

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.980 
see that going on here it's filling up
with<00:03:15.670> redstone<00:03:16.120> blocks<00:03:16.330> then<00:03:16.570> filling<00:03:16.870> up

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
with redstone blocks then filling up

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.590 
with redstone blocks then filling up
with<00:03:17.140> Red<00:03:17.320> Bull<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.390> what's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
with Red Bull and so this is what's

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.120 
with Red Bull and so this is what's
triggering<00:03:20.110> all<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.590> these<00:03:20.709> command<00:03:21.100> blocks

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
triggering all of these command blocks

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.130 
triggering all of these command blocks
and<00:03:22.060> these<00:03:22.180> command<00:03:22.480> blocks<00:03:22.540> are<00:03:22.810> what<00:03:22.930> the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
and these command blocks are what the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.910 
and these command blocks are what the
are<00:03:23.620> what<00:03:23.830> make<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.240> speedometer<00:03:25.240> go<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
are what make the speedometer go so the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.620 
are what make the speedometer go so the
cool<00:03:27.130> thing<00:03:27.160> about<00:03:27.370> this<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:28.060> we<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.420> actually

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
cool thing about this is we can actually

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.540 
cool thing about this is we can actually
determine<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.350> order<00:03:29.530> in<00:03:29.650> which<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.280> command

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
determine the order in which the command

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.400 
determine the order in which the command
blocks<00:03:30.760> are<00:03:30.880> going<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.060> happen<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.480> if<00:03:32.290> I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
blocks are going to happen and if I

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.800 
blocks are going to happen and if I
press<00:03:32.590> f3<00:03:32.860> you'll<00:03:33.370> see<00:03:33.610> right<00:03:34.570> now<00:03:34.720> I'm

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
press f3 you'll see right now I'm

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.510 
press f3 you'll see right now I'm
looking<00:03:34.930> in<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.170> positive<00:03:35.410> x-direction<00:03:35.950> and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
looking in the positive x-direction and

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.070 
looking in the positive x-direction and
then<00:03:36.970> if<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.180> look<00:03:37.300> this<00:03:37.450> way<00:03:37.510> I'm<00:03:37.750> looking<00:03:37.840> at

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
then if I look this way I'm looking at

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.250 
then if I look this way I'm looking at
the<00:03:38.230> positive<00:03:38.620> z<00:03:38.770> direction<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:40.110> when<00:03:41.110> you

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
the positive z direction so when you

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.010 
the positive z direction so when you
organize<00:03:42.240> redstone<00:03:43.240> blocks<00:03:43.480> like<00:03:43.660> this<00:03:43.810> and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
organize redstone blocks like this and

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.840 
organize redstone blocks like this and
have<00:03:44.140> an<00:03:44.230> area<00:03:44.440> filled<00:03:44.620> up<00:03:44.830> turns<00:03:45.340> out<00:03:45.580> that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
have an area filled up turns out that

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.110 
have an area filled up turns out that
the<00:03:46.000> way<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.140> game<00:03:47.440> runs<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.640> commands

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
the way that the game runs the commands

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.720 
the way that the game runs the commands
is<00:03:49.270> always<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.720> same<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.459> basically<00:03:51.459> you'll

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
is always the same and basically you'll

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.440 
is always the same and basically you'll
start<00:03:52.270> at<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:53.050> lowest<00:03:53.950> x<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.700> z<00:03:54.850> value<00:03:55.240> and

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
start at the lowest x and z value and

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.540 
start at the lowest x and z value and
first<00:03:56.140> it'll<00:03:56.410> go<00:03:56.590> count<00:03:56.980> up<00:03:57.130> in<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.400> X

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
first it'll go count up in the X

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.160 
first it'll go count up in the X
positive<00:03:57.850> x-direction<00:03:58.330> so<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:58.870> gonna<00:03:58.959> run

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
positive x-direction so it's gonna run

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.920 
positive x-direction so it's gonna run
all<00:03:59.350> of<00:03:59.380> these<00:03:59.590> first<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.310> then<00:04:01.150> it'll<00:04:01.630> go<00:04:01.900> to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
all of these first and then it'll go to

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.770 
all of these first and then it'll go to
the<00:04:02.110> next<00:04:02.350> row<00:04:03.160> in<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.550> Z<00:04:03.790> which<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.300> this<00:04:04.600> is

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
the next row in the Z which is this is

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.110 
the next row in the Z which is this is
the<00:04:04.900> second<00:04:05.230> row<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:06.250> z<00:04:06.430> coordinates<00:04:06.880> and

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
the second row in the z coordinates and

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.820 
the second row in the z coordinates and
it'll<00:04:07.420> run<00:04:07.540> all<00:04:07.570> these<00:04:07.870> command<00:04:08.290> blocks<00:04:08.530> and

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
it'll run all these command blocks and

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.699 
it'll run all these command blocks and
then<00:04:09.520> it'll<00:04:09.700> go<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.090> next<00:04:10.180> row<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.709> and

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
then it'll go to the next row and and

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.990 
then it'll go to the next row and and
it'll<00:04:11.950> run<00:04:12.070> all<00:04:12.190> these<00:04:12.280> command<00:04:12.610> blocks<00:04:12.670> so

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
it'll run all these command blocks so

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.760 
it'll run all these command blocks so
this<00:04:13.209> one<00:04:13.450> is<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.750> last<00:04:14.050> command<00:04:14.380> block<00:04:14.620> that

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
this one is the last command block that

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.590 
this one is the last command block that
gets<00:04:14.920> run<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:15.850> take<00:04:16.030> advantage<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.480> that

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
gets run so I take advantage of that

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.190 
gets run so I take advantage of that
with<00:04:16.870> this<00:04:17.020> contraption<00:04:18.000> because<00:04:19.020> if<00:04:20.020> you'll

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
with this contraption because if you'll

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.230 
with this contraption because if you'll
notice<00:04:20.530> if<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.250> go<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.400> game-mode<00:04:21.729> 0<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:22.090> never

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
notice if I go to game-mode 0 you never

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.110 
notice if I go to game-mode 0 you never
see<00:04:22.570> my<00:04:22.930> experience<00:04:23.440> bar<00:04:23.650> lower<00:04:24.220> than<00:04:24.550> level

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
see my experience bar lower than level

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.420 
see my experience bar lower than level
or<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.449> have<00:04:25.900> this<00:04:26.080> this<00:04:26.500> number<00:04:26.889> four<00:04:27.100> always

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
or I have this this number four always

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.790 
or I have this this number four always
present<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.180> my<00:04:28.720> experience<00:04:29.169> bar<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.590> always

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
present and my experience bar is always

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.730 
present and my experience bar is always
at<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.550> low<00:04:30.639> for<00:04:30.940> at<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.240> minimum<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.750> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
at the low for at the minimum and the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.520 
at the low for at the minimum and the
way<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:32.860> achieve<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:33.550> is<00:04:33.850> by<00:04:34.229> basically<00:04:35.229> every

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
way I achieve this is by basically every

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.290 
way I achieve this is by basically every
time<00:04:35.770> this<00:04:36.220> clock<00:04:36.460> runs<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.000> we<00:04:37.060> get<00:04:37.180> all

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
time this clock runs and we get all

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.730 
time this clock runs and we get all
these<00:04:37.419> redstone<00:04:37.840> blocks<00:04:38.139> to<00:04:38.320> fill<00:04:38.470> up<00:04:38.590> the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
these redstone blocks to fill up the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.980 
these redstone blocks to fill up the
area<00:04:39.040> first<00:04:39.910> we<00:04:40.120> take<00:04:40.300> away<00:04:40.540> a<00:04:40.570> hundred<00:04:40.840> levels

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
area first we take away a hundred levels

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.379 
area first we take away a hundred levels
which<00:04:41.350> basically<00:04:42.160> just<00:04:42.490> sets<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.790> players

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
which basically just sets the players

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.170 
which basically just sets the players
level<00:04:43.930> down<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:44.350> zero<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.010> then<00:04:45.699> we<00:04:45.790> add<00:04:45.910> four

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
level down to zero and then we add four

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.390 
level down to zero and then we add four
levels<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:46.750> these<00:04:47.260> happen<00:04:47.710> in<00:04:47.889> the<00:04:48.010> exact

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
levels and these happen in the exact

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.670 
levels and these happen in the exact
same<00:04:48.639> tick<00:04:48.970> they're<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.229> player<00:04:50.410> doesn't

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
same tick they're the player doesn't

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.260 
same tick they're the player doesn't
have<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.800> chance<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.220> see<00:04:51.430> their<00:04:51.639> experience<00:04:52.120> by

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
have a chance to see their experience by

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.870 
have a chance to see their experience by
our<00:04:52.330> drop<00:04:52.600> down<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.900> zero<00:04:53.139> before<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.830> gets<00:04:54.070> set

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
our drop down to zero before it gets set

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.379 
our drop down to zero before it gets set
back<00:04:54.910> up<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.479> four<00:04:55.720> so<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.919> then<00:04:57.910> all<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.240> these

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
back up to four so and then all of these

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.330 
back up to four so and then all of these
command<00:04:58.720> blocks<00:04:58.780> run<00:04:59.350> in<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.770> same<00:04:59.919> tick<00:05:00.160> as

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
command blocks run in the same tick as

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.020 
command blocks run in the same tick as
well<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:01.000> first<00:05:01.900> we<00:05:02.199> add<00:05:02.500> one<00:05:03.130> experience

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
well so first we add one experience

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.590 
well so first we add one experience
point<00:05:04.330> if<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.900> players<00:05:05.470> walked<00:05:06.100> score<00:05:06.820> is<00:05:07.060> at

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
point if the players walked score is at

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.070 
point if the players walked score is at
least<00:05:07.720> 20<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:09.060> so<00:05:10.060> basically<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.960> way<00:05:10.990> I

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
least 20 and so basically the way I

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.790 
least 20 and so basically the way I
created<00:05:11.699> the<00:05:12.699> walked<00:05:13.090> scoreboard<00:05:13.780> is<00:05:13.960> I<00:05:14.080> ran

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
created the walked scoreboard is I ran

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.600 
created the walked scoreboard is I ran
this<00:05:14.919> command<00:05:15.250> walked<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.120> then<00:05:16.510> his<00:05:16.660> stat

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
this command walked and then his stat

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.390 
this command walked and then his stat
walk<00:05:18.610> 1cm<00:05:19.479> so<00:05:20.289> this<00:05:20.680> is<00:05:20.800> exactly<00:05:21.190> how<00:05:21.370> I

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
walk 1cm so this is exactly how I

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.890 
walk 1cm so this is exactly how I
created<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:21.910> objective<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.510> you<00:05:22.600> see<00:05:22.780> on

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
created that objective that you see on

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.960 
created that objective that you see on
the<00:05:22.990> right<00:05:23.139> hand<00:05:23.289> side<00:05:23.470> and<00:05:23.919> as<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.639> walk<00:05:24.820> around

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
the right hand side and as I walk around

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.240 
the right hand side and as I walk around
you<00:05:25.300> can<00:05:25.449> see<00:05:25.600> that<00:05:25.690> objective<00:05:26.110> ticking<00:05:26.500> up<00:05:26.650> on

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
you can see that objective ticking up on

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.390 
you can see that objective ticking up on
its<00:05:27.490> own<00:05:27.669> the<00:05:28.270> game<00:05:28.419> tracks<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.050> its<00:05:29.200> own

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
its own the game tracks it on its own

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.540 
its own the game tracks it on its own
pretty<00:05:30.400> cool<00:05:30.639> so<00:05:31.450> so<00:05:31.840> this<00:05:32.770> command<00:05:33.099> block<00:05:33.280> is

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
pretty cool so so this command block is

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.219 
pretty cool so so this command block is
saying<00:05:33.849> well<00:05:34.210> if<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.450> players<00:05:34.660> locked<00:05:34.960> at

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
saying well if the players locked at

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.520 
saying well if the players locked at
least<00:05:35.440> 20<00:05:36.030> centimeters<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.270> think<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.080> actually

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
least 20 centimeters I think it actually

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.190 
least 20 centimeters I think it actually
tracks<00:05:39.419> decimetres<00:05:40.419> which<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:40.780> tenth<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.139> a

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
tracks decimetres which is a tenth of a

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.430 
tracks decimetres which is a tenth of a
meter<00:05:41.849> then<00:05:42.849> we<00:05:43.090> add<00:05:43.240> one<00:05:43.539> experience<00:05:44.080> points

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
meter then we add one experience points

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.219 
meter then we add one experience points
and<00:05:44.560> then<00:05:45.430> if<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.419> players<00:05:46.630> walked<00:05:46.900> at<00:05:47.080> least

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
and then if the players walked at least

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.820 
and then if the players walked at least
40<00:05:47.590> me<00:05:48.599> decimeters<00:05:49.599> then<00:05:49.930> we<00:05:50.139> want<00:05:50.410> then<00:05:50.680> we

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
40 me decimeters then we want then we

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.920 
40 me decimeters then we want then we
give<00:05:51.580> them<00:05:51.760> another<00:05:51.940> experience<00:05:52.479> point<00:05:52.690> and

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
give them another experience point and

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.640 
give them another experience point and
then<00:05:53.440> 60<00:05:54.099> and<00:05:54.430> then<00:05:54.610> 80<00:05:55.030> etc<00:05:55.630> so<00:05:55.900> basically

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
then 60 and then 80 etc so basically

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.960 
then 60 and then 80 etc so basically
there's<00:05:57.010> a<00:05:57.070> bunch<00:05:57.220> of<00:05:57.310> command<00:05:57.580> blocks<00:05:57.789> that

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
there's a bunch of command blocks that

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.110 
there's a bunch of command blocks that
are<00:05:58.030> adding<00:05:58.570> one<00:05:59.020> experience<00:05:59.560> point<00:06:00.090> but<00:06:01.090> only

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
are adding one experience point but only

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.210 
are adding one experience point but only
if<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:01.570> players<00:06:01.750> walked<00:06:02.199> a<00:06:02.500> certain<00:06:03.130> amount

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
if the players walked a certain amount

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.520 
if the players walked a certain amount
of<00:06:03.340> distance<00:06:03.490> since<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.240> last<00:06:04.419> time<00:06:04.780> this

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
of distance since the last time this

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.779 
of distance since the last time this
thing<00:06:05.710> was<00:06:05.740> checked<00:06:06.070> and<00:06:06.220> then<00:06:06.460> the<00:06:06.580> last

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
thing was checked and then the last

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.760 
thing was checked and then the last
command<00:06:07.060> block<00:06:07.270> here<00:06:07.570> just<00:06:08.139> sets<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:08.500> walked

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
command block here just sets the walked

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.469 
command block here just sets the walked
score<00:06:09.160> back<00:06:09.370> down<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:09.729> zero<00:06:09.940> so<00:06:10.000> that's<00:06:10.210> what

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
score back down to zero so that's what

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.390 
score back down to zero so that's what
keeps<00:06:10.599> resetting<00:06:10.990> it<00:06:11.199> to<00:06:11.289> zero<00:06:11.500> so<00:06:12.039> that<00:06:12.250> when

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
keeps resetting it to zero so that when

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.640 
keeps resetting it to zero so that when
I<00:06:12.430> when<00:06:13.150> I<00:06:13.210> go<00:06:13.330> to<00:06:13.389> game<00:06:13.570> well<00:06:13.930> I<00:06:13.960> don't<00:06:14.500> have<00:06:14.590> to

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
I when I go to game well I don't have to

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.320 
I when I go to game well I don't have to
be<00:06:14.740> in-game<00:06:14.830> with<00:06:15.010> zero<00:06:15.190> but<00:06:15.340> you<00:06:15.430> can<00:06:15.580> see<00:06:15.820> the

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
be in-game with zero but you can see the

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.000 
be in-game with zero but you can see the
Walk<00:06:16.510> Score<00:06:16.720> is<00:06:16.870> constantly<00:06:17.530> getting<00:06:17.650> reset

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
Walk Score is constantly getting reset

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.760 
Walk Score is constantly getting reset
to<00:06:18.160> zero<00:06:18.570> and<00:06:19.570> that's<00:06:20.050> and<00:06:20.380> that's<00:06:20.500> what's

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
to zero and that's and that's what's

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.250 
to zero and that's and that's what's
doing<00:06:20.889> that<00:06:21.039> so<00:06:21.520> that<00:06:21.760> each<00:06:22.389> time<00:06:22.419> this<00:06:22.960> thing

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
doing that so that each time this thing

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.180 
doing that so that each time this thing
runs<00:06:23.530> it's<00:06:23.949> got<00:06:24.160> a<00:06:24.190> fresh<00:06:24.520> count<00:06:24.849> of<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.389> last

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
runs it's got a fresh count of the last

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.790 
runs it's got a fresh count of the last
the<00:06:27.190> last<00:06:27.570> amount<00:06:28.570> of<00:06:28.810> time<00:06:29.080> walked<00:06:29.410> since

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
the last amount of time walked since

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.909 
the last amount of time walked since
this<00:06:30.520> whole<00:06:30.990> this<00:06:31.990> whole<00:06:32.050> circuit<00:06:32.710> ran

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
this whole this whole circuit ran

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.779 
this whole this whole circuit ran
previously<00:06:33.880> so<00:06:34.780> it<00:06:35.349> basically<00:06:35.650> you<00:06:36.490> know<00:06:36.610> as

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
previously so it basically you know as

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:38.700 
previously so it basically you know as
you're<00:06:36.940> walking<00:06:37.360> it<00:06:37.539> ticks<00:06:37.780> up<00:06:38.020> and

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
you're walking it ticks up and

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.190 
you're walking it ticks up and
then<00:06:38.830> your<00:06:39.820> skort<00:06:40.210> your<00:06:40.420> experience<00:06:40.900> gets<00:06:41.080> at

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
then your skort your experience gets at

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.740 
then your skort your experience gets at
0<00:06:41.590> then<00:06:41.800> 2<00:06:41.920> 4<00:06:41.950> then<00:06:42.670> you<00:06:42.730> get<00:06:43.090> little<00:06:43.420> bits<00:06:43.690> of

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
0 then 2 4 then you get little bits of

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.870 
0 then 2 4 then you get little bits of
experience<00:06:44.230> added<00:06:44.620> and<00:06:44.770> that's<00:06:44.890> what<00:06:45.250> fills

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
experience added and that's what fills

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.760 
experience added and that's what fills
at<00:06:46.000> the<00:06:46.090> speedometer<00:06:46.270> and<00:06:46.690> then<00:06:47.170> it's<00:06:47.590> it's

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
at the speedometer and then it's it's

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.230 
at the speedometer and then it's it's
your<00:06:47.920> walk<00:06:48.070> score<00:06:48.370> back<00:06:48.520> to<00:06:48.670> zero<00:06:48.880> so<00:06:49.210> that

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
your walk score back to zero so that

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.650 
your walk score back to zero so that
it'll<00:06:49.660> count<00:06:50.260> up<00:06:50.560> again<00:06:51.040> from<00:06:51.490> zero<00:06:51.760> and<00:06:52.060> so

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
it'll count up again from zero and so

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.900 
it'll count up again from zero and so
the<00:06:52.840> next<00:06:52.960> time<00:06:53.080> this<00:06:53.290> thing<00:06:53.440> runs<00:06:53.910> you'll

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910 
the next time this thing runs you'll

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.780 
the next time this thing runs you'll
have<00:06:55.060> a<00:06:55.090> fresh<00:06:55.420> walk<00:06:56.050> score<00:06:56.610> which<00:06:57.610> should

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
have a fresh walk score which should

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.090 
have a fresh walk score which should
accurately<00:06:57.960> reflect<00:06:58.960> how<00:06:59.590> far<00:06:59.800> you've<00:06:59.920> walked

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
accurately reflect how far you've walked

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.840 
accurately reflect how far you've walked
in<00:07:00.430> the<00:07:00.490> last<00:07:00.700> I<00:07:01.440> think<00:07:02.440> four<00:07:03.280> tenths<00:07:03.580> of<00:07:03.730> a

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
in the last I think four tenths of a

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.390 
in the last I think four tenths of a
second<00:07:04.240> that's<00:07:05.200> how<00:07:05.380> that's<00:07:05.590> how<00:07:05.800> long<00:07:06.040> that's

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
second that's how that's how long that's

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.460 
second that's how that's how long that's
how<00:07:06.580> often<00:07:06.880> this<00:07:07.030> clock<00:07:07.240> runs<00:07:07.480> but<00:07:07.960> it's<00:07:08.350> a

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
how often this clock runs but it's a

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.500 
how often this clock runs but it's a
really<00:07:08.560> cool<00:07:08.710> effect<00:07:08.860> and<00:07:09.310> works<00:07:10.240> very<00:07:10.330> well

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
really cool effect and works very well

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.690 
really cool effect and works very well
and<00:07:10.960> I<00:07:11.230> think<00:07:11.290> you<00:07:11.800> should<00:07:12.220> be<00:07:12.460> able<00:07:12.610> to

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
and I think you should be able to

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.180 
and I think you should be able to
replace<00:07:13.030> every<00:07:13.600> instance<00:07:13.630> of<00:07:14.110> @p<00:07:14.680> with<00:07:14.920> at<00:07:15.160> a

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190 
replace every instance of @p with at a

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.970 
replace every instance of @p with at a
and<00:07:15.730> this<00:07:15.880> should<00:07:16.030> work<00:07:16.590> for<00:07:17.590> multiple

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:17.980 
and this should work for multiple

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.980 
and this should work for multiple
players<00:07:18.130> in<00:07:18.400> a<00:07:18.460> server<00:07:18.670> too<00:07:18.910> so<00:07:19.270> kind<00:07:19.840> of<00:07:19.870> cool

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
players in a server too so kind of cool

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.420 
players in a server too so kind of cool
and<00:07:20.170> you<00:07:20.230> could<00:07:20.350> you<00:07:20.530> could<00:07:20.680> use<00:07:20.830> this<00:07:21.010> even<00:07:21.340> if

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430 
and you could you could use this even if

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.510 
and you could you could use this even if
you<00:07:21.460> wanted<00:07:21.820> to<00:07:22.770> you<00:07:23.770> know<00:07:23.800> do<00:07:24.160> different

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
you wanted to you know do different

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.950 
you wanted to you know do different
effects<00:07:24.820> if<00:07:25.000> the<00:07:25.120> players<00:07:25.330> walking<00:07:25.870> at

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
effects if the players walking at

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.660 
effects if the players walking at
different<00:07:26.200> speeds<00:07:26.470> and<00:07:26.710> stuff<00:07:27.370> like<00:07:27.460> that<00:07:27.640> so

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:27.670 
different speeds and stuff like that so

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.060 
different speeds and stuff like that so
I<00:07:28.210> think<00:07:28.330> it's<00:07:28.510> a<00:07:28.630> really<00:07:29.110> cool<00:07:29.260> capability

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.070 
I think it's a really cool capability

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.480 
I think it's a really cool capability
and<00:07:30.250> it's<00:07:30.910> thanks<00:07:31.540> to<00:07:31.600> Mojang<00:07:32.290> for<00:07:32.590> fixing<00:07:33.400> a

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
and it's thanks to Mojang for fixing a

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.430 
and it's thanks to Mojang for fixing a
bug<00:07:33.670> with<00:07:33.850> walk<00:07:34.030> 1cm<00:07:34.600> which<00:07:34.810> was<00:07:35.020> making<00:07:35.200> it

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 
bug with walk 1cm which was making it

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.340 
bug with walk 1cm which was making it
not<00:07:35.740> count<00:07:36.370> your<00:07:36.610> speed<00:07:36.850> correctly<00:07:37.330> before<00:07:37.450> so

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.350 
not count your speed correctly before so

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.960 
not count your speed correctly before so
this<00:07:38.470> is<00:07:38.620> pretty<00:07:38.740> cool<00:07:38.980> that's<00:07:39.670> about<00:07:39.850> it

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:39.970 
this is pretty cool that's about it

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.540 
this is pretty cool that's about it
thanks<00:07:40.210> for<00:07:40.240> watching
