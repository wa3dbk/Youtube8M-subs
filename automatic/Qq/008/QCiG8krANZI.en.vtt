00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:10.840
 Everybody how are you and the channel It is the last time is that Playstation 3 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:13.429
 a first with the motherboard such Fu in was to decompose the guy now bare of state 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:18.949
 You will be in a state of thinking 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.190
 Well I do not know Well become to repair the repair from this, but I think about to enter the repair Well 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.150
 But at that time 3 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:28.920
 We will introduce you what you need for flux 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.780
 Silver grease parts cleaner aluminum wheel 1 child is necessary 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.329
 Riding on top of the chip as ready So is that the first I would like to immediately 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.879
 I will remove it if there is a lot of grease 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.140
 The method of removal is to flick parts cleaner like this from above 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.100
 The axis is a machine as it blows 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.100
 It will be 0 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.390
 Of course here is the main body side of the PlayStation 3 just as it is now 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.650
 Please be and said, Hatcher took angry that grease even more of 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.370
 Right ? 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.370
 Hmm 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:15.090
 With When you have finished the removal of Chris will continue to Tsu likely 8 flac 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.090
 At this time it will be around this big chip to apply the flux 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:25.409
 Bae to Ttoripu 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:28.570
 The reason why this big chip is painted 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.159
 The cause of the breakdown is 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.220
 About this 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.970
 Big chip 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.450
 Kana say what I mean and thermal runaway thermal runaway 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.469
 That amazing heat or heat of vaporization 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:51.110
 8 solder cracks caused by guest house contraction 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:54.500
 It's because the solder of cracking has been referred to as the 8-inch Institute 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.610
 After painting, we will wrap in aluminum foil next time 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:06.610
 The reason for wrapping with this aluminum foil is 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 It's actually from the oven oven Noo Nono-who usually repair that No. 4 that that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 It seems to use a heat guard, though 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.510
 This entire aluminum large Masu owner is Arthur to open booby 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:26.360
 4 because it 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:31.420
 Given the heat we use this aluminum four-color to a big defense where Do not Let chip 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.980
 Except after at was hid large in such Fu whole will continue to bake in the oven So 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.280
 8 That's right 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.500
 First of all in the case of Aid residual heat is over 8200 degrees 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.660
 As it is said that it is more than 200 years that 8 judgment melts, 8 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:50.300
 And to about 200 degrees or more income or 10 degrees by pressing the large army 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.660
 It is about 8 at a glance 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.780
 Well about three and a half minutes 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.140
 It is okay if you give up 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:06.830
 Start now and see what happens with this 1 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.370
 I'm looking forward to it as soon as the oven is finished . 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.510
 so 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:19.100
 Well Oh put in about 10 minutes it in 8 to 10 minutes, you want to have still wake up that heat 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:23.120
 First of all I will apply grease 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:28.850
 Waeee as 8 reasons to paint the grease 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:33.240
 8 I will put in a feeling not say so or enhance the cooling of the effect 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.010
 I will extend the grease I applied a little bit 8 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.610
 8 Well then 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.330
 8 is actually a little while ago in the just finished assembling now 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.490
 that 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:51.640
 I assembled it normally and did the same experiment as I like, but ylod recurred 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.810
 It was 210 degrees of yellow lamp ticker that was also yellow for that it was dead 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.390
 +5 minutes in 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.319
 PlayStation 3 Well this kind of Fu and put the now power that would have been and are normally 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.490
 It has been started 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.410
 I will 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:07.730
 Let's do so this time you was how Well that stunning is the return of ale od 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.840
 We success 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:18.050
 Some of them just say they won't succeed 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:21.480
 In relapsed after all the things that are broken once even that well was successful 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:24.960
 It seems to do just that 7 days after 3 days 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:29.640
 Are You farewell Well than Tteyuu effectively one week Deluxe Edition 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.690
 Appreciate Well that it is So You know doing that everyone in about lucky to be used until it 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.180
 I think 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:39.870
 Microwave oven 8 just that earnestly as that note 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.500
 Please do not be in the range, please be absolutely open and maybe that 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.480
 A big fire will occur 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:50.380
 It is to have you do it at your own risk after all else 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:54.910
 Anoma This time, I'm glad than was the PlayStation 3 Well warranty has expired 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:59.890
 If you have a guarantee that there is compensation or if you have received after-sales service 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:02.610
 I think it would be better to do it honestly then it was a bit of a channel 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.610
 Thank you
