00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
so what does that look like so let's

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.660 
so what does that look like so let's
start<00:00:54.370> by<00:00:54.520> opening<00:00:54.550> up<00:00:56.310> FileMaker<00:00:57.310> Go<00:00:57.340> and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
start by opening up FileMaker Go and

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.710 
start by opening up FileMaker Go and
this<00:00:57.880> is<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.000> little<00:00:58.150> different<00:00:58.240> the<00:00:58.510> first

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
this is a little different the first

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.090 
this is a little different the first
time<00:00:58.930> you<00:00:59.020> open<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.320> files<00:00:59.560> and<00:00:59.920> then

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
time you open the files and then

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.850 
time you open the files and then
additional<00:01:00.940> times<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:01.630> my<00:01:02.170> network<00:01:02.530> there's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
additional times so my network there's

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.720 
additional times so my network there's
my<00:01:03.040> server<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.210> there<00:01:05.170> is<00:01:05.470> goes<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.370> coasted

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
my server and there is goes and coasted

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.100 
my server and there is goes and coasted
so<00:01:07.120> this<00:01:07.270> is<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.450> one<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.600> want<00:01:07.660> to<00:01:07.870> grab
