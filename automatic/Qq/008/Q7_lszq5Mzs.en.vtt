00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.539
 Hello dear car enthusiasts 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.439
 today we get to know the car 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.090
 thermolux ceramic heater 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.710
 The advantage of this model is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.590
 using ceramic 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.720
 the device reaches high quality 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.809
 working temperature literally for 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.670
 few seconds unlike metals 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.440
 of which others are made 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.269
 ceramic heaters 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.979
 when heated does not react with 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.350
 oxygenated and does not dry the air 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.059
 this way inside the car 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 manage to keep optimal 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.260
 insufficient microclimate 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.329
 oxygen to the driver and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.429
 passengers feel comfortable 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 another clear advantage 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.110
 ceramics compared to metals 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.780
 is that it is practically not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 susceptible to oxidation resulting in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.590
 ceramic lifetime 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.159
 heater increases in several 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.600
 times due to high quality 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.490
 ceramic element heater 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.520
 Thermolux differ elevated 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.080
 reliability indicators 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.840
 car heater thermolux 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.790
 can work in two modes 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.560
 heater and fan you can 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.310
 choose suitable depending on 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 time of year 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.570
 cold winter thermolux will 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 irreplaceable helper to speed up 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.780
 heating and defrosting glass and mirrors 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.659
 the car 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.770
 summer heat can translate heater 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.380
 to fan mode 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.020
 which will create air movement inside 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.030
 salon it will be useful if in 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.460
 vehicle missing or defective 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.130
 air conditioning mode selection 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.520
 carried by a switch on the case 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.259
 devices for installation and start of work 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.420
 with car heater 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.640
 thermolux does not require special 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.869
 skills and knowledge 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.659
 heater connects to the connector 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.619
 car cigarette lighter and 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.170
 mounted on a special sticky 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.959
 basis or adjustable bracket 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.849
 the angle of the blown hole can 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.050
 be changed if necessary 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.030
 each driver repeatedly 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.220
 had to sit in the winter for ice cream 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.440
 cars wait until the engine is 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.629
 warms up to at least 20 degrees 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.549
 to send warm air to 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.980
 windshield and melt the ice 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.379
 overlapping view from inside the car 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.310
 and how much time each day 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:39.500
 spend while waiting for the engine to warm up 5 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.019
 10-20 minutes it all depends on age and 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.780
 car brands and we of course on the size 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.459
 negative temperature outside but 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.950
 who will risk moving 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.959
 clearing only a few narrow bands along 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.930
 iced up windshield 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.730
 however, the only way out is 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.519
 warm frontal and front side 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.769
 glass to melt the ice just for these 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.129
 purposes basically does not serve electric 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.780
 car heater 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.790
 This device is completely autonomous and 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.190
 able to produce warm air already 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.260
 a few seconds after turning on 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.440
 besides this useful device 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.239
 useful not only in the winter off season 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.410
 when the yard is cool and glass 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.450
 begin to mist 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.019
 just turn on the interior heater 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.680
 car and glass will quickly become dry 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.630
 opaque so let's summarize 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.669
 car ceramic heater 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.470
 inexpensive and effective means which 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:36.310
 provides additional heating 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.019
 passenger compartment defrost glass 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.120
 preventing them from fogging as well 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.120
 blowing cool air hot days
