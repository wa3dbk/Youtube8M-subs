00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
of made some templates here for the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.870 
of made some templates here for the
circles<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.840> get<00:00:45.020> them<00:00:45.190> perfectly<00:00:46.190> round<00:00:46.520> and

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
circles to get them perfectly round and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.030 
circles to get them perfectly round and
then<00:00:47.000> some<00:00:47.720> I<00:00:48.080> templates<00:00:48.590> there<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:48.860> get<00:00:48.950> them

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
then some I templates there to get them

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.060 
then some I templates there to get them
the<00:00:49.190> same<00:00:49.370> on<00:00:49.520> both<00:00:49.550> sides<00:00:50.500> just<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.680> same<00:00:51.860> old

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
the same on both sides just the same old

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.550 
the same on both sides just the same old
same<00:00:52.250> old<00:00:52.400> stuff<00:00:52.780> but<00:00:53.780> i<00:00:53.810> just<00:00:54.230> thought<00:00:54.410> i'd

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560

tedious I got this this part pretty good
this<00:02:19.840> side<00:02:20.080> there's<00:02:20.350> kind<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.680> basic<00:02:21.209> layout

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
this side there's kind of basic layout

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.110 
this side there's kind of basic layout
and<00:02:24.390> had<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.540> relocate<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.290> whole<00:02:27.120> filter

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
and had to relocate this whole filter

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.020 
and had to relocate this whole filter
assembly<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:29.110> know<00:02:29.230> multiple<00:02:29.620> times<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.250> had

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
assembly you know multiple times and had

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.430 
assembly you know multiple times and had
to<00:02:31.150> rework<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.600> face<00:02:31.810> had<00:02:32.050> quite<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.290> bit<00:02:32.410> of

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
to rework to face had quite a bit of

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.460 
to rework to face had quite a bit of
symmetry<00:02:32.920> issues<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:34.239> them<00:02:34.480> they're<00:02:35.260> all

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
symmetry issues on them they're all

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.009 
symmetry issues on them they're all
pretty<00:02:35.739> much<00:02:35.860> straightened<00:02:36.340> out<00:02:36.400> right<00:02:36.459> now

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
pretty much straightened out right now

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.740 
pretty much straightened out right now
what<00:02:38.019> I've<00:02:38.110> been<00:02:38.200> doing<00:02:38.380> today<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.420> lately<00:02:40.420> is

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
what I've been doing today and lately is

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.900 
what I've been doing today and lately is
working<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.410> antenna<00:02:42.190> assembly<00:02:42.370> here

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
working on this antenna assembly here

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.670 
working on this antenna assembly here
and<00:02:43.090> I've<00:02:43.750> been<00:02:43.870> going<00:02:44.110> by<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.290> little

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
and I've been going by this little

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.320 
and I've been going by this little
concept<00:02:45.069> picture<00:02:45.430> on<00:02:45.580> if<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.880> mentioned<00:02:46.090> it

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
concept picture on if I mentioned it

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.050 
concept picture on if I mentioned it
before<00:02:46.420> probably<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.930> did<00:02:47.519> but<00:02:48.519> I<00:02:48.580> noticed<00:02:49.000> that

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
before probably I did but I noticed that

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.569 
before probably I did but I noticed that
there<00:02:49.269> was<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.420> little<00:02:49.950> kind<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.010> like<00:02:51.190> holder

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
there was a little kind of like holder

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.270 
there was a little kind of like holder
to<00:02:52.180> hold<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.510> antenna<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.140> that's<00:02:54.070> what<00:02:54.220> I'm

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
to hold the antenna and that's what I'm

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830 
to hold the antenna and that's what I'm
kind<00:02:54.489> of<00:02:54.519> working<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.910> right<00:02:55.090> here<00:02:55.329> it's<00:02:55.540> a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
kind of working on right here it's a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.250 
kind of working on right here it's a
piece<00:02:56.079> of<00:02:56.110> PVC<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.950> then<00:02:57.850> some<00:02:58.260> corrugated

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
piece of PVC and then some corrugated

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.650 
piece of PVC and then some corrugated
tubing<00:02:59.620> for<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.280> wires<00:03:00.489> now<00:03:01.329> I<00:03:01.359> just<00:03:01.420> gotta

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
tubing for like wires now I just gotta

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.080 
tubing for like wires now I just gotta
peeee<00:03:01.690> instil<00:03:02.049> in<00:03:02.109> there<00:03:02.260> right<00:03:02.380> now<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:03.090> kind

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
peeee instil in there right now to kind

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.880 
peeee instil in there right now to kind
of<00:03:04.209> replicate<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.840> antenna<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.500> can<00:03:05.709> get<00:03:05.829> a

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
of replicate the antenna so I can get a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.680 
of replicate the antenna so I can get a
visual<00:03:06.070> on<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.640> see<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.820> scale<00:03:07.420> and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
visual on it and see a scale and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.620 
visual on it and see a scale and
everything<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.400> it's<00:03:10.120> kind<00:03:10.359> of<00:03:10.390> hard<00:03:10.570> to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
everything so it's kind of hard to

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.530 
everything so it's kind of hard to
replicate<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.260> exactly<00:03:11.320> as<00:03:12.329> those<00:03:13.329> are<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
replicate it exactly as those are the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.690 
replicate it exactly as those are the
only<00:03:13.660> pictures<00:03:14.049> i<00:03:14.170> have<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.680> i'm<00:03:14.799> going<00:03:15.519> by

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
only pictures i have and i'm going by

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.130 
only pictures i have and i'm going by
this<00:03:15.760> one<00:03:16.120> instead<00:03:16.329> of<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.480> in-game<00:03:16.750> model

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
this one instead of the in-game model

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.259 
this one instead of the in-game model
just<00:03:17.980> because<00:03:18.220> that's<00:03:18.310> what<00:03:18.519> i<00:03:18.549> have<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:18.970> i

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
just because that's what i have and i

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.289 
just because that's what i have and i
like<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.760> i'll<00:03:21.760> probably<00:03:21.970> use<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.209> little

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
like it so i'll probably use a little

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.830 
like it so i'll probably use a little
bit<00:03:22.540> artistic<00:03:23.019> license<00:03:23.410> with<00:03:24.630> stuff<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.660> I

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
bit artistic license with stuff that I

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.130 
bit artistic license with stuff that I
can't<00:03:26.109> see<00:03:26.410> perfectly<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.810> kind<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.840> make<00:03:28.989> it

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
can't see perfectly and kind of make it

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.640 
can't see perfectly and kind of make it
you<00:03:29.320> know<00:03:29.350> unique<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.930> try<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.350> keep<00:03:32.440> it

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
you know unique but try to keep it

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.060 
you know unique but try to keep it
pretty<00:03:32.769> close<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.359> picture<00:03:34.359> there<00:03:35.070> so

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
pretty close to the picture there so

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.670 
pretty close to the picture there so
that's<00:03:36.310> what's<00:03:36.489> going<00:03:36.700> on<00:03:36.910> it's<00:03:37.600> going<00:03:37.870> nicely

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
that's what's going on it's going nicely

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.160 
that's what's going on it's going nicely
like<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.100> said<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.760> hopefully<00:03:40.510> go<00:03:40.780> or<00:03:40.930> finish

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
like I said and hopefully go or finish

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.979 
like I said and hopefully go or finish
it<00:03:41.290> pretty<00:03:41.500> time<00:03:41.680> soon<00:03:41.980> if<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.280> keep<00:03:42.489> working<00:03:42.989> on

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
it pretty time soon if I keep working on

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.990 
it pretty time soon if I keep working on
it<00:03:44.140> off<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.530> on<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:45.100> don't<00:03:45.459> have<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.609> lot<00:03:45.730> of<00:03:45.760> time

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
it off and on I don't have a lot of time

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.940 
it off and on I don't have a lot of time
to<00:03:46.180> work<00:03:46.299> on<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.540> because<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.319> work<00:03:47.560> in<00:03:47.709> school

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
to work on it because of work in school

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.050 
to work on it because of work in school
but<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.480> know<00:03:49.480> I'll<00:03:49.630> keep<00:03:49.840> working<00:03:49.989> on<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.380> and

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
but you know I'll keep working on it and

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.949 
but you know I'll keep working on it and
hopefully<00:03:52.060> I'll<00:03:52.299> be<00:03:52.329> able<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.600> upload<00:03:52.750> this

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
hopefully I'll be able to upload this

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.509 
hopefully I'll be able to upload this
video<00:03:53.170> along<00:03:53.590> with<00:03:53.799> some<00:03:54.100> of<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.220> other<00:03:54.340> ones

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
video along with some of the other ones

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.870 
video along with some of the other ones
and<00:03:55.320> some<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.470> Corvette<00:03:56.769> ones<00:03:56.919> so

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
and some of the Corvette ones so

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
and some of the Corvette ones so
that<00:03:58.480> would<00:03:58.570> be<00:03:58.630> nice<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:59.190> am<00:04:00.840> thinking<00:04:01.840> about

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
that would be nice I am thinking about

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.090 
that would be nice I am thinking about
some<00:04:02.350> more<00:04:04.050> custom<00:04:05.050> helmet<00:04:05.410> designs<00:04:05.860> that

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
some more custom helmet designs that

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.650 
some more custom helmet designs that
I've<00:04:06.250> actually<00:04:06.460> come<00:04:06.700> up<00:04:06.760> with<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.330> sketched

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
I've actually come up with and sketched

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.620 
I've actually come up with and sketched
out<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.740> I<00:04:08.770> want<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.100> do<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:09.640> maybe<00:04:10.330> I'll<00:04:10.480> do

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
out that I want to do so maybe I'll do

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.880 
out that I want to do so maybe I'll do
one<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.840> those<00:04:11.020> after<00:04:11.410> I<00:04:11.440> get<00:04:11.590> done<00:04:11.620> with<00:04:11.860> this

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
one of those after I get done with this

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.500 
one of those after I get done with this
unless<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.570> see<00:04:13.570> something<00:04:13.810> else<00:04:14.110> you<00:04:14.770> know<00:04:14.950> or
