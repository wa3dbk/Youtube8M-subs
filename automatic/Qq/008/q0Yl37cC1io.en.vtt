00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
of quick notes and then we'll get

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.930 
of quick notes and then we'll get
started<00:00:12.719> first<00:00:13.440> thing<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.490> programs

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
started first thing is that the programs

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.840 
started first thing is that the programs
that<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.179> launched<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.980> are<00:00:16.980> tied<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.670> specific

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
that I launched I are tied to specific

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.040 
that I launched I are tied to specific
spaces<00:00:19.100> using<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.910> spaces<00:00:21.359> option<00:00:21.869> in

System Preferences so in order to do

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.240 
System Preferences so in order to do
that<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.990> would<00:00:25.199> go<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.680> system

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
that you would go to your system

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.419 
that you would go to your system
preferences<00:00:27.380> expose<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.439> spaces<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> then

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
preferences expose in spaces and then

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.820 
preferences expose in spaces and then
you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.760> select<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.420> program<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.289> open<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you can select a program to open in a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.900 
you can select a program to open in a
specific<00:00:32.369> space<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:33.270> okay<00:00:34.200> enough<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.770> that

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
specific space here okay enough of that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.299 
specific space here okay enough of that
so<00:00:35.910> now<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.410> show<00:00:37.649> how<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:38.010> use

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
so now we are going to show how we use

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.209 
so now we are going to show how we use
Automator<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.180> optimize<00:00:39.629> our<00:00:39.809> Mac<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.800> moving

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
Automator to optimize our Mac so moving

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
Automator to optimize our Mac so moving
into<00:00:41.399> an<00:00:41.760> automated<00:00:42.059> workflow<00:00:42.649> you're<00:00:43.649> going

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
into an automated workflow you're going

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
into an automated workflow you're going
to<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.520> my<00:00:44.760> Automator

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
to see that this is my Automator

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600 
to see that this is my Automator
workflow<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.110> am<00:00:46.289> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> first<00:00:47.039> quit<00:00:47.399> all

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
workflow I am going to first quit all

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.119 
workflow I am going to first quit all
applications<00:00:48.450> except<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.260> program<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.100> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
applications except the program that I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.729 
applications except the program that I
am<00:00:50.219> using<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.730> record<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.300> screencast<00:00:51.739> we

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
am using to record this screencast we

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
am using to record this screencast we
are<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.460> run<00:00:53.940> an<00:00:54.059> apple<00:00:54.480> script

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
are then going to run an apple script

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.580 
are then going to run an apple script
which<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.260> toggle<00:00:55.649> Airport<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.550> or<00:00:56.910> off

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
which will toggle Airport on or off

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.279 
which will toggle Airport on or off
launch<00:00:58.590> system<00:00:59.129> preferences<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.510> watch

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
launch system preferences and then watch

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.149 
launch system preferences and then watch
me<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.470> recording<00:01:04.470> action<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.040> use

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
me do is a recording action you can use

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.500 
me do is a recording action you can use
the<00:01:05.309> record<00:01:05.640> button<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.420> will

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the record button up here and it will

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.830 
the record button up here and it will
record<00:01:07.250> mouse<00:01:08.250> clicks<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> whole

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
record mouse clicks and there's a whole

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.030 
record mouse clicks and there's a whole
bunch<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.140> mouse<00:01:10.290> clicks<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:10.890> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
bunch of mouse clicks in here that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.859 
bunch of mouse clicks in here that
you'll<00:01:11.130> see<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.400> action<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.909> minute<00:01:12.150> then

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
you'll see in action in a minute then

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.280 
you'll see in action in a minute then
quit<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> application<00:01:15.270> System<00:01:16.049> Preferences

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
quit the application System Preferences

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.940 
quit the application System Preferences
and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.549> launch<00:01:18.150> audio<00:01:18.750> hijacked<00:01:19.350> Pro<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and then launch audio hijacked Pro and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.920 
and then launch audio hijacked Pro and
then<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.400> an<00:01:20.670> Apple<00:01:21.150> script<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:21.720> will

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
then I have an Apple script which will

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
then I have an Apple script which will
launch<00:01:22.229> track<00:01:22.619> door<00:01:22.860> Pro<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> find<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
launch track door Pro I find it to be a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.580 
launch track door Pro I find it to be a
little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.420> faster<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.020> launched<00:01:25.380> via

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
little bit faster when launched via

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.480 
little bit faster when launched via
Apple<00:01:25.979> script<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.439> that's<00:01:28.439> enough<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.400> we

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
Apple script so that's enough so here we

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.050 
Apple script so that's enough so here we
go<00:01:29.610> ready<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.549> open<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.909> use
