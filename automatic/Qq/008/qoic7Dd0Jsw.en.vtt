 stable but cool very good night 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.990
 andalusia such images today 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.300
 thanks to our hearing hydrates in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.740
 thermometers like these thanks to the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.230
 state weather agency we have 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.420
 reached 23 degrees but only in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.760
 motril port and already values ​​around 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.490
 the 20 in the corner of victory in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.289
 adra in málaga and in estepona almost everything 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.939
 in points of the Costa del Sol and we must 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.189
 wait for all those holidays 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.289
 that we have very much data ahead of us 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.570
 similar to these and very cold nights 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 keep it in mind and in the heavens 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 currently sending a powerful 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.059
 anticyclone both today and the next 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.290
 days what is going to offer this that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.690
 we are seeing heavens quite 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.579
 clear and clean in almost all the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.649
 peninsula less in the far north 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.200
 now let's see keeping for now 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.430
 this anticyclone the storm in the margin 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.890
 located in front of the coasts of portugal 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.360
 but still sending cloudiness and also 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.890
 which is low have broken 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.989
 this precisely where we are going to wait 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.000
 precipitations of the Catalan coast and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.100
 also by the entrance of that cold 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.320
 north wind another very data 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.420
 important perfectly visible in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.549
 these images with that dismemberment of 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.300
 those clouds that environment is leaving me 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.340
 well 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.800
 very cold winter panorama 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
 these days especially in the north of 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.310
 country here in andalusia is also going to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 let us feel we know in headlines what 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.240
 that is planned for these days that is not 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.700
 other thing than very stable time like 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.050
 we just saw and sunny anticyclone 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.900
 the sun will be the main protagonist 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.300
 but of course it's going to blow north wind and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.430
 that will make the environment look fresh 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.380
 for the day with low values but more 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.210
 cold now at night when even 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.000
 dance in high areas of the interior 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.830
 oriental see and look at the rest of the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.810
 country two situations for tomorrow 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.320
 clearly differentiated between the north 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.390
 and the south a lot of cloudiness and rains 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 galicia all the Cantabrian area in 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.500
 the Pyrenees and on the Catalan coast and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.570
 in the Balearics and rains that fall 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.760
 above 500 meters in this 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.220
 area in the Cantabrian area and the 900 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.770
 the first ones are going to turn into snow 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.230
 and on the other hand, both in the center and in 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.240
 the south the sun is going to be the only one the great 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.980
 protagonist in the Canary Islands the day 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.750
 It's going to be quiet with sun and clouds but 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.730
 possibility of occasional rain 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.530
 on the islands of greater relief notice 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.690
 that the temperatures for the day are going to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.990
 go down tomorrow where here in points of 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.480
 north 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.250
 and also in the Canaries and they are going to 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.080
 keep unchanged in the rest 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.180
 important and remarkable will be the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 frosts that are planned for this next 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.520
 night in high areas across the country 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 but more intense in the Pyrenees and that 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.790
 cold environment is going to accentuate even more 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.010
 because tomorrow a wind is going to blow 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.810
 north quite intensely throughout the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.480
 valley of the ebro in the area of ​​the ampurdán 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.310
 Pyrenees and east of the Balearics 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.080
 we advance in the time from here of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.530
 our region of andalusia and on sunday 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.970
 the panorama will be the same with the heavens 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.890
 totally clean of clouds here what 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.750
 We are seeing in all areas except 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.520
 look at the Mediterranean coast more 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.590
 where the wind will come from 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.150
 lift and you will accumulate those clouds there 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.650
 and it's going to dawn with cloudy intervals 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.270
 the thermometers are not going to move 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.010
 on Sunday so again they are going to 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.070
 repeat those weak frosts in points 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.810
 from the interior of Jaén and from Granada and 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.520
 the chapter of the winds those of the north 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.380
 they will continue to leave the panorama fresh 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.570
 in the strait and presence as 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.460
 we just increased it from the east and the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.960
 Day of the Immaculate Andalusia on Monday 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.360
 will continue under the domains of 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.000
 anticyclone therefore sun throughout the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.110
 region they were watching - at sunrise 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.760
 the day here 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.350
 throughout the Mediterranean coast and in the 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.330
 narrow area there will be installed 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.460
 the east wind so the day 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.680
 will start with those stagnant clouds 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.450
 in all that area the mercury for this 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.070
 day may go up a little 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.450
 slightly due to the arrival of that 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.130
 warm east wind 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.350
 those easterly winds are winds that 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.480
 we get warmer and little go to 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.310
 last really because late 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.220
 Monday reinstall again 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.170
 the north wind so it will be installed 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.130
 in all areas with less here in the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.750
 rate area 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.120
 there the east will continue to be 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.490
 present in a nutshell and here what 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.970
 we have to leave a bridge or a long 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.790
 weekend of sunny days mornings and 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.350
 very cold nights especially nights and 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.820
 with frost in the early hours so 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.950
 they must take precautions and they will 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.450
 take the car early in the morning and 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.310
 that those frosts are dangerous in 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.290
 road and here we are going to leave 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.209
 wishing you enjoy it very much 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.010
 for my part I will be here again tomorrow 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.300
 to offer them the news that is 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.570
 go producing in good time 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.570
 nights
