have clay soil and you want to plant

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.599 
have clay soil and you want to plant
succulents<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.540> most<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.800> know<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.400> order

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
succulents as most of you know in order

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.670 
succulents as most of you know in order
to<00:00:17.760> plant<00:00:18.000> succulents<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.750> need<00:00:18.930> soil<00:00:19.350> that

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
to plant succulents you need soil that

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.130 
to plant succulents you need soil that
drains<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.520> quickly<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.510> way<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
drains really quickly so that way the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.900 
drains really quickly so that way the
roots<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> succulents<00:00:23.340> don't<00:00:23.730> get

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
roots of the succulents don't get

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.589 
roots of the succulents don't get
waterlogged<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.220> cause<00:00:26.220> rot<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.060> cause<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
waterlogged and cause rot and cause the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.140 
waterlogged and cause rot and cause the
plant<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> die<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.490> important<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> if

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
plant to die so it's important that if

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.910 
plant to die so it's important that if
you<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.390> clay<00:00:30.779> soil<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.529> way<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.830> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
you have clay soil and the way that you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.590 
you have clay soil and the way that you
figure<00:00:32.550> out<00:00:32.610> whether<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:32.940> clay<00:00:33.180> soil<00:00:33.450> so

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
figure out whether you have clay soil so

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.229 
figure out whether you have clay soil so
take<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> handful<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.620> soil<00:00:34.969> put<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> little

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
take a handful of your soil put a little

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.350 
take a handful of your soil put a little
bit<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> water<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> squeeze<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> if<00:00:39.239> it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
bit of water in it squeeze it and if it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.869 
bit of water in it squeeze it and if it
comes<00:00:39.570> together<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.290> clay<00:00:40.680> ball<00:00:40.920> then

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
comes together like a clay ball then

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.930 
comes together like a clay ball then
you'll<00:00:42.660> know<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.290> soil<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.829> clay<00:00:44.190> now

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you'll know that your soil is clay now

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.229 
you'll know that your soil is clay now
clay<00:00:45.719> soil<00:00:46.079> does<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.739> tend<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.250> drain<00:00:47.640> very

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
clay soil does not tend to drain very

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.830 
clay soil does not tend to drain very
quickly

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
quickly

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
quickly
it<00:00:49.079> also<00:00:49.260> doesn't<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.039> got<00:00:50.190> very<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.730> fine

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it also doesn't it's got very very fine

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700 
it also doesn't it's got very very fine
particles<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.899> it'll<00:00:52.079> tend<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.440> stick

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
particles and it'll tend to stick

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.610 
particles and it'll tend to stick
together<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.370> hold<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> water<00:00:54.620> which

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
together and hold on to the water which

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.979 
together and hold on to the water which
is<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.980> great<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.309> succulents<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.690> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
is not great for succulents so it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.709 
is not great for succulents so it's
important<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:59.010> amend<00:00:59.520> your<00:00:59.940> soil

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
important that you do amend your soil

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.009 
important that you do amend your soil
for<00:01:01.649> before<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> plant<00:01:02.609> succulents<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
for before you plant succulents and the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.370 
for before you plant succulents and the
way<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.549> by<00:01:05.850> adding<00:01:06.380> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
way that you can do this is by adding a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
way that you can do this is by adding a
prepared<00:01:08.630> cactus<00:01:10.610> palm<00:01:11.610> citrus<00:01:12.210> soil<00:01:12.510> there

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
prepared cactus palm citrus soil there

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.460 
prepared cactus palm citrus soil there
was<00:01:12.900> known<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.260> succulent<00:01:13.740> soil<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.520> your

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
was known as succulent soil to your

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.380 
was known as succulent soil to your
garden<00:01:16.470> planting<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:18.090> also

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
garden planting and then I would also

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.010 
garden planting and then I would also
amend<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:18.960> some<00:01:20.390> compost<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> have

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
amend it with some compost if you have

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.429 
amend it with some compost if you have
that<00:01:22.549> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.580> buy<00:01:23.880> compost<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.780> well<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that you can buy compost as well this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
that you can buy compost as well this
will<00:01:25.590> add<00:01:25.770> nutrients<00:01:26.369> into<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.880> soil<00:01:27.000> it'll

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
will add nutrients into the soil it'll

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.469 
will add nutrients into the soil it'll
also<00:01:28.229> break<00:01:28.619> up<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> soil<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.640> add<00:01:29.880> more<00:01:30.240> air

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
also break up the soil and add more air

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.090 
also break up the soil and add more air
pockets<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.560> way<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.400> will<00:01:32.780> drain<00:01:34.100> better

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
pockets so that way it will drain better

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.660 
pockets so that way it will drain better
and<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:35.970> add<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.340> succulent<00:01:38.340> soil

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and then add some of the succulent soil

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.710 
and then add some of the succulent soil
in<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.970> you'll<00:01:41.970> notice<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
in here too and you'll notice that the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.350 
in here too and you'll notice that the
succulent<00:01:43.439> soil<00:01:43.770> has<00:01:44.220> these<00:01:44.820> little<00:01:45.090> white

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
succulent soil has these little white

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.270 
succulent soil has these little white
pebbles<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.200> which<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.500> called<00:01:46.680> perlite

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
pebbles in here which is called perlite

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.749 
pebbles in here which is called perlite
and<00:01:47.520> perlite<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> really<00:01:49.049> great<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.759> holding

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
and perlite is really great for holding

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.510 
and perlite is really great for holding
onto<00:01:51.000> water<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.960> kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.380> whisking<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.189> away

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
onto water and kind of whisking it away

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.410 
onto water and kind of whisking it away
from<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.630> rest<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.680> soil<00:01:56.280> material<00:01:56.969> here

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.289 
from the rest of the soil material here
and<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.649> mixed<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.310> well<00:01:59.969> if

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and then get it mixed in really well if

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.319

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
it up so that way you're mixing the clay

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.260 
it up so that way you're mixing the clay
soil<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> amendments

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270
