the world we all have a chance to come

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.790 
the world we all have a chance to come
together<00:02:15.880> with<00:02:16.570> his<00:02:16.810> quantum<00:02:17.140> leap<00:02:17.590> in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
together with his quantum leap in

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.610 
together with his quantum leap in
technology<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:19.090> refresh<00:02:19.570> our<00:02:19.870> precious

planet with our give back programs we

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.250 
planet with our give back programs we
believe<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.820> all<00:02:25.060> people<00:02:25.090> around<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.080> world

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
believe that all people around the world

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.710 
believe that all people around the world
now<00:02:26.950> have<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.430> opportunity<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:28.150> contribute

now have the opportunity to contribute

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.500 
now have the opportunity to contribute
to<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.140> cleaner<00:02:29.590> environment<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.520> benefit
