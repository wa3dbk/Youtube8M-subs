00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the only thing you can't see is the hero

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.389 
the only thing you can't see is the hero
you<00:01:53.880> were<00:01:53.970> playing<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> game<00:01:55.159> like<00:01:56.159> which

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you were playing or the game like which

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.620 
you were playing or the game like which
game<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> keep<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.119> game<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.540> playing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
game I keep this game I was playing

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.760 
game I keep this game I was playing
let's<00:01:58.229> see<00:01:59.659> I<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.930> playing<00:02:01.140> Olof<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.680> then

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
let's see I was playing Olof and then

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.420 
let's see I was playing Olof and then
this<00:02:01.890> game<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.310> playing<00:02:03.590> buddhir<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.250> it's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this game I was playing buddhir so it's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.280 
this game I was playing buddhir so it's
it<00:02:05.700> might<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.060> hard<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.360> tell<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.899> by<00:02:06.930> looking

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
it might be hard to tell just by looking

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.930 
it might be hard to tell just by looking
at<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> numbers<00:02:07.829> because<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.729> date

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
at the numbers because it's just date

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.119 
at the numbers because it's just date
and<00:02:09.119> times<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> can

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
and times so what you can do is you can

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.059 
and times so what you can do is you can
rename

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
rename

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.589 
rename
just<00:02:12.249> say<00:02:12.989> hippo<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.999> should<00:02:16.299> be

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
just say hippo and then it should be

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.209 
just say hippo and then it should be
available<00:02:18.510> there<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.599> go<00:02:19.749> now<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:20.980> at<00:02:21.129> the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
available there we go now it's at the

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.610 
available there we go now it's at the
top<00:02:21.430> because<00:02:21.609> it's<00:02:21.819> hippo<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.359> it<00:02:22.689> allows<00:02:23.439> you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620
