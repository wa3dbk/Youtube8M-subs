00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
get transformers rpms I thought I'd get

it before they take them off the shelves

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.720 
it before they take them off the shelves
because<00:00:22.439> these<00:00:22.740> things<00:00:22.949> have<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.490> think

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
because these things have I think

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.310

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you know but you know i just thought i'd

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.650

care<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.750> thing<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
care for but the thing was this was the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.249 
care for but the thing was this was the
same<00:01:34.950> price<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> single<00:01:35.970> pack<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.049> did

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
same price as a single pack and I did

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.679 
same price as a single pack and I did
check<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> make<00:01:37.950> sure<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.430> was<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.090> you

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
okay this one Megatron his turret does

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.370 
okay this one Megatron his turret does
move

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
move

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.700 
move
you<00:02:12.710> know<00:02:12.860> as<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:14.960> does<00:02:15.500> move

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
you know as like this so it does move

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.790 
you know as like this so it does move
nothing<00:02:16.160> else<00:02:16.310> moves<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.660> unlike<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.530> other

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
nothing else moves and unlike the other

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.950 
nothing else moves and unlike the other
tank<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.700> showed<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.030> from<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.810> other

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
tank that I showed you from the other

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.530 
tank that I showed you from the other
day<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:22.070> one<00:02:22.280> does<00:02:22.490> have<00:02:22.520> wheels<00:02:23.030> underneath

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
day this one does have wheels underneath

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.340 
day this one does have wheels underneath
so<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.740> does<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.250> role<00:02:25.790> rather<00:02:26.510> nicely<00:02:26.900> and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
so so it does a role rather nicely and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.100 
so so it does a role rather nicely and
both<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.620> them<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:28.040> know<00:02:28.160> it's<00:02:28.280> they<00:02:29.110> they're

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
both of them you know it's they they're

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.550 
both of them you know it's they they're
able<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:31.400> run<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.300> it's<00:02:32.570> kind<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.020> your

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
able to to run so it's kind of like your

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.100 
able to to run so it's kind of like your
standard<00:02:33.830> Hot<00:02:34.190> Wheels<00:02:34.430> type<00:02:34.670> car<00:02:35.060> all<00:02:35.540> right

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
standard Hot Wheels type car all right

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.880 
standard Hot Wheels type car all right
so<00:02:36.410> what<00:02:36.770> makes<00:02:37.010> these<00:02:37.220> guys<00:02:37.490> stand<00:02:37.970> out<00:02:38.240> is

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
so what makes these guys stand out is

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.940 
so what makes these guys stand out is
this<00:02:39.890> feature<00:02:40.220> right<00:02:40.550> here<00:02:40.580> don't<00:02:41.090> don't<00:02:41.390> dome

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
this feature right here don't don't dome

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.500 
this feature right here don't don't dome
okay<00:02:42.950> there<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.220> go<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.730> that's<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:44.240> guess

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
okay there you go so that's I guess

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.040 
okay there you go so that's I guess
that's<00:02:44.840> how<00:02:44.990> they<00:02:45.670> transform<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.940> guess<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:47.900> let

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
that's how they transform I guess so let

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.800 
that's how they transform I guess so let
me<00:02:48.140> bring<00:02:48.350> these<00:02:48.530> up<00:02:49.220> much<00:02:49.700> closer<00:02:50.030> so<00:02:50.780> you

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
me bring these up much closer so you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.160 
me bring these up much closer so you
guys<00:02:51.020> can<00:02:51.200> see<00:02:51.470> better<00:02:51.970> okay<00:02:52.970> here<00:02:53.480> here<00:02:53.990> they

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
guys can see better okay here here they

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.390 
guys can see better okay here here they
are<00:02:54.320> us<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.490> it's<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.120> very<00:02:56.440> kind<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:58.010> them<00:02:58.280> i

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
are us and it's a very kind of them i

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.910 
are us and it's a very kind of them i
guess<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:59.150> actually<00:02:59.480> put<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> name<00:03:00.050> on<00:03:00.440> there

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
guess to actually put the name on there

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.770 
guess to actually put the name on there
so<00:03:01.160> it<00:03:01.250> says<00:03:01.430> megatron<00:03:02.060> on<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.360> one<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:02.720> it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
so it says megatron on this one and it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.080 
so it says megatron on this one and it
says<00:03:02.960> bumblebee<00:03:03.560> over<00:03:03.590> there<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> actually

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
says bumblebee over there so it actually

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.360 
says bumblebee over there so it actually
says<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:06.380> could<00:03:06.530> also<00:03:06.680> see<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.100> actual

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
says that you could also see the actual

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.080 
says that you could also see the actual
the<00:03:08.240> symbol<00:03:08.660> right<00:03:09.080> here<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.620> purple

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
the symbol right here this is a purple

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.940 
the symbol right here this is a purple
Decepticon<00:03:11.090> symbol<00:03:11.330> in<00:03:11.630> red<00:03:12.320> over<00:03:12.560> here<00:03:12.620> is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
Decepticon symbol in red over here is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.050 
Decepticon symbol in red over here is
the<00:03:13.250> Autobot<00:03:14.030> symbol<00:03:14.300> right<00:03:15.260> there<00:03:15.560> and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
the Autobot symbol right there and

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.210 
the Autobot symbol right there and
pretty<00:03:17.060> much<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.360> characters<00:03:17.750> are<00:03:18.080> not<00:03:18.740> drawn

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
pretty much the characters are not drawn

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.540 
pretty much the characters are not drawn
on<00:03:19.460> there<00:03:19.990> they<00:03:20.990> pretty<00:03:21.530> much<00:03:21.650> are<00:03:21.950> drawn<00:03:22.370> on

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
on there they pretty much are drawn on

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.110 
on there they pretty much are drawn on
there<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:23.030> they<00:03:23.510> do<00:03:23.570> have<00:03:24.020> a<00:03:24.550> texture<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:26.030> to

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
there but they do have a texture so to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.810 
there but they do have a texture so to
speak<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.900> bumpy<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.650> same<00:03:28.460> over<00:03:28.790> here

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
speak so it is bumpy and same over here

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.220 
speak so it is bumpy and same over here
and<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.150> is<00:03:32.330> about<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.630> simplest

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
and so that is about the simplest

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.590 
and so that is about the simplest
transform<00:03:33.800> or<00:03:33.980> transformation<00:03:34.600> transformer

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
transform or transformation transformer

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.520 
transform or transformation transformer
if<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.900> could<00:03:36.020> even<00:03:36.170> call<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:36.470> a

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
if you could even call this a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.970 
if you could even call this a
transformer<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.250> have<00:03:37.490> ever<00:03:37.790> ever<00:03:38.210> seen

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
transformer that I have ever ever seen

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.290 
transformer that I have ever ever seen
okay<00:03:39.980> so<00:03:40.040> I'm<00:03:40.280> going<00:03:40.460> to<00:03:40.490> give<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:40.790> some<00:03:41.030> quick

color<00:04:13.070> wise<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:14.209> Megatron<00:04:14.600> is<00:04:14.750> nice<00:04:15.200> silver

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
color wise the Megatron is nice silver

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.789 
color wise the Megatron is nice silver
this<00:04:16.430> is<00:04:16.489> some<00:04:16.820> kind<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.530> Cybertronian<00:04:18.530> tank

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
this is some kind of a Cybertronian tank

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.650 
this is some kind of a Cybertronian tank
because<00:04:19.250> obviously<00:04:19.400> there<00:04:19.790> is<00:04:19.910> no<00:04:20.090> tank<00:04:20.419> that

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
because obviously there is no tank that

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.870 
because obviously there is no tank that
looks<00:04:20.870> like<00:04:21.020> this

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
looks like this

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.680 
looks like this
on<00:04:21.940> earth<00:04:23.550> this<00:04:24.550> part<00:04:24.850> all<00:04:24.970> here<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.330> like<00:04:25.480> this

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
on earth this part all here is like this

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.050 
on earth this part all here is like this
is<00:04:25.900> soft<00:04:26.200> plastic<00:04:26.980> right<00:04:27.160> here<00:04:27.400> this<00:04:27.790> does

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
is soft plastic right here this does

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.330 
is soft plastic right here this does
move<00:04:28.360> even<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:29.620> parts<00:04:29.920> like<00:04:30.100> soft<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.910> stuff

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
move even this parts like soft and stuff

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.890 
move even this parts like soft and stuff
and<00:04:33.340> right<00:04:33.580> here<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:33.910> the<00:04:34.000> front<00:04:34.030> there<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:34.750> a

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
and right here in the front there is a

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.170 
and right here in the front there is a
lot<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.200> detail<00:04:35.710> on<00:04:35.950> on<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.550> treads<00:04:36.880> and

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
lot of detail on on the treads and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.680 
lot of detail on on the treads and
there's<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.140> face<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:39.640> guess<00:04:40.330> that's<00:04:40.570> like

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
there's a face of I guess that's like

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.360 
there's a face of I guess that's like
Megatron's<00:04:41.200> face<00:04:41.560> or<00:04:41.800> something<00:04:42.070> right<00:04:42.160> there

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
Megatron's face or something right there

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.490 
Megatron's face or something right there
but<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:43.180> not<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.450> same<00:04:43.780> face<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.290> when<00:04:44.410> you

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
but it's not the same face that when you

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.620 
but it's not the same face that when you
stand<00:04:44.770> them<00:04:44.890> up<00:04:45.010> you<00:04:45.190> see<00:04:45.340> that's<00:04:45.940> that's<00:04:46.390> his

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
stand them up you see that's that's his

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.390 
stand them up you see that's that's his
robot<00:04:46.960> face<00:04:47.140> so<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.860> don't<00:04:48.040> know<00:04:48.100> what<00:04:48.220> that<00:04:48.370> is

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
robot face so I don't know what that is

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.550 
robot face so I don't know what that is
but<00:04:48.640> it<00:04:48.760> just<00:04:48.910> looks<00:04:49.000> like<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.270> mean<00:04:49.780> bumper

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
but it just looks like a mean bumper

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.250 
but it just looks like a mean bumper
skull<00:04:50.950> bumper<00:04:51.430> or<00:04:51.640> megatron<00:04:52.360> face<00:04:52.630> bumper<00:04:53.050> so

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
skull bumper or megatron face bumper so

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.840 
skull bumper or megatron face bumper so
so<00:04:53.830> that's<00:04:53.980> kind<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.220> cool<00:04:54.400> that<00:04:54.460> they<00:04:54.700> have

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
so that's kind of cool that they have

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.520 
so that's kind of cool that they have
that<00:04:54.970> in<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.180> front<00:04:55.480> lots<00:04:55.690> of<00:04:55.840> detail<00:04:56.200> a<00:04:56.230> lot

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
that in the front lots of detail a lot

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.040 
that in the front lots of detail a lot
lots<00:04:56.830> more<00:04:57.070> detail<00:04:57.490> on<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.910> one<00:04:58.180> then<00:04:58.690> on<00:04:58.900> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
lots more detail on this one then on the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.310 
lots more detail on this one then on the
bumblebee<00:04:59.560> a<00:05:00.210> vehicle<00:05:01.210> car<00:05:01.420> because<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:02.050> guess

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
bumblebee a vehicle car because I guess

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.180 
bumblebee a vehicle car because I guess
the<00:05:02.440> car<00:05:02.680> is<00:05:02.830> just<00:05:03.040> a<00:05:03.190> lot<00:05:03.910> more<00:05:04.060> aerodynamic

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
the car is just a lot more aerodynamic

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.650 
the car is just a lot more aerodynamic
but<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.520> see<00:05:06.670> you<00:05:06.820> can<00:05:07.210> see<00:05:07.330> all<00:05:07.360> these

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
but you see you can see all these

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.860 
but you see you can see all these
details<00:05:07.870> going<00:05:08.320> on<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.280> treads<00:05:09.550> and

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
details going on and on the treads and

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.230 
details going on and on the treads and
whatnot<00:05:10.870> so<00:05:11.070> I<00:05:12.070> think<00:05:12.460> they<00:05:12.730> both<00:05:12.880> came<00:05:13.060> out

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
whatnot so I think they both came out

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.950 
whatnot so I think they both came out
quite<00:05:13.900> well<00:05:14.020> for<00:05:14.650> what<00:05:14.830> they<00:05:14.950> are<00:05:15.720> okay<00:05:16.720> one

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
quite well for what they are okay one

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.490 
quite well for what they are okay one
last<00:05:16.990> thing<00:05:17.470> I'd<00:05:17.650> like<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.800> mention<00:05:17.980> is<00:05:18.490> that

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
last thing I'd like to mention is that

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.570 
last thing I'd like to mention is that
compared<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.650> hot<00:05:20.830> wheel<00:05:21.010> cars<00:05:21.310> during

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
compared to the hot wheel cars during

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.430 
compared to the hot wheel cars during
that<00:05:21.790> they<00:05:21.880> don't<00:05:22.060> feel<00:05:22.240> any<00:05:22.540> more<00:05:22.750> heavier<00:05:23.170> or

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
that they don't feel any more heavier or

that they don't feel any more heavier or
any<00:05:23.740> more<00:05:23.950> lighter<00:05:24.310> but<00:05:24.940> I<00:05:25.300> do<00:05:25.840> have<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.080> say
