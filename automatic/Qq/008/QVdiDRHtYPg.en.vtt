00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
season what I want to do is kind of

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.659 
season what I want to do is kind of
narrow<00:05:51.350> down<00:05:51.650> what's<00:05:52.010> getting<00:05:52.220> hit<00:05:52.430> every

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.730 
narrow down what's getting hit every
night<00:05:52.850> and<00:05:53.000> once<00:05:53.270> what's<00:05:53.810> just<00:05:54.110> you<00:05:54.410> know<00:05:54.530> a

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
night and once what's just you know a

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.300 
night and once what's just you know a
couple<00:05:54.830> times<00:05:55.669> a<00:05:55.790> week<00:05:55.820> so<00:05:56.770> I'm<00:05:57.770> figuring<00:05:57.979> that

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
couple times a week so I'm figuring that

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.420 
couple times a week so I'm figuring that
out<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:59.410> it's<00:06:00.410> looking<00:06:00.530> pretty<00:06:00.860> good<00:06:01.040> i<00:06:01.100> got

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
out and it's looking pretty good i got

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.620 
out and it's looking pretty good i got
all<00:06:02.300> five<00:06:02.630> spots<00:06:03.050> that<00:06:03.440> are<00:06:04.210> what<00:06:05.210> i<00:06:05.240> would<00:06:05.450> say

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
all five spots that are what i would say

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.920 
all five spots that are what i would say
are<00:06:05.810> pretty<00:06:06.260> much<00:06:06.410> every<00:06:06.680> night<00:06:07.030> so<00:06:08.030> I'd<00:06:08.720> say

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
are pretty much every night so I'd say

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.530 
are pretty much every night so I'd say
that's<00:06:09.050> pretty<00:06:09.260> good<00:06:09.470> for<00:06:10.000> being<00:06:11.000> all<00:06:11.360> new

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
that's pretty good for being all new

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:39.710 
that's pretty good for being all new
