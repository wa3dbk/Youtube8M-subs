00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
knife there's going to be a rubber boot

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.040 
knife there's going to be a rubber boot
right<00:01:57.780> here

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
right here

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
sorry this is actually a rubber boot so

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.760 
sorry this is actually a rubber boot so
best<00:02:04.120> thing<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.360> do<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:04.480> cut<00:02:04.840> out<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.350> rubber

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
best thing to do is cut out the rubber

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.890 
best thing to do is cut out the rubber
boot<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.420> they're<00:02:07.420> going<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:07.600> get<00:02:07.690> directly

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
boot and they're going to get directly

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.250 
boot and they're going to get directly
to<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.400> firewall<00:02:09.400> underneath<00:02:09.760> and<00:02:10.050> then<00:02:11.050> just

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
to the firewall underneath and then just

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.440 
to the firewall underneath and then just
drill<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> hole<00:02:11.890> right<00:02:12.460> through<00:02:12.520> Iran<00:02:13.180> as<00:02:13.360> you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
drill a hole right through Iran as you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.390 
drill a hole right through Iran as you
can<00:02:13.570> see<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.720> ran<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.290> four<00:02:14.620> gauge<00:02:14.860> power<00:02:15.100> wires

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
can see I ran to four gauge power wires

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.100 
can see I ran to four gauge power wires
through<00:02:15.700> there<00:02:17.100> see<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:19.000> put<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.900> wires

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
through there see so put the wires

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.930 
through there see so put the wires
through<00:02:20.350> there<00:02:20.560> once<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:20.920> drill<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.550> holes

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
through there once you drill the holes

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.960 
through there once you drill the holes
then<00:02:22.870> best<00:02:23.290> thing<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.470> do<00:02:23.710> is<00:02:23.830> grab<00:02:23.980> yourself<00:02:24.580> a

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
then best thing to do is grab yourself a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.630 
then best thing to do is grab yourself a
coat<00:02:25.450> hanger<00:02:25.600> cut<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> top<00:02:26.470> stretch<00:02:27.310> up<00:02:27.490> the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
coat hanger cut the top stretch up the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.610 
coat hanger cut the top stretch up the
coat<00:02:27.790> hanger<00:02:27.970> run<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.990> coat<00:02:29.170> hanger<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:29.500> you

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
coat hanger run the coat hanger if you

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.900 
coat hanger run the coat hanger if you
put<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.890> up<00:02:30.010> mate<00:02:30.250> when<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.460> stretch<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.700> up

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
put it up mate when you stretch it up

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.640 
put it up mate when you stretch it up
make<00:02:31.060> sure<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.270> curve<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.870> bit<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.470> as<00:02:32.560> you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
make sure you curve it a bit so as you

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.530 
make sure you curve it a bit so as you
put<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:32.980> through<00:02:33.160> it'll<00:02:33.370> action<00:02:33.670> curve<00:02:33.970> upward

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
put it through it'll action curve upward

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.640 
put it through it'll action curve upward
and<00:02:34.810> then<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.950> can<00:02:36.070> grab<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:37.440> right<00:02:38.440> through

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
and then you can grab it right through

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
and then you can grab it right through
there<00:02:38.830> once<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.940> grabbed<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.570> actually<00:02:41.290> tied

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
there once I grabbed it I actually tied

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.030 
there once I grabbed it I actually tied
on<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:43.060> wire<00:02:43.240> itself<00:02:43.690> tied<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.590> up<00:02:44.710> with<00:02:44.740> some

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
on the wire itself tied it up with some

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.000 
on the wire itself tied it up with some
tape<00:02:45.250> held<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.330> slowly<00:02:46.930> fed<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
tape held it on and slowly fed it to the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.370 
tape held it on and slowly fed it to the
hole<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.220> drilled<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.970> there<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.810> go<00:02:49.960> then<00:02:50.350> you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
hole I drilled and there you go then you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.780 
hole I drilled and there you go then you
run<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.710> wire<00:02:50.830> through<00:02:51.160> let's<00:02:51.430> see<00:02:51.640> if<00:02:51.700> you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
run the wire through let's see if you

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.220 
run the wire through let's see if you
can<00:02:51.910> see<00:02:52.120> good<00:02:52.330> look<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.750> know<00:02:52.900> it's<00:02:53.020> kind<00:02:53.200> of

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
can see good look I know it's kind of

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.280 
can see good look I know it's kind of
hard<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.470> see<00:02:53.620> there<00:02:53.800> you<00:02:53.890> go<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.230> go

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
hard to see there you go there you go

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.540 
hard to see there you go there you go
you<00:02:56.470> see<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.920> see<00:02:57.100> where<00:02:57.220> I've<00:02:57.310> drilled

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
you see it you see where I've drilled

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.340 
you see it you see where I've drilled
through<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.940> everything<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:59.020> actually

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
through and everything it's actually

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.870 
through and everything it's actually
right<00:02:59.620> there<00:02:59.920> where's<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.490> rest<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
right there where's the rest of the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.550 
right there where's the rest of the
firewall<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.570> looked<00:03:01.840> over<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.140> entire<00:03:02.380> car

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
firewall I looked over the entire car

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.620 
firewall I looked over the entire car
between<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.890> passenger<00:03:03.250> side<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:04.209> most<00:03:04.450> of

between the passenger side and most of

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.180 
between the passenger side and most of
the<00:03:04.720> firewall<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.260> pretty<00:03:05.620> not<00:03:05.980> not

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
the firewall is pretty not not

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.520 
the firewall is pretty not not
incredibly<00:03:06.880> thick<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.270> thicker<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.320> found

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
incredibly thick but thicker but I found

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.170 
incredibly thick but thicker but I found
right<00:03:08.830> there<00:03:09.040> where<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.190> boot<00:03:09.520> is<00:03:09.640> right<00:03:10.060> in

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
right there where that boot is right in

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.670 
right there where that boot is right in
that<00:03:10.300> corner<00:03:10.630> it's<00:03:10.900> actually<00:03:11.140> fairly<00:03:11.350> thin

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
that corner it's actually fairly thin

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.979 
that corner it's actually fairly thin
easy<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.070> drill<00:03:12.310> through<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:13.480> can<00:03:13.600> even<00:03:13.780> seal

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
easy to drill through you can even seal

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.270 
easy to drill through you can even seal
it<00:03:14.110> up<00:03:14.140> with<00:03:14.290> some<00:03:14.470> silicone<00:03:14.860> which<00:03:15.010> I'm<00:03:15.160> going

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
it up with some silicone which I'm going

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.500 
it up with some silicone which I'm going
to<00:03:15.370> be<00:03:15.430> doing<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.790> at<00:03:15.880> some<00:03:16.060> point<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.330> just

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
to be doing it at some point I just

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.900 
to be doing it at some point I just
finished<00:03:16.750> wiring<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.050> not<00:03:17.260> too<00:03:17.470> long<00:03:17.500> ago<00:03:17.910> so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
finished wiring this not too long ago so

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.490 
finished wiring this not too long ago so
you<00:03:18.970> know<00:03:19.330> I'm<00:03:19.450> eventually<00:03:19.930> going<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.230> seal<00:03:20.470> it

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
you know I'm eventually going to seal it

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.310 
you know I'm eventually going to seal it
up<00:03:20.709> with<00:03:20.890> some<00:03:21.130> silicone<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:22.020> there<00:03:23.020> you<00:03:23.170> go

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
up with some silicone and there you go

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.940 
up with some silicone and there you go
so<00:03:23.970> there<00:03:24.970> you'll<00:03:25.180> see<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:26.530> kind<00:03:26.770> of<00:03:26.830> tied

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
so there you'll see I just kind of tied

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.800 
so there you'll see I just kind of tied
my<00:03:27.100> wire<00:03:27.310> around<00:03:27.489> put<00:03:28.180> my<00:03:28.300> fuse<00:03:28.540> blocks

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
my wire around put my fuse blocks

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.250 
my wire around put my fuse blocks
there's<00:03:29.070> easily<00:03:30.070> accessible<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.989> then<00:03:32.110> again

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
there's easily accessible and then again

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.820 
there's easily accessible and then again
down<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.410> there<00:03:39.239> go<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.600> then<00:03:41.290> once<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.590> of

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
down in there go and then once you of

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.260 
down in there go and then once you of
course<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.280> said<00:03:42.489> drill<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.790> wire<00:03:42.940> through

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
course it said drill the wire through

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.510 
course it said drill the wire through
feet<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.110> coat<00:03:44.320> hanger<00:03:44.440> tie<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.190> wire

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
feet of the coat hanger tie the wire

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.900 
feet of the coat hanger tie the wire
right<00:03:45.880> on<00:03:46.090> onto<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> coat<00:03:47.020> hanger<00:03:47.140> itself

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
right on onto the coat hanger itself

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.160 
right on onto the coat hanger itself
slowly<00:03:48.910> from<00:03:49.480> this<00:03:49.750> side<00:03:51.090> slowly<00:03:52.090> pull<00:03:53.020> the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
slowly from this side slowly pull the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.199 
slowly from this side slowly pull the
power<00:03:53.410> wire<00:03:53.739> and<00:03:54.010> through<00:03:54.340> as<00:03:54.580> you<00:03:54.940> need<00:03:55.180> to

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
power wire and through as you need to

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.940 
power wire and through as you need to
once<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.019> get<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.350> that<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.560> can<00:03:56.680> take<00:03:56.830> it

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
once you get it to that you can take it

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.830 
once you get it to that you can take it
start<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.310> know<00:03:57.430> pulling<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.269> little<00:03:58.420> more<00:03:58.660> get

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
start you know pulling a little more get

start you know pulling a little more get
it<00:03:58.959> all<00:03:59.080> through<00:03:59.380> but<00:03:59.920> that's<00:04:00.040> basically<00:04:00.280> the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
it all through but that's basically the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.070 
it all through but that's basically the
