that<00:01:07.280> hot<00:01:07.910> so<00:01:08.240> I<00:01:08.270> think<00:01:08.360> um<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.080> people<00:01:09.350> at

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
that hot so I think um the people at

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.779 
that hot so I think um the people at
nintendo's<00:01:09.860> like<00:01:09.979> we<00:01:10.100> gotta<00:01:10.250> get<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:10.490> platoon

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
nintendo's like we gotta get to platoon

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.600 
nintendo's like we gotta get to platoon
out<00:01:10.910> even<00:01:11.210> if<00:01:11.300> it's<00:01:11.450> not<00:01:11.750> fully<00:01:12.200> done<00:01:12.520> at<00:01:13.520> the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
out even if it's not fully done at the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.310 
out even if it's not fully done at the
beginning<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.090> summer<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:14.780> people<00:01:14.960> guy<00:01:15.170> should

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
beginning of summer so people guy should

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.600 
beginning of summer so people guy should
be<00:01:15.350> playing<00:01:15.649> this<00:01:15.800> game<00:01:15.979> for<00:01:16.039> at<00:01:16.280> least<00:01:16.369> three

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
be playing this game for at least three

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.430 
be playing this game for at least three
or<00:01:16.700> four<00:01:16.880> months<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.420> then<00:01:17.959> family<00:01:18.289> could

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
or four months and then family could

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.779 
or four months and then family could
release<00:01:18.649> our<00:01:18.800> next<00:01:19.069> game<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.369> we<00:01:19.520> will<00:01:19.640> be

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
release our next game and we will be

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.609 
release our next game and we will be
fine<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.420> think<00:01:20.899> that's<00:01:21.020> why<00:01:21.140> this<00:01:21.200> game<00:01:21.470> was

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
fine I think that's why this game was

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:22.690 
fine I think that's why this game was
really<00:01:21.770> Russian<00:01:22.220> we<00:01:22.310> don't<00:01:22.520> have<00:01:22.610> the
