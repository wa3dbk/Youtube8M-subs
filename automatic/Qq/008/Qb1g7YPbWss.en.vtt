00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.940
 and nothing more 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.910
 now let's see how it gets in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.439
 practice the technique of mixing over 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.960
 paper let's think that this cushion 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:31.930
 we're going to put it in earth tones and I'm going 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.329
 to then use marker 51 and 33 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.059
 to make the shade of the coty brand 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.610
 that so in this case I'm going to start 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.530
 the other way around I'm going to start doing the shadow 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.530
 first with the 33 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.950
 I decide that my shadow is in the part 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.790
 under the cushion so I'm going to apply 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.780
 shadow where all the light that would be in the 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.780
 bottom part of the cushion 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.640
 little on the sides 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.640
 and that is going to give you an appearance 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 rounded 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.040
 a little here in the division a little bit of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.040
 shadow 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.330
 and now I'm going to go with the clearest 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.010
 in the opposite direction 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.020
 in this case it is a cushion in earth tones 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.040
 let's apply the light color in the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.659
 top part where the cushions 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.530
 receive more light 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.530
 of the environment 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.890
 let's go over that color from 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.890
 down 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.369
 If we erase the dividing line between the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.590
 colors and let's mix over the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.869
 same cushion creating a shadow area 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.890
 but with a smoother transition without 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.890
 leave a line 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.230
 this shadow we can also put a 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.230
 little of the shadow on the furniture in the 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.690
 two 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.690
 Y 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.310
 and here we have applied the two techniques 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.170
 the mixing technique on paper and the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.590
 technique of flickr in or brush strokes in 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.590
 Start 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.650
 already
