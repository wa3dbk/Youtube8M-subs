00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.740
 house that is your house 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.840

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.389
 videos and to follow us on our blog and 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.369

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.369
 true thank you and thank you for all your 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.100
 comments and good we are still in the subject 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.960
 of the diet because it's not that I'm going to 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.130
 stay on a diet all life simply 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.500
 diet means a way of eating and I 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.399
 what I did when doing so long 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.110
 diet is changing the way I eat 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.650
 then today I'll share how I 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.930
 like some delicious eggs with ham 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.910
 the crashed eggs a way that I 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.800
 I do them a long time ago it's not 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.980
 no science or any wonder 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.230
 but I share it with you and hope you like it 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.149
 these eggs are very simple the only thing 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.930
 what we are going to do first is to chop 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.600
 finite 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.420
 the ham is just the way to make 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.910
 it's not that they are the great science eggs 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.700
 starred with ham everyone makes 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.460
 eggs studied with ham but to me 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.080
 like we do them in 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.950
 first I do not put any fat 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.170
 to the pan 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.250
 and what we are going to do is wait for 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.840
 brown all this ham cured very well 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.289
 remember that in the diet we can eat 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.259
 Two slices of ham is already good 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.479
 well golden, that's how it is richer 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.750
 but let's put your eggs up 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.200
 this bed of 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.909
 hammond then how rich are they to the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.819
 family loves 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.240
 to the children to the husband you can give us 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.310
 with a delicious toasted web 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 here the only thing that matters most 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.539
 after the ham is golden brown 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.530
 the eggs do not break is that it sew 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.899
 to the taste of the family to me that's how 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.939
 I like there are people who liked it more 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.880
 known then that's your choice 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.219
 look perfect desmolda this is the pan 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.119
 some have asked me what pan in 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.959
 its use 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.860

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.819

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.299
 that this egg is favorite for me 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:28.340
 it's got chunky on top raw 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:31.579
 of this firm the clear and raw the yolk 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.120
 It is a delicious combination and meets 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.819
