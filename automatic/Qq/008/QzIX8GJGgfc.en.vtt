00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.000
 time and pressure is not the most convenient 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.709
 cover design and lack 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.870
 ability to find out the current temperature 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.280
 inside the bowl can hardly be considered 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.280
 significant shortcomings
