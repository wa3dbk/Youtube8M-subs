00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
she can and you're really hoping he's

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.280 
she can and you're really hoping he's
gonna<00:01:43.360> stay<00:01:43.480> at<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.660> racetrack<00:01:43.840> and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
gonna stay at the racetrack and

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.450 
gonna stay at the racetrack and
initially<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:44.710> looked<00:01:44.890> like<00:01:45.040> he<00:01:45.160> was<00:01:45.220> going<00:01:45.370> to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
initially it looked like he was going to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.740 
initially it looked like he was going to
stay<00:01:45.610> up<00:01:45.640> there<00:01:45.940> he<00:01:46.000> still<00:01:46.270> had<00:01:46.390> quite<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:46.600> bit

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
stay up there he still had quite a bit

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.090 
stay up there he still had quite a bit
of<00:01:46.780> speed<00:01:47.050> when<00:01:47.230> to<00:01:47.320> start<00:01:47.470> crashing<00:01:47.860> into<00:01:48.010> the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
of speed when to start crashing into the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.060 
of speed when to start crashing into the
corner<00:01:48.400> but<00:01:49.470> he<00:01:50.470> started<00:01:50.710> coming<00:01:50.830> down<00:01:50.920> the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
corner but he started coming down the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
corner but he started coming down the
track<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.460> was<00:01:51.580> already<00:01:51.700> committed<00:01:51.850> to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
track and I was already committed to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.460 
track and I was already committed to
going<00:01:52.240> low<00:01:52.480> it's<00:01:52.660> just<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:53.020> it's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
going low it's just that it's

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.440 
going low it's just that it's
unfortunate<00:01:53.980> our<00:01:54.160> shop<00:01:54.730> Angela<00:01:55.120> Ford<00:01:55.300> wasn't

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
unfortunate our shop Angela Ford wasn't

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.580 
unfortunate our shop Angela Ford wasn't
the<00:01:55.600> best<00:01:55.810> but<00:01:55.930> I<00:01:56.050> felt<00:01:56.230> like<00:01:56.290> we<00:01:56.350> could<00:01:56.560> make

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
the best but I felt like we could make

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.690 
the best but I felt like we could make
some<00:01:56.800> adjustments<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.280> make<00:01:57.400> it<00:01:57.550> a<00:01:57.580> little

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
some adjustments to make it a little

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.910 
some adjustments to make it a little
better<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.060> at<00:01:59.050> least<00:01:59.200> have<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.410> shot<00:01:59.680> at<00:01:59.800> when

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
better and at least have a shot at when

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.870 
better and at least have a shot at when
that<00:01:59.950> million<00:02:00.370> at<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.580> end<00:02:00.700> but

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
that million at the end but

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.610 
that million at the end but
unfortunately<00:02:01.870> gonna<00:02:01.990> have<00:02:02.200> no<00:02:02.290> fun<00:02:02.320> tonight
