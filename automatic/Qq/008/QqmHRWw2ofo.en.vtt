00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.080
 of a high five leads during 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.059
 for example watching a movie or 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 when you listen to your favorite 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.180
 plate 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.310
 first the headphones themselves 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
 so he is completely black 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.640
 he is very light and he has 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 great 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 ear cups with large ear cushions 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.730
 this because really an over-ear 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.410
 headphones is your ear really goes there 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.540
 all the way in 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 And yes the good thing is that he really 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.890
 has fabric ear cushions and yes it is 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.320
 just really very nice you can 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 understand over time then yes 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 by of course not really an irritant 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
 feeling around your ears and yes those 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.340
 fabric ear pads ensure that all real 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.800
 for all that just whole 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.539
 remains comfortable also has a soft 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.289
 lining as you see on the headband 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.969
 self 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.730
 then you also see that there is a kind 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.039
 leathery fabric is a processed and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.690
 I also have the charging point here 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.390
 so that you can use the headphones 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.309
 charge when put on the cent station 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.840
 to the ear cups themselves that also have 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.060
 an open design 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.189
 That means that you really have an extra 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.380
 surround sound so're so fine 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.659
 when so watch an exciting movie 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.650
 the earcups themselves can also be put on and on 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.630
 move down 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.310
 partially from left to right and the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.259
 headphones are of course in length 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.880
 adjustable so it is not alone 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.130
 foldable 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.659
 Well the rechargeable batteries can also 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 put into the earcups 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.380
 well how you do that is very easy you 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.799
 turns the ear cushions a little bit 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.450
 to the left and then you can use the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.880
 put in batteries 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.030
 well and with a full battery he goes 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.649
 about 18 hours 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.659
 after charging your headphones 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.909
 So you through your headphones on the s 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.070
 station and like I said and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.259
 then you see an indication at the front 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.180
 light that says whether or not it already 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.100
 for is already that red so must still 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.320
 to be charged more is green than 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.850
 so he is full to okay see there still 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.829
 sit a level button you can choose 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.259
 between arm and I level control of many 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.719
 more level control ' so you already have it on 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.420
 at least one level control ' 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.430
 so you can adjust the volume with this rotary knob 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.440
 we determine ourselves we go to the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.610
 back then we see there at all 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.830
 shackles she has there a 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.840
 optical connection and an analogue 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.730
 audio connection and for both 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.560
 connections you also get 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.770
 a cable and that's how you close easily 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.510
 on your TV stereo tower or even you 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.250
 computer to then over the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.930
 sound quality you can expect 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.210
 that with a set like this 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.110
 that it is high and that is certainly it 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.090
 case 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.920
 every detail in your music or during one 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.080
 you just hear a film and because it is so 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.700
 really gives a spatial sound 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.320
 so you have when viewing it from 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.080
 a movie so really feel 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.940
 yes that you are really in the middle of it 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.740
 what is also very nice is you 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.510
 for example, the volume can be adjusted with 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.190
 the earcup itself there you have another 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.190
 number of buttons on it 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.490
 and you also have the level control there 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.690
 so does not necessarily have to go to the sets 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.450
 and walk to the station 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.980
 so you want to arrange this all be well 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.750
 journey has also thought about you 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.890
 of course watch a movie with several 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.840
 people 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.270
 that's why you can have no fewer than four 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.600
 connect this type of headset to 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.360
 this broadcasting station is quite a range 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.590
 great because they are going wireless 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.480
 up to 100 meters 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.800
 And that means that you for example 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.420
 while watching the movie too 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.880
 just walk into the kitchen if you want 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.380
 for example, get some drink 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.959
