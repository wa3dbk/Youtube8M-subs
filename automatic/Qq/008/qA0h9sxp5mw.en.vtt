00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
those two so i'll create a whole new

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.950 
those two so i'll create a whole new
arena<00:00:40.280> it's<00:00:41.280> gonna<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:41.700> large

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.080 

alright<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:52.040> first<00:00:53.040> so<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.059> have

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
alright so first so that you can have

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.530 
alright so first so that you can have
six<00:00:54.510> shapes<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.170> six<00:00:55.500> items<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> basically

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
six shapes and six items so basically

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.799 
six shapes and six items so basically
i'll<00:00:57.720> take<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.199> shape<00:00:58.470> I'll<00:00:58.680> take<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.809> cylinder

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
i'll take one shape I'll take a cylinder

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
i'll take one shape I'll take a cylinder
I'll<00:01:01.769> drag<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.960> under<00:01:03.960> my<00:01:04.199> water<00:01:04.500> bottle<00:01:05.390> maybe

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I'll drag it under my water bottle maybe

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.649 
I'll drag it under my water bottle maybe
if<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.960> wondering<00:01:07.350> that's<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.710> too<00:01:07.770> small<00:01:08.659> but

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
if I wondering that's way too small but

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.830 
if I wondering that's way too small but
that's<00:01:09.930> why<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.659> make<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:13.020> bigger<00:01:14.570> by<00:01:15.570> just

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that's why we can make it bigger by just

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.219 
that's why we can make it bigger by just
dragging<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.950> gets<00:01:17.250> bigger<00:01:18.080> don't<00:01:19.080> make

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
dragging this it gets bigger don't make

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.219 
dragging this it gets bigger don't make
it<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.470> big<00:01:19.649> as<00:01:19.800> a<00:01:19.830> water<00:01:20.100> bottle<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.570> make<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
it as big as a water bottle and make it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
it as big as a water bottle and make it
wider<00:01:24.410> so<00:01:25.410> it's<00:01:25.649> as<00:01:25.830> thick<00:01:26.190> as<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> water

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
wider so it's as thick as the water

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.990 
wider so it's as thick as the water
bottle<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.289> looks<00:01:28.560> real<00:01:28.880> maybe<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> little

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
bottle so it looks real maybe a little

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.380 
bottle so it looks real maybe a little
bit<00:01:30.300> thicker<00:01:30.539> than<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.490> make<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.149> it's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
bit thicker than it will make it so it's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.740 
bit thicker than it will make it so it's
invisible<00:01:33.929> and<00:01:34.880> since<00:01:35.880> its<00:01:36.030> water<00:01:36.270> will<00:01:36.570> make

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
invisible and since its water will make

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020 
invisible and since its water will make
it<00:01:36.960> shoot<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.500> water<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.550> good<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it shoot out water if it's good if it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.980 
it shoot out water if it's good if it
gets<00:01:39.210> shot<00:01:39.509> by<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.229> tank<00:01:40.619> by<00:01:41.520> rocket<00:01:41.970> next<00:01:42.869> we'll

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
gets shot by a tank by rocket next we'll

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.880 
gets shot by a tank by rocket next we'll
take<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.440> another<00:01:43.649> cylinder<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.670> our<00:01:44.820> lotion

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
take on another cylinder for our lotion

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.230 
take on another cylinder for our lotion
drag<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.069> under<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:48.950> make<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.190> bigger<00:01:53.240> stop

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
drag it under there make it bigger stop

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.380 
drag it under there make it bigger stop
right<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.799> make<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> thicker<00:02:02.390> in

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
right there and make it thicker in

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
right there and make it thicker in
physical<00:02:06.350> will<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.920> shoot<00:02:08.310> out

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
physical will just make it shoot out

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.170 
physical will just make it shoot out
fire<00:02:08.850> even<00:02:09.600> though<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.079> real<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.730> no

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
fire even though it's not real so no

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.330 
fire even though it's not real so no
next<00:02:12.660> for<00:02:12.900> our<00:02:13.140> Garrett<00:02:13.950> will<00:02:14.519> use<00:02:16.040> will<00:02:17.040> use<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
next for our Garrett will use will use a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.720 
next for our Garrett will use will use a
cube<00:02:19.220> it's<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> closest<00:02:20.760> thing

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:40.570 

then<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.750> will<00:02:27.970> make<00:02:28.970> get<00:02:30.129> wire<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:39.310> make<00:02:40.310> it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
then we will make get wire it make it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:50.480 
then we will make get wire it make it
longer

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.800 

make<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.480> little<00:02:51.630> bit<00:02:51.780> bigger<00:02:53.690> it's<00:02:54.690> about

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
make it a little bit bigger it's about

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.050 
make it a little bit bigger it's about
it<00:02:57.170> make<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.800> got<00:02:59.040> smoke<00:02:59.900> cuz<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:02.430> closest

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
it make it you got smoke cuz the closest

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.020 
it make it you got smoke cuz the closest
thing<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.570> would<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:05.010> spray<00:03:05.820> deodorant

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
thing to it would be the spray deodorant

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.200 
thing to it would be the spray deodorant
so<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.660> know<00:03:06.870> whatever<00:03:07.460> make<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.850> over<00:03:09.120> the

so you know whatever make you over the
next<00:03:09.450> one<00:03:10.730> make<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:12.000> wider<00:03:14.900> longer<00:03:15.900> first<00:03:17.960> wire

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.860 

a<00:03:26.310> little<00:03:27.270> bit<00:03:27.420> taller<00:03:30.320> all<00:03:31.320> right<00:03:32.360> now<00:03:33.360> do<00:03:33.420> the
