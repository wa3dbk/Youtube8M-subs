00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
decisions about how to make it more

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.869 
decisions about how to make it more
habitual<00:00:43.079> maybe<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.250> means<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.550> can't<00:00:44.760> do

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
habitual maybe that means you can't do

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.880 
habitual maybe that means you can't do
it<00:00:45.000> every<00:00:45.210> day<00:00:45.239> maybe<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.140> means<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.680> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
it every day maybe that means that you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.380 
it every day maybe that means that you
have<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> same<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:48.120> each<00:00:48.180> day

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390

if<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.230> every<00:00:49.410> day<00:00:49.440> maybe<00:00:49.920> it

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
if you want to do it every day maybe it

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.709 
if you want to do it every day maybe it
needs<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> part<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.570> your

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
needs to be really a part of your

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.470 
needs to be really a part of your
schedule<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.730> depends<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.270> your

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
schedule it really depends on what your

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
schedule it really depends on what your
goal<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.010> find<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.370> way<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
goal is but you have to find a way to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
goal is but you have to find a way to
make<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.149> habitual<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> by<00:00:59.129> now

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
make it habitual because it is by now

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.270 
make it habitual because it is by now
enough<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.960> habit<00:01:01.350> mentally<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
enough of a habit mentally that you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.500 
enough of a habit mentally that you
should<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.640> thinking<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> time

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
should be thinking about it all the time

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.289 
should be thinking about it all the time
the<00:01:04.199> question<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.949> whether<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.970> habit<00:01:06.150> or

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the question of whether it's a habit or

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
the question of whether it's a habit or
not<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> actually<00:01:07.140> relevant<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.830> week<00:01:08.070> we've

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
not is actually relevant this week we've

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
not is actually relevant this week we've
been<00:01:08.460> talking<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.119> Lee<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.869> more

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
been talking so Lee and more and more

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.719 
been talking so Lee and more and more
about<00:01:10.320> whether<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.860> becoming<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.310> habit<00:01:11.340> but

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
about whether it's becoming a habit but

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.660 
about whether it's becoming a habit but
now<00:01:11.909> by<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:13.170> should<00:01:13.229> feel<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.619> Evan<00:01:14.040> if

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
now by now it should feel like Evan if

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.719 
now by now it should feel like Evan if
it<00:01:14.909> doesn't<00:01:15.290> it<00:01:16.290> probably<00:01:16.799> means<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> your

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it doesn't it probably means that your

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.420 
it doesn't it probably means that your
baby<00:01:18.180> step<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.840> too<00:01:19.140> big<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.070> while<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.250> can

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
baby step was too big it was while I can

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.190 
baby step was too big it was while I can
maybe<00:01:20.460> leak<00:01:20.820> then<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> was<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> baby<00:01:21.750> step<00:01:22.049> or

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
maybe leak then it was the baby step or

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.630 
maybe leak then it was the baby step or
maybe<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.830> leak<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.369> named<00:01:23.520> in

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
maybe it was just a leak it was named in

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.330 
maybe it was just a leak it was named in
a<00:01:23.700> baby<00:01:23.880> league<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> time<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
a baby league so now is the time to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.510 
a baby league so now is the time to
really<00:01:26.670> consider<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.990> doable<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.770> you're

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
really consider is this doable if you're

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.330 
really consider is this doable if you're
still<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.030> finding<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> habitual<00:01:31.680> at<00:01:31.860> three

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
still not finding and habitual at three

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
still not finding and habitual at three
weeks<00:01:32.549> into<00:01:32.970> doing<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.799> probably<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
weeks into doing this it's probably a

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.910 
weeks into doing this it's probably a
goal<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:36.119> outside<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.020> range<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.799> what

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
goal that's outside of the range of what

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
goal that's outside of the range of what
a<00:01:38.570> natural<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.350> baby<00:01:41.009> step<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.579> basically

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
a natural for you baby step is basically

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.560 
a natural for you baby step is basically
if<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:44.159> coming<00:01:44.399> naturally<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
if it's not coming naturally to you you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
if it's not coming naturally to you you
need<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.869> modify<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> does<00:01:47.009> come

need to modify it so it does come
naturally<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.170> means

naturally to you and if that means
scaling<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.670> back<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.360> doesn't<00:01:51.810> matter

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
scaling way back it doesn't matter

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.780 
scaling way back it doesn't matter
whether<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.649> disappointing<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.670> not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
if that means scaling way back it means

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
if that means scaling way back it means
scaling<00:01:55.740> way<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:56.040> find<00:01:56.700> something<00:01:57.210> that

what I'm doing the problem is not

what I'm doing the problem is not
whether<00:02:15.459> it's<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:16.150> baby<00:02:16.360> step<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.019> fit<00:02:17.290> in

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379

my life it is if that's the case then

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.979 
my life it is if that's the case then
the<00:02:21.189> only<00:02:21.370> thing<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:22.420> need<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.629> worry<00:02:22.750> about

the only thing you need to worry about

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.710 
the only thing you need to worry about
is<00:02:23.519> why<00:02:25.290> why<00:02:26.290> are<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:27.280> doing<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:28.299> goal<00:02:29.400> why

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
is why why are you doing this goal why

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.830 
is why why are you doing this goal why
because<00:02:31.720> clearly<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.590> motivation<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:34.569> do<00:02:34.810> it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
because clearly the motivation to do it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.220 
because clearly the motivation to do it
isn't<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.549> must<00:02:36.909> want<00:02:37.329> this<00:02:37.420> goal<00:02:37.959> in

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
isn't there you must want this goal in

isn't there you must want this goal in
your<00:02:38.409> life<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:40.030> key<00:02:40.359> thing<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
your life that is the key thing to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.539 
your life that is the key thing to
remember<00:02:41.049> with<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.590> baby<00:02:41.769> steps<00:02:42.129> they<00:02:42.400> are

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
remember with the baby steps they are

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.009 
remember with the baby steps they are
baby<00:02:42.790> steps<00:02:42.939> and<00:02:43.269> they'll<00:02:43.359> ease<00:02:43.599> you<00:02:43.810> in<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
baby steps and they'll ease you in the

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.509 
baby steps and they'll ease you in the
right<00:02:44.140> direction<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.829> have<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.190> want<00:02:45.400> it

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
right direction but you have to want it

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.000 
right direction but you have to want it
because<00:02:46.480> if<00:02:46.599> you<00:02:46.690> don't<00:02:46.840> you're<00:02:47.650> not<00:02:47.769> going<00:02:47.950> to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
because if you don't you're not going to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.319 
because if you don't you're not going to
do<00:02:48.099> it<00:02:48.220> even<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.120> goal<00:02:49.299> is

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
do it even if the goal is

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.319 
do it even if the goal is
extraordinarily<00:02:49.989> doable<00:02:50.909> so<00:02:51.909> you<00:02:51.970> have<00:02:52.209> to

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
extraordinarily doable so you have to

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.470 
extraordinarily doable so you have to
examine<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.870> why<00:02:53.170> sometimes<00:02:54.099> it's<00:02:54.489> a<00:02:54.609> simple

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
examine the why sometimes it's a simple

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.270 
examine the why sometimes it's a simple
matter<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:56.200> making<00:02:56.379> the<00:02:56.620> connecting<00:02:57.190> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
matter of just making the connecting the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.789 
matter of just making the connecting the
dots<00:02:57.400> why<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.569> water<00:02:58.810> important<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.409> me<00:02:59.500> well

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
dots why is water important to me well

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.099 
dots why is water important to me well
I'm<00:03:00.280> feeling<00:03:00.609> better<00:03:01.030> I'm<00:03:01.269> sleeping<00:03:01.780> better<00:03:01.930> I

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
that control I knew it was a baby step

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.050 
that control I knew it was a baby step
obviously<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.310> was<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.459> little<00:04:15.609> cleaning<00:04:15.879> the

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060

morning a little cleaning in the evening

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.750 
morning a little cleaning in the evening
it<00:04:17.500> wasn't<00:04:17.799> anything<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.190> wasn't<00:04:18.519> used<00:04:18.669> to

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
it wasn't anything I wasn't used to

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.729 
it wasn't anything I wasn't used to
doing<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.570> was<00:04:19.810> just<00:04:19.989> simply<00:04:20.260> putting<00:04:20.530> myself

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
doing it was just simply putting myself

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.790 
doing it was just simply putting myself
on<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.070> schedule<00:04:21.669> for<00:04:21.700> doing<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.389> so<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.620> bait

on a schedule for doing it so the bait
the<00:04:23.979> step<00:04:24.190> was<00:04:24.310> obviously<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.820> baby

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
the step was obviously a baby

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.500 
the step was obviously a baby
because<00:04:25.490> it<00:04:25.610> was<00:04:25.730> stuff<00:04:25.910> i<00:04:26.000> was<00:04:26.210> kind<00:04:26.480> of

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
because it was stuff i was kind of

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.240 
because it was stuff i was kind of
already<00:04:26.690> doing<00:04:27.050> but<00:04:27.230> making<00:04:27.560> it<00:04:27.620> regular<00:04:28.040> and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
then the other side of that of the other

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.310 
then the other side of that of the other
part<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:30.889> is<00:04:31.040> that<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.730> was<00:04:32.230> something<00:04:33.230> I

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
the morning so why not make a challenge

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.870 
the morning so why not make a challenge
to<00:04:44.930> fix<00:04:45.139> that<00:04:45.260> i<00:04:45.440> wanted<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.980> talk<00:04:46.190> about<00:04:46.220> then

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.330 
to fix that i wanted to talk about then
again<00:04:47.210> why<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.600> why<00:04:48.050> makes<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.770> difference<00:04:49.160> in

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
again why the why makes a difference in

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.670 
again why the why makes a difference in
how<00:04:49.370> it's<00:04:49.639> a<00:04:49.730> habit<00:04:49.880> for<00:04:50.240> example<00:04:51.139> with<00:04:51.470> my

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
how it's a habit for example with my

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.250 
how it's a habit for example with my
habit<00:04:52.160> i<00:04:52.340> don't<00:04:52.610> have<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.210> do<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.510> every<00:04:53.660> day<00:04:53.840> I

the<00:04:58.550> but<00:04:59.330> it's<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.630> point<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.800> point<00:05:00.980> of

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
the but it's the point it's the point of

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.490 
the but it's the point it's the point of
I<00:05:01.550> need<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.910> do<00:05:02.060> it<00:05:02.240> it's<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.660> principle<00:05:03.350> of

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
I need to do it it's the principle of

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.020 
I need to do it it's the principle of
the<00:05:03.560> thing<00:05:03.680> if<00:05:04.070> you<00:05:04.250> will<00:05:04.460> it's<00:05:04.760> not<00:05:04.970> that

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
the thing if you will it's not that

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.180

process leads me down the road to a pile

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:11.920 
process leads me down the road to a pile
of<00:05:10.910> dishes<00:05:11.210> at<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.540> end<00:05:11.660> of<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.780> week<00:05:11.900> that

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
work we had spent a whole day at

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.860 
work we had spent a whole day at
Disneyland<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.700> day<00:05:31.850> before<00:05:32.000> and<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.450> was<00:05:32.630> just

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
Disneyland the day before and I was just

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.380 
Disneyland the day before and I was just
so<00:05:33.620> I'm<00:05:33.680> kind<00:05:33.919> of<00:05:33.979> chilly<00:05:34.190> I<00:05:34.430> was<00:05:34.880> just<00:05:35.090> really

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
so I'm kind of chilly I was just really

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.650 
so I'm kind of chilly I was just really
really<00:05:35.900> missing<00:05:36.410> any<00:05:36.919> time<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.669> do<00:05:37.820> chores<00:05:38.240> and

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
really missing any time to do chores and

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.930 
really missing any time to do chores and
so<00:05:39.320> Corey<00:05:39.710> was<00:05:39.830> like<00:05:39.979> well<00:05:40.190> just<00:05:40.430> do<00:05:40.520> it's<00:05:40.820> no

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
so Corey was like well just do it's no

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.370 
so Corey was like well just do it's no
big<00:05:41.090> deal<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.419> he<00:05:41.570> just<00:05:41.780> went<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.080> did<00:05:42.260> him

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
big deal and he just went and did him

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.440 
big deal and he just went and did him
and<00:05:42.530> so<00:05:43.370> I<00:05:43.400> got<00:05:43.669> to<00:05:43.760> check<00:05:43.789> them<00:05:44.090> off<00:05:44.210> of<00:05:44.240> my

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
and so I got to check them off of my

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.450 
and so I got to check them off of my
calendar<00:05:44.900> now<00:05:45.229> is<00:05:45.440> that<00:05:45.560> cheating<00:05:45.830> because<00:05:46.280> I

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
calendar now is that cheating because I

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.110 
calendar now is that cheating because I
didn't<00:05:46.760> do<00:05:46.940> it<00:05:47.650> possibly<00:05:48.650> but<00:05:49.520> it's<00:05:49.789> more

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
didn't do it possibly but it's more

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.150 
didn't do it possibly but it's more
likely<00:05:50.510> the<00:05:50.930> fact<00:05:51.169> that<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.500> chores<00:05:51.770> getting

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
likely the fact that the chores getting

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.070 
likely the fact that the chores getting
done<00:05:52.370> and<00:05:52.580> that<00:05:52.729> was<00:05:53.000> the<00:05:53.180> whole<00:05:53.450> goal<00:05:53.780> of<00:05:53.960> the

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
done and that was the whole goal of the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.080 
done and that was the whole goal of the
challenge<00:05:54.500> so<00:05:55.070> occasionally<00:05:55.400> when<00:05:55.789> Corey

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
challenge so occasionally when Corey

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.480 
challenge so occasionally when Corey
does<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.510> chores<00:05:56.810> I<00:05:57.110> mark<00:05:57.800> it<00:05:57.890> off<00:05:58.010> and<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.460> say

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
does the chores I mark it off and I say

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.219 
does the chores I mark it off and I say
I<00:05:58.729> did<00:05:59.030> it<00:05:59.060> but<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.390> didn't<00:05:59.750> but<00:05:59.930> I<00:05:59.960> delegated

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
I did it but I didn't but I delegated

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.420 
I did it but I didn't but I delegated
and<00:06:00.680> that's<00:06:00.830> sort<00:06:00.979> of<00:06:01.070> the<00:06:01.130> same<00:06:01.370> thing

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
and that's sort of the same thing

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.730 
and that's sort of the same thing
because<00:06:01.940> then<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.330> end<00:06:02.450> the<00:06:02.930> tour<00:06:03.200> gets<00:06:03.380> done

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
because then the end the tour gets done

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.130 
because then the end the tour gets done
now<00:06:04.070> your<00:06:04.760> goal<00:06:04.910> is<00:06:04.940> water<00:06:05.270> drinking<00:06:05.690> exercise

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
now your goal is water drinking exercise

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.500 
now your goal is water drinking exercise
you<00:06:06.289> can't<00:06:06.500> delegate<00:06:06.860> but<00:06:07.490> if<00:06:07.610> your<00:06:07.820> chore<00:06:08.300> is

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
you can't delegate but if your chore is
