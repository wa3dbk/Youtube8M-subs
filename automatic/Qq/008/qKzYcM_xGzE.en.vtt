00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.860
 slowly but surely the topper comes across 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.960
 PSV closer to the squatter is early in 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.120

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.029
 and two in the ranking and duel with a lot 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.360
 battle and memorable moments that occur 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.759
 now ball for it is thea 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.310
 or player thriving for that out 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.189
 to euro to ruin it the player the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.160
 suspense everything around it and such a sweet and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.290
 toe life of whole week it was one 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.890
 I think beautiful sport you can have on 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.840
 it out so we are going to goods 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.260
 we are up against a good club 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.949
 weird smile on the face we go 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.750
 the farmer 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.149
 these psv are the dean again 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.309
 fully back against az daley played 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.679
 blind a great match since they 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.289
 then made himself an entrance and dual fieldman 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.399
 last 75 minutes with 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.960
 young ajax 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.670
 ricardo van rhijn was an hour long 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.239
 they both actively learned good ones 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.159
 leaving an impression was not easy 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.130
 about circumstances with the same people 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.280
 I have so many languages ​​but you want both 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.740
 did well 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.170
 and so all those who wanted even longer 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.710
 play saw in his facial expression 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.869
 but can be satisfied with one 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.390
 these minutes are important again 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.640
 each pass to ajax 1 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.530
 so if i have a nice one she programs 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.570
 to continuously again there is evidence 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.340
 those guys now have are there too 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.659
 very well done that is alone 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.399
 good thing the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.710
 the competition is that the pressure be 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.869
 stepped up, and the level thus carried on 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.179
 must be want to want them in the boss 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.920
 so please continue coaching that on 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.750
 its middle and almost fit 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.940
 selection is preparing for duel against 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.190
 PSV the club that the competition is good 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.619
 begun which I top with 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.179
 no chosen from 2000 that says something 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.929
 about 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:03.200
 shot forces the effectiveness of 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.580
 from psv so yes its always nice 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.320
 competition and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.040
 two different years 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.590
 matches it a bit too 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.240
 the same result is there is one 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.030
 beautiful animal is played by lasse 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.740
 schöne and rounded or sigthorsson 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.600
 and again, every goal can be gold 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.460
 worth the duel between the clubs 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.230
 that their favorite role so far 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.120
 fully deliver 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.980
 I think both clubs are both teams 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.530
 just feel about women 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.170
 over 2 matches 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.460
 yes we will take that next 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.250
 Sunday 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.500
 yes just stay one 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.450
 things taken the game cleared two teams 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.450
 who like to play offensive 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.680
 that can also be the effective one 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.410
 yes i have a good feeling about it but that 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.530
 does not mean that you will end up 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.060
 it will also have to z but 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.400
 think we are the clover but it will 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.500
 psv also the youth not only has the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.970
 future but sometimes also a leading role 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.840
 as a viktor fischer two seasons 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.460
 ago through three an it is decided 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.080
 and who knows this time others may 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.550
 talents take over the baton as 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.680
 anwar el-ghazi 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.330
 or his generation on the other 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.740
 flunky stand 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.200
 walk very easily along choose 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.850
 then what a great number to one 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.850
 amazingly beautiful on it
