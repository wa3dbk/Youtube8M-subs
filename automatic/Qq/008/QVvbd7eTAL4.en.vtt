00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.000 
then you kind of like pull them apart
and<00:02:35.850> then<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.360> goes<00:02:37.140> all<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.410> way<00:02:37.590> up<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.740> braid

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
and then it goes all the way up to braid

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.740 
and then it goes all the way up to braid
well<00:02:38.550> that's<00:02:38.730> not<00:02:38.850> working<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.330> me<00:02:39.390> because
