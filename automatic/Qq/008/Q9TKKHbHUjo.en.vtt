 colors rose pink plums 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.160
 so I used in this video that 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.210
 yves saint laurent products since 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.460

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 on my dear from the dyed background 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.780
 until the lipstick invites to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.400
 watch this look and if you bah 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.860
 pleasure 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.869
 so here I present you late in 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.680
 hollow two hens last fanta from 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.040
 Yves Saint Laurent 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 he has 18 spl and I wear the color b50 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.000
 you have the level here that allows you 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.680
 to actually see if the dyed background is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.649
 quickly made such a stage they lie 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.600
 and so for the application in fact you 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.649
 have a style of little feathers like that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.560
 which allows you to actually dose the bottom 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.750
 complexion that you want to ask is so I 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.840
 the apply of a brush but you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.569
 can also apply it to the finger there 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 is scalable so you can do 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.009
 several layers depending on the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.450
 result that you want covering him - 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.390
 super super pleasant to the touch 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.670
 pleasant on the skin a powdery finish 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.520
 it really slips on the skin we have 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.660
 the impression of having two of the pigment 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.880
 idea of asu finally it's really great 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.830
 super nice like a cast 1 I you 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.050
 really recommend going to the store on 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.420
 test you have a whole panoply of 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.810
 colors and b 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.959
 roses and walleyes here is the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.569
 touch that's so a great product of 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.459
 the well-known brand you have six 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.739
 different colors me I wear to 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.020
 color 3 and so he before intense 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.360
 product it's still pretty amazing 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.890
 and so it's really a product in 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.890
 do I will not call a corrector 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.480
 I'll call it the illuminator 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.790
 really illuminates the shaded areas 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.790
 fades dark circles gives radiance 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.569
 and so for the application I advise 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.569
 to really use your finger so 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.569
 to have a very natural result 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.560
 where are we going 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.560
 1 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.060
 1 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.470
 e 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.510
 and 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.190
 Oh 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.610
 1 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.120
 here I present you the voluptuous blush 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.650
 of which you have several colors of 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.069
 unfortunately available the brush 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.440
 I do not like it too much but a very 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.670
 good for that romantic look not too much 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.580
 too pigmented and that's just what he 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.040
 have to give a little life to my 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.319
 very dull complexion that you may have the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.440
 see that I had before applying the 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:59.799
 foundation for my headlights 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.129
 hold a maximum I apply a base 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.859
 thanks and so that's it to ensure 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.700
 holding and ogs also have some 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.640
 intense colors 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.060
 so here I'm going to use the breakdown 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.760
 is pure chromatic number 6 so she 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.320
 can be used dry or water for a 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.630
 effect plus a time if I'm going to use 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.240
 these two colors so so for starters 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.330
 in mobile eyelid I'm going to apply the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.000
 pink color is a palette that you 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.120
 offers a little color and reese and 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.930
 you do not have maths and so voila 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.450
 me like that indeed a romantic look 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.710
 and not too intense except for just 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:44.050
 does it have them I will use them dry 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:49.060
 but you can force if you 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:52.419
 want using a mist a fixed + 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.880
 or a fixing spray or just 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.220
 water so here I use the second 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.280
 color 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.860
 a plum to rape a very very beautiful 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.290
 color and so shame gesture really 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.720
 for not having a great brand 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.060
 defined you can also if you 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.830
 do not have this palette if you said a 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:17.190
 pink and then use a pencil 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:22.730
 plums is blurred like that in clade cl I 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:27.680
 internally put the pink color and 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:31.470
 in outer corner the color plum 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.270
 then I will use the drawing here 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.070
 waterproof eye so it's 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.310
 number one black ink 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:41.670
 it's a super creamy col and very very 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.950
 very intense so here it was very 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.620
 easy to apply here this is the 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.390
 mascara volum false eyelash effect so the 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.720
 color is black high density 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.090
 so it is available in March 2015 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.300
 so it's exclusive on my channel 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.980
 it has been around since 2000 and so here 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.550
 a new new formula has been 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.400
 invented for the 15 years of the product is 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.380
 a mascara that gives you volume but 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.620
 at the same time it is a care in fact 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.220
 because I had tamini v5 products 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.390
 so that beautifies the eyelash and oils 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.860
 essential in fact that they 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.860
 soften which strengthens them 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.349
 to give more intensity to 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.940
 makeup and shattered at the level of 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:33.789
 look I will add the color in 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.550
 inner corner is used to complete 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:39.160
 the voluptuous red number 30 coral 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.470
 jealous a very moisturizing lipstick 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.919
 very pigmented so I'm going to apply myself 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.720
 just like that and unfortunately 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:47.680
 as there is a little correlation that it's not going 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.660
 not with the look 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:55.659
 I'm just a little removed the color 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:57.520
 to keep a little rosy effect and to 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:59.889
 a look a little more dramatic I you 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.699
 propose to put false eyelashes 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:07.240
 really depends on your desires but finally 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:09.130
 here I am here I am a little crazy 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.900
 right now this pair of false eyelashes 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.900
 so I'm going to apply it for this look 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.880
 or 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:30.110
 so here is the final result I hope 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.110
 that this tutorial will have pleased you 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.550
