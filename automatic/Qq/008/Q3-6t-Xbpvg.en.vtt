00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.580
 and 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.930
 very good to all guys welcome a 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.150
 day more to the channel I am good and 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.369
 welcome in this case to a new 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.170
 video today I bring you the prediction of the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.630
 scams of if they are consistent 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.430
 I direct what the fuck is this 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.590
 I will explain as soon as possible a 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.460
 tiny summary is worth the time 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.860
 decision on tops means team the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.170
 season each league has a team of 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.790
 the season and she makes the letters 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 specials in some way similar to 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.230
 the totti and the consistent ones are 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.000
 the players that have made a great 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.340
 season but that throughout the fifa 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.329
 he has not had any and for example jafar 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.770
 has made a great season with the 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.360
 chelsea has been taking advantage of 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.489
 party but I've never made a 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.829
 brutal appearance as to leave a 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.210
 team of the week then then 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.129
 directly puts it in this time 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.690
 consistent prison we give a letter 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.460
 special as it deserves after its good 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.680
 season I have to tell you that at 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.140
 rudder decision is usually taken in 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.970
 five points from its normal average except 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.160
 which has no and but that already goes 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 forward over those of each league is worth 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.060
 for these consistent you are usually 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.040
 raise five points to each half of your 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.290
 normal player for example 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.690
 hahaha if you have 88 will go up 5 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.310
 average points I have not inflated much 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.230
 the statues I have directly placed 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.480
 5 more points in each of the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.100
 staatsballet and I have not touched anything else 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.410
 I really did not do anything else because I think 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.210
 which is more important to explain why 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.220
 is that player at the helm of decision 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.479
 consistent in my opinion that the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.950
 are you going to have because then 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.120
 really she is going to do what she gives 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.979
 he wins it so I'm not going to expand 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.140
 much in is to be like this having said 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.360
 all this let's start with the bending 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.550
 I have divided this prediction to some 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 how many parts would we first have to the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.210
 two goalkeepers that I think will come out yes 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.400
 or yes then the box defense that 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.560
 would be my eleven holder and center of the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.880
 field of three and another attack of three 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.259
 variants are going to be three more players 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.330
 You will like the section of the others 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.880
 where there are going to be players that really 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.830
 I think that they are not going to come out 100% but that 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.869
 have an option or if they even leave 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.000
 substitute the two goalkeepers that I think that 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.619
 they will leave yes or yes is a bravo and buffoon 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.970
 the two goalkeepers very very good both 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.520
 they look at the same media because in the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.430
 game has 83 and we will raise it 5 points 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.470
 had 88 in the brave part a 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.970
 goalkeeper who is going to take the barça nobody 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.769
 gave a hard for him me neither and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.610
 really with his 31 years making a 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.490
 brutal season 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.610
 and jester that the same this man grows 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.500
 each year is older and every year the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 pulls out even more brutal buffon a goalkeeper 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.400
 very very good and that will go very well 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.200
 for the Italian league and we needed 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.910
 of great goalkeepers in defense in the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.440
 left side we would have marcelo 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.330
 known to all playing the real 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.260
 madrid and as you already know it is 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.610
 doing is doing a great 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.200
 season with madrid has not had 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.690
 no if and that's why I think it will be 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.090
 here easily a very good side to 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.370
 the league sees me as the first central 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.630
 we would have a marmoset a player that already 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.190
 you know that the olympique de lyon is 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.240
 making a great season next to 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.830
 marseille giving the surprise practically 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.350
 unseating the psg something very difficult 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.670
 unthinkable for many a central that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.110
 would go very well since you see that they gave you 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.120
 very very good statistics and that 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.830
 I really do not think it's very, very expensive to 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.350
 his side we would have a laurent koscienly 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.880
 a terrific central had an app and I think 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.440
 that will be here yes or yes since in the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.780
 arsenal has been playing very very well 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.420
 has been one of the pillars in the scheme 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.250
 from arséne wenger and I think I repeat it's going to 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.440
 be here and from the right side 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.840
 we had a clarion a side that also 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.640
 it had a silver step now 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.489
 and as you can see it would be a very very color 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.170
 fast with good defense and good physique 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.670
 We will see why it is walker but of course 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.319
 could unseat it even though 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.269
 I really believe that as a walker, 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.129
 never brannan to anyone because it is very very 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.530
 good walker but we will not see if bugle 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.390
 it's going to give us a team from the 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.890
 premier in the middle of the field one of 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.930
 the pieces fit we would 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.849
 Henderson one of the players that 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.610
 it seems that it is the group saws of the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.379
 liverpool almost almost closes is a very 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.849
 player not at the iron level never what 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.709
 will spend I think but it is a great 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.299
 season also had an app and 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.860
 I really think it's going to come out here as 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.319
 an offensive midfielder we would have to 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.299
 Roberto signed a player who is 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.250
 great tino in the bundesliga is the 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.920
 pulling out I was even summoned with brazil 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.049
 scoring a very important goal against 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.470
 France very good player I think that 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.359
 would give much play to the bundesliga a 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.639
 ferrous competitor of kevin de bruyne 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.799
 who would only have to see rat and a 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.440
 brutal midfielder and indispensable for 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.630
 loren blanc in the psg and I think he has 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.789
 some statistics but really not 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.039
 I think it never reaches the matrix level 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.780
 and everything and he's a very good player that I think 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.910
 that would not be very very 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.560
 very expensive in the attacking party the first 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.120
 that we would have that ben jafar I have already 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.650
 previously commented is being removed 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.050
 in chelsea I think it's one of the 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.610
 top players of the premier 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.990
 forward watching we would have ajax a 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.760
 martí media of a player that year 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.919
 past came out in the consistent tops 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.600
 also since I think this man is 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.430
 inflates goals but the same never 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.320
 he comes out on his team of the week I do not know why 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.210
 what but this is the typical way you 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.220
 gets one or two goals each game but 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.500
 then never leave team of the week a 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.330
 little weird and on the right we had to 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.350
 dancing there was one of the pillars of 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.720
 bayer leverkusen 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.430
 I want it to be here, it has not 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.020
 had no iffhs and he had a 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.700
 we could see him before the athletic one of madrid 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.919
 that at a very fast color very skillful 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.810
 and that really was very very good and 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.150
 We'll see if it comes out even though I trust that 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.700
 if we are going to move on to the other side 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.350
 I have to tell you and confess that no 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.330
 I had a lot of idea who to put here 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.950
 I had some idea or another but really 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.680
 I had to pull to see other 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.570
 predictions of throwing through web pages and 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.639
 such and I have really come to a small 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.320
 conclusion let's start with the part 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.180
 defensive the first of them is that there 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.430
 a central one that I think has very good 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.840
 he paints and I hope he comes out he should go 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.700
 this one I know he's doing very 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.620
 well on time 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.150
 lazio and especially with Holland we 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.400
 put a goal to Spain for example a very 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.450
 good central we did not have a horse 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.310
 total that I think is a bit 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.570
 wasted in the zenith hopefully that 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.910
 someday end up in the awards is 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.190
 rumored that he could sign for the united 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.200
 but seeing his age and little by little I think 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.270
 that this option is disappearing 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.920
 left lateral finally we had to 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.990
 Williams, a player that I hope will come out 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.480
 because it would really be a brutal patch 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.250
 and would make very good company I feel 'of 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.600
 country on the part of midfielders 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.250
 we would have very very players 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.840
 interesting but I did not want to put in 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.060
 my titular team because everything and that 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.530
 they had better stockings I do not think they have 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.850
 made the best season the first of 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.470
 them nemanja matic is one of the 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.660
 pillars also the chelsea the chelsea is 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.000
 a great season and has not had 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.080
 no son so I think it's going to be 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.150
 cissokho midfielder offensive 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.820
 newcastle you can see its stats it would seem 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.890
 one day I toured but really hopefully 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.530
 for but brutal what it would look like 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.230
 new marchisio a brutal player but 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.210
 let's go the ideas would be a luxury to have a 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.490
 midfield with pop by arturo 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.980
 vidal and then we had in ball one of 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.330
 the top players of the marseille that all 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.890
 and he wants to make a very high letter like that 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.390
 that will be very important in the scheme 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.980
 marcelo bielsa 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.510
 which comes out because there was a very 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.160
 good couple to fight and if you want 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.870
 really defend in a center the 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.490
 field let's go with the last four 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.840
 players the first of them is felipe 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.850
 Anderson this left end 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.980
 Brazilian who played in the Italian league 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.660
 if I'm not wrong in lazio and one like 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.250
 you see very fast good dribble but a 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.260
 shot a little loose and physically good 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.910
 it is not anything otherworldly 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.290
 at his side Jonathan Soriano a player 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.610
 that every year in the Austrian league is the 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.980
 he pulls I do not understand why he is not going to go 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.360
 because it will pay you very well or you should 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.340
 feel very loved but I do not know I do not think 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.590
 that does not have the level to be 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.120
 there I think it's a team a very 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.220
 weak for the level I can in this 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.930
 man in any league we did not have to 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.670
 I was one of the top scorers in 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.200
 the bundesliga and that surely yes that 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.750
 be in the consistent even if 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.910
 substitute and then we had him was a 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.800
 player who is Brazilian but is 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.660
 Italian nationalized are playing with 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.790
 the Italian national team and I think it could 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.320
 even get to go out with the tasting of 

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.670
 Italian everything and that seems to me a good 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.040
 Brazilian center forward so 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.850
 I hope they do not change it because 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.800
 refuse life a little power 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.200
 try even this player and nothing else 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.970
 guys these are my consistent tots 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.680
 say less dead in the comments 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.460
 it's worth the ones that you want that are going to 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.229
 leave those that do not 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.060
 nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:57.410
