so<00:00:28.260> once<00:00:28.710> you've<00:00:28.830> downloaded<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.609> installed

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
so once you've downloaded and installed

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.310 
so once you've downloaded and installed
a<00:00:30.150> software<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.750> go<00:00:30.869> ahead<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.170> minimize

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
a software you can go ahead and minimize

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.660 
a software you can go ahead and minimize
this<00:00:31.740> window<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:34.010> open<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.040> software<00:00:35.250> there

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
this window and open the software there

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.100 
this window and open the software there
and<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.270> looks<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.570> something<00:00:36.899> like

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and it looks a little something like

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.160 
and it looks a little something like
this

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
this

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.450 
this
now<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> reason<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.680> recommend<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.100> software

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
now the reason I recommend this software

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.180 
now the reason I recommend this software
is<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.690> any<00:00:43.110> set<00:00:43.590> now<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
is because with any set now and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.540 
is because with any set now and
especially<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:45.239> TomTom<00:00:46.039> when<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.190> plan

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
especially with my TomTom when you plan

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
especially with my TomTom when you plan
a<00:00:47.579> route<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> takes<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> way<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.050> thinks

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
a route to takes you the way it thinks

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.549 
a route to takes you the way it thinks
is<00:00:49.530> best<00:00:49.969> fit<00:00:50.969> by<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> shortest<00:00:52.110> route<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
is best fit by the shortest route or the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.130 
is best fit by the shortest route or the
quickest<00:00:53.010> route<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.809> its<00:00:54.930> own<00:00:54.989> way

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
quickest route and it's got its own way

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
quickest route and it's got its own way
of<00:00:55.230> calculating<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> same<00:00:56.340> with

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
of calculating that it's the same with

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.639 
of calculating that it's the same with
Google<00:00:57.300> now<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.809> differ<00:00:58.050> they've<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.500> their

Google now they differ they've got their
own<00:00:58.850> ideas<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> what's<00:01:00.270> quicker<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:01.530> what

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.770 

now<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.700> beauty<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.210> is<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.420> can<00:01:14.510> use

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
now the beauty of this is you can use

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.320 
now the beauty of this is you can use
Google<00:01:15.560> Maps<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.280> plan<00:01:16.700> your<00:01:16.850> journey<00:01:16.880> and

Google Maps to plan your journey and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.690 
Google Maps to plan your journey and

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
then add waypoints along the way the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.410 
then add waypoints along the way the
forces<00:01:20.180> on<00:01:20.390> certain<00:01:20.900> route<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.820> rather<00:01:23.330> than

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
forces on certain route so rather than

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.970 
forces on certain route so rather than
it<00:01:23.510> taking<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:23.870> by<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.050> motorway<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.650> can<00:01:24.860> go

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
it taking you by the motorway you can go

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.820 
it taking you by the motorway you can go
more<00:01:25.280> scenic<00:01:25.670> route<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.360> you<00:01:27.260> can<00:01:27.410> force<00:01:27.680> it

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
more scenic route and you can force it

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.630 
more scenic route and you can force it
to<00:01:27.890> go<00:01:28.130> by<00:01:28.480> point<00:01:29.480> of<00:01:29.630> interest

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
to go by point of interest

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:42.870

particular way so I'm going to come

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.600 
particular way so I'm going to come
straight<00:02:50.300> down<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.750> Augean<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:55.400> don't

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
straight down and Augean and you don't

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.920 
straight down and Augean and you don't
have<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.820> rename<00:02:56.090> each<00:02:56.150> point<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.630> can<00:02:56.780> just

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
have to rename each point you can just

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.740 
have to rename each point you can just
accept<00:02:57.260> it

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
accept it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:07.450 
accept it
I'm<00:02:59.750> gonna<00:02:59.990> cut<00:03:00.350> across<00:03:05.680> etc<00:03:06.680> etc<00:03:06.800> so<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.340> just

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
I'm gonna cut across etc etc so you just

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.320 
I'm gonna cut across etc etc so you just
force<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.940> where<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.750> want

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
force it where you want

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.480 
force it where you want
basically<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.480> more<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.750> these<00:03:12.490> waypoints

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
basically the more of these waypoints

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.480 
basically the more of these waypoints
you<00:03:13.970> choose<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:15.350> more<00:03:15.530> likely<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:15.980> are<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.340> go

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.620 
you choose the more likely you are to go
on<00:03:16.520> that<00:03:16.730> journey<00:03:16.790> because<00:03:17.240> it's<00:03:17.390> basically

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
on that journey because it's basically

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.690 
on that journey because it's basically
what<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.010> TomTom<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.040> doing<00:03:19.370> is<00:03:19.520> calculating

what the TomTom is doing is calculating

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.990 
what the TomTom is doing is calculating
each<00:03:20.540> segment<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.290> by<00:03:21.440> one<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:24.820> once<00:03:25.820> you're

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
this one here is a copy to TomTom so

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.490 
this one here is a copy to TomTom so
files<00:04:02.210> we<00:04:02.360> copy<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.690> my<00:04:02.780> TomTom<00:04:03.140> you<00:04:03.260> can

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
files we copy to my TomTom you can

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.720 
files we copy to my TomTom you can
double<00:04:03.740> check<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:03.950> by<00:04:04.280> clicking<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.700> again

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.570 
double check that by clicking it again
all<00:04:05.600> really<00:04:05.900> exists<00:04:06.290> on<00:04:06.410> there<00:04:06.880> no<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:10.430> then

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
all really exists on there no and then

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.640 
all really exists on there no and then

then get through to find the one you
want<00:05:56.420> so<00:05:56.600> I'm<00:05:57.140> going<00:05:57.290> to<00:05:57.350> try<00:05:57.440> and<00:05:57.620> make<00:05:57.710> one

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
want so I'm going to try and make one

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.960 
want so I'm going to try and make one
which<00:05:58.040> is<00:05:58.190> right<00:05:58.400> three<00:06:03.490> I'll<00:06:04.490> come<00:06:04.730> over<00:06:04.760> the

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
which is right three I'll come over the

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.580 
which is right three I'll come over the
first<00:06:05.150> destination<00:06:05.390> and<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.080> is<00:06:06.320> basically

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
first destination and that is basically

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.220 
first destination and that is basically
your<00:06:06.800> end<00:06:06.950> point<00:06:07.280> that<00:06:07.610> is<00:06:07.730> right<00:06:08.030> so<00:06:08.480> I<00:06:08.780> think

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
your end point that is right so I think

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.420 
your end point that is right so I think
it's<00:06:09.470> just<00:06:09.590> going<00:06:09.680> to<00:06:09.770> take<00:06:09.890> this<00:06:10.070> straight
