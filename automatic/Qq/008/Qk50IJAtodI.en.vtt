and<00:00:22.050> people<00:00:22.500> are<00:00:22.619> saying<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.369> know<00:00:23.460> what

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
and people are saying that you know what

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.279 
and people are saying that you know what
actually<00:00:23.910> thinking<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:24.539> him<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.779> Marvel<00:00:25.140> is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
actually thinking for him that Marvel is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.160 
actually thinking for him that Marvel is
not<00:00:25.529> moving<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.420> believe<00:00:27.660> DC<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.140> not

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.620 
not moving and I believe DC is not
moving<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.820> means<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.300> we're

moving so what this means is that we're

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
moving so what this means is that we're
gonna<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.869> both<00:00:31.109> movies<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> same<00:00:31.949> date
