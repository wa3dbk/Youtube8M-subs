for now a white background now the only

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.279 
for now a white background now the only

time that this width really becomes
important<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.700> will<00:00:50.879> be

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
important is because we will be

can always change it down here and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.920 
can always change it down here and
canvas<00:00:58.890> size<00:00:59.329> now<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> first<00:01:00.600> thing<00:01:00.719> we're

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
canvas size now the first thing we're

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.740 
canvas size now the first thing we're
going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.739> build<00:01:02.129> our

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
background this is going to be the kind

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.710 
background this is going to be the kind
of<00:01:05.129> rounded<00:01:05.489> thing<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.939> around<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.299> and

popping up off the page so to do that
we're<00:01:11.610> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.820> start<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.299> our<00:01:12.360> layer<00:01:12.630> 1

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
we're going to start with our layer 1

and i'm just going to rename layer 1
rectangles<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:18.619> then<00:01:19.619> i'm<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.950> come

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
rectangles and then i'm going to come

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.800 
rectangles and then i'm going to come
over<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.580> i'm<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> click<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.479> and

over here i'm going to click this and
make<00:01:22.140> sure<00:01:22.170> I've<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.680> rectangle<00:01:23.189> tool<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
make sure I've got my rectangle tool and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.649 
make sure I've got my rectangle tool and
I'm<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> white<00:01:26.009> fill<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:27.299> a

I'm going to have a white fill with a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.679 
I'm going to have a white fill with a
black<00:01:28.439> outline<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.509> draw

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
black outline and I'm just going to draw

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.929 
black outline and I'm just going to draw
a<00:01:30.720> rectangle<00:01:31.290> now<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.159> reason<00:01:32.369> i<00:01:32.549> drew<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
a rectangle now the reason i drew this

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.640 
a rectangle now the reason i drew this
tiny<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.720> rectangle<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.500> want

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
tiny little rectangle when we want

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
tiny little rectangle when we want
something<00:01:34.860> actually<00:01:35.159> significantly<00:01:35.490> larger

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
something actually significantly larger

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.640 
something actually significantly larger
is<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.720> down<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> properties

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
is because down here in the properties

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
is because down here in the properties
inspector<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:38.850> easier<00:01:38.880> than<00:01:39.240> trying

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
inspector it's a lot easier than trying

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.160 
inspector it's a lot easier than trying
to<00:01:39.600> manually<00:01:40.140> drag<00:01:40.439> out<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.490> width<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.729> want

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
to manually drag out the width you want

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.810 
to manually drag out the width you want
so<00:01:43.170> i'm<00:01:43.259> going<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> come<00:01:43.619> down<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.220> for

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so i'm going to come down here and for

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940 
so i'm going to come down here and for
this<00:01:44.939> sample<00:01:45.320> we're<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> make<00:01:46.649> our

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
this sample we're going to make our

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.310 
this sample we're going to make our
rectangle<00:01:47.820> 800<00:01:48.360> x<00:01:49.189> 500<00:01:50.390> now<00:01:51.390> when<00:01:52.200> you're

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
rectangle 800 x 500 now when you're

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.630 
rectangle 800 x 500 now when you're
designing<00:01:52.470> your<00:01:52.770> website<00:01:53.250> you'll<00:01:53.430> want<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
designing your website you'll want to

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.569 
designing your website you'll want to
make<00:01:53.700> sure<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.180> design<00:01:54.600> your<00:01:54.930> width<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
make sure that you design your width to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.219 
make sure that you design your width to
be<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> width<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.299> want<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:58.049> your

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
be the width that you want for your

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.560 
be the width that you want for your
viewers<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.880> viewing<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
viewers if they are viewing this and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.120 
viewers if they are viewing this and
they<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:01.020> large<00:02:01.350> resolution

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
they have a very large resolution

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.709 
they have a very large resolution
they're<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> see<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.329> pretty

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
they're going to see this as pretty

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.240 
they're going to see this as pretty
small<00:02:04.049> kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> thin<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:04.860> column

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
small kind of a thin little column

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.120 
small kind of a thin little column
website

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
website

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.490 
website
if<00:02:06.219> they<00:02:06.399> have<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.549> lower<00:02:06.790> resolution<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.990> will

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
if they have a lower resolution it will

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.960 
if they have a lower resolution it will
appear<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.890> make<00:02:09.069> take<00:02:09.550> up<00:02:09.670> more<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:09.880> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
appear to make take up more of the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.520 
appear to make take up more of the
screen<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:10.869> you're<00:02:10.989> really<00:02:11.080> going<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.319> want<00:02:11.380> to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
screen so you're really going to want to

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.780 
screen so you're really going to want to
think<00:02:11.739> about<00:02:11.830> your<00:02:12.040> audience<00:02:12.190> when<00:02:12.670> you're

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
think about your audience when you're

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.449 
think about your audience when you're
making<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.530> for<00:02:14.530> us<00:02:14.650> this<00:02:15.160> will<00:02:15.310> do<00:02:15.430> just

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
making this for us this will do just

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.940 
making this for us this will do just
fine<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:16.989> I'm<00:02:17.290> going<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.620> round<00:02:17.769> these

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
fine and now I'm going to round these

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.309 
fine and now I'm going to round these
corners<00:02:18.459> I'm<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:19.810> going<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.959> come<00:02:20.080> down<00:02:20.170> here

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
corners I'm just going to come down here

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.630 
corners I'm just going to come down here
to<00:02:20.380> roundness<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:20.860> I'm<00:02:21.160> going<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.340> change

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
to roundness and I'm going to change

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.140 
to roundness and I'm going to change
that<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:22.319> 20<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:24.099> makes<00:02:24.310> these<00:02:24.430> pretty<00:02:24.849> round

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
that to 20 that makes these pretty round

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.000 
that to 20 that makes these pretty round
now<00:02:25.720> obviously<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.410> want<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.620> website<00:02:26.980> that's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
now obviously we want a website that's

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.890 
now obviously we want a website that's
going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.489> longer<00:02:28.090> than<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.480> we<00:02:28.720> want

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
going to be longer than this we want

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.410 
going to be longer than this we want
something<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.260> will<00:02:29.349> grow<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:30.269> we<00:02:31.269> add<00:02:31.390> more

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
something that will grow as we add more

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.350 
something that will grow as we add more
text<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:33.459> will<00:02:33.580> happen<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:34.180> by

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
text to it and that will happen just by

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.610 
text to it and that will happen just by
the<00:02:34.420> way<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.810> we<00:02:34.930> build<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.590> don't

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
the way that we build it so we don't

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.860 
the way that we build it so we don't
really<00:02:35.860> need<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.160> worry<00:02:36.190> right<00:02:36.550> now<00:02:36.610> about<00:02:37.269> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
really need to worry right now about the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.970 
really need to worry right now about the
width<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:38.680> want<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.860> make<00:02:38.920> sure

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
width of this we just want to make sure

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.530 
width of this we just want to make sure
we've<00:02:39.190> got<00:02:39.220> enough<00:02:39.400> room<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:40.030> cut<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.360> into

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
we've got enough room to cut this into

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.289 
we've got enough room to cut this into
pieces<00:02:40.810> later<00:02:41.940> once<00:02:42.940> you've<00:02:43.120> got<00:02:43.269> your

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
pieces later once you've got your

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.539 
pieces later once you've got your
rectangle<00:02:43.900> done<00:02:44.099> make<00:02:45.099> sure<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.400> selected

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
rectangle done make sure it's selected

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.900 
rectangle done make sure it's selected
and<00:02:46.000> I'm<00:02:46.690> just<00:02:46.900> going<00:02:47.049> to<00:02:47.110> copy<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:48.790> can

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
and I'm just going to copy it you can

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.309 
and I'm just going to copy it you can
also<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:49.330> this<00:02:49.480> by<00:02:49.540> using<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.170> little

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
also do this by using the little

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.050 
also do this by using the little
shortcut<00:02:50.650> ctrl<00:02:51.040> C<00:02:51.280> which<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.549> what<00:02:51.790> we'll<00:02:51.910> do

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
shortcut ctrl C which is what we'll do

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.360 
shortcut ctrl C which is what we'll do
for<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.480> others<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:54.040> I'm<00:02:54.160> going<00:02:54.310> to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
for the others and then I'm going to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.670 
for the others and then I'm going to
paste<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.880> which<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.750> ctrl<00:02:56.110> V<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:59.290> you'll<00:02:59.560> see

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
paste it which is ctrl V and you'll see

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.410 
paste it which is ctrl V and you'll see
here<00:02:59.860> we<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.010> two<00:03:00.250> rectangles<00:03:00.790> I'm<00:03:01.030> going<00:03:01.360> to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
here we have two rectangles I'm going to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.410 
here we have two rectangles I'm going to
keep<00:03:01.569> doing<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:03.120> I'm<00:03:04.120> just<00:03:04.239> going<00:03:04.329> to

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
keep doing that and I'm just going to

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.660 
keep doing that and I'm just going to
have<00:03:04.540> five<00:03:04.690> rectangles<00:03:04.930> for<00:03:05.319> now<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:06.519> reason

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
have five rectangles for now the reason

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.160 
have five rectangles for now the reason
we're<00:03:06.910> building<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:07.299> is<00:03:07.480> because<00:03:07.750> we<00:03:08.079> are

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
we're building this is because we are

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.590 
we're building this is because we are
going<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.620> cut<00:03:09.489> some<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.819> these<00:03:09.910> up<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.420> we

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
going to cut some of these up and we

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.880 
going to cut some of these up and we
want<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.870> make<00:03:10.900> sure<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.380> have<00:03:11.470> others<00:03:11.769> to

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
want to make sure that we have others to

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.030 
want to make sure that we have others to
work<00:03:12.040> with<00:03:12.220> four<00:03:12.430> other<00:03:12.579> parts<00:03:13.470> now<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.890> looks

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
work with four other parts now it looks

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.710 
work with four other parts now it looks
like<00:03:15.220> we<00:03:15.459> still<00:03:15.519> have<00:03:15.760> only<00:03:15.940> one<00:03:16.180> rectangle

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
like we still have only one rectangle

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.870 
like we still have only one rectangle
and<00:03:16.840> that's<00:03:17.170> because<00:03:17.500> as<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.829> can<00:03:17.859> see<00:03:17.980> they

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
and that's because as you can see they

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.280 
and that's because as you can see they
are<00:03:18.910> all<00:03:19.180> stacked<00:03:19.600> on<00:03:19.810> top<00:03:19.840> of<00:03:20.049> each<00:03:20.170> other

are all stacked on top of each other
next<00:03:23.290> I'm<00:03:23.470> going<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.950> make<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.340> new<00:03:24.549> layer<00:03:24.760> over

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
next I'm going to make a new layer over

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.870 
next I'm going to make a new layer over

check the eyes off of all of these

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.780 
check the eyes off of all of these
layers<00:04:40.500> get<00:04:41.500> rid<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.650> footer<00:04:42.010> get<00:04:42.640> rid<00:04:42.760> of

layers get rid of footer get rid of

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.880 
layers get rid of footer get rid of
header<00:04:43.030> make<00:04:43.660> sure<00:04:43.690> outlines<00:04:44.170> still<00:04:44.470> gone<00:04:44.650> and

header make sure outlines still gone and
we're<00:04:45.580> going<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.760> keep<00:04:45.940> background<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.140> I'm

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
we're going to keep background and I'm

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.410 
we're going to keep background and I'm
going<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.250> get<00:04:48.370> rid<00:04:48.460> of<00:04:48.490> our<00:04:48.640> other<00:04:48.790> rectangles

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
going to get rid of our other rectangles

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.240 
going to get rid of our other rectangles
later<00:04:49.900> for<00:04:50.170> now<00:04:50.290> we<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.710> always<00:04:50.830> put<00:04:51.100> that

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
later for now we can always put that

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.070 
later for now we can always put that
back<00:04:51.400> on<00:04:51.550> later<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:52.570> now<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:52.750> should<00:04:53.050> have

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
back on later so now you should have

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.750 
back on later so now you should have
only<00:04:53.410> one<00:04:53.710> rectangle<00:04:54.250> and<00:04:54.310> you<00:04:54.400> can<00:04:54.520> see<00:04:54.670> if

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
only one rectangle and you can see if

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.950 
only one rectangle and you can see if
you<00:04:54.880> move<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.150> around<00:04:55.210> there<00:04:55.600> are<00:04:55.630> no<00:04:55.810> other

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
you move it around there are no other

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.090 
you move it around there are no other
rectangles<00:04:56.620> to<00:04:57.310> take<00:04:57.490> its<00:04:57.670> place<00:04:59.010> so<00:05:00.010> we're

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
rectangles to take its place so we're

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.380 
rectangles to take its place so we're
going<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.280> keep<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.610> in<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.880> position<00:05:01.240> it's

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
going to keep that in the position it's

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.640 
going to keep that in the position it's
very<00:05:01.570> important<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:01.900> not<00:05:02.110> start<00:05:02.380> fiddling

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
very important you not start fiddling

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.930 
very important you not start fiddling
around<00:05:02.890> with<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.370> positions<00:05:03.790> of<00:05:03.880> the

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
around with the positions of the

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.430 
around with the positions of the
rectangles<00:05:04.450> make<00:05:04.660> sure<00:05:04.840> if<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.050> accidentally

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
rectangles make sure if you accidentally

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.280 
rectangles make sure if you accidentally
move<00:05:05.620> them<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:06.460> control<00:05:07.120> Z<00:05:07.390> back<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:08.020> undo

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
move them you control Z back to undo

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.260 
move them you control Z back to undo
that<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.700> what<00:05:09.700> we're<00:05:09.820> going<00:05:09.850> to<00:05:10.060> do<00:05:10.150> with

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
that and what we're going to do with

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.050 
that and what we're going to do with
this<00:05:10.420> is<00:05:10.660> just<00:05:11.350> give<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.770> glow<00:05:12.400> now<00:05:12.700> you<00:05:12.760> can

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
this is just give it a glow now you can

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.930 
this is just give it a glow now you can
see<00:05:13.300> if<00:05:13.510> we<00:05:13.660> drop<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.870> shadow<00:05:14.200> that<00:05:14.730> gives<00:05:15.730> us<00:05:15.850> a

looking<00:05:25.450> over<00:05:25.810> here<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.710> wouldn't<00:05:26.950> notice<00:05:27.160> so

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
looking over here you wouldn't notice so

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
if you look at this and it's not got a

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.830 
if you look at this and it's not got a

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
full glow around it this is going to

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.720 
full glow around it this is going to
look<00:05:31.960> flat<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.320> then<00:05:32.740> only<00:05:32.919> this<00:05:33.250> side<00:05:33.490> will

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
look flat and then only this side will

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.150 
look flat and then only this side will
look<00:05:33.910> like<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:34.360> raised<00:05:34.570> off<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:34.780> page<00:05:35.160> to

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
look like it's raised off the page to

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.860 
look like it's raised off the page to
prevent<00:05:36.460> that<00:05:36.580> we're<00:05:37.419> going<00:05:37.510> to<00:05:37.570> get<00:05:37.690> rid<00:05:37.840> of

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
prevent that we're going to get rid of

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.140 
prevent that we're going to get rid of
this<00:05:38.050> drop<00:05:38.320> shadow<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.790> we're<00:05:40.000> going<00:05:40.120> to

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
this drop shadow and we're going to

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.880 
this drop shadow and we're going to
replace<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.570> with<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:43.060> glow<00:05:43.330> and<00:05:43.540> we<00:05:44.380> probably

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
replace it with a glow and we probably

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.920 
replace it with a glow and we probably
don't<00:05:45.340> want<00:05:45.580> red<00:05:45.790> but<00:05:46.090> if<00:05:46.330> that's<00:05:46.630> what<00:05:46.720> does

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
don't want red but if that's what does

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.380 
don't want red but if that's what does
it<00:05:47.080> for<00:05:47.230> you<00:05:47.320> then<00:05:47.350> go<00:05:47.740> for<00:05:47.980> it<00:05:48.240> instead<00:05:49.240> I'm

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
it for you then go for it instead I'm

work<00:05:55.570> how<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:55.900> want<00:05:56.260> it<00:05:57.210> once<00:05:58.210> you've<00:05:58.330> got

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
work how you want it once you've got

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.270 
work how you want it once you've got
that<00:05:58.510> you<00:05:58.930> should<00:05:59.169> have<00:05:59.350> something<00:06:00.160> that

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
that you should have something that

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.740 
that you should have something that
looks<00:06:00.370> like<00:06:00.580> it's<00:06:01.030> popping<00:06:01.210> off<00:06:01.450> the<00:06:01.480> page<00:06:01.720> a

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
looks like it's popping off the page a

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.840 
looks like it's popping off the page a
little<00:06:01.990> bit<00:06:02.169> and<00:06:02.350> this<00:06:02.950> is<00:06:03.070> going<00:06:03.190> to<00:06:03.280> be<00:06:03.400> the

little bit and this is going to be the
