00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
and this is just going to create a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.480 
and this is just going to create a
little<00:02:17.660> more<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.990> natural<00:02:18.170> beachy<00:02:19.070> wavy

kind of feel to the curls and this just

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.820 
kind of feel to the curls and this just
works<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.610> lot<00:02:22.790> better<00:02:22.850> on<00:02:23.150> my<00:02:23.630> shorter<00:02:24.050> hair<00:02:24.290> so
