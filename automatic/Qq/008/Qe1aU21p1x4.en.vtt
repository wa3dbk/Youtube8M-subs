00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
long time just like me trying to find

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.009 
long time just like me trying to find
them<00:00:55.229> so<00:00:56.229> I'm<00:00:56.800> gonna<00:00:56.949> show<00:00:57.220> you<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:58.390> think

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
them so I'm gonna show you and I think

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.439 
them so I'm gonna show you and I think
it's<00:00:59.140> relatively<00:00:59.680> new<00:01:00.089> we<00:01:01.089> haven't<00:01:01.330> really

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
it's relatively new we haven't really

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.730 
it's relatively new we haven't really
noticed<00:01:01.720> it<00:01:02.080> until<00:01:02.199> after<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:03.489> beta<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.650> you

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
noticed it until after the beta that you

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.460 
noticed it until after the beta that you
can<00:01:05.860> do<00:01:06.010> this<00:01:06.250> but<00:01:06.549> ok<00:01:07.240> we'll<00:01:07.540> just<00:01:07.780> pretend<00:01:07.990> I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
can do this but ok we'll just pretend I

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.160 
can do this but ok we'll just pretend I
did<00:01:08.740> not<00:01:08.950> do<00:01:09.159> that<00:01:09.340> ok

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
did not do that ok

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.580 
did not do that ok
so<00:01:12.040> basically<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.729> hear<00:01:12.909> these<00:01:13.060> noises<00:01:13.590> or

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
so basically you hear these noises or

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.880 
so basically you hear these noises or
die<00:01:15.159> or<00:01:15.189> geek<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.140> can<00:01:17.290> either<00:01:17.439> go<00:01:17.650> that

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
die or geek and you can either go that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.130 
die or geek and you can either go that
way<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:20.380> way

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.320 

that<00:01:24.140> way<00:01:25.690> this<00:01:26.690> way<00:01:26.870> but<00:01:27.940> you<00:01:28.940> know<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.180> f

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
that way this way but you know the f
