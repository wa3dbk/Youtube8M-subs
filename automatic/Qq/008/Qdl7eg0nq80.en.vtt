not that the ship is going to be
finished<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.470> were<00:01:31.560> confident<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
finished we were confident that it that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
finished we were confident that it that
it<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> weather

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it would be but it was the weather

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.499 
it would be but it was the weather
window<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.430> first<00:01:35.790> nautical<00:01:36.299> mile

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
window because the first nautical mile

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.120 
window because the first nautical mile
from<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> yard<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> most

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
from the yard is one of the most

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.410 
from the yard is one of the most
challenging<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.759> ship<00:01:38.909> was<00:01:39.030> ever<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.329> to

challenging the ship was ever going to
face<00:01:39.600> first<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:40.829> there's<00:01:41.009> only<00:01:41.220> about

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
face first of all there's only about

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
face first of all there's only about
three<00:01:41.909> feet<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.240> water<00:01:42.270> under<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> keel<00:01:42.960> which

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
three feet of water under the keel which

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
three feet of water under the keel which
means<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.979> very<00:01:44.430> very<00:01:44.700> very

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
means we have to be very very very

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.340 
means we have to be very very very

actually we can't even use the ship's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.450 
actually we can't even use the ship's
propellers<00:01:48.720> or<00:01:48.750> azipods<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:50.280> would
