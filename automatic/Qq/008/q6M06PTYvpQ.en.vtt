00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.599
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.699
 video more of grand theft auto 5 a 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.160
 concrete analysis of deformation 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.689
 of the deformation physics that happens 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.849
 when several vehicles collide 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.859
 among themselves or vehicles against 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.899
 other objects and so on that's what 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.269
 let's analyze in this in this video 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.430
 although we do not have much information for 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.050
 deal with this topic so let's use 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.000
 the few images in which we have 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.769
 seen this kind of collisions 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.780
 for this good we can see for example 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.839
 in the trailer of trevor in the trailer 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.460
 of the second trailer that also came out 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.549
 even in the gameplays it has also been 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.379
 seen the slight light touches of 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.330
 deformation in cars to start 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.689
 which is what we see that is very 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.909
 improved deformation is much better 

00:00:59.689 --> 00:01:04.460
 in comparison to what we had seen 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.290
 in grand theft auto 4 why do I say this 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.689
 well basically because in grand theft 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.720
 car 4 so that a car will be shattered 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.740
 in a fairly real way 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.540
 we had to launch it practically 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.579
 from the empire state because we had to 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.890
 good from the empire state not because no 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.270
 I had to upload a car but to 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.060
 any other tall building you had 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.060
 to take the car to know how with 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.360
 sometimes because of course you can not 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.610
 take a car in another way and then 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.920
 throw it down and clear imagine 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.190
 a free fall that fell face down and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.710
 so good then so it was shattered 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.950
 but other than that, what can you 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.990
 give a huge blow against a wall that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.390
 I do not mean that the car did not break 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.160
 and the only thing that happened was that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.380
 you went flying forward 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.090
 a nice detail curious but what was 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.240
 the car itself the realism of that 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.670
 collision was good because it left a lot that 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.340
 really wish we see here in this 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.950
 new in this new game because it's 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.010
 greatly improved the deformation is much more 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.520
 pronounced much bigger and in addition 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.250
 we can see many many other types of 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.720
 formations that we did not see in the game 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.730
 previous in the previous game 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.160
 it was all exhausting here yes that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.850
 lift the capo to a more realistic style 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.520
 for this we have a simulator 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.530
 good that I got to show 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.620
 How are the realistic conditions 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.950
 This simulator is based practically on 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.760
 Real collisions in good simulate 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.040
 physical 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.400
 all I could say would be technical 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.710
 it was simulated somebody physics is called 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.930
 they are good so what is used to 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.150
 simulate traffic accidents and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.860
 others to rebuild it yes and for 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.960
 study how a car behaves 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.210
 when to study the safety of a 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.160
 car and all this good is not usually 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.110
 use this simulator obviously that is 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.050
 more throwing a game but yes that is used 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.970
 is this technique well in this 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.520
 simulator we can see how it would form 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.650
 a car realistically when hitting 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.330
 with different objects in this case then 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.990
 we have tested cubes and we have tested 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.680
 trees and falls and the odd type 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.030
 of how to jump and other types 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.260
 of accidents so to speak and thank you 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.540
 to them then we can make an idea 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.650
 what it would be like is how it will be in grand 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.360
 theft auto 'well I think that pretty 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.100
 similar if it's true that in the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.210
 simulator as soon as you give yourself a little 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.010
 hit on the engine then 3 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.690
 the car works as it would in the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.640
 real life obviously but it 's grand theft 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.530
 auto, they will not put it on you like that, not if you 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.000
 you hit a chase in a chase what 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.400
 they're going to make the minimum hit against 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.200
 a streetlight you run out of persecution and 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.530
 makes you follow by legs obviously 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.850
 that's not going to happen so that's what 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.890
 I think they're going to do with that theme 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.560
 you will see the car that we 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.840
 we manage is going to break little is going to have 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.030
 a harder physics is going to cost more 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.850
 lean because because of what I say 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.350
 so that it lasts longer and is not so 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.990
 realistic that is more arcade than it is 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.300
 funny 7 you have to go down and how much 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.010
 it makes you a little bit that it's going to happen that the 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.050
 rest of cars and hit other cars 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.450
 on the road or if the cars are given without 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.940
 want those that yes they are going to support 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.460
 we can see right in pictures of 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.630
 our car does not taste de facto in one 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.040
 of the trains that our car 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.040
 supports but we see him 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.610
 so much surprised us 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.979
 quite when we saw those images 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.080
 that is, this brings us to the conclusion of 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.560
 that the physicists are much better 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.449
 achieved that in the previous game are 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.479
 enough evidence to get to 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.639
 determine that they are going to be so good 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.349
 I think we do not have just images of 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.270
 see the scenes of the trains but that 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.669
 it's more a script like for example when 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.930
 the truck that they are going to steal in the 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.939
 gameplay in the first one that involves 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.879
 they removed when a wall is loaded 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.770
 truck is to Group 6 Well I 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.279
 I think they are more than script scenes and 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.960
 fairies that remain real formations but 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.879
 we go what we can see by cars 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.370
 it's quite realistic I think we're going to 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.680
 see a much higher level in this of the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.279
 deformations in collisions and other 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.710
 and I think it will even surprise us more 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:17.689
 of what we expect I think they have been 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.669
 something that they will have taken into account because 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.879
 in the previous game there were people who 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.460
 complained was not much but it did 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.069
 I was talking about collisions that were not 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.770
 so so successful were more of style 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.840
 san andreas that style whatever a 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.730
 game like the colin mcrae dirt 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.160
 it's quite realistic in terms of 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.169
 deformation in order that has been the 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.820
 analysis I hope you liked it 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.260
 has made this as clear as possible 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.540
 collisions even if we do not have much 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.400
 information to be able to analyze it very 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.139
 background but with what we have had we have 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.970
 done what we could so I hope 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.270
 what you liked and until next time 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.270
 goodbye 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.449
