00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
backwards and there you can see the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.510 
backwards and there you can see the
catapult<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.330> just<00:01:10.479> fits<00:01:10.810> over<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.950> back<00:01:12.250> of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
catapult and just fits over the back of

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.000 
catapult and just fits over the back of
the<00:01:12.670> torso<00:01:12.909> clips<00:01:13.690> on<00:01:13.990> over<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.590> shoulders

the torso clips on over the shoulders

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.520 
the torso clips on over the shoulders
and<00:01:15.220> then<00:01:15.670> secures<00:01:16.119> at<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.780> waist<00:01:16.990> there<00:01:17.320> and

and then secures at the waist there and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.249 
and then secures at the waist there and
here<00:01:18.159> is<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.640> power<00:01:18.880> web<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.630> is<00:01:19.810> connected

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
here is the power web that is connected

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.440 
here is the power web that is connected
through<00:01:20.560> a<00:01:20.680> hole<00:01:21.159> and<00:01:21.399> then<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.969> just<00:01:22.180> feed

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
through a hole and then you just feed

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.389 
through a hole and then you just feed
that<00:01:22.479> through<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:23.350> top<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:23.920> catapult

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
that through the top of the catapult

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.240 
that through the top of the catapult
there<00:01:24.579> and<00:01:25.000> we<00:01:25.090> have<00:01:25.270> two<00:01:25.570> discs<00:01:26.140> now<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.740> aim

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
there and we have two discs now the aim

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.480 
there and we have two discs now the aim
of<00:01:27.280> this<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.939> to<00:01:28.329> pull<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.930> back<00:01:29.109> and<00:01:29.500> hold<00:01:30.219> the

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
of this is to pull it back and hold the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.539 
of this is to pull it back and hold the
arm<00:01:30.969> where<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.659> web<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.469> attached<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.829> and

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
arm where the web is attached to and

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.160 
arm where the web is attached to and
that<00:01:33.700> will<00:01:33.880> cause<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.450> elastic<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.109> stretch

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
that will cause the elastic to stretch

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.770 
that will cause the elastic to stretch
and<00:01:36.130> then<00:01:36.399> you<00:01:36.520> should<00:01:36.700> fire<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.210> two<00:01:37.479> discs

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
and then you should fire the two discs

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.050 
and then you should fire the two discs
so<00:01:38.079> let's<00:01:38.289> try<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.680> now<00:01:38.859> there<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.759> go<00:01:39.909> over

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
so let's try that now there you go over

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.690 
so let's try that now there you go over
the<00:01:40.179> two<00:01:40.420> discs<00:01:40.869> that<00:01:40.929> did<00:01:41.320> fire<00:01:42.009> off<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.520> that

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
the two discs that did fire off so that

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.090 
the two discs that did fire off so that
is<00:01:43.210> how<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.630> works<00:01:44.109> let's<00:01:44.409> just<00:01:44.679> take<00:01:44.890> a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
is how that works let's just take a

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.060 
is how that works let's just take a
quick<00:01:45.310> look<00:01:45.549> after<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.390> figure<00:01:46.689> itself<00:01:47.140> he's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
quick look after the figure itself he's

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.830 
quick look after the figure itself he's
pretty<00:01:48.609> cool<00:01:49.140> highly<00:01:50.140> detailed<00:01:50.640> only

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pretty cool highly detailed only

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.469 
pretty cool highly detailed only
articulated<00:01:52.840> on<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.109> leg<00:01:53.259> after<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:53.979> top<00:01:54.479> by

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
articulated on the leg after the top by

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.539 
articulated on the leg after the top by
the<00:01:55.509> wife's<00:01:56.109> there<00:01:56.380> no<00:01:56.619> more<00:01:56.799> articulation

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
the wife's there no more articulation

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.310 
the wife's there no more articulation
does<00:01:57.969> have<00:01:58.149> some<00:01:58.359> nice<00:01:58.479> red<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.140> yellow

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
does have some nice red and yellow

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.340 
does have some nice red and yellow
coloring<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.399> if<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.670> take<00:02:00.999> this<00:02:01.570> catapult<00:02:02.140> off

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
coloring and if I take this catapult off

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.560 
coloring and if I take this catapult off
all<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.710> need<00:02:02.859> to<00:02:02.979> do<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.670> unclip<00:02:04.119> it<00:02:04.359> from

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
all you need to do is unclip it from

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.230 
all you need to do is unclip it from
back<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.619> saw<00:02:05.799> so<00:02:06.039> there<00:02:06.249> and<00:02:06.850> they<00:02:07.030> can

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
back of the saw so there and they can

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
main feature of this figure is of course

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.380 
main feature of this figure is of course
the<00:02:55.150> catapult<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:57.580> figure<00:02:57.790> will<00:02:58.090> stand

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
the catapult and this figure will stand

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.550 
the catapult and this figure will stand
up<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.630> corner<00:02:58.870> obviously<00:02:59.290> without<00:02:59.410> the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
up a corner obviously without the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.320 
up a corner obviously without the
catapult<00:03:00.130> but<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.640> once<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.060> have<00:03:01.240> the

catapult in place it will offset the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.660 
catapult in place it will offset the
weight<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.870> will<00:03:05.350> fall<00:03:05.680> over<00:03:05.980> very<00:03:06.400> easily

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
weight and will fall over very easily

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.850 
weight and will fall over very easily
