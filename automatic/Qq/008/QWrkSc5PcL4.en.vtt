00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
that horse's foot when it's on the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.759 
that horse's foot when it's on the
ground<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:41.900> can't<00:02:42.140> do<00:02:42.290> anything<00:02:42.470> with

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
ground and we can't do anything with

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.699 
ground and we can't do anything with
that<00:02:42.799> artists<00:02:43.310> foot<00:02:43.580> when<00:02:43.970> it's<00:02:44.120> in<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.450> air

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
that artists foot when it's in the air

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.770 
that artists foot when it's in the air
but<00:02:45.709> if<00:02:45.890> we<00:02:46.010> know<00:02:46.250> when<00:02:46.519> that<00:02:46.549> foot<00:02:46.970> leaves<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
but if we know when that foot leaves the

but if we know when that foot leaves the
ground<00:02:48.049> when<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.709> departs<00:02:48.950> we<00:02:49.549> can<00:02:49.700> direct

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
ground when it departs we can direct

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.030 
ground when it departs we can direct
that<00:02:50.269> foot<00:02:50.600> we<00:02:51.200> directed<00:02:51.650> forward<00:02:52.930> faster<00:02:54.040> or

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
that foot we directed forward faster or

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.729 
that foot we directed forward faster or
we<00:02:55.280> can<00:02:55.489> direct<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.030> laterally<00:02:56.750> from<00:02:57.380> right<00:02:57.709> to

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
we can direct it laterally from right to

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.819 
we can direct it laterally from right to
left<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.299> makes<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.660> so<00:02:59.900> much<00:03:00.079> easier<00:03:00.140> for

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
left and it makes it so much easier for

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.330 
left and it makes it so much easier for
a<00:03:00.890> horse<00:03:01.540> exactly<00:03:02.829> exactly

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
a horse exactly exactly

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.310 
a horse exactly exactly
we're<00:03:04.910> directing<00:03:05.329> that<00:03:05.570> horse<00:03:05.840> which<00:03:06.049> we<00:03:06.230> hit

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
we're directing that horse which we hit

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.199 
we're directing that horse which we hit
exactly<00:03:06.470> like<00:03:07.130> you<00:03:07.340> direct<00:03:07.700> your<00:03:07.850> feet<00:03:08.090> if

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
exactly like you direct your feet if

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.900 
exactly like you direct your feet if
you're<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.570> dad
