00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.020
 everyone already knows that I am bryant I hope 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.850
 and they are very well and today I bring 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.800
 a slightly more thematic video which is 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.660
 you come to finish I think that all 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.040
 we have this endless list of sagas 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.390
 to finish and why I wanted 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.119
 share with you what are the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.680
 trilogies areas and so on etcetera that 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.509
 I have yet to finish and that really 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.399
 I want to finish the first one knows that 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.200
 I want to finish and I 'm sorry to show 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.780
 this and say that it was not over in 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.590
 the harry potter saga of jake rolling 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.940
 I'm teaching about the first ones 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.440
 two and they really have this saga 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.660
 because all the people talk about it all 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.400
 people know the sea discussion carry the 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.410
 movies that you make certain point I already know 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.570
 what happens but I still want to read 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.700
 I want to finish reading them because they are 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.890
 apparently great books the by 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.510
 what does not end this saga is because I do not 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.510
 along very well with the magic in 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.980
 Fantasy is not my favorite genre 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.320
 then battle a little with those books 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.640
 I do not know how much I like them and I do not know 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.470
 if they are not bad because both 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.899
 I like it first but it's not the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.710
 genre that I love to read more the 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.200
 gender 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.729
 I prefer without lending him a magnet and that's why 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.619
 that the following do not end 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.600
 audiences with western I read 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.940
 only the first two that are how 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.250
 we see piris you miss me pesos that is the 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.440
 last and third surgery and also I 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.180
 missing the sequel extras with these books 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.740
 I have a small problem because I 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.690
 they like my stories very much 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.880
 favorites but how to write the 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.009
 writer if it is a bit strange English 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.840
 it's like a weird medium half confused 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.090
 then and struggled a lot when this 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.560
 book and our books that's why 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.750
 I think I've left them like that 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.070
 then I'm still unknown but I already want 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.140
 finish it is already a fault the third 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.610
 so I hope to do it soon and now 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.440
 to be able to continue with the sequel and take 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 finished this room the next of the 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.149
 trilogy of maestro leinier maría la 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.550
 triumph and in itself already the law but I'm missing 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.020
 which it is the prequel detail and virus 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.729
 honestly I have not bought him because 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.920
 our my priorities not heard what 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.450
 best of the prequel then like that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.580
 I do not care much to read but just 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.920
 I want to complete this saga well and I want 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.410
 read this after stable follows from 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.510
 list price which biology is to be 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.340
 if andré and it was read nothing else 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.079
 is this very well be super learners 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.810
 because I'll be already know that it's an emmy 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.060
 free please 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.770
 I loved it totally and if I want to know 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.239
 how this story ends but not what 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.220
 I can get and that's why he's 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.900
 as in standby is biology but I'm 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.700
 eager to finish it because really 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.709
 I want to be the next are the books 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.080
 of hunters of shadows these books already 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.580
 lily the five of us obviously lack the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.260
 sixth that not all leave yet as soon as 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.000
 come out I will read it but we also need 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.010
 the prequel that are infernal of the s of 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.690
 senna and mechanic mechanic prince 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.069
 mechanical princess I really want to read 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.660
 those schools because I heard that is 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.580
 even better than this and if this one 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.410
 liked I do not want to imagine how much I 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.299
 like the prequel then want the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.130
 prequel and in addition to the sixth one that is already 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.900
 for going out to be able to say that I've 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.760
 finished with shadow hunter though 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.549
 well also against the chronicles of 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.530
 Beijing and the sequel that he plans to take 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.269
 tenacity here is worth then I do not know when 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.840
 I'm going to end up with shadow hunters 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.840
 but 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.340
 the following are the books of the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.260
 chronicles of narnia if it is lewis I have 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 finished the third then I go as 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.540
 home in the room that is preaching well 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.130
 and these books are good but they have 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.930
 various aspects that make me not 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.120
 continue those that make me have them in 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.590
 standby first is that obviously these 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.480
 books they wrote a long time ago 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.490
 then English is very different from 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.740
 which is used now and it is in itself just 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.810
 I'm with English so I'm not 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.550
 just use it dominating now 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.380
 imagine an Englishman of many, many 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.690
 years, if they are good and complicated 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.640
 besides that they are obviously books 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.350
 dedicated for children then we the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.690
 frames the frames I do not feel a 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.700
 little like that the great thing and I go back to what 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.500
 same fantasy is not given to me very child 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.050
 struggled a lot with fantasy and is for 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.580
 what is born of these books but go 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.190
 that are good and if they are worth it 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.959
 read them troy me but if they are these 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.670
 aspects that allow me to continue 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.200
 besides it is very ironic that they are 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.640
 all super short 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.010
 although he wanted to was nothing more than 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.470
 impose a straight type of saying in two 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.980
 weeks they took it out - and if it would end 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.050
 but then 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.120
 the following is not merely a saga 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.209
 but it is a series which is the cbi 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.799
 by robert langdon by dan brown includes 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.669
 the code da vinci and angels and demons 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.530
 the lost symbol 'and many others and in 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.240
 I really want to follow this series this is 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.100
 the code da vinci that without utility is 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.840
 the second but I want to read the rest 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.160
 because the da vinci code I loved it 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.740
 you know it's one of my books 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.270
 favorites are my top 3 even of 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.560
 favorite readings 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.240
 so if I want to follow this series 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.560
 because I was very interested, I liked it 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.360
 quite the way to write and with 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.729
 brawn I feel that he is an author who is worth 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.100
 very much worth reading and has a 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.840
 unique way of writing then if 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.190
 I want to follow this series but I can not 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.830
 get them in addition to that if they are 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.380
 holes and I'm in my challenge of not 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.990
 buy books then wait for me 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.000
 a short time and if these have been the 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.039
 saga this unfinished technician is some 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.440
 way I was thinking also make a 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.880
 Video of the sagas I want to start 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.410
 what I am about to start then 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.389
 tell me down here if you want to see your 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.830
 video to record it and share with 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.210
 you the sagas that I have here that 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.460
 I want to start or the birds that I want 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.100
 buy to start and if this is 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.900
 true for the video I hope you like it 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.550

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.350
 see what are they finally leave their 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.940
 ask for the instructors do not forget 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.380
 do it in the hashtag so bryant 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.150
 Answer for your question 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.280
 by the descriptors because in about 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.780
 how many days I will be answering them and not 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.910
 I would like you to stay with the 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.830
 same question and good as always 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.870
 I was with my social networks in case 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.400
 they like to pass their but none of them we 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.390
 we see in a next video take care of yourself a lot 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.390
 I love you enough
