you<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> ripcord<00:01:22.950> launcher<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.790> then

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you get the ripcord launcher and then

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
you get the ripcord launcher and then
the<00:01:24.420> actual<00:01:24.689> bay<00:01:24.900> itself<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.950> do<00:01:26.159> seem<00:01:26.310> to

the actual bay itself they do seem to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.880 
the actual bay itself they do seem to
have<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> metal<00:01:26.820> part<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> looks<00:01:28.650> like

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
have a metal part can see it looks like

that tip still mimics the actual twisted
tempo<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.159> thing<00:01:32.700> that's

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
tempo which would be the thing that's

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
here the others we saw each have three

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.539 
here the others we saw each have three
to<00:01:57.360> launch<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:59.520> they

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to launch out what they have if they

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.270 
to launch out what they have if they
think<00:01:59.670> makes<00:02:00.240> contact<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:01.100> then<00:02:02.100> his

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
think makes contact that then his

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
think makes contact that then his
hammers<00:02:02.670> launch<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.259> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
hammers launch out I like what that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.530 
hammers launch out I like what that
happens<00:02:04.740> his<00:02:05.130> balance<00:02:05.549> will<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.729> thrown<00:02:06.450> off

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
happens his balance will be thrown off

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059 
happens his balance will be thrown off
kilter<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.110> he<00:02:07.380> won't<00:02:07.560> last<00:02:07.710> very<00:02:07.860> much

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
kilter and he won't last very much

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.430 
kilter and he won't last very much
longer<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.700> battle<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.869> we'll<00:02:09.989> get<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> stamp

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
longer in battle so we'll get the stamp

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.559 
longer in battle so we'll get the stamp
set<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.830> will<00:02:10.890> show<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.129> how<00:02:11.459> very<00:02:12.270> many

we'll<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.740> how<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.860> goes<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.400> just<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.640> second

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
we'll see how that goes in just a second

feathers<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.060> do<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.270> trial<00:02:24.540> monstrous<00:02:24.960> make

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
feathers I do a trial monstrous make

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140 
feathers I do a trial monstrous make
things<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.320> little<00:02:25.380> easier<00:02:25.620> here<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.730> we'll<00:02:26.820> see

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
things a little easier here so we'll see

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.570 
things a little easier here so we'll see
how<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.480> works<00:02:27.660> out<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.890> 321<00:02:29.460> let<00:02:30.180> it

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
how this works out then in 321 let it

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.190 
how this works out then in 321 let it
that<00:02:32.580> was<00:02:32.700> obviously<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.150> bad<00:02:33.690> launch<00:02:33.990> let's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
that was obviously a bad launch let's

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.040 
that was obviously a bad launch let's
try<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:34.620> more<00:02:34.830> time<00:02:35.100> here<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:35.930> we<00:02:36.930> can

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
try that one more time here so we can

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.660 
try that one more time here so we can
actually<00:02:37.170> have<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> make<00:02:37.770> contact<00:02:38.430> with<00:02:38.580> each

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
actually have a make contact with each

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.940 
actually have a make contact with each
other<00:02:38.790> may<00:02:39.720> provide<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.080> slightly<00:02:40.680> better

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
other may provide a slightly better

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.840 
other may provide a slightly better
demonstration<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:43.520> skip<00:02:44.520> these<00:02:44.640> guys

out<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.060> statement<00:03:03.330> immediately<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:05.700> looks

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
out a statement immediately and it looks

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.310 
out a statement immediately and it looks
like<00:03:05.970> Pegasus<00:03:06.360> jumper<00:03:06.690> actually<00:03:07.020> deployed

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
like Pegasus jumper actually deployed

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.190 
like Pegasus jumper actually deployed
his<00:03:07.530> jumping<00:03:08.220> thin<00:03:08.550> there<00:03:08.730> as<00:03:08.880> well<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.960> that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
his jumping thin there as well as that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.810 
his jumping thin there as well as that
was<00:03:10.380> over<00:03:10.650> instantly<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.490> actually<00:03:11.730> the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
was over instantly and actually the

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.760 
was over instantly and actually the
temple<00:03:12.150> there<00:03:12.330> seems<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.200> hold<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.500> spin

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
temple there seems to hold the spin

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.770 
temple there seems to hold the spin
fairly<00:03:14.370> decently<00:03:14.700> there<00:03:14.970> he's<00:03:15.300> compared<00:03:15.690> to

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
fairly decently there he's compared to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.950 
fairly decently there he's compared to
the<00:03:15.930> curb<00:03:16.650> x1<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:18.270> let's<00:03:18.390> try<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.570> one<00:03:18.900> last

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
the curb x1 so let's try this one last

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.710 
the curb x1 so let's try this one last
time<00:03:19.350> then<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:21.080> three<00:03:22.080> two<00:03:22.350> one<00:03:22.380> liddie<00:03:23.720> so

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
time then in three two one liddie so

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.320 
time then in three two one liddie so
they<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.020> see<00:03:25.140> they<00:03:25.230> make<00:03:25.380> contact<00:03:25.560> wit<00:03:26.010> again

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
they can see they make contact wit again

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.240 
they can see they make contact wit again
goes<00:03:27.330> pick<00:03:27.570> this<00:03:27.720> jumping<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.440> temple<00:03:29.070> goes

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
goes pick this jumping and temple goes

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.720 
goes pick this jumping and temple goes
down<00:03:29.610> first<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:31.350> not<00:03:32.070> always<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.550> it<00:03:32.640> gonna

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
down first so not always is it gonna

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.920 
down first so not always is it gonna
shove<00:03:33.150> them<00:03:33.240> drunk<00:03:33.510> out<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> stadium

out<00:03:44.430> these<00:03:44.640> extensively<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.360> think<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.690> paint

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870
