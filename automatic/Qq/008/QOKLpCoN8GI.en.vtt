00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.620 
gonna a quick look I'm going to grab a
GTX<00:05:33.200> 450<00:05:34.180> compare<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.270> size<00:05:35.480> this<00:05:36.380> is<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.860> GTX

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
GTX 450 compare the size this is the GTX

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.370 
GTX 450 compare the size this is the GTX
450<00:05:38.630> from<00:05:39.220> from<00:05:40.220> stock<00:05:41.060> GTX<00:05:41.480> 450<00:05:41.990> from<00:05:42.200> the

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
450 from from stock GTX 450 from the

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.850 
450 from from stock GTX 450 from the
Nvidia<00:05:42.950> so<00:05:43.580> you<00:05:43.670> can<00:05:43.790> see<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.860> actually

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
Nvidia so you can see the actually

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.280 
Nvidia so you can see the actually
similar<00:05:46.070> size<00:05:46.460> their<00:05:46.970> pay<00:05:47.840> now<00:05:47.900> should<00:05:48.110> be<00:05:48.140> the

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
similar size their pay now should be the

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.160 
similar size their pay now should be the
same<00:05:48.500> but<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:49.030> gtx<00:05:50.030> 550<00:05:50.390> ti<00:05:50.690> is<00:05:50.870> an

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
same but the gtx 550 ti is an

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.230 
same but the gtx 550 ti is an
improvement<00:05:51.560> over<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:52.160> gtx<00:05:52.610> 450

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
improvement over the gtx 450

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.200 
improvement over the gtx 450
architecture<00:05:53.810> and<00:05:57.070> put<00:05:58.070> the<00:05:58.190> 450<00:05:58.640> aside<00:05:58.910> and

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
architecture and put the 450 aside and

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.260 
architecture and put the 450 aside and
look<00:05:59.390> and<00:05:59.600> 550d<00:06:00.410> are<00:06:00.500> in<00:06:00.590> great<00:06:00.710> detail<00:06:01.120> it<00:06:02.120> has

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
look and 550d are in great detail it has

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.870 
look and 550d are in great detail it has
a<00:06:02.300> single<00:06:02.630> fan<00:06:02.930> by<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.500> center<00:06:03.920> you<00:06:04.550> can<00:06:04.640> see

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
a single fan by the center you can see

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.940 
a single fan by the center you can see
through<00:06:05.060> there<00:06:05.300> there<00:06:05.450> is<00:06:05.540> in<00:06:05.720> a<00:06:05.950> aluminum

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
through there there is in a aluminum

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.410 
through there there is in a aluminum
heatsink<00:06:09.430> there's<00:06:10.430> a<00:06:10.520> plastic<00:06:10.880> shroud<00:06:11.120> with<00:06:11.390> a

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
heatsink there's a plastic shroud with a

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.410 
heatsink there's a plastic shroud with a
gtx<00:06:12.020> 550<00:06:12.440> i<00:06:12.620> blow<00:06:13.430> over<00:06:13.610> now<00:06:13.910> alright<00:06:14.150> in<00:06:14.270> the

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
gtx 550 i blow over now alright in the

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.760 
gtx 550 i blow over now alright in the
corner<00:06:14.750> there<00:06:15.020> and<00:06:16.630> it<00:06:17.630> comes<00:06:17.930> in<00:06:18.050> a<00:06:18.110> black<00:06:18.260> PCB

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
corner there and it comes in a black PCB

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.280 
corner there and it comes in a black PCB
well<00:06:19.670> actually<00:06:19.820> we're<00:06:20.120> there<00:06:20.480> with<00:06:21.170> the

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
well actually we're there with the

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.440 
well actually we're there with the
copper<00:06:21.680> traces<00:06:21.980> a<00:06:22.540> thick<00:06:23.540> PCB<00:06:24.020> and<00:06:25.090> the<00:06:26.090> this

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
copper traces a thick PCB and the this

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.750 
copper traces a thick PCB and the this
end<00:06:26.660> you<00:06:26.840> can<00:06:26.990> see<00:06:27.230> that<00:06:27.440> there<00:06:27.560> is<00:06:27.590> a<00:06:27.770> 6<00:06:28.520> pin

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
end you can see that there is a 6 pin

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.230 
end you can see that there is a 6 pin
power<00:06:29.090> connector<00:06:29.210> and<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:30.500> 4<00:06:30.860> pin<00:06:31.240> fan

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
power connector and the 4 pin fan

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.580 
power connector and the 4 pin fan
connector<00:06:32.770> and<00:06:35.020> we're<00:06:36.020> going<00:06:36.140> to<00:06:36.200> look<00:06:36.350> for

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
connector and we're going to look for

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.680 
connector and we're going to look for
the<00:06:36.800> SLR<00:06:37.310> connector<00:06:37.700> there<00:06:37.970> is<00:06:38.150> only<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.419> single

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
the SLR connector there is only a single

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.730 
the SLR connector there is only a single
as<00:06:38.960> a<00:06:38.990> light<00:06:39.229> connector<00:06:39.760> since<00:06:40.760> this<00:06:40.910> is<00:06:41.150> a

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
as a light connector since this is a
