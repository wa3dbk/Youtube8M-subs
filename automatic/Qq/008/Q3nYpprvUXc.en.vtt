00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 on the eve of the international day of dentists 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.420
 our film crew decided to look to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.120
 heroes of the occasion a dentist from 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.370
 Alex Medical Center and need to understand 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.130
 Are we afraid of dentists today? 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 and how often they need to be visited in order 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.600
 make your teeth strong and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.580
 healthy perhaps many people have more than one 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.350
 medical action does not cause as much 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.449
 emotions as fear of visiting 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.279
 dentist however every 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.650
 self-respecting person tries 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.480
 visit this office more than once 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.579
 year especially since dentists 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.010
 recommend seeking their help 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 timely they pull as they say to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.969
 last when the pain becomes 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 unbearably painful and even fear 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.050
 the patient must remain in front of the door 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.329
 cabinet modern technology 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.309
 allow you to completely relax and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.809
 trust the dentist date 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.329
 celebration of international day 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.910
 Dentist is not chosen randomly in this 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.610
 day christians catholics commemorate the holy 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.500
 apollonia which, according to legend, heals 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.270
 from toothache but on this fact 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.649
 dentist alexander archangel 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.649
 there is a certain opinion 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.159
 life that is, I understand perfectly that things 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.149
 who surround us 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:22.189
 we try to do without them 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:24.479
 without toothpaste all that 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:29.310
 activities of people who forget 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.429
 again you decide everything is worth 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:39.080
 sleeve but if someone helps not 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:42.060
 Well, in general, what are all the problems 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.340
 Alexander came his profession by accident 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.500
 at first he couldnâ€™t even imagine 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.870
 that dentistry attracts him so much 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.570
 that dental treatment will be his goal in 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.880
 life for 17 years of work a doctor has never 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.740
 thought to devote himself to another matter only 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.900
 prosthetics only quick and 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.060
 quality patient care by the way 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.280
 Alexander sometimes compare themselves with 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.100
 a psychologist because every person needs 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.680
 find a different approach and every day 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.300
 he voices his patient literate 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.050
 health instruction 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.050
 oral cavity 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.090
 medium hard as soon as sound 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.130
 appeared hinged from that moment he 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.940
 can be differently korean when 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.630
 be weak 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.980
 but as soon as the news 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.980
 appeared this moment 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:48.620
 to man permanent teeth 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.409
 appeared in the right place at the right time 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.310
 condition is very desirable to but 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.450
 of this moment milk teeth pour out too 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.659
 bad mood 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.950
 the story on the baby tooth is sick and hits 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.950
 earlier than it should 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.040
 as the poet Sergey Fedin said 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.049
 the only person I heed with 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.939
 open mouth my dentist 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.189
 it was precisely the person who came to the dentist 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:28.139
 trust your health so much so that it 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.389
 can be compared with the work of a jeweler over 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.760
 very fragile gem such 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.889
 seasoned literate and wise dentists 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.959
 as Alexander is not so much but by 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.700
 opinion of the dentist by this 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.769
 qualities can have any 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.139
 the dentist only needs a little 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.120
 desires work and love 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.780
