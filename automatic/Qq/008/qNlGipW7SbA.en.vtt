so<00:00:03.120> first<00:00:03.419> up<00:00:04.370> we<00:00:05.370> have<00:00:05.400> our<00:00:05.580> epoxy<00:00:06.290> which<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.440> a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
so first up we have our epoxy which is a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.820 
so first up we have our epoxy which is a
two-part<00:00:07.950> 5-minute<00:00:08.910> cure<00:00:09.230> which<00:00:10.230> really<00:00:10.469> it's

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
two-part 5-minute cure which really it's

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.220 
two-part 5-minute cure which really it's
more<00:00:11.010> like<00:00:11.219> after<00:00:11.519> half<00:00:11.940> an<00:00:12.090> hour<00:00:12.210> even<00:00:13.139> an

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
more like after half an hour even an

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.429 
more like after half an hour even an
hour<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.710> better<00:00:13.920> than<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.240> sand<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:18.439> this

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
hour is better than you can sand it this

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.460 
hour is better than you can sand it this
is<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> rocking<00:00:20.160> chair<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:21.920> has<00:00:23.720> two<00:00:24.720> non

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
is the rocking chair that has two non

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.779 
is the rocking chair that has two non
holes<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> bottom<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> two

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
holes here on the bottom of this two

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.029 
holes here on the bottom of this two
inch<00:00:26.939> lumber<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.410> I've<00:00:28.529> taped<00:00:28.800> off

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
inch lumber you can see I've taped off

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.299 
inch lumber you can see I've taped off
all<00:00:29.279> around<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.670> hole<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.689> keep<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
all around the hole just to keep the

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.270 
all around the hole just to keep the
extra<00:00:32.309> mess<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> epoxy<00:00:33.600> makes<00:00:34.280> just

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
extra mess that the epoxy makes just

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.040 
extra mess that the epoxy makes just
less<00:00:35.460> work<00:00:35.730> when<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.210> comes<00:00:36.390> back<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> standing

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
less work when it comes back to standing

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.940 
less work when it comes back to standing
it<00:00:37.430> see<00:00:38.430> both<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> holes<00:00:39.469> see<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.739> there

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
it see both the holes see right in there

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.470 
it see both the holes see right in there
these<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.460> air<00:00:41.550> gun<00:00:41.730> blowing<00:00:42.059> them<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.270> out

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
these an air gun blowing them all out

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.560 
these an air gun blowing them all out
knocked<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> loose<00:00:43.350> material<00:00:45.860> and

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
knocked out all the loose material and

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.910 
knocked out all the loose material and
so<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.840> I'm<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.739> I'll<00:00:49.890> actually

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so what I'm going to do is I'll actually

00:00:49.920 --> 00:01:02.390 
so what I'm going to do is I'll actually
be<00:00:50.309> coloring<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.140> epoxy<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:53.000> sawdust

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.359 

so<00:01:03.400> you<00:01:03.460> can<00:01:03.579> see<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.790> sawdust<00:01:04.479> we<00:01:04.930> just<00:01:05.110> made

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so you can see the sawdust we just made

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.859 
so you can see the sawdust we just made
and<00:01:06.369> we'll<00:01:06.460> mix<00:01:06.670> that<00:01:06.790> with<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.090> actual<00:01:07.450> proxy

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
and we'll mix that with the actual proxy

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:17.149 
and we'll mix that with the actual proxy
while<00:01:08.050> we're<00:01:08.200> mixing<00:01:08.320> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980 

so<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.390> rubber<00:01:18.570> may<00:01:18.780> pin

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
so I like to use this rubber may pin

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.190 
so I like to use this rubber may pin
that<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.229> actually<00:01:19.439> mix<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> epoxy<00:01:20.579> on

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
that I actually mix up all the epoxy on

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.330 
that I actually mix up all the epoxy on
you<00:01:22.200> would<00:01:22.320> think<00:01:22.409> I'd<00:01:22.560> use<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.829> inside<00:01:23.130> by

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you would think I'd use the inside by

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.069 
you would think I'd use the inside by
excuse<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.820> outside<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
excuse the outside here with a little in

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.410 
excuse the outside here with a little in
dentists<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> plastic<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> cracked

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
dentists and with the plastic is cracked

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
dentists and with the plastic is cracked
after<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.049> hardens<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:29.159> crack<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.520> plastic

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
after it hardens just crack the plastic

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.270 
after it hardens just crack the plastic
and<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> epoxy<00:01:30.450> comes<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.840> off<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> we're

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and the epoxy comes right off so we're

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
and the epoxy comes right off so we're
going<00:01:32.399> to<00:01:38.360> pretty<00:01:39.360> warm<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:39.929> in<00:01:40.049> my

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
going to pretty warm right now in my

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.429 
going to pretty warm right now in my
shop<00:01:40.409> sleeve<00:01:40.710> box<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.100> pretty<00:01:41.369> runny<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.439> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
shop sleeve box is pretty runny and the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
shop sleeve box is pretty runny and the
cure<00:01:43.619> time<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.189> fairly<00:01:44.340> quick<00:01:44.670> so

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
cure time is actually fairly quick so

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.999 
cure time is actually fairly quick so
it's<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.569> squeeze<00:01:46.289> out<00:01:49.130> equal<00:01:50.130> amounts

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
it's gonna squeeze out equal amounts

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.700 
it's gonna squeeze out equal amounts
with<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.130 

and<00:01:59.710> if<00:02:00.040> it's<00:02:00.190> around

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.530 

I<00:02:03.170> like<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.860> mix<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.130> epoxy<00:02:04.190> first<00:02:04.730> together

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
I like to mix the epoxy first together

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.219 
I like to mix the epoxy first together
before<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.020> put<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.230> sawdust<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:06.980> I<00:02:08.229> feel

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
before I put the sawdust and just I feel

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.200 
before I put the sawdust and just I feel
like<00:02:09.290> that<00:02:09.590> gives<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.009> better<00:02:10.190> mix<00:02:10.430> I<00:02:10.729> don't

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
like that gives it a better mix I don't

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:32.650 
like that gives it a better mix I don't
know<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.730> actually<00:02:31.880> very<00:02:32.060> warm<00:02:32.510> in

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
know it is it is actually very warm in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.190 
know it is it is actually very warm in
my<00:02:32.750> shot

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
my shot

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.380 
my shot
right<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.520> proxy<00:02:34.850> cures<00:02:35.120> very

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
right now so the proxy cures very

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:55.740 
right now so the proxy cures very
quickly

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.760 

and<00:02:56.750> there<00:02:56.900> we<00:02:57.020> are<00:02:57.050> there<00:02:57.320> I'm<00:02:57.410> pretty<00:02:57.590> happy

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
and there we are there I'm pretty happy

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.280 
and there we are there I'm pretty happy
with<00:02:57.920> that<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:59.660> second<00:03:00.020> one<00:03:01.690> and<00:03:02.690> now<00:03:03.170> we're

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
with that the second one and now we're

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.940 
with that the second one and now we're
going<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.440> have<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.650> wait

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.830 

probably<00:03:08.550> what<00:03:08.640> half<00:03:08.790> an<00:03:08.940> hour<00:03:09.060> before<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.690> can

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
probably what half an hour before I can

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.670 
probably what half an hour before I can
actually<00:03:10.110> work<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.440> maybe<00:03:11.310> even<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.640> bit<00:03:11.760> longer

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
actually work it maybe even a bit longer

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.580 
actually work it maybe even a bit longer
and<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.860> there<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.540> seeing<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> little<00:03:16.050> bit<00:03:18.590> okay

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and is there so seeing a little bit okay

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.710 
and is there so seeing a little bit okay
so<00:03:19.620> now<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.980> epoxy<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.580> hard<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:21.090> actually

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
so now the epoxy is hard I actually

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.360 
so now the epoxy is hard I actually
leave<00:03:21.990> this<00:03:22.170> tape<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.830> begin<00:03:23.070> sanding

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
leave this tape on and begin sanding

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
speed come on I'm trying to keep the

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.800 
speed come on I'm trying to keep the
epoxy<00:03:39.240> cool

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
epoxy cool

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.910 
epoxy cool
try<00:03:40.290> not<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.500> melt<00:03:40.830> it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:58.520 

you

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:24.040 

you

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.600 

and<00:04:25.050> that's<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.500> now<00:04:25.890> I<00:04:25.920> can<00:04:26.190> see<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.400> do<00:04:26.520> have

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
and that's that now I can see I do have

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.770 
and that's that now I can see I do have
some<00:04:27.110> minor<00:04:28.110> minor<00:04:29.150> imperfections<00:04:30.150> here<00:04:30.690> in

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
some minor minor imperfections here in

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.720 
some minor minor imperfections here in
the<00:04:30.870> epoxy<00:04:31.110> so<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.500> have<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.830> use<00:04:32.280> an<00:04:32.400> airgun

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
the epoxy so I have to use an airgun

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.650 
the epoxy so I have to use an airgun
I'll<00:04:33.270> pull<00:04:33.600> out<00:04:33.630> these<00:04:33.990> little<00:04:34.290> spots<00:04:34.500> and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
I'll pull out these little spots and

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.960 
I'll pull out these little spots and
reapply<00:04:36.660> another<00:04:36.990> coat<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.320> epoxy<00:04:37.550> very<00:04:38.550> thin

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
reapply another coat of epoxy very thin

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.719 
reapply another coat of epoxy very thin
skin<00:04:39.180> coat

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:55.930 

you

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.670 

so<00:04:56.940> it's<00:04:57.180> been<00:04:57.300> saying<00:04:57.540> it<00:04:57.690> for<00:04:57.720> 500<00:04:58.290> shuttle

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
so it's been saying it for 500 shuttle

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.070 
so it's been saying it for 500 shuttle
water<00:04:58.980> applied<00:04:59.510> as<00:05:00.510> compared<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.050> other

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
water applied as compared to the other

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.100 
water applied as compared to the other
one<00:05:01.350> which<00:05:01.470> still<00:05:01.830> needs<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.250> have<00:05:02.550> some<00:05:03.110> go

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
one which still needs to have some go

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.380 
one which still needs to have some go
through<00:05:04.320> all<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.890> same<00:05:05.070> steps<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.970> probably

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
through all the same steps and probably

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.680 
through all the same steps and probably
like<00:05:06.660> little<00:05:06.990> skim<00:05:07.230> coat<00:05:07.410> epoxy<00:05:07.920> again<00:05:08.690> and

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
like little skim coat epoxy again and

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.040 
like little skim coat epoxy again and
then<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.440> final<00:05:10.770> sand
