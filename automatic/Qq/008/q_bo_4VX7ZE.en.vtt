this<00:00:14.670> piece<00:00:17.539> if<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.690> take<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.080> piece<00:00:19.380> out<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
this piece if you take this piece out of

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.490 
this piece if you take this piece out of
the<00:00:19.980> back<00:00:20.730> end<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.470> center

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the back end here so that the center

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.849 
the back end here so that the center
track<00:00:23.130> will<00:00:23.460> will<00:00:24.180> come<00:00:24.390> out<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:25.019> piece<00:00:25.320> just

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
track will will come out this piece just

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.640 
track will will come out this piece just
screws<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.460> there<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> center<00:00:28.410> track

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
screws in there so that the center track

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.770 
screws in there so that the center track
will<00:00:29.310> slide<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.320> we<00:00:31.320> also<00:00:31.439> took<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
will slide out of it we also took the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.040 
will slide out of it we also took the
the<00:00:33.800> bolts<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> bottom<00:00:35.489> hinge<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
the bolts out of the bottom hinge and

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.180 
the bolts out of the bottom hinge and
under<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.200> top<00:00:37.440> hinge<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:39.350> therefore<00:00:42.980> we<00:00:43.980> put

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
under the top hinge and therefore we put

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.150 
under the top hinge and therefore we put
them<00:00:44.370> back<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:45.030> here

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.100 

should<00:00:49.640> be<00:00:49.760> easy<00:00:49.940> we've<00:00:50.360> only<00:00:50.540> been<00:00:50.750> out<00:00:50.870> this

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
should be easy we've only been out this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.920 
should be easy we've only been out this
for<00:00:51.380> ten<00:00:51.560> minutes<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.540> we<00:00:53.540> should<00:00:53.750> have<00:00:53.900> it

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
for ten minutes so we should have it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.020 
for ten minutes so we should have it
back<00:00:54.200> on<00:00:54.500> in<00:00:54.680> another<00:00:54.980> ten<00:00:55.310> minutes<00:00:55.490> so<00:00:55.970> you

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
back on in another ten minutes so you

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.450 
back on in another ten minutes so you
slid<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.570> back<00:00:56.900> in<00:00:57.970> and<00:00:59.890> we've<00:01:00.890> got<00:01:01.130> a<00:01:01.160> couple

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
slid that back in and we've got a couple

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.350 
slid that back in and we've got a couple
of<00:01:01.640> volts<00:01:01.970> into<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.830> top<00:01:03.830> engine<00:01:04.520> in<00:01:05.030> here

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
of volts into the top engine in here

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.920 
of volts into the top engine in here
again<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.890> bring<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.940> bolt<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.510> bottom

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.010 
again and bring the bolt in the bottom
now<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.790> then<00:01:10.940> we'll<00:01:11.120> put<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.450> cable<00:01:11.870> on

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
now and then we'll put the cable on

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.980 
now and then we'll put the cable on
what's<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.950> cable<00:01:13.310> for<00:01:15.310> locking<00:01:16.750> okay<00:01:17.750> well

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
what's the cable for locking okay well

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.850 
what's the cable for locking okay well
door<00:01:18.380> actually<00:01:18.620> walks<00:01:19.070> in<00:01:19.280> here<00:01:19.850> oh<00:01:20.000> okay<00:01:23.860> so

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
door actually walks in here oh okay so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.420 
door actually walks in here oh okay so
we<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.160> these<00:01:25.369> bolted<00:01:26.270> back<00:01:26.390> together<00:01:26.660> now

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
we have these bolted back together now

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.219 
we have these bolted back together now
this<00:01:28.430> is<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.850> together<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:29.570> cable<00:01:30.110> is

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
this is that together and that cable is

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.980 
this is that together and that cable is
together<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:31.580> cable<00:01:31.940> is<00:01:32.060> for<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.450> lock<00:01:32.660> when

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
together the cable is for the lock when

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.060 
together the cable is for the lock when
it<00:01:33.110> goes<00:01:33.290> backwards<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.330> doesn't<00:01:35.740> slide<00:01:36.740> on

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
it goes backwards so it doesn't slide on

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.290 
it goes backwards so it doesn't slide on
you<00:01:37.250> then<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.420> can<00:01:38.660> undo<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.530> by<00:01:39.800> doing<00:01:40.070> more

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
you then you can undo it by doing more

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.999 
you then you can undo it by doing more
so<00:01:41.300> it's<00:01:41.450> all<00:01:41.630> working<00:01:42.020> great<00:01:43.420> space<00:01:44.420> nice

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
so it's all working great space nice

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.790 
so it's all working great space nice
everywhere<00:01:46.009> is<00:01:46.130> nice<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.660> even<00:01:47.660> here<00:01:48.320> that's

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
everywhere is nice and even here that's

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.150 
everywhere is nice and even here that's
what<00:01:49.009> you<00:01:49.160> have<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.399> look<00:01:49.520> at<00:01:49.790> is<00:01:50.060> your
