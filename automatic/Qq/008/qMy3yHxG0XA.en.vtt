00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
talk about a passing tip that you can

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.589 
talk about a passing tip that you can
use<00:00:06.960> when<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.560> ball<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.859> coming<00:00:08.010> high<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.700> you

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
use when the ball is coming high and you

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.330 
use when the ball is coming high and you
can<00:00:09.719> open<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.320> it's<00:00:10.410> an<00:00:10.769> easier<00:00:11.130> way<00:00:11.309> to

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
can open up and it's an easier way to

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.710 
can open up and it's an easier way to
pass<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.880> steep<00:00:12.120> walls

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.850 

sometimes<00:00:17.720> when<00:00:17.990> a<00:00:18.020> ball<00:00:18.200> is<00:00:18.380> coming<00:00:18.529> high

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
sometimes when a ball is coming high

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.609 
sometimes when a ball is coming high
every<00:00:19.400> common<00:00:20.360> misconception<00:00:21.290> is<00:00:21.380> that<00:00:21.529> you

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
every common misconception is that you

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.350 
every common misconception is that you
always<00:00:21.830> have<00:00:22.130> to<00:00:22.250> move<00:00:22.369> your<00:00:22.520> feet<00:00:22.730> back<00:00:23.029> and

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
always have to move your feet back and

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.390 
always have to move your feet back and
take<00:00:23.660> it<00:00:23.779> on<00:00:23.840> your<00:00:23.990> midline<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:24.590> one<00:00:25.189> thing

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
take it on your midline and one thing

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.310 
take it on your midline and one thing
that<00:00:25.580> we<00:00:25.700> practice<00:00:26.150> with<00:00:26.360> the<00:00:26.750> national<00:00:27.140> team

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
that we practice with the national team

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.679 
that we practice with the national team
is<00:00:27.560> sometimes<00:00:28.279> you<00:00:28.400> don't<00:00:28.550> have<00:00:28.700> time<00:00:28.939> to<00:00:29.509> move

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
is sometimes you don't have time to move

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.960 
is sometimes you don't have time to move
back<00:00:29.900> and<00:00:30.259> so<00:00:30.410> we<00:00:30.650> open<00:00:30.950> up<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:31.340> it's<00:00:31.910> a

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
back and so we open up and it's a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.820 
back and so we open up and it's a
quicker<00:00:32.210> way<00:00:32.330> to<00:00:32.480> make<00:00:32.720> that<00:00:32.870> move<00:00:33.080> and<00:00:33.350> pass<00:00:33.530> a

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
quicker way to make that move and pass a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.790 
quicker way to make that move and pass a
high<00:00:34.040> ball<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.670> one<00:00:35.300> thing<00:00:35.540> that<00:00:35.570> they<00:00:36.440> stress

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
high ball and one thing that they stress

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.590 
high ball and one thing that they stress
is<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:37.280> take<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.519> drop<00:00:37.790> step<00:00:38.150> so<00:00:38.449> that

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
is that you take a drop step so that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.360 
is that you take a drop step so that
your<00:00:38.780> body<00:00:38.989> can<00:00:39.110> open<00:00:39.470> up<00:00:39.590> your<00:00:39.830> hips<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.220> your

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
your body can open up your hips and your

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.580 
your body can open up your hips and your
shoulders<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.180> you<00:00:41.510> can<00:00:41.660> drop<00:00:41.900> your<00:00:42.140> inside

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
shoulders and you can drop your inside

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.290 
shoulders and you can drop your inside
shoulder<00:00:42.620> better<00:00:43.220> and<00:00:43.489> create<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.760> good<00:00:43.970> angle

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
shoulder better and create a good angle

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.990 
shoulder better and create a good angle
for<00:00:44.449> a<00:00:44.600> high<00:00:44.840> ball<00:00:45.280> sometimes<00:00:46.280> if<00:00:46.699> you<00:00:46.820> don't

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
for a high ball sometimes if you don't

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.880 
for a high ball sometimes if you don't
open<00:00:47.210> up<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:47.660> don't<00:00:47.930> take<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:48.290> drop<00:00:48.590> step

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
open up and don't take this drop step

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.740 
open up and don't take this drop step
then<00:00:49.309> it's<00:00:49.520> really<00:00:49.760> hard<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.210> create<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.600> good

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
then it's really hard to create the good

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.119 
then it's really hard to create the good
angle<00:00:50.870> with<00:00:51.170> your<00:00:51.290> shoulders<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.829> it<00:00:51.890> can<00:00:52.010> be

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
angle with your shoulders and it can be

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.639 
angle with your shoulders and it can be
too<00:00:52.340> flat<00:00:52.700> instead<00:00:53.210> of<00:00:53.270> dropped<00:00:54.079> up<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.530> your

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
too flat instead of dropped up and your

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.380 
too flat instead of dropped up and your
great<00:00:55.010> shoulder<00:00:55.460> can<00:00:55.670> drop<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:55.879> little<00:00:56.210> bit

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
great shoulder can drop a little bit

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:24.700 
great shoulder can drop a little bit
more<00:00:56.570> create<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.110> better<00:00:57.260> angle

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.200 

you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.670 

sometimes<00:01:29.210> we<00:01:29.480> actually<00:01:29.810> practice<00:01:30.170> on<00:01:30.320> stools

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
sometimes we actually practice on stools

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.130 
sometimes we actually practice on stools
to<00:01:30.920> practice<00:01:31.460> our<00:01:31.610> drop<00:01:31.820> step<00:01:32.090> it's<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.930> great

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
to practice our drop step it's a great

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.430 
to practice our drop step it's a great
way<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.620> force<00:01:34.010> you<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.810> open<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:35.930> rather<00:01:36.290> than

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
way to force you to open up rather than

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.500 
way to force you to open up rather than
just<00:01:36.920> stand<00:01:37.400> straight<00:01:37.730> up<00:01:37.760> with<00:01:38.060> your<00:01:38.240> legs

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
just stand straight up with your legs

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.840 
just stand straight up with your legs
when<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.840> ball<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.020> coming<00:01:39.260> high<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.370> a<00:01:40.400> lot<00:01:40.820> of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
when the ball is coming high so a lot of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.880 
when the ball is coming high so a lot of
players<00:01:41.510> tendencies<00:01:42.200> when<00:01:42.380> it's<00:01:42.500> coming<00:01:42.740> high

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
players tendencies when it's coming high

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.340 
players tendencies when it's coming high
is<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.880> not<00:01:44.120> have<00:01:44.150> your<00:01:44.540> legs<00:01:44.720> bent<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.230> to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
is to not have your legs bent and to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.730 
is to not have your legs bent and to
kind<00:01:45.770> of<00:01:45.830> hop<00:01:46.040> up<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.430> being<00:01:47.120> on<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.390> stools

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
kind of hop up and being on the stools

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.830 
kind of hop up and being on the stools
forces<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:49.130> not<00:01:49.310> adjust<00:01:49.730> with<00:01:49.880> your<00:01:49.910> with

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
forces you to not adjust with your with

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.170 
forces you to not adjust with your with
your<00:01:50.870> legs<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.530> only<00:01:51.710> adjust<00:01:52.190> by<00:01:52.700> opening<00:01:53.060> up

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
your legs and only adjust by opening up

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.050 
your legs and only adjust by opening up
and<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.960> we<00:01:54.830> actually<00:01:54.950> do<00:01:55.310> this<00:01:55.460> a<00:01:55.520> lot<00:01:55.670> with

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
and so we actually do this a lot with

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.600 
and so we actually do this a lot with
the<00:01:56.180> national<00:01:56.600> team<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.340> great<00:01:58.490> way

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
the national team and it's a great way

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.550 
the national team and it's a great way
to<00:01:58.640> practice<00:01:58.880> high<00:01:59.240> balls<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.050> tool

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
to practice high balls and the tool

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.220 
to practice high balls and the tool
allows<00:02:00.830> you<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:01.160> pivot<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:02.360> open<00:02:02.660> up<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:03.080> like

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
allows you to pivot it open up just like

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:33.530 
allows you to pivot it open up just like
we're<00:02:03.440> talking<00:02:03.590> about<00:02:03.890> earlier

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:51.270 

you

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.340 

you
