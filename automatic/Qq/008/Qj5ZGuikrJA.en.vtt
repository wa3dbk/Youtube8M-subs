00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
shiny so the results kind of speak for

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
shiny so the results kind of speak for
itself<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.930> another<00:01:16.229> cool<00:01:16.560> thing<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
itself and another cool thing about the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.740 
itself and another cool thing about the
place<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.970> they're<00:01:18.210> considered

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
place are that they're considered

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
place are that they're considered
floating<00:01:19.259> plates<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.830> find<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.280> it's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
floating plates and I find that it's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.609 
floating plates and I find that it's
easy<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.299> curl<00:01:21.540> your<00:01:21.570> hair<00:01:21.960> when<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> plates

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
easy to curl your hair when the plates

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
easy to curl your hair when the plates
move<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.280> side<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> side<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> thought<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
move from side to side so I thought that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
move from side to side so I thought that
was<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.290> unique<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.920> cool<00:01:25.979> feature<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
was a really unique and cool feature of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
was a really unique and cool feature of
this<00:01:27.030> Flatiron<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.780> only<00:01:27.960> thing<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.200> don't

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
this Flatiron the only thing I don't

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.380 
this Flatiron the only thing I don't
care<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.610> doesn't<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.150> like

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
care for is that it doesn't have like

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.600 
care for is that it doesn't have like
