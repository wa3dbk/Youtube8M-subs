hi<00:00:07.859> Steve<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.400> at<00:00:08.490> ACK<00:00:08.970> wanted<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.360> talk<00:00:09.510> to

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
hi Steve here at ACK wanted to talk to

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.879 
hi Steve here at ACK wanted to talk to
you<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.870> just<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.139> minute<00:00:10.320> about<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
you for just a minute about the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.669 
you for just a minute about the
different<00:00:11.400> styles<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.059> rod<00:00:12.330> holders<00:00:12.809> there's

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
different styles of rod holders there's

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.260 
different styles of rod holders there's
probably<00:00:15.350> 20<00:00:16.350> 30<00:00:16.650> 40<00:00:17.070> different<00:00:17.580> versions<00:00:18.090> out

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
probably 20 30 40 different versions out

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.750 
probably 20 30 40 different versions out
there<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.810> sometimes<00:00:19.650> making<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.310> decision

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
there and sometimes making that decision

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.400 
there and sometimes making that decision
can<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:21.029> difficult<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.779> just<00:00:21.960> want<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> point

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
can be difficult I just want to point

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
can be difficult I just want to point
out<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> couple<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.220> differences<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.000> some<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
out a couple of differences on some of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.330 
out a couple of differences on some of
the<00:00:24.449> rod<00:00:24.600> holders<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.080> carry<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:26.099> makes

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the rod holders we carry and what makes

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.429 
the rod holders we carry and what makes
them<00:00:26.580> different<00:00:26.730> these<00:00:27.630> two<00:00:27.869> rod<00:00:28.080> holders

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
them different these two rod holders

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
them different these two rod holders
over<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.070> from<00:00:29.369> Ram<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.000> run<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
over here one from Ram and one run and

over here one from Ram and one run and
one<00:00:31.080> from<00:00:31.349> Scotty<00:00:31.790> there<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.910> basically<00:00:33.239> just

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
one from Scotty there are basically just

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.470 
one from Scotty there are basically just
two<00:00:33.630> broad<00:00:33.899> holders<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.680> butt<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.130> rod

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
two broad holders the butt of your rod

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.630 
two broad holders the butt of your rod
fits<00:00:36.480> inside<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.079> tube<00:00:37.320> there's<00:00:38.040> no<00:00:38.280> locking

place<00:00:41.660> which<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.290> know<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.649> positive

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
place which is you know can be positive

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.500 
place which is you know can be positive
or<00:00:44.280> negative<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.760> means<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:45.180> get<00:00:45.300> your

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
or negative it means you can get your

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.060

quickly and easily but you potentially

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
quickly and easily but you potentially

run the risk of knocking the rod out of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
run the risk of knocking the rod out of
the<00:00:52.199> holder<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> leg<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.399> having<00:00:53.940> a

fish pull it out of there for you this

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.459 
fish pull it out of there for you this
version<00:00:57.059> here<00:00:57.510> happens<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.140> Scotty

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
version here happens to be from Scotty

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.020 
version here happens to be from Scotty
it's<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:58.859> they<00:00:58.949> call<00:00:59.160> their<00:00:59.309> bait<00:00:59.520> caster

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it's what they call their bait caster

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's what they call their bait caster
and<00:01:00.120> spinning<00:01:00.539> rod<00:01:01.230> holder<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and spinning rod holder they also have a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.780 
and spinning rod holder they also have a
fly<00:01:03.090> rod<00:01:03.300> version<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:03.899> looks<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:04.320> similar

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
fly rod version which looks very similar

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.570 
fly rod version which looks very similar
both<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.030> them<00:01:06.560> have<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.890> locking<00:01:08.549> mechanism

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
both of them have a locking mechanism

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
both of them have a locking mechanism
which<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.210> essentially<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> rubber<00:01:10.049> strap<00:01:10.380> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
which is essentially a rubber strap and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280 
which is essentially a rubber strap and
that<00:01:10.680> rubber<00:01:10.950> strap<00:01:11.310> fits<00:01:12.090> over<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:13.049> rod

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that rubber strap fits over your rod

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.440 
that rubber strap fits over your rod
which<00:01:13.950> traps<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.549> real<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.270> rod

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
which traps your real and your rod

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
which traps your real and your rod
inside<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> holder<00:01:16.380> um<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.549> can

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
inside the holder um you know you can

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.850 
inside the holder um you know you can
see<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.150> easy<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.540> operate<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.290> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
see it's pretty easy to operate it you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.670 
see it's pretty easy to operate it you
know<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.939> strong<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.630> shouldn't<00:01:22.500> come

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
know it's it's strong it shouldn't come

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
know it's it's strong it shouldn't come
out<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.979> there<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.060> entirely

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
out of there but it's it's not entirely

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.469 
out of there but it's it's not entirely
a<00:01:24.930> positive<00:01:25.409> locking<00:01:25.650> mechanism<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.909> are

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
a positive locking mechanism so you are

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
a positive locking mechanism so you are
relying<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> rubber<00:01:28.380> strap<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.979> most

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
relying on the rubber strap in most

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.850 
relying on the rubber strap in most
cases<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.750> than<00:01:30.960> enough<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
cases that's more than enough but if you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950 
cases that's more than enough but if you
needed<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:33.270> heavier<00:01:33.600> duty

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
needed to go a little heavier duty

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.510 
needed to go a little heavier duty
Scotty<00:01:34.350> offers<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:34.890> they<00:01:35.009> call<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> power

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
Scotty offers what they call the power

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.910 
Scotty offers what they call the power
lock<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.659> power<00:01:36.900> lock<00:01:37.140> has<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.560> collar

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
lock and the power lock has this collar

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
lock and the power lock has this collar
that<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.610> twists<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.450> positive

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that just twists and it's a positive

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.440 
that just twists and it's a positive
locking<00:01:40.229> collar<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.040> can't<00:01:41.850> come<00:01:42.119> undone

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
locking collar it can't come undone

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.810 
locking collar it can't come undone
without<00:01:42.840> quite<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.860> effort<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.670> can

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
without quite a bit of effort you can

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.240 
without quite a bit of effort you can
see<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.390> rod<00:01:45.630> holders<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> lot<00:01:46.590> larger

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
see that this rod holders a lot larger

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.920 
see that this rod holders a lot larger
than<00:01:47.430> their<00:01:47.549> bait<00:01:47.729> caster<00:01:48.210> or<00:01:48.509> spinning

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
than their bait caster or spinning

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.200 
than their bait caster or spinning
version<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.430> probably<00:01:50.790> more
