00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
training technique called dry firing

training technique called dry firing
what<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.790> why<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.390> should<00:00:06.720> do<00:00:06.870> it<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.200> what

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
what it is why you should do it and what

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:17.060 
what it is why you should do it and what
to<00:00:07.589> focus<00:00:07.830> on<00:00:08.130> when<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.849> dry<00:00:09.059> fire<00:00:15.770> so<00:00:16.770> what<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
to focus on when you dry fire so what is

the process of shooting without actually
having<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.310> live<00:00:23.550> round<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.269> chamber<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
having a live round in the chamber the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.990 
having a live round in the chamber the
effectiveness<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.769> dry<00:00:26.039> firing<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.880> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
effectiveness of dry firing is that it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.970 
effectiveness of dry firing is that it
eliminates<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.019> extra<00:00:28.320> noise<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
eliminates all the extra noise and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.529 
eliminates all the extra noise and
messages<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.789> get<00:00:30.000> when<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.269> fire<00:00:30.480> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
thousands of rounds in a session so I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.600 
thousands of rounds in a session so I

would take my ammunition to the range
and<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.090> every<00:01:06.360> live<00:01:06.630> round<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.229> shot<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.770> shot

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and for every live round I shot I shot

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.719 
and for every live round I shot I shot
three<00:01:08.520> dry<00:01:09.060> fire<00:01:09.299> rounds<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:11.130> actually

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
three dry fire rounds and that actually

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.640 
three dry fire rounds and that actually
has<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> side<00:01:12.210> benefit<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.900> making<00:01:13.080> me<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> better

but<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.119> now<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.659> great<00:02:03.840> place<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
but for now that's a great place to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.889 
but for now that's a great place to
begin<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:05.100> remember<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.299> dry<00:02:06.569> firing

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
begin now remember if you're dry firing

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.650 
begin now remember if you're dry firing
always<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.829> sure<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.099> gun<00:02:08.519> is<00:02:08.700> unloaded<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
always make sure the gun is unloaded and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.630 
always make sure the gun is unloaded and
if<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:09.929> doing<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.319> within<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.679> home<00:02:10.920> make

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
if you're doing it within your home make

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.910 
if you're doing it within your home make
sure<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.970> ammunition<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.140> an<00:02:13.230> entirely

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
sure the ammunition is in an entirely

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.520 
sure the ammunition is in an entirely
separate<00:02:14.580> room<00:02:15.000> from<00:02:15.720> where<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.170> are<00:02:16.200> dry

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
separate room from where you are dry

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.979 
separate room from where you are dry
firing<00:02:16.890> also<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.849> very<00:02:18.180> important<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> note

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
firing also it's very important to note

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.449 
firing also it's very important to note
that<00:02:19.019> with<00:02:19.410> rimfire<00:02:19.920> guns

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
that with rimfire guns

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.059 
that with rimfire guns
you<00:02:20.819> should<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.269> dry<00:02:21.630> fire<00:02:21.900> them<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.739> only

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
you should not dry fire them the only

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.280 
you should not dry fire them the only
reason<00:02:23.430> why<00:02:23.549> I'm<00:02:23.670> able<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.060> dry<00:02:24.360> fire<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.989> gun

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
reason why I'm able to dry fire this gun

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.069 
reason why I'm able to dry fire this gun
is<00:02:25.620> because<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> competition<00:02:27.090> rifle<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
is because of the competition rifle and

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.800 
is because of the competition rifle and
it's<00:02:28.560> made<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.160> able<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.459> dry<00:02:29.700> fire<00:02:30.000> if<00:02:30.599> you

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's made to be able to dry fire if you

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.620 
it's made to be able to dry fire if you
dry<00:02:31.079> fire<00:02:31.380> regular<00:02:31.799> rimfire<00:02:32.250> guns<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:33.269> risk

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
dry fire regular rimfire guns you risk

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.319 
dry fire regular rimfire guns you risk
damaging<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.530> firing<00:02:35.190> pin<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.760> your<00:02:35.790> gun<00:02:36.090> and

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
damaging the firing pin in your gun and

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.030 
damaging the firing pin in your gun and
there<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.959> go<00:02:36.989> that's<00:02:37.500> enough<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:37.980> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
there you go that's enough to get you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.830 
there you go that's enough to get you
started<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.599> matter<00:02:39.780> of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
started now it's just a matter of

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.990 
started now it's just a matter of
actually<00:02:40.110> doing<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.769> dry<00:02:41.370> firing<00:02:41.610> isn't<00:02:41.940> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
actually doing it dry firing isn't the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.819 
actually doing it dry firing isn't the
most<00:02:42.150> exciting<00:02:42.810> thing<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.319> but<00:02:43.709> it

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
most exciting thing to do but it

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.830 
most exciting thing to do but it
definitely<00:02:44.519> is<00:02:44.760> one<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.299> most<00:02:45.480> crucial

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
definitely is one of the most crucial

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.900 
definitely is one of the most crucial
