00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hey, guys, it's okay, I'm Paul. 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.420
 pear tree from Brazil 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.420
 we will talk about animal manure 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.549
 as a form of good fertilization 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 for many years right people have the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.359
 habit of using animal manure be it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.900
 of a good wine be it from a bird be 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:31.800
 he finally equalized as a form of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:34.380
 fertilization is and the practice is that more 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 has spread there that more is practiced 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.540
 It's a tanned manure like that. 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.760
 people take a net out of a 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.840
 with a chicken coop an amount 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.579
 determined of manure and put 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 with a certain location 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.109
 so that the solar incidence reseck nÃ© 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 this material usually from 30 to 60 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.489
 days 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.159
 is this stuff left to the sun 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.380
 often also get rain and then 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.630
 for a certain time it will be dry 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.430
 and then yes it will be used as a fertilizer 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.270
 It can be considered a one goiano 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.479
 fertilizer 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.009
 it may be that a fertilizer of few 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.939
 nutrients a nutrient- poor fertilizer 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.159
 huh 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.640
 another way of using it and if this 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:32.790
 material is composed is after it has 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 passed by compost 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.479
 We here in Brazil work with this 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.479
 composting we have withdrawn we have acquired 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.689
 this large-scale material is this 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.030
 material is that dung is directed 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.180
 to one of our champions where there 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.700
 for 30 days it will not be placed 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.530
 in piles at first did not remember a 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.579
 meter wide and 40 cm 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.439
 height and 10 15 20 meters in length 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.240
 during 30 days this material will be 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.790
 will undergo a process of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.680
 composting the effect of this right that the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.379
 not the ranks nor the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.180
 calls they will be taken from two in 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.150
 two days for the exchange to take place 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.620
 ghazi usually animal manure he is 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.439
 composed of a very large quantity 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.379
 carbon dioxide and through 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.450
 aerobic composting, and through 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.950
 in this turn that we make 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.219
 gas is exchanged between the gas 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.810
 entered this genius came out of carbon and 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.420
 usually the inter also has a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.170
 very large amount of ammonia which is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.329
 a substance that in large 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.900
 amount it may well be so Hiss 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.019
 plant 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.540
 then through from this compost 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.519
 at the end of 30 days 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.919
 this material will be going through this 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.720
 composting process and through this 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.819
 compound in this process 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.099
 we eliminate the natural odor of this 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.109
 compound and potentiate 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.540
 macronutrients present compound month 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.829
 that normally nitrogen phosphorus and 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:13.180
 potassium is good 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.189
 past this, we, as we pack that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.680
 product and we make it available to 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.389
 so that he can use this material in the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.849
 its fullness 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.650
 is not a compound that will offer a 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.409
 full donation 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.409
 Let's be honest, the more he supplies 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.310
 nutritional needs 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.569
 mainly in terms of macacu in the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.609
 body 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.729
 when I spoke between nitrogen 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.889
 potassium and touch focus 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.889
 a big hug and see you soon
