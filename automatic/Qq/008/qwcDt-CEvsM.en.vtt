00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
okay so in second Corinthians 7 verse 1

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.740 
okay so in second Corinthians 7 verse 1
it<00:02:41.680> says<00:02:41.739> therefore<00:02:42.519> having<00:02:42.849> these<00:02:43.180> promises

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
it says therefore having these promises

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.110 
it says therefore having these promises
11<00:02:44.260> let<00:02:44.980> us<00:02:45.099> cleanse<00:02:45.400> ourselves<00:02:45.579> from<00:02:46.000> all

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
11 let us cleanse ourselves from all

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.420 
11 let us cleanse ourselves from all
filthiness<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.680> flesh<00:02:47.799> and<00:02:48.340> spirit

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
filthiness of the flesh and spirit

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.890 
filthiness of the flesh and spirit
perfecting<00:02:49.180> holiness<00:02:49.780> in<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.890> fear<00:02:51.129> of<00:02:51.370> God

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
perfecting holiness in the fear of God

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.670 
perfecting holiness in the fear of God
so<00:02:52.900> what<00:02:53.530> Paul<00:02:54.129> is<00:02:54.189> saying<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.420> we<00:02:55.989> know

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
so what Paul is saying is that we know

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.580 
so what Paul is saying is that we know
Jesus<00:02:57.220> we<00:02:58.000> should<00:02:58.209> be<00:02:58.390> clean<00:02:58.750> like<00:02:58.989> Jesus<00:02:59.439> did

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
Jesus we should be clean like Jesus did

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.180 
Jesus we should be clean like Jesus did

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.230 

and<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.580> sin

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:44.070 

every<00:03:25.240> time<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.660> sin<00:03:41.610> but<00:03:42.610> yeah<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:44.050> know

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
Adam and Eve's and my parents and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.330 
Adam and Eve's and my parents and
there's<00:03:47.980> sin<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.340> our<00:03:48.460> life<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:50.800> that's<00:03:51.040> sin

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
there's sin in our life and that's sin

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.210 
there's sin in our life and that's sin
so<00:03:51.520> why<00:03:51.670> don't<00:03:51.850> you<00:03:52.320> think<00:03:53.320> about<00:03:53.530> your<00:03:53.860> sin

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
so why don't you think about your sin

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.750 
so why don't you think about your sin
and<00:03:54.490> every<00:03:55.240> time<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.660> disobey<00:03:56.050> your<00:03:56.380> parents

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
and every time you disobey your parents

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.820 
and every time you disobey your parents
or<00:03:57.930> you<00:04:00.240> disobey<00:04:01.240> your<00:04:01.360> parents<00:04:01.680> why<00:04:02.680> don't

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
or you disobey your parents why don't

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:14.030 
or you disobey your parents why don't
you<00:04:03.010> stick<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:03.640> drop<00:04:04.590> in<00:04:05.590> your<00:04:05.650> life

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.710 

to<00:04:15.040> do<00:04:15.159> some<00:04:15.370> different<00:04:15.519> colors

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.210 

so<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.840> goal<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.199> this<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:25.740> they<00:04:26.160> could

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
so the goal of this is that they could

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.219 
so the goal of this is that they could
take<00:04:26.520> their<00:04:26.699> time<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.569> looks<00:04:27.750> really<00:04:28.050> nice

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
take their time and it looks really nice

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.200 
take their time and it looks really nice
and<00:04:28.289> cool<00:04:28.710> they<00:04:29.009> could<00:04:29.160> decorate<00:04:29.370> their<00:04:29.880> jar

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
and cool they could decorate their jar

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.830 
and cool they could decorate their jar
but<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.440> idea<00:04:32.069> of<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.310> study<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.940> for<00:04:33.270> them<00:04:33.449> to

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
but the idea of the study is for them to

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.860 
but the idea of the study is for them to
really<00:04:34.680> think<00:04:34.770> about<00:04:35.099> how<00:04:35.490> they<00:04:35.699> sin<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.360> how

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
really think about how they sin and how

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.659 
really think about how they sin and how
it<00:04:37.050> affects<00:04:37.349> their<00:04:37.560> life<00:04:39.979> because<00:04:40.979> sin<00:04:41.430> might

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
it affects their life because sin might

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.059 
it affects their life because sin might
look<00:04:41.940> cool<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.690> surface<00:04:45.889> but<00:04:46.889> it

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
look cool on the surface but it

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:53.830 
look cool on the surface but it
contaminates<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.240> whole<00:04:48.690> body<00:04:50.479> alright<00:04:51.509> so

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
contaminates the whole body alright so

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.760 
contaminates the whole body alright so
weeks<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:55.410> look<00:04:55.620> like<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:57.080> before<00:04:58.080> we<00:04:58.410> accept

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
weeks we look like this before we accept

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.930 
weeks we look like this before we accept
Christ<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.800> when<00:05:01.800> we<00:05:01.889> accept<00:05:02.280> Christ<00:05:02.520> Jesus

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
Christ and when we accept Christ Jesus

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.370 
Christ and when we accept Christ Jesus
comes<00:05:03.389> into<00:05:03.720> our<00:05:03.750> heart<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:05.720> he<00:05:06.720> mixes<00:05:07.199> things

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
comes into our heart and he mixes things

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:18.200 
comes into our heart and he mixes things
up<00:05:07.680> right<00:05:15.979> so<00:05:16.979> if<00:05:17.099> we<00:05:17.250> get<00:05:17.400> stirred<00:05:17.849> up<00:05:18.000> with

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
up right so if we get stirred up with

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.129 
up right so if we get stirred up with
Christ<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:18.810> he<00:05:18.960> abides<00:05:19.349> in<00:05:19.530> us<00:05:20.840> what<00:05:21.840> happens

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
Christ and he abides in us what happens

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.310 
Christ and he abides in us what happens
to<00:05:22.319> our<00:05:22.349> sin<00:05:25.520> becomes<00:05:26.520> lighter<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.320> lighter

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
to our sin becomes lighter and lighter

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.120 
to our sin becomes lighter and lighter
and<00:05:28.770> brighter<00:05:29.570> until<00:05:31.220> heaven<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.509> we<00:05:33.509> become

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
and brighter until heaven and we become

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.790 
and brighter until heaven and we become
yellow<00:05:35.900> clear<00:05:37.159> free<00:05:38.159> of<00:05:38.310> sin<00:05:38.669> like<00:05:39.570> Christ<00:05:39.960> so

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
yellow clear free of sin like Christ so

00:05:40.800 --> 00:06:21.320
