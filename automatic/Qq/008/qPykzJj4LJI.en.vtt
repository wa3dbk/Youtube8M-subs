00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.919 
refused to training trunks this can be a
matter<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.340> perspective<00:02:04.789> as<00:02:05.300> some<00:02:05.660> people

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
matter of perspective as some people

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.680 
matter of perspective as some people
will<00:02:06.020> say<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.350> genius<00:02:06.619> rejecting<00:02:07.220> his<00:02:07.399> son

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
will say the genius rejecting his son

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.479 
will say the genius rejecting his son
and<00:02:08.690> others<00:02:09.320> would<00:02:09.470> say<00:02:09.679> he<00:02:09.979> wanted<00:02:10.220> Trump's

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
and others would say he wanted Trump's

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.309 
and others would say he wanted Trump's
camp

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
camp

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.800 
camp
so<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.340> believe<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.879> event<00:02:13.209> can<00:02:13.420> go<00:02:13.569> either

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
so I believe this event can go either

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.059 
so I believe this event can go either
way<00:02:13.959> but<00:02:14.409> my<00:02:15.310> perspective<00:02:15.810> more<00:02:16.810> on<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.890> G

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
way but my perspective more on to the G

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.020 
way but my perspective more on to the G
the<00:02:18.219> rejecting<00:02:18.790> his<00:02:18.879> own<00:02:19.060> son<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:20.760> he<00:02:21.760> has<00:02:22.000> done

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
the rejecting his own son as he has done

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.420 
the rejecting his own son as he has done
it<00:02:22.599> multiple<00:02:22.870> times<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.680> doesn't<00:02:24.010> even<00:02:24.129> want

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
it multiple times and doesn't even want

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.030 
it multiple times and doesn't even want
to<00:02:24.519> even<00:02:24.879> get<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.120> know<00:02:25.269> his<00:02:25.480> son<00:02:25.859> neither<00:02:26.859> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
to even get to know his son neither a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.710 
to even get to know his son neither a
hyperbolic<00:02:27.609> time<00:02:27.879> chamber<00:02:27.909> one<00:02:28.329> those<00:02:28.540> are

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
hyperbolic time chamber one those are

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.390 
hyperbolic time chamber one those are
the<00:02:28.810> only<00:02:28.930> two<00:02:29.140> people<00:02:29.319> in<00:02:29.560> there<00:02:29.799> more

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
the only two people in there more

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.360 
the only two people in there more
outside<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.109> again<00:02:32.470> another<00:02:33.099> bad

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
outside that so again another bad

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.929 
outside that so again another bad
popcorn<00:02:33.939> the<00:02:34.510> next<00:02:34.840> event<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:35.980> one<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.489> big

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
popcorn the next event is one of the big

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.020 
popcorn the next event is one of the big
ones<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.989> see<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.889> a<00:02:39.069> huge<00:02:39.370> bad<00:02:39.790> father

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
ones that I see as a huge bad father

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.710 
ones that I see as a huge bad father
point<00:02:40.299> FPC<00:02:41.219> when<00:02:42.219> Vegeta<00:02:42.730> allows<00:02:43.120> cells<00:02:43.480> to

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
point FPC when Vegeta allows cells to

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.199 
point FPC when Vegeta allows cells to
absorb<00:02:43.900> number<00:02:44.439> eighteen<00:02:44.879> trunks<00:02:45.879> tries<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
absorb number eighteen trunks tries to

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.610 
absorb number eighteen trunks tries to
stop<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.569> surface<00:02:46.870> either<00:02:46.989> knows<00:02:47.290> that

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
stop the surface either knows that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.559 
stop the surface either knows that
trunks<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.040> stronger<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.819> imperfect<00:02:49.329> self

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
trunks of stronger and imperfect self

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.610 
trunks of stronger and imperfect self
and<00:02:49.870> feels<00:02:50.939> threatened<00:02:51.939> I<00:02:52.269> would<00:02:53.019> say<00:02:53.169> that<00:02:53.439> he

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
and feels threatened I would say that he

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.979 
and feels threatened I would say that he
will<00:02:53.799> kill<00:02:54.040> him<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:55.030> he<00:02:55.060> goes<00:02:55.329> into<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.659> fight

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
will kill him so he goes into a fight

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.349 
will kill him so he goes into a fight
with<00:02:56.139> trunk<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.859> as<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.069> result<00:02:57.459> Belle<00:02:58.000> Cain's

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
with trunk and as a result Belle Cain's

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.960 
with trunk and as a result Belle Cain's
perfect<00:02:58.720> form<00:02:59.169> so<00:02:59.409> again<00:02:59.439> that's<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.189> huge<00:03:00.489> bad

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
perfect form so again that's a huge bad

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.470 
perfect form so again that's a huge bad
father<00:03:01.269> point<00:03:01.659> right<00:03:01.870> there<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.799> far<00:03:03.480> Vegeta

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
father point right there so far Vegeta

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.699 
father point right there so far Vegeta
is<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.689> pretty<00:03:05.049> bad<00:03:05.260> father

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
is a pretty bad father

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.860 
is a pretty bad father
he<00:03:06.010> doesn't<00:03:06.310> care<00:03:06.459> about<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.669> son<00:03:07.000> rejection

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
he doesn't care about a son rejection

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.080 
he doesn't care about a son rejection
even<00:03:08.260> fights<00:03:08.530> him<00:03:08.829> just<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.519> Vegeta<00:03:09.849> can<00:03:10.000> have

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
even fights him just so Vegeta can have

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.170 
even fights him just so Vegeta can have
a<00:03:10.180> good<00:03:10.329> fight<00:03:10.629> but<00:03:11.379> here<00:03:12.129> is<00:03:12.400> where<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:12.879> think

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
a good fight but here is where I think

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.839 
a good fight but here is where I think
the<00:03:13.599> Jeana<00:03:13.810> turns<00:03:14.169> us<00:03:14.349> around<00:03:14.620> once<00:03:15.519> that'll

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
the Jeana turns us around once that'll

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.059 
the Jeana turns us around once that'll

way which is the exact opposite of his
training<00:04:00.739> with<00:04:00.920> beauty<00:04:01.280> trunks<00:04:01.610> and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
training with beauty trunks and

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.640 
training with beauty trunks and
hyperbolic<00:04:02.299> time<00:04:02.540> chamber<00:04:02.569> as<00:04:03.110> he<00:04:03.560> is

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
hyperbolic time chamber as he is

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.650 
hyperbolic time chamber as he is
actually<00:04:03.950> training<00:04:04.430> with<00:04:04.790> his<00:04:04.940> son<00:04:05.209> and

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
actually training with his son and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.289 
actually training with his son and
helping<00:04:05.959> him<00:04:06.079> get<00:04:06.230> stronger<00:04:06.790> although<00:04:07.790> in<00:04:08.060> a

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
helping him get stronger although in a

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.559 
helping him get stronger although in a
tough<00:04:08.599> way<00:04:08.900> as<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:10.370> gia<00:04:10.610> is<00:04:10.790> always<00:04:11.299> the

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
tough way as the gia is always the

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.900 
tough way as the gia is always the
temple<00:04:11.930> as<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.290> all<00:04:12.379> know<00:04:12.590> that<00:04:12.799> but<00:04:13.340> he<00:04:13.760> was

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
temple as you all know that but he was

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.550 
temple as you all know that but he was
still<00:04:14.120> there<00:04:14.329> so<00:04:14.720> I<00:04:14.750> think<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:16.209> their<00:04:17.560> next

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
still there so I think that their next

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.650 
still there so I think that their next
event<00:04:18.739> is<00:04:19.010> something<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.459> no<00:04:19.760> Dragon<00:04:20.329> Ball<00:04:20.450> Z

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
event is something that no Dragon Ball Z

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.159 
event is something that no Dragon Ball Z
fans<00:04:20.989> will<00:04:21.769> ever<00:04:22.100> miss<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.729> it's<00:04:23.060> Vegeta<00:04:23.840> when

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
fans will ever miss and it's Vegeta when

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.080 
fans will ever miss and it's Vegeta when
he<00:04:24.260> sacrificed<00:04:24.830> himself<00:04:25.010> against<00:04:25.520> booth

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
he sacrificed himself against booth

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.510 
he sacrificed himself against booth
prior<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.169> explosion<00:04:27.500> though<00:04:28.010> Vegeta

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
prior to the explosion though Vegeta

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.310 
prior to the explosion though Vegeta
told<00:04:28.910> trunks<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.419> he<00:04:29.510> never<00:04:29.720> hugged<00:04:30.050> him<00:04:30.200> as

take<00:05:13.770> away<00:05:14.010> his<00:05:14.160> allows<00:05:14.660> even<00:05:15.660> if<00:05:15.900> he<00:05:16.139> doesn't

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
take away his allows even if he doesn't

join<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.070> tournament<00:05:17.220> although<00:05:17.880> it's<00:05:18.300> kind

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
join the tournament although it's kind

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.390 
join the tournament although it's kind
of<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.630> small<00:05:18.990> scene<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:20.010> can<00:05:20.250> be

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
of a small scene that it can be

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.279 
of a small scene that it can be
overlooked<00:05:20.880> in<00:05:21.030> ways<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.510> do<00:05:21.570> think<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.139> this

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
overlooked in ways I do think that this

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.810 
overlooked in ways I do think that this
confirms<00:05:23.070> that<00:05:23.340> in<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:24.240> 10<00:05:24.720> years<00:05:25.099> in<00:05:26.099> the<00:05:26.340> 10

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
confirms that in the 10 years in the 10

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.960 
confirms that in the 10 years in the 10
plus<00:05:27.210> years<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:28.370> Vegeta<00:05:29.370> was<00:05:29.550> being<00:05:29.729> a<00:05:29.789> bit

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
plus years that Vegeta was being a bit

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.480 
plus years that Vegeta was being a bit
father<00:05:30.210> figure<00:05:30.660> to<00:05:30.900> trump<00:05:31.199> so<00:05:31.800> another<00:05:32.250> good

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
father figure to trump so another good

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.600 
father figure to trump so another good
father<00:05:32.789> point<00:05:33.509> right<00:05:33.750> there<00:05:33.960> so<00:05:34.770> in<00:05:35.009> the<00:05:35.190> end<00:05:35.340> I

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
father point right there so in the end I

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.480 
father point right there so in the end I
do<00:05:35.669> think<00:05:36.270> that<00:05:36.419> Vegeta<00:05:36.900> has<00:05:37.740> started<00:05:38.310> out<00:05:38.460> a

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
do think that Vegeta has started out a

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.170 
do think that Vegeta has started out a
pretty<00:05:39.000> terrible<00:05:39.990> father<00:05:40.289> and<00:05:40.650> he<00:05:41.550> grew<00:05:41.849> fond

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
pretty terrible father and he grew fond

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.640 
pretty terrible father and he grew fond
of<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.449> Sun<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:42.900> it<00:05:42.990> was<00:05:43.020> a<00:05:43.139> good<00:05:43.440> father

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
of the Sun and it was a good father

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.339 
of the Sun and it was a good father
which<00:05:44.370> is<00:05:44.539> pretty<00:05:45.539> straightforward

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
which is pretty straightforward

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.310 
which is pretty straightforward
unlike<00:05:46.979> Goku<00:05:47.520> who<00:05:47.580> has<00:05:47.849> a<00:05:47.880> lot<00:05:48.210> of<00:05:48.240> mixed<00:05:49.050> bags

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
unlike Goku who has a lot of mixed bags

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.339 
unlike Goku who has a lot of mixed bags
and<00:05:49.849> why<00:05:50.849> good<00:05:51.240> father<00:05:51.570> moment<00:05:51.990> didn't<00:05:52.169> want

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
and why good father moment didn't want

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:53.920 
and why good father moment didn't want
bad

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
bad

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.700 
bad
so<00:05:54.500> it's<00:05:55.430> kind<00:05:55.940> of<00:05:56.000> like<00:05:56.380> different<00:05:57.380> than<00:05:57.530> that

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
so it's kind of like different than that

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.370 
so it's kind of like different than that
so<00:05:58.400> I<00:05:58.699> hope<00:05:59.000> you<00:05:59.150> liked<00:05:59.300> this<00:05:59.419> video<00:05:59.570> and<00:05:59.930> share
