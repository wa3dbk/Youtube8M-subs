there<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> few<00:01:21.360> floors<00:01:21.689> where<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> devil

past<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.400> womb<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.360> stuck

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
past the womb so don't get stuck

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.760 
past the womb so don't get stuck
