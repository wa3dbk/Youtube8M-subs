 the conquista farm of ipanema coffees 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.710
 today on the subject rearing and renovation 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.090
 of coffee plants on our farm the 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:37.809
 I tell you whole and show you 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:39.460
 So you just go now time's we 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.160
 are now here on the first part 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.280
 our tour on the subject of coffee renewal 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.199
 and renovating how to get around me 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.140
 The trees you see here are visible 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.600
 no longer as experienced on the rest 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.300
 that means you live a few days ago 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.260
 Here from a bulldozer and bread time 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.199
 and flattened 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 The goal is that you look for one 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.050
 certain time about 30 years the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.369
 Trees renews the yield of the trees 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.020
 bring trees is then not so 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.310
 high and it's worth it sometime 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.310
 to think about the renovation 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.280
 It was harvested here two weeks ago 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.200
 Now the wood is collected together 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.970
 and for our processing plant 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.110
 specially used for the dryers 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.700
 to dry our cafes and in the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.030
 next week this area will be here 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.690
 then prepared in and four five 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.540
 months the new café saplings here 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.820
 to bring out and where these are made 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.350
 be bred or bred 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 Let's take a look at next 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.039
 So now arrived on the nursery 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.220
 as you can see it all 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.260
 unromantisch out of you that we 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.140
 currently have the brazilian winter 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.900
 that at the beginning of june and until here the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.220
 first leaves and the first trees 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.410
 you can see is a little bit 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.350
 last, because at the end of the coffee 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:37.560
 seedlings only on the fields beginning 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:39.420
 december is upset and you have to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.459
 now the breeding of coffee seedlings 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.610
 Here we introduce one here 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.590
 whole set of ratios each 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.580
 a relationship is in the end for a 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.850
 café or seedlings will be one 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.340
 coffee bean planted here and out 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.380
 a coffee beans are two triebel 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.989
 but in the end we only need a café 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.690
 tree which is why 1 is filed again 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.489
 so that the whole energy content 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.040
 seedling a café operation can go 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.959
 the whole thing will be over a whole 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.530
 period of about 34 months 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.750
 done 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.560
 that is now being 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.620
 planted and until december 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.660
 maybe the end of november will be the 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.510
 coffee here on the nursery we around 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.130
 We tend to look after each other and then 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.150
 fielded and then there 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.150
 to be implanted 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.940
 so we have seen like coffee fields 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.850
 to be cut down we have seen the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.430
 nursery new seedlings are bred 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.620
 now this process of renovation 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.260
 to complete it once we are now 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.720
 on a field that just before one 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.650
 half year with new café saplings 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.360
 was planted 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.350
 and here we are going to take a look now 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.810
 on here now coffee trees as I said 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.120
 we have about half a year old 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.400
 The size fits quite well 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.799
 Also the color is very full that's all 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.230
 wonderful that we are very satisfied 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.150
 as a special feature we still have here 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.470
 this field an irrigation system that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.230
 you can see here in the form of these hoses 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.600
 These hoses have small holes like that 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.550
 that we have water and possibly also 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.430
 Fertilizer directly to the individual 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.500
 coffee plants can give that is for 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.540
 one in contrast to one 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.460
 Irrigation system very gentle on water 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.370
 we use it with very little water and 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.380
 so can the coffee farmers optimally 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.100
 support that he has good earnings on 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.100
 ends 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.000
 the area you see here behind me and 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.620
 around me it looks like 100 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.140
 hectare big now turns natural 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.400
 the question how many cafés have a line 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.610
 we actually transplanted here 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.150
 There are a total of 350,000 pieces so 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.860
 around 3500 per hectare you can still see 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.230
 However, most of these little acts 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.020
 only as a windbreak around the currently still 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.320
 small cafe trees protect 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.330
 the café trees need about now 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.800
 Two years to get your first production 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.680
 then we really shed it 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.350
 but it could export to one 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.150
 coffee tree really active and in the 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:44.350
 full production is there in total 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:46.960
 five years takes that it was on the subject 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.070
 Rearing and renewing plants 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.500
 on a coffee break 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.760
 I hope you liked it many 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.760
 Greetings from based and see you soon
