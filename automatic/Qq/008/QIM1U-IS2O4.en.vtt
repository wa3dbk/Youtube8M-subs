00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
had to be on the better waves of that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.399 
had to be on the better waves of that
he'd<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.250> kind<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.330> decided<00:02:09.659> to<00:02:10.019> get<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
he'd and I kind of decided to get it

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.500 
he'd and I kind of decided to get it
easy<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.519> start<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:11.970> heat<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.450> just

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
easy at the start of the heat and just

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.110 
easy at the start of the heat and just
get<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> few<00:02:13.230> scores<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.220> knew<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> way<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.819> was

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
get a few scores I I knew the way I was

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.729 
get a few scores I I knew the way I was
taking<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.599> going<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.810> offer<00:02:15.900> huge<00:02:16.319> scores

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
taking was going to offer huge scores

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.589 
taking was going to offer huge scores
but<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.310> just<00:02:17.640> wanted<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.030> get<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.299> board

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
but I just wanted to get on the board

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.690 
but I just wanted to get on the board
with<00:02:18.840> two<00:02:19.049> ways<00:02:19.230> because<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.680> knew<00:02:19.890> just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
with two ways because I knew just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.550 
with two ways because I knew just
getting<00:02:20.970> two<00:02:21.180> ways<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.629> there<00:02:21.689> was

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
getting two ways out there was

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.740 
getting two ways out there was
was<00:02:22.739> gonna<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.099> difficult<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.209> then<00:02:24.630> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
was gonna be difficult and and then I

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.809 
was gonna be difficult and and then I
after<00:02:25.440> I've<00:02:25.709> got<00:02:25.860> those<00:02:26.040> I'd<00:02:26.280> focus<00:02:26.640> on

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
after I've got those I'd focus on

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.330 
after I've got those I'd focus on
building<00:02:27.390> bigger<00:02:27.989> scores<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:29.190> was<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
building bigger scores and it was a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.070 
building bigger scores and it was a
tight<00:02:29.610> heat'll<00:02:30.030> all<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.420> way<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.900> last

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
tight heat'll all the way up to the last

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.800 
tight heat'll all the way up to the last
minute<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.709> then<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:31.890> finally<00:02:32.310> dragged<00:02:32.790> one<00:02:33.690> of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
minute and then I finally dragged one of

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.500 
minute and then I finally dragged one of
those<00:02:34.550> incredible<00:02:35.550> Peaks<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.030> were<00:02:36.180> coming

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
those incredible Peaks that were coming

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.699 
those incredible Peaks that were coming
through<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:38.280> got<00:02:38.459> me<00:02:38.580> through<00:02:38.760> easily

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
through and and it got me through easily

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.410 
through and and it got me through easily
like<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.890> points<00:02:41.340> but<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.940> was<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> pretty<00:02:42.330> tough

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
like on points but it was a pretty tough

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.630 
like on points but it was a pretty tough
heat<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.290> my<00:02:43.620> next<00:02:43.680> tip<00:02:43.980> was<00:02:44.160> up<00:02:44.340> against

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
heat then my next tip was up against

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.360 
heat then my next tip was up against
Ryan<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.239> yeah<00:02:45.720> he<00:02:46.050> goes<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.650> one<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.069> he

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
Ryan and yeah he goes that one and he

Ryan and yeah he goes that one and he
got<00:02:47.880> he<00:02:48.239> got<00:02:48.269> through<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.780> was<00:02:48.930> pretty

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
got he got through it was pretty

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.400

devastating<00:02:49.739> not<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.010> make<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:51.959> was<00:02:52.110> kind

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
devastating not to make it it was kind

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.220

waves<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.280> last<00:03:05.489> day<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:06.030> was<00:03:06.180> pumping<00:03:06.600> but

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
waves I the last day it was pumping but

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.140 
waves I the last day it was pumping but
I<00:03:06.780> never<00:03:07.080> really<00:03:07.380> felt<00:03:07.620> like<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.920> got<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.430> chance

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
I never really felt like I got a chance

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.350 
I never really felt like I got a chance
to<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:10.260> get<00:03:10.440> get<00:03:11.190> on<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.370> roll<00:03:11.640> or<00:03:11.849> get<00:03:12.030> some<00:03:12.209> good

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
to to get get on a roll or get some good

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.000 
to to get get on a roll or get some good
ones<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.690> know<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.110> seemed<00:03:13.470> like<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> lot<00:03:13.980> of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
ones you know it seemed like a lot of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.490 
ones you know it seemed like a lot of
luck<00:03:14.220> was<00:03:14.880> going<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:15.360> person's<00:03:15.810> way<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.319> day

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
luck was going one person's way that day

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.339 
luck was going one person's way that day
and<00:03:16.819> yeah<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:18.060> was<00:03:18.180> kind<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.569> tricky

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
and yeah it was kind of tricky

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.580 
and yeah it was kind of tricky
conditions<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:21.180> at<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.080> end<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.470> know

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
conditions and but at the end you know

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.400 
conditions and but at the end you know
like<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.310> cream<00:03:23.880> always<00:03:24.450> rises<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:25.230> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
like the the cream always rises to the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.550 
like the the cream always rises to the
top<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.310> can't<00:03:27.090> take<00:03:27.269> away<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:28.140> wins<00:03:28.350> and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
top so you can't take away the wins and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.239 
top so you can't take away the wins and
losses<00:03:28.680> from<00:03:29.100> anyone<00:03:29.519> really<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:29.940> seems
