00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.830
 in guys are new tuto and I'm going 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.290
 to show how to control your android 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.559
 completely through your pc 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.770
 ok the first thing we need is 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.540
 to download 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.540
 in time bnc 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.930
 I've already talked a lot about this program 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.550
 in previous videos 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.250
 we all load here 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.250
 and let's see here that we install 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.550
 once loaded the poplars to zero 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.340
 run 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.340
 and next to everything and be installed 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:57.719
 very good now what we need 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.719
 it would be because it would be the plc server 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.610
 in reserve 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.610
 for android 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.710
 Well that you will search the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.310
 tina play store 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.040
 none of these are I going to show 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.400
 direct 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.850
 but prove from here is this 20 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.850
 it is noted 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.539
 to download them let's go to the play 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.539
 history 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.570
 and we look for it as we see in being 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.570
 good 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.320
 and so we will look like that end 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.400
 we click on install 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.220
 we see some catches of 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.220
 screen 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.670
 of how is the operation here we 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.180
 shows what a button would be 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.770
 what it says today and off 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.380
 when we are going to look us 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.620
 simply angry and we will appear 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.620
 here below the ip address that is here 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.739
 and we have dots at the end and then he says 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.180
 four other numbers all that goes around 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.180
 that's going to put the program ok 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.730
 very well 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.299
 there will be no times tared 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 we go back to the computer 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.580
 and we opened what would be 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.400
 the PDC and well I'm here 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.770
 and we will see here the address of 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.650
 surgeries of the moment that direction the 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.080
 they will get precisely from their place 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.280
 when they open their server vein here they 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.280
 the address appears ok 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.710
 here it does not appear that the copy or rather 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.110
 they write wait for her here 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.050
 read on connect 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.480
 and connect 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.480
 and disappear automatically is like that 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.209
 for your android everything you see 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.810
 on your android screen they will be able to 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.510
 see on the pc an example for example to the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.390
 time to write messages let's see 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.180
 the messages and well for example here 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.900
 we can write messages very comfortable 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.900
 one 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.210
 Ray 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.890
 very quickly fly here for tata 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.160
 tata x number 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.170
 that is an example for 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.740
 to see what really works and 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.740
 it is very useful 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.489
 otherwise it would be to pass tutorials 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.489
 just like me 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.920
 to make calls they also serve good 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.050
 you can give it the utility that 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.810
 you like them to need 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.709
 ok but this is the way to be able 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.750
 achieve it 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.480
 and so we will have the final result 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.480
 the father does not and in this way you can 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.260
 completely control your android 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.260
 totally at your whim 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.490
 and well that would be all right 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.490
 actively the windows if they want 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.770
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.960
 tutorial and any questions or comments 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.849
 so do not hesitate to say it they had 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.429
 received and answered of course 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.099
 and if they have any suggestions about not 

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:58.709
 I know if there have to be any tutorials 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:04.219
 about any application or topic 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:04.219
 I will also gladly do it good
