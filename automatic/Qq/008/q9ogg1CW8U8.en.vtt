00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
really aimed at anything just aim it in

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.379 
really aimed at anything just aim it in
the<00:04:15.160> general<00:04:15.430> direction<00:04:15.459> where<00:04:16.239> they're

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
the general direction where they're

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.680 
the general direction where they're
spawning<00:04:16.720> or<00:04:17.079> whatever<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:18.419> just<00:04:19.419> hope

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
spawning or whatever and just just hope

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.710 
spawning or whatever and just just hope
your<00:04:19.930> missiles<00:04:20.680> from<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.890> sky<00:04:21.010> will<00:04:21.729> somehow

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
your missiles from the sky will somehow

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.230 
your missiles from the sky will somehow
get<00:04:23.200> somebody

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
get somebody

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.620 
get somebody
perfect<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.810> also<00:04:28.650> when<00:04:29.220> you're<00:04:29.310> sniping

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
perfect so also when you're sniping

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.779 
perfect so also when you're sniping
obviously<00:04:30.630> keep<00:04:31.020> your<00:04:31.169> distance<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.550> key

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
obviously keep your distance that is key

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.430 
obviously keep your distance that is key
in<00:04:32.970> this<00:04:33.060> game<00:04:33.180> there's<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.810> lot<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.139> players

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
in this game there's a lot of players

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.890 
in this game there's a lot of players
and<00:04:34.919> it's<00:04:35.880> really<00:04:36.120> hard<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.509> kind<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.720> keep

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
and it's really hard to kind of keep

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.050 
and it's really hard to kind of keep
track<00:04:37.289> of<00:04:37.319> everybody<00:04:38.130> because<00:04:38.400> people<00:04:39.000> will

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
track of everybody because people will

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.610 
track of everybody because people will
just<00:04:39.270> sneak<00:04:39.479> around<00:04:39.660> all<00:04:40.139> different<00:04:40.560> angles

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
just sneak around all different angles

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.230 
just sneak around all different angles
and<00:04:40.949> directions<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.699> you<00:04:41.910> know<00:04:42.030> there's

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
and directions and you know there's

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.629 
and directions and you know there's
tanks<00:04:42.630> obviously<00:04:43.139> and<00:04:43.440> those<00:04:43.650> UAV<00:04:44.099> drones<00:04:44.430> can

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
tanks obviously and those UAV drones can

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.520 
tanks obviously and those UAV drones can
be<00:04:44.669> pretty<00:04:44.910> nasty<00:04:45.000> if<00:04:45.960> people<00:04:46.259> know<00:04:46.380> how<00:04:46.500> to

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
be pretty nasty if people know how to

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.670 
be pretty nasty if people know how to
fly<00:04:46.830> them<00:04:47.039> so<00:04:47.789> as<00:04:48.030> long<00:04:48.120> as<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.389> can<00:04:48.539> just<00:04:48.720> try

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
fly them so as long as you can just try

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.240 
fly them so as long as you can just try
to<00:04:49.789> stay<00:04:50.789> as<00:04:51.330> far<00:04:52.139> away<00:04:52.199> as<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.770> feel

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
to stay as far away as you feel

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.200 
to stay as far away as you feel
comfortable<00:04:53.280> with<00:04:54.259> when<00:04:55.259> shooting<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.970> will

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
for a long period of time you just have

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.089 
for a long period of time you just have
you<00:05:06.630> know<00:05:06.659> a<00:05:06.750> better<00:05:07.020> chance<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.590> take<00:05:07.740> out

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
you know a better chance to take out

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.430 
you know a better chance to take out
people<00:05:08.460> rather<00:05:08.639> than<00:05:08.789> trying<00:05:09.659> to<00:05:09.750> run<00:05:09.990> up<00:05:10.199> and

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
people rather than trying to run up and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.820 
people rather than trying to run up and
pull<00:05:10.949> some<00:05:11.190> Yahoo<00:05:11.430> shit<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.199> dying<00:05:13.199> and<00:05:13.530> then

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
pull some Yahoo shit and dying and then

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.339 
pull some Yahoo shit and dying and then
you<00:05:13.949> have<00:05:14.069> to<00:05:14.220> spend<00:05:14.520> time<00:05:15.360> trying<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.960> respond

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
you have to spend time trying to respond

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.499 
you have to spend time trying to respond
with<00:05:16.620> your<00:05:16.710> teammates<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.460> then<00:05:17.639> comes<00:05:18.270> the

when you respawn I mean a lot of times I
just<00:05:43.020> spawn<00:05:43.199> randomly<00:05:43.409> just<00:05:44.009> because<00:05:44.310> I<00:05:44.340> don't

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
just spawn randomly just because I don't

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.189 
just spawn randomly just because I don't
really<00:05:44.669> want<00:05:44.880> to<00:05:44.969> risk<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.270> unless<00:05:45.930> I'm<00:05:46.110> with

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
really want to risk it unless I'm with

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.870 
really want to risk it unless I'm with
friends<00:05:46.680> or<00:05:46.740> somebody<00:05:47.009> I<00:05:47.070> know<00:05:47.190> who's<00:05:47.490> legit

or a sniper who has a good position you

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.969 
or a sniper who has a good position you
know<00:05:50.729> I'll<00:05:51.030> tend<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.509> just<00:05:52.229> spawn<00:05:52.740> randomly

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
know I'll tend to just spawn randomly

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.850 
know I'll tend to just spawn randomly
and<00:05:53.370> run<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.699> my<00:05:53.819> spot<00:05:54.169> which<00:05:55.169> can<00:05:55.440> get<00:05:55.590> kind<00:05:55.800> of

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
and run to my spot which can get kind of

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.709 
and run to my spot which can get kind of
annoying<00:05:55.979> if<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.490> you<00:05:56.940> know<00:05:56.969> died<00:05:57.449> a<00:05:57.479> couple

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
annoying if you you know died a couple
