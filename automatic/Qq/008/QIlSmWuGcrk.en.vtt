00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.330 

this<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:23.900> Hayfield<00:00:24.230> that<00:00:24.529> we<00:00:24.650> planted

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
this is the Hayfield that we planted

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.480 
this is the Hayfield that we planted
this<00:00:25.460> spring<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:26.650> we<00:00:27.650> are<00:00:27.769> having<00:00:28.130> to<00:00:28.220> cut<00:00:28.250> it

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
this spring and we are having to cut it

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.510 
this spring and we are having to cut it
right<00:00:28.640> now<00:00:28.759> because<00:00:29.029> the<00:00:29.390> oats<00:00:29.599> are<00:00:30.520> starting

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
right now because the oats are starting

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.439 
right now because the oats are starting
to<00:00:31.789> turn<00:00:32.350> brown<00:00:33.350> instead<00:00:34.309> of<00:00:34.430> green<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:35.090> we

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
to turn brown instead of green and we

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.889 
to turn brown instead of green and we
need<00:00:35.660> those<00:00:35.870> oat<00:00:36.199> seeds<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.949> stay<00:00:37.220> inside

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
need those oat seeds to stay inside

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.110 
need those oat seeds to stay inside
that's<00:00:38.899> gonna<00:00:39.079> allow<00:00:39.320> us<00:00:39.559> to<00:00:40.010> be<00:00:40.129> able<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.430> cut

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
that's gonna allow us to be able to cut

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.780 
that's gonna allow us to be able to cut
back<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.780> green<00:00:42.079> that<00:00:42.650> we're<00:00:42.829> feeding<00:00:43.040> our

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
back the green that we're feeding our

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.140 
back the green that we're feeding our
animals<00:00:44.360> in<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.839> barn<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.260> livestock

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
animals in the barn the livestock

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.270 
animals in the barn the livestock
because<00:00:47.150> they'll<00:00:47.420> be<00:00:47.600> getting<00:00:47.809> oats<00:00:48.260> mixed<00:00:49.070> in

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
because they'll be getting oats mixed in

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.250 
because they'll be getting oats mixed in
with<00:00:49.519> their<00:00:49.760> hay<00:00:54.640> today<00:00:55.640> he<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.119> using<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.689> 16

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.640 

it's<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.860> horribly<00:01:16.220> hot<00:01:16.460> day<00:01:16.700> for<00:01:16.730> cutting<00:01:17.240> hay

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
it's a horribly hot day for cutting hay

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.840 
it's a horribly hot day for cutting hay
but<00:01:18.650> as<00:01:18.770> far<00:01:18.980> as<00:01:19.010> I<00:01:19.220> can<00:01:19.280> see<00:01:19.610> when<00:01:19.850> is<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.120> not

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
but as far as I can see when is it not

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.830 
but as far as I can see when is it not
I've<00:01:22.850> never<00:01:23.120> seen<00:01:25.030> farmers<00:01:26.030> cutting<00:01:26.630> when<00:01:26.750> it

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
I've never seen farmers cutting when it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.320 
I've never seen farmers cutting when it
was<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.990> cool<00:01:27.230> day<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.820> seems<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.240> be

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
was a cool day and it seems to be

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.180 
was a cool day and it seems to be
because<00:01:29.660> you<00:01:29.840> always<00:01:30.050> want<00:01:30.410> to<00:01:30.530> get<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.830> hay

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
because you always want to get the hay

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.990 
because you always want to get the hay

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
dry like you can see this row here is

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.160 
dry like you can see this row here is
pretty<00:01:35.540> green<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:37.550> was<00:01:37.670> cut<00:01:37.850> today<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.480> this

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:05.899 

hey<00:01:56.789> honey

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.320 

and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.540> had<00:02:06.689> said<00:02:06.869> earlier<00:02:07.079> when<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.649> showed<00:02:08.330> in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
and I had said earlier when I showed in

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.839 
and I had said earlier when I showed in
the<00:02:09.750> other<00:02:09.780> video<00:02:10.259> about<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:11.459> having<00:02:11.790> enough

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the other video about not having enough

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.860 
the other video about not having enough
hydraulic<00:02:12.510> power<00:02:13.040> he<00:02:14.040> corrected<00:02:14.550> me<00:02:14.840> when<00:02:15.840> I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
hydraulic power he corrected me when I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.229 
hydraulic power he corrected me when I
asked<00:02:16.230> him<00:02:16.290> about<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.590> today<00:02:16.849> it's<00:02:17.849> not<00:02:18.060> that

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
asked him about it today it's not that

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.940 
asked him about it today it's not that
it<00:02:18.360> doesn't<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.780> enough<00:02:18.810> hydraulic<00:02:19.709> power

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
it doesn't have enough hydraulic power

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.220 
it doesn't have enough hydraulic power
it's<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.849> such<00:02:21.060> an<00:02:21.239> old<00:02:21.420> tractor<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.110> it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
it's just such an old tractor that it

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.870 
it's just such an old tractor that it
doesn't<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.680> all<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.010> extra<00:02:23.280> hydraulic

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
doesn't have all the extra hydraulic

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.759 
doesn't have all the extra hydraulic
settings<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.489> go<00:02:26.610> up<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.060> down<00:02:27.470> but<00:02:28.470> I

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
settings so it can go up and down but I

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.920 
settings so it can go up and down but I
guess<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.130> don't<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> hydraulic<00:02:29.930> option

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
guess we don't have the hydraulic option

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.720 
guess we don't have the hydraulic option
for<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.380> go<00:02:31.500> sideways<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.310> able<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.550> pull

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
for it to go sideways to be able to pull

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.030 
for it to go sideways to be able to pull
it<00:02:32.849> back<00:02:32.970> where<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.450> supposed<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.720> go

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:03:18.330 

and<00:02:38.250> that's<00:02:38.760> why<00:02:38.939> he's<00:02:39.299> cutting<00:02:39.629> off<00:02:39.750> that

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.150 

we<00:03:18.849> are<00:03:18.910> using<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.390> 7:20<00:03:20.200> time<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:21.040> your
