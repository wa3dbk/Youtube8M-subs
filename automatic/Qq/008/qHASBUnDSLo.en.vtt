00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
 Hello, another non-working 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.410
 video card in our service center 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.210
 this case is asus gtx560 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.630
 video card is not fully defined 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.369
 In system more precisely motherboard 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.800
 indicates that the video as 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.800
 missing such specific sands 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.850
 but when we are about the diagnosed card 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.340
 diagnostics started visual inspection 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:35.180
 there was a banal problem 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.110
 I think that if we eliminate the card 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.960
 earn now and show where 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.970
 There is a problem on the card 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.870
 capacitor block zlit psi line 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.710
 express now I'll move 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 if you look closely you will notice that two 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.540
 capacitors are there now I see 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:03.009
 I will not try them with a pencil 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:08.649
 restore well and I think we'll see 

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:12.380
 while I'm going to change capacitors, I sealed 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.240
 2 missing capacitors there still 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.460
 it seemed to be torn off the track thought one 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.009
 the capacitor is a little out of the way and 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.070
 think can be seen in the video but it is not 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.580
 okay trying to include 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.580
 card 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.240
 food I always leave the sim card so 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.159
 how does he help too 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.950
 troubleshooting video cards do not 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:02:03.429
 I know that I filmed there I will correct the map 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:03.429
 drove 122 but passed the monitor lit up 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:12.130
 The picture appeared and all such 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.430
 light repairs unfortunately come across 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.410
 very rarely however does not happen and see 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.360
 if you suddenly cleaned your system 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.200
 block rb or 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.390
 preassembled stormy 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.489
 video card 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.230
 then you meet your motherboard 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.630
 signals that the video card is not 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.549
 first discovered of course 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.739
 try and just pull and paste 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.380
 back to the slot maybe you with some 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.010
 small distortions left but also 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.650
 It is possible that you could like the owner 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.690
 This video card knock down these small 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.829
 smd capacitors which are in 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.970
 psi express 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.819
 if you whipped the video card stops 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.049
 I hope to determine the system 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.049
 useful good
