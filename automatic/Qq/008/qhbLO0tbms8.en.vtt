00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
trees and I'm going to use a sponge for

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.849 
trees and I'm going to use a sponge for
that<00:00:21.449> now<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.439> an<00:00:22.590> ordinary

we<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.680> we<00:00:28.680> put<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> water<00:00:30.710> make<00:00:31.710> it

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
we do is we put it in the water make it

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.799 
we do is we put it in the water make it
fairly<00:00:32.640> fairly<00:00:33.149> wet<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> pick<00:00:34.410> up

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
fairly fairly wet I'm going to pick up

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.220 
fairly fairly wet I'm going to pick up
some<00:00:36.809> blue<00:00:37.489> work<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.730> into<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> sponge<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
some blue work that into the sponge and

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.400 
some blue work that into the sponge and
then<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.610> some<00:00:41.879> pale<00:00:42.120> olive<00:00:42.480> green<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
then this is some pale olive green and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.619 
then this is some pale olive green and
add<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> nice<00:00:44.160> bluish<00:00:44.629> pale

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
add that so it's a nice bluish pale

add that so it's a nice bluish pale
green<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:49.530> start<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> sponge<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
green you start here with the sponge and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.150 
green you start here with the sponge and
what<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:51.989> doing<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.320> tapping<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
what I'm doing is just tapping the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.139 
what I'm doing is just tapping the
sponge<00:00:53.430> onto<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.850> surface<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
sponge onto the surface you can see you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
sponge onto the surface you can see you
get<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.480> lovely<00:00:57.960> texture<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.430> that's<00:00:59.579> why

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
get this lovely texture and that's why

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700 
get this lovely texture and that's why
it's<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.180> important<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.500> very

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it's so important to have a very very

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.510 
it's so important to have a very very
coarse<00:01:02.100> sponge<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.850> blueish<00:01:06.450> green

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
coarse sponge so it's a blueish green

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.090 
coarse sponge so it's a blueish green
background<00:01:09.470> just<00:01:10.470> change<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> color

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
background just change the color

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.420 
background just change the color
slightly<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.640> add<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.000> bit<00:01:12.119> more<00:01:13.430> pale

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
slightly to add a little bit more pale

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.609 
slightly to add a little bit more pale

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
olive green bring that in was the bottom

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.020 
olive green bring that in was the bottom
of<00:01:19.710> these<00:01:19.830> trees<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.460> comes<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:23.030> towards

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
of these trees and comes down towards

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.320 
of these trees and comes down towards
the<00:01:24.150> stream<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.520> what<00:01:26.520> I'm<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.060> is

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the stream and what I'm going to do is

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.160 
the stream and what I'm going to do is
just<00:01:27.630> block<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.250> hole<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
just block in the hole of this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.830 
just block in the hole of this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
background of the wood paint over the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.100 
background of the wood paint over the
silver<00:01:34.079> birches<00:01:35.630> don't<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> worry<00:01:37.020> about

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
silver birches don't have to worry about

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.230 
silver birches don't have to worry about
the<00:01:37.290> trees<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.740> masking<00:01:38.549> fluid<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.939> taking

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the trees as masking fluid is taking

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.980 
the trees as masking fluid is taking
care<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:40.939> you<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.119> slightly<00:01:42.659> darker

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
care of that you have a slightly darker

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.690 
care of that you have a slightly darker
color<00:01:43.229> I've<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.740> added<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.460> bit<00:01:44.579> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
color I've just added a little bit of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.920 
color I've just added a little bit of
hookers<00:01:45.149> green<00:01:45.920> into<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:48.450> sponge

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
hookers green into the sponge

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
hookers green into the sponge
bring<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> along<00:01:49.860> towards<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> large<00:01:51.119> tree

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
bring that along towards the large tree

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.380 
bring that along towards the large tree
here<00:01:52.579> take<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.869> up<00:01:55.909> towards<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> top<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
here take that up towards the top of the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.150 
here take that up towards the top of the
painting<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.909> then<00:01:59.909> bring<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.240> over

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.430 

over<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.310> top<00:02:04.640> of<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.880> stream<00:02:05.210> back<00:02:06.200> down

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
over the top of the stream back down

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.410 
over the top of the stream back down
again<00:02:06.770> just<00:02:07.090> fill<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:10.090> change<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.210> color

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
again just fill that in change the color

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.640 
again just fill that in change the color
little<00:02:11.630> bit<00:02:11.810> maybe<00:02:12.620> put<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.880> touch<00:02:14.330> of

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
little bit maybe put just a touch of

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.770 
little bit maybe put just a touch of
yellow<00:02:15.650> cadmium<00:02:16.610> yellow<00:02:16.820> into<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.540> pale

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
yellow cadmium yellow into the pale

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.910 
yellow cadmium yellow into the pale
olive<00:02:18.110> green<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.570> brighter<00:02:20.570> color

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
olive green so this is a brighter color

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.050 
olive green so this is a brighter color
you<00:02:21.920> have<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.160> bear<00:02:22.310> in<00:02:22.400> mind<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.880> is

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
you have to bear in mind that this is

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.150 
you have to bear in mind that this is
spring<00:02:23.900> seen<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.650> colors<00:02:24.890> are<00:02:24.980> going<00:02:25.100> to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
spring seen so the colors are going to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:38.560 
spring seen so the colors are going to
be<00:02:25.310> fairly<00:02:27.010> only<00:02:28.010> light<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.520> bright<00:02:37.570> right

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
be fairly only light and bright right

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.510 
be fairly only light and bright right
for<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:38.960> large<00:02:39.500> tree<00:02:39.890> here<00:02:40.250> in<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
for this large tree here in the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.100 
for this large tree here in the
foreground<00:02:41.170> we<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:43.750> slightly<00:02:44.750> darker

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
foreground we have a slightly darker

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.510 
foreground we have a slightly darker
color<00:02:45.410> at<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.130> top<00:02:47.380> now<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.590> then<00:02:49.130> comes

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
color at the top now that then comes

00:02:49.520 --> 00:03:00.220 
color at the top now that then comes
over<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:53.180> sky<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:56.420> comes<00:02:56.690> down<00:02:59.230> fairly

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
over the sky and just comes down fairly

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.870 
over the sky and just comes down fairly
dark<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.740> this<00:03:01.100> side<00:03:01.310> certainly<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
dark this this side certainly the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.250 
dark this this side certainly the
right-hand<00:03:02.150> side<00:03:02.300> of<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.510> tree<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:03.020> going<00:03:03.170> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
right-hand side of the tree is going to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:12.100 
right-hand side of the tree is going to
be<00:03:03.320> in<00:03:03.470> shadow<00:03:10.390> then<00:03:11.390> we<00:03:11.510> move<00:03:11.630> down<00:03:11.810> here<00:03:11.870> to

dragging the color down I get this
lovely<00:03:23.720> grass<00:03:24.380> effect<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.780> we<00:03:26.900> move<00:03:27.080> over

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
is painting at the back of the bridge

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
and what I'm using is a piece of paper

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.830 
and what I'm using is a piece of paper
and<00:03:59.140> I'm<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.380> laying<00:03:59.560> that<00:04:00.030> over<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.570> bridge

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
and I'm just laying that over the bridge

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.960 
and I'm just laying that over the bridge
just<00:04:03.990> to<00:04:04.990> mask<00:04:05.260> off<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.640> surface<00:04:06.640> of<00:04:06.790> the

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
just to mask off the surface of the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.850 
just to mask off the surface of the
bridge<00:04:07.870> that's<00:04:08.800> some<00:04:09.010> coloring<00:04:09.400> down<00:04:10.860> just

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
bridge that's some coloring down just

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.350 
bridge that's some coloring down just
change<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.250> color<00:04:12.459> a<00:04:12.640> little<00:04:12.670> bit<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:13.150> little

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
change the color a little bit a little

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.330 
change the color a little bit a little
bit<00:04:13.450> darker<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:17.140> take<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.500> up<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:18.010> base

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
bit darker you take that up to the base

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.050 
bit darker you take that up to the base
of<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.640> tree<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:20.579> this<00:04:21.579> comes<00:04:21.960> forward<00:04:24.060> this

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
of the tree and this comes forward this

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.730 
of the tree and this comes forward this
is<00:04:25.180> where<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.480> bluebells<00:04:26.110> are<00:04:26.260> going<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.560> go

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
is where the bluebells are going to go

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.250 
is where the bluebells are going to go
so<00:04:27.669> what<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.150> need<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.390> a<00:04:28.510> background<00:04:28.810> color

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
so what I need is a background color

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.570 
so what I need is a background color
first<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:31.150> comes<00:04:31.390> down<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:33.220> a<00:04:33.250> little<00:04:33.490> bit

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
first it comes down it's a little bit

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.670 
first it comes down it's a little bit
lighter<00:04:33.850> than<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.360> background<00:04:34.690> color<00:04:35.169> comes

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
lighter than the background color comes

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
lighter than the background color comes
down<00:04:35.919> towards<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:37.230> stream<00:04:38.230> and<00:04:39.160> again<00:04:39.460> just

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
down towards the stream and again just

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.870 
down towards the stream and again just
using<00:04:39.850> the<00:04:40.000> piece<00:04:40.150> of<00:04:40.270> paper<00:04:41.490> use<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.700> as<00:04:42.850> a

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
using the piece of paper use that as a

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.350 
using the piece of paper use that as a
mask<00:04:43.210> so<00:04:44.200> I<00:04:44.230> get<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.620> water<00:04:45.100> line<00:04:45.480> in<00:04:46.480> there

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
mask so I get the water line in there

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.610 
mask so I get the water line in there
and<00:04:49.360> then<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.890> darker<00:04:50.890> color<00:04:51.100> coming<00:04:51.460> down<00:04:52.620> mask

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
and then a darker color coming down mask

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.570 
and then a darker color coming down mask
off<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.860> bridge<00:04:54.640> again<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.360> that<00:04:55.450> comes<00:04:55.690> down

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
off the bridge again and that comes down

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.719 
off the bridge again and that comes down
and<00:04:57.580> stops<00:04:58.000> before<00:04:58.540> we<00:04:58.810> get<00:04:58.930> on<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.320> bridge

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
and stops before we get on to the bridge

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.670 
and stops before we get on to the bridge
so<00:05:00.729> hopefully<00:05:01.210> we<00:05:01.330> have<00:05:01.479> Bend<00:05:02.140> of<00:05:02.290> the<00:05:02.320> stream

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
so hopefully we have Bend of the stream

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.790 
so hopefully we have Bend of the stream
coming<00:05:03.040> around<00:05:03.160> here<00:05:04.169> just<00:05:05.169> add<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.470> little<00:05:05.680> bit

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
coming around here just add a little bit

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:14.850 
coming around here just add a little bit
of<00:05:05.890> color<00:05:06.190> underneath<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.210> bridge<00:05:13.620> just<00:05:14.620> fill

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
of color underneath the bridge just fill

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
of color underneath the bridge just fill
this<00:05:15.010> in<00:05:15.220> and<00:05:15.400> beside

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.940
