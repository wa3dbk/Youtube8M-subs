00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
 good to everyone today I'm going to teach how 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.640
 raise the power of the internal wef in 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.780
 this laptop or computer case 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.340
 itself also worth with usb pens 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.920
 etcetera etcetera good first thing 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.110
 we have to do is go here to where 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.520
 we have the wifi network open center 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.470
 networks and shared resources 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.710
 Manage Wireless Networks 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.130
 adapter properties 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.460
 configure advanced options and here 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.239
 all right 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.969
 in this case the internal wef is this code 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.250
 the external wifi that is this forgiveness does not 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.530
 let the value we want change 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.530
 that we're going to go inside then 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.150
 of the same as before setting options 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.690
 advanced and well 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.240
 here it is usually comes or as 128 256 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.540
 for the subject of battery consumption 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.130
 of such and such so if you want the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.470
 maximum power what you have to put 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.320
 it is in 512 that will not leave anymore 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.229
 because it is the maximum 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.080
 and also if you leave the option 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.510
 we have to give 512 to the transit this 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.150
 woofers and is and with that at the beginning 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.050
 well, our network is also changed 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.050
 example on our router that will bring me 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.650
 a signal of type n the delivery or good 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.080
 of type not type g that delivers it in a 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.360
 type b you will get a few meters 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.030
 more scope but that's already for the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.560
 wifi because it's from home and so on 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.560
 etcetera so nothing 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.300
 good to everyone today I'm going to teach how 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.190
 raise the power of the internal wef in 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 this laptop or computer case 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.860
 itself also worth with usb pens 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.560
 etcetera etcetera good first thing 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.870
 we have to do is go here to where 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.100
 we have the wifi network open networking people 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.030
 and shared resources 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.240
 manage wireless networks 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.660
 adapter properties 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.980
 configure advanced options and here 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.000
 all right 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.489
 in this case the internal wef is this the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.769
 external wifi that is this sorry I do not 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.349
 let's change the value we want like this 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.349
 that we're going to go inside then 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.680
 of the same as before setting options 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.219
 advanced and well 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.920
 here it is usually comes or as 128 256 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:45.370
 for the subject of battery consumption and 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.079
 such and such, so if you want the maximum 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.599
 power what you have to put them in 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.860
 512 that will not stop anymore because it's the 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.770
 maximum 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.620
 and also leaves you the option if you 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.530
 we have to give 512 to the transit this 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.660
 buffer and mikonos at the beginning well 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.290
 also if you change your network 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.900
 example on our router that instead of 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.440
 enter a signal of type n the delivery 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.500
 web type not type g that deliver it 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.660
 in a type b you will get a few 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.680
 meters more range but that's already 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.100
 for wifi because it's from home etc. 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.100
 So nothing
