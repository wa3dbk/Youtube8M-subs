00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.430 

what<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.899> want<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.320> join<00:00:56.219> them<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> corner

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
what you want to join them on the corner

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.650 
what you want to join them on the corner
is<00:00:58.440> fine<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.850> make

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
is fine you know that you can make

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.840 
is fine you know that you can make
you<00:01:01.840> say<00:01:02.260> one<00:01:02.530> position<00:01:02.890> piece<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.610> let<00:01:03.730> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
you say one position piece and let the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.660 
you say one position piece and let the
glass<00:01:04.059> fill<00:01:04.540> in<00:01:04.690> behind<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:06.040> reason<00:01:06.280> it's

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
glass fill in behind it the reason it's

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.240 
glass fill in behind it the reason it's
doing<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.540> not<00:01:07.750> so<00:01:08.050> much<00:01:08.260> now<00:01:08.590> before

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
doing this is not so much now before

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.120 
doing this is not so much now before
when<00:01:09.490> you're<00:01:09.640> doing<00:01:09.940> other<00:01:10.090> projects

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
when you're doing other projects

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.300 
when you're doing other projects
whenever<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:12.490> create<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.770> can<00:01:14.920> never

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
whenever you create you can never

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.450 
whenever you create you can never
destroy<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:16.330> circle<00:01:16.900> is<00:01:17.200> always<00:01:17.560> there<00:01:18.100> so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
destroy that circle is always there so

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.580 
destroy that circle is always there so
that's<00:01:19.119> what<00:01:19.300> gives<00:01:19.510> you<00:01:19.600> gotta<00:01:19.900> ride<00:01:20.260> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
that's what gives you gotta ride the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.950 
that's what gives you gotta ride the
deferment<00:01:20.979> because<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.030> chemistry<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.630> the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
deferment because the chemistry of the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960 
deferment because the chemistry of the
surface<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.590> ever<00:01:23.979> so<00:01:24.310> slightly<00:01:24.640> different

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
surface is ever so slightly different

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.300 
surface is ever so slightly different
but<00:01:25.360> anything<00:01:25.900> that<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.110> below<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:26.650> surface

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
but anything that is below the surface

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.210 
but anything that is below the surface
so<00:01:27.940> here<00:01:28.240> we<00:01:28.420> have<00:01:28.570> one<00:01:28.810> surface<00:01:29.170> but<00:01:29.920> we<00:01:30.070> also

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
so here we have one surface but we also

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.490 
so here we have one surface but we also
now<00:01:30.580> have<00:01:30.820> two<00:01:31.060> surfaces<00:01:31.360> but<00:01:32.259> wait<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.410> minute

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
now have two surfaces but wait a minute

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.620 
now have two surfaces but wait a minute
we<00:01:32.890> have<00:01:32.920> another<00:01:33.430> surface<00:01:33.820> which<00:01:34.149> say<00:01:34.600> that

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
we have another surface which say that

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.719 
we have another surface which say that
this<00:01:34.990> works<00:01:35.259> but<00:01:35.680> we<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.040> another<00:01:36.340> surface

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
this works but we have another surface

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.120 
this works but we have another surface
here<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.750> we<00:01:37.990> still<00:01:38.259> there<00:01:38.500> together<00:01:38.800> we're

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
here so we still there together we're

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.969 
here so we still there together we're
actually<00:01:39.310> dealing<00:01:39.759> on<00:01:40.060> formed<00:01:40.539> into<00:01:40.990> three

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
actually dealing on formed into three

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.120 
actually dealing on formed into three
same<00:01:42.759> purpose<00:01:43.270> or<00:01:43.450> deal<00:01:43.660> with<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.899> 300<00:01:44.590> services

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
same purpose or deal with a 300 services

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.490 
same purpose or deal with a 300 services
for<00:01:45.340> these<00:01:45.430> back<00:01:45.729> together<00:01:46.080> so<00:01:47.080> if<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.320> heat

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
for these back together so if you heat

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.330 
for these back together so if you heat
it<00:01:47.530> up<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.100> take<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.700> back<00:01:48.820> together<00:01:50.340> together

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
it up and take it back together together

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.150 
it up and take it back together together
though<00:01:51.729> all<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.060> lines<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.050> if<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.800> ever<00:01:53.950> go

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
though all the lines and if you ever go

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.370 
though all the lines and if you ever go
to<00:01:54.190> stretch<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:55.450> will<00:01:55.600> stretch<00:01:55.869> to<00:01:55.899> go<00:01:56.170> this

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
to stretch it will stretch to go this

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.620 
to stretch it will stretch to go this
long<00:01:56.440> right<00:01:57.160> away<00:01:57.520> well<00:01:58.270> that's<00:01:58.420> because

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
long right away well that's because

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.540 
long right away well that's because
there's<00:01:59.080> another<00:01:59.380> service<00:02:00.009> there<00:02:00.280> the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
there's another service there the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.790 
there's another service there the
farmers<00:02:01.210> surface<00:02:01.630> area<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.110> coming<00:02:02.619> all

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
farmers surface area that is coming all

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.850 
farmers surface area that is coming all
the<00:02:02.950> way<00:02:02.979> through<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:03.550> rock<00:02:04.410> so<00:02:05.410> if<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.649> join

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
the way through the rock so if you join

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.160 
the way through the rock so if you join
in<00:02:06.099> a<00:02:06.160> very<00:02:06.399> nice<00:02:06.670> point<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.450> are<00:02:07.479> minimizing

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
in a very nice point you are minimizing

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.880 
in a very nice point you are minimizing
that's<00:02:09.009> purchase<00:02:09.490> area<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.090> are<00:02:10.119> moving

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.930 

this<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.040> really<00:02:16.220> important<00:02:16.700> if<00:02:16.760> you're<00:02:16.910> doing

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
this is really important if you're doing

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.280 
this is really important if you're doing
a<00:02:17.330> repair<00:02:17.690> for<00:02:18.080> example<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:19.130> colors<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.900> you

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
a repair for example and colors and you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.130 
a repair for example and colors and you
know<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.680> don't<00:02:21.890> want<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:22.190> mine<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.150> be<00:02:23.300> so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
know you don't want that mine to be so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.990 
know you don't want that mine to be so
if<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.349> started<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.860> corner<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.489> work<00:02:25.730> that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
if you started the corner and work that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.870 
if you started the corner and work that
is<00:02:26.180> having<00:02:26.569> Bradford<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.459> you're<00:02:28.459> able<00:02:28.849> to

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
is having Bradford in you're able to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.380 
is having Bradford in you're able to
pull<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.450> much<00:02:29.720> cruder<00:02:30.370> perfect<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.120> have

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
pull a much cruder perfect and you have

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.020 
pull a much cruder perfect and you have
any<00:02:32.840> other<00:02:33.080> way<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.860> people<00:02:34.250> makeup<00:02:34.700> field

you<00:02:38.150> want<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.450> join<00:02:38.660> them

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
you want to join them

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.380 
you want to join them
I'm<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.290> little<00:02:39.500> bit<00:02:39.650> shaky<00:02:39.950> now<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:41.269> want

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
I'm a little bit shaky now but you want

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.930 
I'm a little bit shaky now but you want
to<00:02:41.510> join<00:02:41.780> them<00:02:41.989> really<00:02:42.500> tiny<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.130> then<00:02:43.640> just

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
to join them really tiny and then just

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.789 
to join them really tiny and then just
allow<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.269> glass<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.870> pour<00:02:45.080> went<00:02:45.319> behind<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
allow the glass to pour went behind a

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.420 
allow the glass to pour went behind a
nice<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.900> anyway<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.380> second<00:02:48.769> basic<00:02:49.160> skill

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
nice so anyway the second basic skill

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.250 
nice so anyway the second basic skill
once<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.819> taking<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.269> rods<00:02:50.480> apart<00:02:50.930> and

once you taking the rods apart and

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.710 
once you taking the rods apart and
simply<00:02:52.130> bus<00:02:52.340> deal<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.730> back<00:02:52.910> together<00:02:53.090> and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
simply bus deal it back together and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.110 
simply bus deal it back together and
work<00:02:54.380> on<00:02:54.620> getting<00:02:54.980> your<00:02:55.069> buck<00:02:55.280> deal<00:02:55.549> as<00:02:55.760> clean

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
work on getting your buck deal as clean

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.110 
work on getting your buck deal as clean
as<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.390> can

they're owned by Java I do think I have

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.580 
they're owned by Java I do think I have

flame and that way I can see the

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.530 
flame and that way I can see the
reflection<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.709> light<00:03:20.920> in<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.250> rock<00:03:21.550> and

I<00:03:22.660> can<00:03:22.870> see<00:03:23.080> where<00:03:23.319> it's<00:03:23.440> wavering<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:32.130> think<00:03:33.130> up

together as you're turning it the reason

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.430 
together as you're turning it the reason
being<00:04:27.729> for<00:04:28.060> example<00:04:28.690> when<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.900> made<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.259> list

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
being for example when I made the list

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.129 
being for example when I made the list
for<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.800> complet<00:04:30.280> there's<00:04:30.970> no<00:04:31.240> way<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.600> get<00:04:31.960> a

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
for the complet there's no way to get a

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.810 
for the complet there's no way to get a
ring<00:04:32.410> hot<00:04:32.740> enough<00:04:33.009> where<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:33.430> can<00:04:33.580> just

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
ring hot enough where you can just

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.159 
ring hot enough where you can just
simply<00:04:34.000> get<00:04:34.330> it<00:04:34.449> hot<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.630> then<00:04:34.900> push<00:04:35.139> it

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
simply get it hot and then push it

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.680 
simply get it hot and then push it
together<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:36.669> really<00:04:37.210> want<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.570> have

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
together and so you really want to have

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.810 
together and so you really want to have
that<00:04:37.930> skill<00:04:38.289> where<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.740> can<00:04:38.949> rotate<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.610> push

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
that skill where you can rotate and push

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:49.120

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.010 

now<00:04:49.640> obviously<00:04:50.240> no<00:04:50.740> reality

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
now obviously no reality

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.470 
now obviously no reality
so<00:04:53.620> I'm<00:04:53.980> going<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.280> stop<00:04:54.550> here<00:04:54.760> now<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.090> add<00:04:55.450> a

mind this was an icicle through the
corner<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.800> made<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.850> I<00:05:04.000> got<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.390> the

corner that I made that I got to the

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.110 
corner that I made that I got to the
point<00:05:04.660> where<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:04.870> could<00:05:05.080> never<00:05:05.290> bake<00:05:05.560> enough<00:05:05.890> of

two years and all of that and your hands
are<00:06:07.160> ready<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.550> go

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:23.580 

we<00:06:17.710> got<00:06:17.979> to<00:06:18.129> be<00:06:18.249> where<00:06:18.460> I<00:06:18.490> think<00:06:18.819> about<00:06:22.439> $3<00:06:23.439> a

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
we got to be where I think about $3 a

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:36.800 
we got to be where I think about $3 a
day<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:24.009> was<00:06:24.939> okay<00:06:25.240> with<00:06:25.419> that<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:26.800> are

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.580 

one<00:06:37.810> of<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:37.990> reasons<00:06:39.870> is<00:06:40.870> that<00:06:40.930> if<00:06:41.230> you<00:06:41.350> stop

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
one of the reasons is that if you stop

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.590 
one of the reasons is that if you stop
and<00:06:41.740> think<00:06:41.830> about<00:06:42.100> it<00:06:42.250> is<00:06:42.520> the<00:06:42.880> logical<00:06:43.360> thing

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
and think about it is the logical thing

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.740 
and think about it is the logical thing
to<00:06:43.630> add<00:06:44.850> because<00:06:45.850> there's<00:06:46.060> a<00:06:46.150> lot<00:06:46.330> of<00:06:46.360> people

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
to add because there's a lot of people

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.140 
to add because there's a lot of people
who<00:06:46.810> type<00:06:47.430> there's<00:06:48.430> a<00:06:48.520> lot<00:06:48.670> of<00:06:48.790> people<00:06:49.060> who

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
who type there's a lot of people who

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.450 
who type there's a lot of people who
celebrate<00:06:49.420> systems<00:06:50.080> but<00:06:50.680> there's<00:06:50.860> also<00:06:51.040> a<00:06:51.250> lot

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
celebrate systems but there's also a lot

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:58.830 
celebrate systems but there's also a lot
of<00:06:51.550> people<00:06:56.880> across<00:06:57.880> new<00:06:58.180> markets<00:06:58.660> in<00:06:58.810> a

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
of people across new markets in a

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.290 
of people across new markets in a
logical<00:06:59.350> way<00:06:59.410> you're<00:07:00.220> not<00:07:00.430> just<00:07:00.730> reaching<00:07:01.150> out

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
logical way you're not just reaching out

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.300 
logical way you're not just reaching out
and<00:07:01.360> hoping<00:07:01.840> and<00:07:01.990> something<00:07:02.380> happens<00:07:02.830> you're

and hoping and something happens you're
actually<00:07:03.730> building<00:07:03.940> is<00:07:04.330> what<00:07:04.930> is<00:07:05.200> my<00:07:05.380> mortgage

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
actually building is what is my mortgage

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.810 
actually building is what is my mortgage
that<00:07:06.040> I<00:07:06.100> get<00:07:06.400> dumped

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
that I get dumped

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.510 
that I get dumped
well<00:07:07.060> that<00:07:08.050> seemed<00:07:08.290> like<00:07:08.470> a<00:07:08.680> good<00:07:08.830> idea<00:07:08.890> to<00:07:09.400> me

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
well that seemed like a good idea to me

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.040 
well that seemed like a good idea to me
and<00:07:09.730> there<00:07:09.820> might<00:07:10.000> be<00:07:10.030> a<00:07:10.240> lot<00:07:10.390> of<00:07:10.420> hype<00:07:10.720> people

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
and there might be a lot of hype people

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:18.960 
and there might be a lot of hype people
who<00:07:11.140> want<00:07:11.410> to<00:07:11.470> convince<00:07:17.310> those<00:07:18.310> to<00:07:18.490> me<00:07:18.670> I<00:07:18.700> was
