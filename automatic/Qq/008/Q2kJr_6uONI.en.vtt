key consideration was access because I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.580 
key consideration was access because I
know<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.599> lot<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.810> women<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.109> probably<00:00:31.439> know

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
but they never wear them because they

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.290 
but they never wear them because they
can't<00:00:34.950> easily<00:00:35.460> access<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.149> they're<00:00:36.270> a

can't easily access them they're a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.180

nuisance<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.960> get<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> key

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
nuisance to get to so it was a key

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.340 
nuisance to get to so it was a key
consideration<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:39.000> me<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.140> make

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
them so that it's easy to make the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.400 
them so that it's easy to make the
choice<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> put<00:00:42.629> them<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> morning

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
is full of belts yes and they just

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.870 
is full of belts yes and they just
rolled<00:02:45.660> up<00:02:45.840> yes<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.860> you've<00:02:46.980> got<00:02:47.190> one's<00:02:47.430> full

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
rolled up yes and you've got one's full

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
of for scarves and things as well that's

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.360 
of for scarves and things as well that's
the<00:02:51.360> way<00:02:51.480> you've<00:02:51.660> kept<00:02:51.930> them<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.380> rolling<00:02:53.250> is

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
the way you've kept them and rolling is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.130 
the way you've kept them and rolling is
a<00:02:53.400> really<00:02:53.730> good<00:02:53.940> way<00:02:54.150> rather<00:02:54.540> than<00:02:54.690> folding

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
a really good way rather than folding

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.810 
a really good way rather than folding
because<00:02:55.650> when<00:02:55.800> something's<00:02:56.160> rolled<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.580> find

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
because when something's rolled I find

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.940 
because when something's rolled I find
it<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.420> doesn't<00:02:57.840> crush<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:58.260> much<00:02:58.470> particularly

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
it it doesn't crush as much particularly

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.710 
it it doesn't crush as much particularly
with<00:02:59.190> scarves<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.700> belts<00:03:00.000> tend<00:03:00.300> not<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.450> crush

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
with scarves my belts tend not to crush

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.150 
with scarves my belts tend not to crush
but<00:03:00.930> they<00:03:01.050> can<00:03:01.200> still<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.470> know<00:03:01.590> get<00:03:01.740> marks<00:03:02.040> in

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
but they can still you know get marks in

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.070 
but they can still you know get marks in
them<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.610> also<00:03:02.820> means<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.570> can<00:03:03.720> see

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
them it also means that you can see

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.810 
them it also means that you can see
things<00:03:04.440> more<00:03:04.770> easily<00:03:05.130> when<00:03:05.340> they're<00:03:05.550> rolled

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820
