so<00:00:00.240> the<00:00:00.630> logic<00:00:01.500> for<00:00:02.100> studying<00:00:03.230> cognitive<00:00:04.230> and

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
so the logic for studying cognitive and

but<00:00:09.000> since<00:00:09.240> you've<00:00:09.360> argued<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.750> language

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
study the immune system it might even be

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.240 
study the immune system it might even be
simpler<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.990> fact<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:23.100> those

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250

systems then for cognition though you'd
expect<00:00:26.250> different<00:00:26.400> answers<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.210> mean<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.869> can

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
expect different answers I mean you can

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.140 
expect different answers I mean you can
do<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> digestive<00:00:28.920> system<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
do it for the digestive system and I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.540 
do it for the digestive system and I
suppose<00:00:30.390> somebody's<00:00:31.130> studying<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
suppose somebody's studying the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.940 
suppose somebody's studying the
digestive<00:00:33.120> system<00:00:33.320> well<00:00:34.320> they're<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.710> going

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
digestive system well they're not going

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.000 
digestive system well they're not going
to<00:00:35.070> study<00:00:35.390> what<00:00:36.390> happens<00:00:36.840> when<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.829> have

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to study what happens when you have

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.940 
to study what happens when you have
stomach<00:00:38.700> flu<00:00:39.000> or<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:40.050> you've<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.649> eaten<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
stomach flu or when you've just eaten a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100 
stomach flu or when you've just eaten a
Big<00:00:41.129> Mac<00:00:41.399> or<00:00:41.760> something<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.360> mean<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:42.989> you're

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
Big Mac or something I mean if you're

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.889 
Big Mac or something I mean if you're
trying<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.700> let's<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.879> back<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.329> taking

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
trying to let's go back to taking

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.420 
trying to let's go back to taking
pictures<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> what's<00:00:46.559> outside<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> window

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
pictures of what's outside the window

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
pictures of what's outside the window
the<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.270> way<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.600> studying<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.110> digestive

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the one way of studying the digestive

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.100 
the one way of studying the digestive
system<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.309> take<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.760> data<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.930> can

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
system is just take all data you can

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.020 
system is just take all data you can
find<00:00:52.379> about<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.949> digestive<00:00:53.520> systems<00:00:53.850> do

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
find about what digestive systems do

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
find about what digestive systems do
under<00:00:54.300> any<00:00:54.480> circumstances<00:00:55.460> toss<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> data

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
under any circumstances toss the data

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.900 
under any circumstances toss the data
into<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> computer<00:00:57.710> do<00:00:58.710> statistical<00:00:59.309> analysis

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
into a computer do statistical analysis

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.599 
into a computer do statistical analysis
you<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.719> something<00:01:01.230> yeah<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.489> not

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you get something yeah but it's not

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.090 
you get something yeah but it's not
going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.180> any<00:01:03.680> biologist<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.920> do

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
going to be what any biologist would do

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
going to be what any biologist would do
they<00:01:05.970> want<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> abstract<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.900> wave<00:01:07.140> at<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
they want to abstract the wave at the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
they want to abstract the wave at the
beginning<00:01:07.830> very<00:01:08.010> beginning<00:01:08.630> abstract<00:01:09.630> away

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
beginning very beginning abstract away

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.190 
beginning very beginning abstract away
from<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.500> our<00:01:11.150> presumed<00:01:12.150> may<00:01:12.750> be<00:01:12.810> wrongly

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
from what our presumed may be wrongly

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.170 
from what our presumed may be wrongly
can<00:01:13.680> always<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.040> wrong<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.060> are

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
can always be wrong but what are

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.010 
can always be wrong but what are
presumed<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.990> irrelevant<00:01:17.750> variables<00:01:18.750> like

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
presumed to be irrelevant variables like

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:28.010 
presumed to be irrelevant variables like
do<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.530> stomach<00:01:19.799> flu<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:27.450> may<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.689> one

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
do you have stomach flu that may be one

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.719 
do you have stomach flu that may be one
that's<00:01:28.380> they're<00:01:28.740> doing<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.189> an<00:01:29.310> advanced

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that's they're doing at an advanced

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.030 
that's they're doing at an advanced
stage<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:31.020> study<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.500> digestive<00:01:31.680> system

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
stage the study the digestive system

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
stage the study the digestive system
they're<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.700> understand<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.450> lot<00:01:33.600> about<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
they're a to understand a lot about the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.289 
they're a to understand a lot about the
study<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.100> justice<00:01:35.549> system<00:01:35.909> before<00:01:36.030> they

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
study that I justice system before they

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.060 
study that I justice system before they
even<00:01:36.420> compare<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.079> otherwise<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> wouldn't

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
even compare them otherwise you wouldn't

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.039 
even compare them otherwise you wouldn't
know<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> compare<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.060> why<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.750> sick

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
know what to compare and why is one sick

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:40.789 
know what to compare and why is one sick
and<00:01:40.229> what<00:01:40.350> isn't

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and what isn't

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
and what isn't
you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.340> mean<00:01:41.820> even<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.060> contrary<00:01:51.799> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
you know I mean even the contrary the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.010 
you know I mean even the contrary the
way<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> fund<00:01:53.250> things<00:01:53.460> yeah<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.509> maybe<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
way to fund things yeah like maybe the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.780 
way to fund things yeah like maybe the
way<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:56.340> know<00:01:56.460> fund<00:01:57.649> study<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.790> languages

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
way to you know fund study of languages

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.420 
way to you know fund study of languages
to<00:02:00.000> say<00:02:00.180> maybe<00:02:01.110> help<00:02:01.380> cure<00:02:01.619> autism<00:02:01.950> or

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
to say maybe help cure autism or

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.910 
to say maybe help cure autism or
something<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.350> different

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
something but that's a different

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.520 
something but that's a different
question<00:02:05.040> yeah<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.600> logic<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.380> the

question yeah but but the logic of the
search<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.429> try<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.509> begin<00:02:09.840> by

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
search is to try to you begin by

you've<00:05:42.830> but<00:05:44.240> but<00:05:45.240> then<00:05:45.389> you<00:05:45.510> look<00:05:45.720> further<00:05:45.960> and

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
you've but but then you look further and

you've but but then you look further and

they're not I mean for example it's

they're not I mean for example it's
