00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980 
sideways and pushed it in this first one
snapped<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.850> by<00:02:06.000> its<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.329> pretty<00:02:06.570> good<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
snapped in by its up pretty good the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.199 
snapped in by its up pretty good the
second<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.619> kind<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.129> booger<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
second one here is kind of a booger so I

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.449 
second one here is kind of a booger so I
just<00:02:09.750> got<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> big<00:02:10.229> pair<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> channellocks<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
just got a big pair of channellocks and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.590 
just got a big pair of channellocks and
kind<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.879> squeeze<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.750> there

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
kind of squeeze it on there

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.590 
kind of squeeze it on there
you<00:02:14.600> can<00:02:14.720> get<00:02:14.840> underneath<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.600> snap

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
you can get underneath it and snap

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.330 
you can get underneath it and snap
together<00:02:18.080> but<00:02:18.350> they<00:02:18.440> do<00:02:18.590> how<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.770> snap<00:02:19.100> better

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
together but they do how to snap better

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.630 
together but they do how to snap better
to<00:02:19.520> be<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.670> tight<00:02:19.970> fit<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:21.340> pretty<00:02:22.340> much<00:02:22.490> that's

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
to be a tight fit so pretty much that's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.180 
to be a tight fit so pretty much that's
how<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:22.940> would<00:02:23.150> take<00:02:23.450> off<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.020> reinstall<00:02:24.830> a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
how you would take off and reinstall a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.790 
how you would take off and reinstall a
reservoir<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.930> is<00:02:27.080> off<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.380> 89<00:02:28.250> Nissan<00:02:28.730> pickup

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
reservoir this is off a 89 Nissan pickup

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.770 
reservoir this is off a 89 Nissan pickup
so<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:30.860> don't<00:02:31.040> know<00:02:31.130> if<00:02:31.190> any<00:02:31.640> other<00:02:31.880> other

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
so I don't know if any other other

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.600 
so I don't know if any other other
Nissan<00:02:33.170> should<00:02:33.440> be<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.650> same<00:02:33.890> similar<00:02:34.430> or

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
Nissan should be the same similar or

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.510 
Nissan should be the same similar or
other<00:02:35.600> reservoirs<00:02:36.260> might<00:02:36.560> be<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.770> same<00:02:37.040> same

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
other reservoirs might be the same same

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.140 
other reservoirs might be the same same
also<00:02:38.560> anyway<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:40.850> is<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.180> for<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.450> video

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
also anyway so this is it for this video

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.790 
also anyway so this is it for this video
okay<00:02:44.150> I'm<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.570> process<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:45.230> bench<00:02:45.500> bleed

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
okay I'm in the process of bench bleed

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.970 
okay I'm in the process of bench bleed
in<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.070> thing<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.990> as<00:02:47.990> you<00:02:48.230> see<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.530> had<00:02:48.800> to

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
in this thing and as you see I had to

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.900 
in this thing and as you see I had to
make<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:50.230> little<00:02:51.460> variance<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:52.670> how<00:02:52.760> you'd

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
make a little variance to how you'd

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.880 
make a little variance to how you'd
bench<00:02:53.210> made<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.600> typically<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.530> want<00:02:54.710> these

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
bench made it typically you want these

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.220 
bench made it typically you want these
lines<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.700> come<00:02:55.940> up<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.330> back<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.080> the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
lines to come up and back in the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.920 
lines to come up and back in the
reservoir<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.000> have<00:02:59.210> a<00:02:59.270> constant<00:02:59.810> flow

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
reservoir so you have a constant flow

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.830 
reservoir so you have a constant flow
back<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.290> forth<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:01.190> these<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:02.420> came<00:03:02.690> with

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
back and forth but these that came with

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.460 
back and forth but these that came with
a<00:03:02.870> kit

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
a kit

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.490 
a kit
we're<00:03:04.160> very<00:03:04.370> stiff<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.240> they<00:03:06.230> really

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
we're very stiff and they really

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.130 
we're very stiff and they really
couldn't<00:03:06.890> come<00:03:07.850> back<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.300> but<00:03:08.570> I'll<00:03:08.660> popping

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
couldn't come back in but I'll popping

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.510 
couldn't come back in but I'll popping
off<00:03:09.580> these<00:03:10.580> leads<00:03:10.940> here<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.830> said<00:03:13.220> what<00:03:13.370> the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
off these leads here so I said what the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.700 
off these leads here so I said what the
heck<00:03:13.700> I'll<00:03:14.150> just<00:03:14.360> mix<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:14.840> my<00:03:15.020> own<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.590> just

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
heck I'll just mix up my own so I just

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.979 
heck I'll just mix up my own so I just
got<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.890> little<00:03:15.980> shot<00:03:16.340> glass<00:03:16.580> there<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
got a little shot glass there on the

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.699 
got a little shot glass there on the
bottom<00:03:19.000> fill<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.150> reservoir<00:03:20.570> up<00:03:20.780> through

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
bottom fill the reservoir up through

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.570 
bottom fill the reservoir up through
pours<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.130> way<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.640> as<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.239> gets<00:03:23.510> held<00:03:23.870> up

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
pours the way and as this gets held up

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.600 
pours the way and as this gets held up
go<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.989> sees<00:03:26.989> an<00:03:27.140> injector<00:03:27.590> from<00:03:27.890> Home<00:03:28.040> Depot<00:03:28.070> I

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
go to sees an injector from Home Depot I

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.479 
go to sees an injector from Home Depot I
cut<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> tip<00:03:29.239> off<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.770> so<00:03:30.770> now<00:03:31.010> it's<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:31.250> a

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
cut the tip off of it so now it's just a

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.240 
cut the tip off of it so now it's just a
like<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.670> big<00:03:31.910> shiny<00:03:32.209> needle<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:33.980> gets

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
like a big shiny needle and this gets

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.390 
like a big shiny needle and this gets
filled<00:03:34.520> up<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.910> suck<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.720> out

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
filled up I suck it out

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.009 
filled up I suck it out
deposit<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.430> back<00:03:37.610> in<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.780> one

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
deposit it back in so this is the one

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.740 
deposit it back in so this is the one
mine<00:03:42.290> here<00:03:42.560> is<00:03:42.709> pretty<00:03:42.920> much<00:03:43.150> solid<00:03:44.150> fluid<00:03:44.510> it

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
mine here is pretty much solid fluid it

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.780 
mine here is pretty much solid fluid it
was<00:03:44.840> pretty<00:03:45.080> much<00:03:45.350> what<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.769> want<00:03:46.040> these<00:03:46.730> are

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
was pretty much what you want these are

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.900 
was pretty much what you want these are
the<00:03:47.030> two<00:03:47.209> are<00:03:47.330> still<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.660> process<00:03:47.870> of

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
the two are still in the process of

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.949 
the two are still in the process of
getting<00:03:49.910> air<00:03:50.300> in<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.570> so<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:52.040> just<00:03:52.100> keep<00:03:52.340> on

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
getting air in it so you just keep on

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.600 
getting air in it so you just keep on
pushing<00:03:53.959> in<00:03:54.320> of<00:03:54.500> course<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.860> know<00:03:55.010> if<00:03:55.130> I<00:03:55.310> go

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
pushing in of course you know if I go

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.740 
pushing in of course you know if I go
just<00:03:55.820> push<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.269> in<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.510> get<00:03:56.630> a<00:03:56.660> little

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
just push it in to get a little

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.400 
just push it in to get a little
screwdriver<00:03:57.350> or<00:03:57.530> something<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:59.239> push<00:04:00.170> in

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
screwdriver or something the push in

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.100 
screwdriver or something the push in
this<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:02.300> activate<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.019> brake<00:04:03.290> lines<00:04:03.560> and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
this to activate the brake lines and

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.590 
this to activate the brake lines and
that<00:04:06.110> creates<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.530> vacuum<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.269> process<00:04:08.269> of<00:04:08.420> get

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
that creates a vacuum in process of get

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.650 
that creates a vacuum in process of get
that<00:04:08.750> fluid<00:04:08.989> through<00:04:09.260> there<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:10.300> just<00:04:11.300> a<00:04:11.480> slow

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
that fluid through there and just a slow

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.630 
that fluid through there and just a slow
process<00:04:12.140> but<00:04:12.350> once<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.680> get<00:04:12.800> all<00:04:12.950> your<00:04:12.980> your

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
process but once you get all your your

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.340 
process but once you get all your your
lines<00:04:13.880> pretty<00:04:14.150> much<00:04:14.390> solid<00:04:14.660> like<00:04:14.870> this<00:04:15.050> first

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
lines pretty much solid like this first

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.920 
lines pretty much solid like this first
one<00:04:15.530> here<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.860> I<00:04:16.330> mean<00:04:17.330> you<00:04:17.390> can<00:04:17.540> see<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.810> but

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
one here is I mean you can see it but

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.500 
one here is I mean you can see it but
there's<00:04:18.049> not<00:04:18.169> much<00:04:18.380> very<00:04:19.060> pretty<00:04:20.060> much<00:04:20.269> full

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
there's not much very pretty much full

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.529 
there's not much very pretty much full
of<00:04:20.630> fluid<00:04:20.989> just<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.799> us<00:04:21.919> so<00:04:22.070> I'm<00:04:22.190> air<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.729> so

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
of fluid just to us so I'm air in it so

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.850 
of fluid just to us so I'm air in it so
just<00:04:24.260> keep<00:04:24.440> at<00:04:24.650> it

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
just keep at it

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.100 
just keep at it
and<00:04:25.280> eventually<00:04:26.270> you'll<00:04:26.419> get<00:04:26.600> it<00:04:26.780> and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
and eventually you'll get it and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.029 
and eventually you'll get it and
then<00:04:27.229> you<00:04:27.469> can<00:04:27.620> install<00:04:29.500> okay<00:04:30.500> just<00:04:30.830> about

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
then you can install okay just about

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.640 
then you can install okay just about
done<00:04:31.310> with<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.550> binge<00:04:31.789> bleeding<00:04:32.210> here<00:04:32.509> as<00:04:33.409> you

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
done with the binge bleeding here as you

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.399 
done with the binge bleeding here as you
can<00:04:33.680> see<00:04:34.039> I've<00:04:34.129> got<00:04:34.280> three<00:04:34.759> lines<00:04:35.689> full<00:04:36.259> of

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
can see I've got three lines full of

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.129 
can see I've got three lines full of
fluid<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.689> looks<00:04:38.689> like<00:04:38.750> I<00:04:38.960> might

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
fluid and looks like I might

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.809 
fluid and looks like I might
accidentally<00:04:39.740> discover<00:04:40.129> something<00:04:40.610> here

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
accidentally discover something here

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.119 
accidentally discover something here
because<00:04:41.419> I<00:04:41.750> apparently<00:04:42.229> didn't<00:04:42.620> clean<00:04:42.889> that

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
because I apparently didn't clean that

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.300 
because I apparently didn't clean that
reservoir<00:04:43.639> off<00:04:44.139> very<00:04:45.139> well<00:04:45.199> and<00:04:45.650> as<00:04:46.009> I<00:04:46.189> was

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
reservoir off very well and as I was

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.240 
reservoir off very well and as I was
doing<00:04:46.639> this<00:04:47.319> and<00:04:48.319> if<00:04:48.469> you<00:04:48.590> could<00:04:48.740> see<00:04:48.949> in<00:04:49.009> there

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
doing this and if you could see in there

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.129 
doing this and if you could see in there
there's<00:04:49.460> quite<00:04:49.759> a<00:04:49.789> bit<00:04:49.969> of<00:04:50.000> dirt<00:04:50.300> particles<00:04:50.960> in

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
there's quite a bit of dirt particles in

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.339 
there's quite a bit of dirt particles in
the<00:04:51.590> screen<00:04:52.479> and<00:04:53.479> that<00:04:53.689> was<00:04:53.870> being<00:04:54.080> collected

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
the screen and that was being collected

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.659 
the screen and that was being collected
as<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.979> was<00:04:55.159> taking<00:04:55.639> it<00:04:55.759> with<00:04:55.909> my<00:04:56.180> ear<00:04:56.419> syringe

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
as I was taking it with my ear syringe

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.839 
as I was taking it with my ear syringe
from<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.969> shot<00:04:59.599> glass<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.490> pour<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.639> back

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
from the shot glass and pour in the back

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.170 
from the shot glass and pour in the back
in<00:05:02.090> there<00:05:02.439> so<00:05:03.439> now<00:05:03.710> I've<00:05:03.919> got<00:05:04.129> just<00:05:04.370> pure<00:05:04.669> fluid

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
in there so now I've got just pure fluid

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.920 
in there so now I've got just pure fluid
in<00:05:05.300> there<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:06.490> if<00:05:07.490> there<00:05:08.150> might<00:05:08.360> be<00:05:08.389> sub<00:05:08.779> you

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
in there so if there might be sub you

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.709 
in there so if there might be sub you
might<00:05:09.139> want<00:05:09.349> to<00:05:09.439> do<00:05:10.090> instead<00:05:11.090> of<00:05:11.300> putting<00:05:11.629> your

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
might want to do instead of putting your

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.080 
might want to do instead of putting your
lines<00:05:11.990> back<00:05:12.349> into<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.740> reservoir<00:05:13.090> because

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
lines back into the reservoir because

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.950 
lines back into the reservoir because
then<00:05:14.270> all<00:05:14.389> you're<00:05:14.539> doing<00:05:14.810> you're<00:05:14.930> just

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
then all you're doing you're just

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.209 
then all you're doing you're just
putting<00:05:15.409> that<00:05:15.500> dirt<00:05:15.740> back<00:05:15.949> in<00:05:16.189> there<00:05:16.779> in<00:05:18.219> which

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
putting that dirt back in there in which

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.529 
putting that dirt back in there in which
case<00:05:19.460> you're<00:05:19.639> going<00:05:19.759> to<00:05:19.819> have<00:05:19.879> dirtier<00:05:20.330> lines

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
case you're going to have dirtier lines

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.399 
case you're going to have dirtier lines
and<00:05:21.250> I<00:05:22.250> can<00:05:23.090> accidentally<00:05:23.659> stumble<00:05:24.050> onto<00:05:24.169> this

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
and I can accidentally stumble onto this

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.029 
and I can accidentally stumble onto this
because<00:05:24.800> of<00:05:24.979> course<00:05:25.250> these<00:05:25.819> lines<00:05:26.120> were<00:05:27.039> real

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
because of course these lines were real

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.860 
because of course these lines were real
stiff<00:05:28.340> and<00:05:28.550> I<00:05:28.580> couldn't<00:05:28.879> do<00:05:29.000> that<00:05:29.180> so<00:05:29.479> this

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
stiff and I couldn't do that so this

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.300 
stiff and I couldn't do that so this
looks<00:05:30.139> like<00:05:30.169> it's<00:05:30.409> pretty<00:05:30.560> good<00:05:30.800> deal<00:05:31.009> I<00:05:31.039> might

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
looks like it's pretty good deal I might

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.860 
looks like it's pretty good deal I might
do<00:05:31.460> this<00:05:31.550> in<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.789> future<00:05:32.150> with<00:05:32.539> my<00:05:32.719> other

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
do this in the future with my other

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.409 
do this in the future with my other
vehicles
