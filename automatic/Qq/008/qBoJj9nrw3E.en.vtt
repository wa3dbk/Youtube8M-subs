00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.539 
for everybody so i personally think that
the<00:03:31.670> 25<00:03:32.209> millimeter<00:03:32.719> one<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.049> for<00:03:33.349> 4<00:03:34.250> girls

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
the 25 millimeter one is for 4 girls

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.449 
the 25 millimeter one is for 4 girls
that<00:03:34.969> have<00:03:35.560> very<00:03:36.560> very<00:03:36.859> long<00:03:37.069> hair<00:03:37.280> so

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
that have very very long hair so

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.059 
that have very very long hair so
probably<00:03:37.730> optimum<00:03:38.269> height<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.829> very<00:03:39.829> thick

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
probably optimum height and very thick

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.149 
probably optimum height and very thick
hair<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.719> the<00:03:41.719> 30<00:03:41.959> millimeters<00:03:42.530> people<00:03:42.980> for

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
hair and the 30 millimeters people for

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.860 
hair and the 30 millimeters people for
short<00:03:43.400> hair<00:03:43.459> just<00:03:43.849> like<00:03:44.000> shoulder<00:03:44.510> length<00:03:44.540> or

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
short hair just like shoulder length or

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.709 
short hair just like shoulder length or
ear<00:03:45.079> length<00:03:45.349> you<00:03:45.859> know<00:03:46.010> short<00:03:46.370> hair<00:03:46.639> and<00:03:46.909> the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:47.719 
ear length you know short hair and the

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.659 
ear length you know short hair and the
25<00:03:48.079> millimeter<00:03:48.409> hair<00:03:48.590> is<00:03:48.769> it<00:03:48.919> fits<00:03:49.250> into<00:03:49.430> the

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
25 millimeter hair is it fits into the

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.659 
25 millimeter hair is it fits into the
middle<00:03:49.760> of<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.150> back<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:51.889> 30-millimeter

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
middle of the back and the 30-millimeter

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.899 
middle of the back and the 30-millimeter
makes<00:03:53.120> more<00:03:53.359> like<00:03:53.540> ringlets<00:03:53.980> sizes<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.219> this

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
makes more like ringlets sizes and this

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.530 
makes more like ringlets sizes and this
one<00:03:56.120> makes<00:03:56.199> more<00:03:57.199> kills<00:03:57.889> and<00:03:58.310> 25<00:03:59.150> millimeter

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
one makes more kills and 25 millimeter

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.439 
one makes more kills and 25 millimeter
ones<00:03:59.689> if<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.019> have<00:04:00.199> like<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:01.340> middle<00:04:01.730> hair<00:04:02.000> so

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
ones if you have like the middle hair so

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.670 
ones if you have like the middle hair so
just<00:04:02.840> halfway<00:04:03.049> down<00:04:03.319> your<00:04:03.500> back<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:06.560> will

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
just halfway down your back it will

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.319 
just halfway down your back it will
probably<00:04:06.889> just<00:04:07.129> make<00:04:07.219> moves<00:04:07.579> which<00:04:07.879> is<00:04:08.150> why

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
probably just make moves which is why

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.969 
probably just make moves which is why
