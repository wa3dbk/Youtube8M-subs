00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.499
 Hello, I am a Beristain teacher 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.770
 Violet right school automotive 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:13.880
 and let's go to teach how to do the 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.880
 change of oil in a car 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.990
 we will place the car in the elevator and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.990
 after making sure that you can 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.900
 lift in conditions we will raise it 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.939
 we will look for the documentation of the car in 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.220
 she will show the type of oil 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.910
 use the amount of oil 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.250
 use the tooling to use the filter 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.250
 that we have to replace etc. 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.160
 etc 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.900
 we will put the deposit to collect the 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.059
 used oil under the crankcase and after 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.360
 let go of the jife screw 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.360
 sump 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.130
 to make this process easier to 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.980
 realize it 's interesting that the engine 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 be a bit hot here we have two 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.520
 one cartridge filters and the other is a 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.740
 filter that goes to thread or in this case in 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.650
 the model to which we are changing the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.650
 oil will carry a cartridge filter 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.540
 this oil is very toxic and therefore 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.820
 is a recycling company that is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.210
 pick it up 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.409
 with a tape wrench 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.909
 we will press the filter and release it and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.360
 then we will collect the oil in the 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.360
 Deposit 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.290
 Now what we will do is withdraw it 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.760
 the old cartridge of the casing where it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.280
 host 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.080
 then we will withdraw 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.950
 the plastic that makes the filter 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.900
 anchor to what is the housing it 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.360
 we'll put the filter again that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.740
 plastic 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.910
 and rinse the filter in the housing 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.830
 then we will remove the old board 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.150
 we will take the new board and the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.150
 we will undertake oil well 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.950
 and we will put a new O-ring 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:01.290
 in the case that it is a filter that is 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.379
 Thread impregnate we have oil well 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.000
 all the board so it does not dry out and 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.500
 barracks and then what 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.670
 by hand 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.670
 three fourth turns 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.940
 Now what we are going to do is screw 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:26.030
 the filter in its place and we will take it 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:29.560
 up to the top by hand and then you 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.560
 we will give the right tightening torque 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.190
 now we will proceed to put the screw 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.990
 of the crankcase in this case the screw 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.870
 the incorporates a washer 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.060
 if it does not become one where it incorporates 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.570
 the screw would have to replace the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.870
 washer that would have before for a new 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.599
 copper flag 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.890
 now we will lower the car to be able 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.890
 make the appointment 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.750
 now we will throw the indicated oil 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.080
 by the manufacturer and the amount in which 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.880
 it appeared in the manual that we have 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.080
 consulted at the beginning in this case 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.080
 would be 4.8 liters 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.940
 this is the dipstick of the oil level 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.520
 We would have to adjust the level between the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.710
 minimum and maximum level the minimum level 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.270
 would indicate us is fringe here and the 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.880
 maximum level would indicate us of this other 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.750
 fringe of here the right level would be 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.190
 the one between the two stripes 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.980
 now we will put the plug 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.409
 and we will start the car for about 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.110
 seconds 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:56.020
 and we will look at the oil level again 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.500
 If the level has decreased, we will return to 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.330
 complete a bit and with this already 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.320
 we would have finished the change of 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.310
 oil in summary these will be the steps 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.310
 main we have made 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.950
 we will elevate the car 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.750
 we will look for the car's documentation 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.450
 We will put the used oil tank to 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.980
 the torque of the crankcase screw 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.010
 let go of the crankcase screw and 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.650
 all the oil remains in the tank 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.000
 we will release the filter we will put the filter 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.550
 new 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.840
 we will place the screw 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.210
 we will lower the car and add oil 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.980
 we will check the amount by looking at the 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.090
 oil rod that is between the 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.090
 specified brands
