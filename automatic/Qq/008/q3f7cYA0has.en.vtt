00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
well now I know which batteries survive

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:47.389 
well now I know which batteries survive
the<00:00:34.649> winter<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.370> made<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:45.559> yep<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:47.129> that

my<00:03:50.090> love<00:03:50.360> rear<00:03:50.540> eagle<00:03:50.930> wouldn't<00:03:51.230> start<00:03:51.470> this

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
my love rear eagle wouldn't start this

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.460 
my love rear eagle wouldn't start this
year<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.430> at<00:03:52.550> this<00:03:52.730> problem<00:03:53.470> corrosion

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
year and at this problem corrosion

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.610 
year and at this problem corrosion
underneath<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.220> computer<00:03:55.700> plate<00:03:56.620> underneath

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
underneath the computer plate underneath

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.850 
underneath the computer plate underneath
the<00:03:57.860> spark<00:03:58.760> coils<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.750> let's<00:04:00.170> check<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.530> out

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the spark coils so let's check it out

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.729 
the spark coils so let's check it out
on<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.550> van<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:02.030> died<00:04:02.209> last<00:04:02.450> night<00:04:02.780> we<00:04:03.410> just

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
on this van it died last night we just

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.590 
on this van it died last night we just
towed<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.100> back<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.940> thing<00:04:05.209> sure<00:04:05.420> made<00:04:05.570> a

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
towed it back that thing sure made a

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.040 
towed it back that thing sure made a
great<00:04:05.840> tow<00:04:06.020> vehicle<00:04:07.390> since<00:04:08.390> they<00:04:08.600> both<00:04:08.750> have<00:04:08.989> a

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
great tow vehicle since they both have a

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.810 
great tow vehicle since they both have a
3.8<00:04:10.989> is<00:04:11.989> what<00:04:12.230> I'm<00:04:12.350> talking<00:04:12.739> about<00:04:12.800> your<00:04:13.520> coil

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
3.8 is what I'm talking about your coil

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.240 
3.8 is what I'm talking about your coil
packs<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.590> underneath<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.860> a<00:04:16.010> little

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
packs and underneath that is a little

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.490 
packs and underneath that is a little
quarter<00:04:16.640> inch<00:04:16.790> thick<00:04:17.000> computer<00:04:17.900> plate<00:04:18.109> it

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
quarter inch thick computer plate it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
quarter inch thick computer plate it
runs<00:04:18.709> everything<00:04:19.070> well<00:04:19.880> runs<00:04:20.540> in<00:04:21.370> men's<00:04:22.370> a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
runs everything well runs in men's a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.940 
runs everything well runs in men's a
spark<00:04:22.790> system<00:04:23.000> anyways<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.650> we've<00:04:24.800> already

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
spark system anyways so we've already

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.770 
spark system anyways so we've already
determined<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.580> has<00:04:25.700> no<00:04:25.880> spark<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:26.419> just<00:04:26.600> died

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
determined it has no spark it just died

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.630 
determined it has no spark it just died
while<00:04:26.990> driving<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:27.950> let's<00:04:28.190> take<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.460> plate

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
while driving so let's take the plate

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.460 
while driving so let's take the plate
off<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.820> see<00:04:29.120> what<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.390> problem<00:04:29.720> is

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.960 

well<00:04:33.470> just<00:04:33.800> then<00:04:33.979> do<00:04:34.160> all<00:04:34.370> six<00:04:34.669> of<00:04:34.850> these

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
well just then do all six of these

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.750 
well just then do all six of these
screws<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:39.710> start<00:04:40.040> out<00:04:40.190> plugging<00:04:40.610> these

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
screws and start out plugging these

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.850 
screws and start out plugging these
things<00:04:41.120> see<00:04:41.390> simple<00:04:41.840> as<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.140> they<00:04:42.380> just<00:04:42.620> plug

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
things see simple as that they just plug

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.050 
things see simple as that they just plug
right<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:43.300> get<00:04:44.300> them<00:04:44.479> out<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.720> way

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
right in get them out of the way

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.330 
right in get them out of the way
remember<00:04:47.060> which<00:04:47.240> order<00:04:47.479> they<00:04:47.600> came<00:04:47.810> off<00:04:48.020> in

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.170 

and<00:04:52.340> voila

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
and voila

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.549 
and voila
it's<00:04:53.990> off

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:55.559 
it's off

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:00.330 
it's off
