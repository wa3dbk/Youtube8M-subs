moisture in the ground now what I'm

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.809 
moisture in the ground now what I'm
going<00:01:18.779> to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:20.009> literally<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.609> but

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:20.819 
going to do now not literally now but

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.569 
going to do now not literally now but
the<00:01:20.880> next<00:01:21.090> couple<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.359> days<00:01:21.599> hmm<00:01:22.469> is<00:01:23.130> give<00:01:23.399> them

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
the next couple of days hmm is give them

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.999 
the next couple of days hmm is give them
another<00:01:23.819> feed<00:01:24.149> now<00:01:24.929> this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.469> sulfate<00:01:25.979> of

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
another feed now this is sulfate of

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.699 
another feed now this is sulfate of
potash<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.359> increases<00:01:27.929> flower<00:01:28.349> heads

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
potash now this increases flower heads

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.330 
potash now this increases flower heads
and<00:01:29.009> increases<00:01:29.669> demand<00:01:29.849> of<00:01:30.149> fruit<00:01:30.899> that

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
and increases demand of fruit that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.639 
and increases demand of fruit that
vegetables<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.639> fruit<00:01:33.090> trees<00:01:33.329> produced<00:01:33.779> so

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
vegetables and fruit trees produced so

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.050 
vegetables and fruit trees produced so
in<00:01:34.919> this<00:01:35.639> bag<00:01:36.829> I've<00:01:37.829> me<00:01:38.069> in<00:01:38.219> this<00:01:38.310> bag<00:01:38.639> there's

you can see on this one this main one

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.060 
you can see on this one this main one
will<00:02:17.450> come<00:02:17.600> out<00:02:17.870> from<00:02:18.380> here<00:02:18.530> that'll<00:02:18.920> be<00:02:18.980> the

will come out from here that'll be the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.040 
will come out from here that'll be the
first<00:02:19.100> thing<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.610> pops<00:02:19.790> here<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.240> then<00:02:20.780> in

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
first thing that pops here and then in

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.850 
first thing that pops here and then in
the<00:02:21.170> crux<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:22.460> this<00:02:23.240> upper<00:02:23.510> branch

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
the crux of that this upper branch

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.990 
the crux of that this upper branch
that'll<00:02:24.860> be<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> branch<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.430> produces

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
that'll be the branch that produces

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.480 
that'll be the branch that produces
flowers<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.630> produces<00:02:27.050> fruit<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:28.070> over<00:02:28.460> time

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
flowers and produces fruit so over time

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.400 
flowers and produces fruit so over time
because<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:29.510> don't<00:02:29.690> want<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.960> just<00:02:29.990> put<00:02:30.290> all

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
because we don't want it to just put all

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.260 
because we don't want it to just put all
of<00:02:30.440> at<00:02:30.620> energy<00:02:30.980> into<00:02:31.250> producing<00:02:31.520> foliage<00:02:32.120> we

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
want fruit you can strip some of these

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.850 
want fruit you can strip some of these
off<00:02:34.310> now<00:02:34.520> all<00:02:35.030> these<00:02:35.210> bottom<00:02:35.570> ones<00:02:35.780> right<00:02:36.620> down

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
off now all these bottom ones right down

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.340 
off now all these bottom ones right down
here<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:38.090> can<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:40.690> pull<00:02:41.690> those<00:02:41.840> bottom<00:02:42.170> ones

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
here you can just pull those bottom ones

here you can just pull those bottom ones
off<00:02:42.530> don't<00:02:43.400> delude<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.880> whole<00:02:44.060> plan<00:02:44.390> from<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
off don't delude the whole plan from the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.220 
off don't delude the whole plan from the
foliage<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:46.340> just<00:02:47.120> take<00:02:47.330> off<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.690> stragglers

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
foliage but just take off the stragglers

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.500 
foliage but just take off the stragglers
at<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.680> bottom<00:02:48.950> once<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.520> other<00:02:49.640> stems<00:02:50.300> have

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
at the bottom once the other stems have

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.050 
at the bottom once the other stems have
come<00:02:50.690> through<00:02:50.900> like<00:02:51.140> this<00:02:51.350> one<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:52.060> can

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
come through like this one you can

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.550 
come through like this one you can
pretty<00:02:53.360> much<00:02:53.420> take<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.840> lot<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.140> these<00:02:54.290> bigger

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
pretty much take a lot of these bigger

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.070 
pretty much take a lot of these bigger
ones<00:02:54.800> off<00:02:55.070> now<00:02:55.850> I'll<00:02:56.300> do<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> sulfate<00:02:57.050> of

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
ones off now I'll do the sulfate of

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.440 
ones off now I'll do the sulfate of
potash<00:02:57.200> today<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.670> like<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:58.940> was<00:02:59.060> saying<00:02:59.270> I'll

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
potash today and like I was saying I'll

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.940 
potash today and like I was saying I'll
do<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.750> in<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.960> next<00:03:00.080> couple<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.470> weeks<00:03:00.650> again

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
do it in the next couple of weeks again

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.000 
do it in the next couple of weeks again
I'll<00:03:01.430> keep<00:03:01.670> feeding<00:03:02.090> them<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.500> every<00:03:03.500> 10<00:03:03.800> days

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
I'll keep feeding them and every 10 days

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.210 
I'll keep feeding them and every 10 days
the<00:03:04.940> wetting<00:03:05.540> agent<00:03:05.900> now<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.830> I've<00:03:06.920> put<00:03:07.070> it

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
the wetting agent now that I've put it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.410 
the wetting agent now that I've put it
on<00:03:07.310> now<00:03:07.490> probably<00:03:07.790> won't<00:03:08.000> do<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.210> for<00:03:08.240> about

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
on now probably won't do it for about

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.630 
on now probably won't do it for about
another<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:09.140> probably<00:03:10.040> won't<00:03:10.250> do<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.550> again

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
another I probably won't do it again

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.310 
another I probably won't do it again
actually<00:03:11.090> unless<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.450> really<00:03:11.720> needs<00:03:12.080> it

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
actually unless it really needs it

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.560 
actually unless it really needs it
what's<00:03:13.190> gone<00:03:13.459> in<00:03:13.670> there<00:03:13.820> will<00:03:14.000> be<00:03:14.120> fine<00:03:14.330> for

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
what's gone in there will be fine for

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.270 
what's gone in there will be fine for
months<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:14.930> months<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.770> these<00:03:15.920> will<00:03:16.100> keep

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
months and months so these will keep

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.280 
months and months so these will keep
growing<00:03:16.459> I'll<00:03:16.790> come<00:03:17.000> back<00:03:17.239> probably<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:18.110> about

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
growing I'll come back probably in about

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.690 
growing I'll come back probably in about
another<00:03:18.500> month<00:03:19.209> or<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.480> there's<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.590> fruit<00:03:22.550> on

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
another month or so there's a fruit on

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.190 
another month or so there's a fruit on
there<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.390> don't<00:03:23.480> know<00:03:23.660> if<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:23.840> can<00:03:23.959> see

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
there in the I don't know if you can see

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.570 
there in the I don't know if you can see
it<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.470> camera<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:24.770> this<00:03:24.980> actually<00:03:25.130> fruit

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
it on the camera but this actually fruit

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.010 
it on the camera but this actually fruit
in<00:03:25.730> there<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.239> see<00:03:26.300> some<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.780> flower

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
in there you can see some of the flower

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.280 
in there you can see some of the flower
heads<00:03:27.320> here<00:03:28.330> this<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:29.510> actually<00:03:29.870> food<00:03:30.110> in

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
heads here this is actually food in

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.290 
heads here this is actually food in
there<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.040> once<00:03:31.220> that's<00:03:31.370> that's<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.850> ripen

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
there so once that's that's the ripen

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.449 
there so once that's that's the ripen
I'll<00:03:32.480> start<00:03:32.989> picking<00:03:33.320> them<00:03:33.500> off<00:03:33.620> now<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.190> main

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
I'll start picking them off now the main

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.100

was limited with space so I went for

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.210 
was limited with space so I went for
quantity<00:04:07.760> not<00:04:07.970> quality

plants so what I've actually done you

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.780 
plants so what I've actually done you
can't<00:04:53.200> see<00:04:53.410> it<00:04:53.560> in<00:04:53.740> there<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.130> round<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:54.430> basin

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
can't see it in there to round the basin

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.850 
can't see it in there to round the basin
around<00:04:55.030> on<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.240> other<00:04:55.420> side<00:04:55.630> with<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.500> rocket

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
around on the other side with the rocket

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.950 
around on the other side with the rocket
once<00:04:57.520> it<00:04:57.670> grew<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:58.090> cut<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.480> off<00:04:58.570> at<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.780> base

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
once it grew I cut it off at the base

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.800 
once it grew I cut it off at the base
and<00:04:59.260> grew<00:04:59.770> again<00:04:59.920> and<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.550> cut<00:05:00.790> it<00:05:00.910> again<00:05:01.180> now

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
and grew again and I cut it again now

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.360 
and grew again and I cut it again now
it's<00:05:01.990> just<00:05:02.140> pretty<00:05:02.320> much<00:05:02.500> got<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.860> straggly

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
it's just pretty much got to a straggly

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.510 
it's just pretty much got to a straggly
kind<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.760> ends<00:05:04.480> where<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.020> ends<00:05:05.320> or<00:05:05.980> bulb<00:05:06.310> and

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
kind of ends where the ends or bulb and

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.610 
kind of ends where the ends or bulb and
go<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.700> seed<00:05:07.620> like<00:05:08.620> those<00:05:10.050> pardon<00:05:11.050> me<00:05:11.140> so

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
go to seed like those pardon me so

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.900 
go to seed like those pardon me so
they'll<00:05:11.770> just<00:05:11.919> go<00:05:12.040> to<00:05:12.100> seeds<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.580> seeds<00:05:12.610> will

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
they'll just go to seeds the seeds will

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.670 
they'll just go to seeds the seeds will
drop<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.600> can<00:05:13.720> let<00:05:13.840> it<00:05:13.960> just<00:05:14.050> go<00:05:14.140> to<00:05:14.260> seed<00:05:14.530> and

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
drop you can let it just go to seed and

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.990 
drop you can let it just go to seed and
the<00:05:14.740> rocket<00:05:15.040> will<00:05:15.130> pop<00:05:15.280> up<00:05:15.310> again<00:05:15.520> next<00:05:15.820> year

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
the rocket will pop up again next year

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.020 
the rocket will pop up again next year
so<00:05:16.870> once<00:05:17.169> I<00:05:17.470> pull<00:05:18.010> most<00:05:18.220> of<00:05:18.430> those<00:05:18.520> out<00:05:18.820> as<00:05:19.000> well

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
so once I pull most of those out as well

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.770 
so once I pull most of those out as well
the<00:05:19.330> rocket<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:19.840> I'll<00:05:20.050> put<00:05:20.230> basil<00:05:20.440> in<00:05:20.740> so

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
the rocket and I'll put basil in so

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.670 
the rocket and I'll put basil in so
companion<00:05:22.780> planting<00:05:23.200> and<00:05:23.350> things<00:05:23.500> like<00:05:23.620> that

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
companion planting and things like that
