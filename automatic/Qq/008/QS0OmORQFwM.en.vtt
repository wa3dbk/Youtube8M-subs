00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.990 
other video on overview of volume
control<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:11.420> this<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.660> 4th<00:00:12.900> gen<00:00:13.200> touch<00:00:14.000> so

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
control so this is the 4th gen touch so

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.269 
control so this is the 4th gen touch so
and<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.780> like<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.139> remove<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.560> completely<00:00:16.710> from

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
and I like to remove it completely from

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.720 
and I like to remove it completely from
the<00:00:17.609> case<00:00:18.680> you've<00:00:19.680> either<00:00:19.859> broken<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.520> down

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
the case you've either broken it down

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.210 
the case you've either broken it down
there<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> volume<00:00:21.980> somewhere<00:00:22.980> down<00:00:23.189> in

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
there on the volume somewhere down in

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.500 
there on the volume somewhere down in
here<00:00:23.720> or<00:00:24.720> up<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:26.930> up<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.140> here

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
here or up in here up in here

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.280 
here or up in here up in here
but<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> mean<00:00:30.779> needs<00:00:31.050> replacing<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:33.020> we<00:00:34.020> want<00:00:34.230> to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
but I mean needs replacing so we want to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
but I mean needs replacing so we want to
get<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> nice<00:00:35.930> hot<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.230> bring<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:38.300> some<00:00:39.300> liquid

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
get a nice hot so bring on some liquid

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.310 
get a nice hot so bring on some liquid
flux<00:00:40.700> when<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> move<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.480> silicone<00:00:43.110> here

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
flux when I move this silicone here

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
flux when I move this silicone here
which<00:00:43.500> I've<00:00:43.680> already<00:00:43.920> done<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
which I've already done but it's that

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.049 
which I've already done but it's that
white<00:00:45.600> gluey<00:00:46.190> silicon<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.820> basically<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
white gluey silicon and then basically I

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.080 
white gluey silicon and then basically I
just<00:00:52.050> use<00:00:54.980> because<00:00:55.980> sometimes<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.550> glued<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
just use because sometimes it glued on a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:16.359 
just use because sometimes it glued on a
little<00:00:57.539> bit<00:00:57.690> too

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.459 

it's<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.789> bit<00:01:17.939> hard<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.479> camera<00:01:19.229> stuck

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
it's a little bit hard with camera stuck

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.359 
it's a little bit hard with camera stuck
in<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.770> way<00:01:20.810> you're<00:01:21.810> quite<00:01:22.079> often<00:01:22.259> rip<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
in the way you're quite often rip the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.630 
in the way you're quite often rip the
cable<00:01:24.109> it's<00:01:25.109> very<00:01:25.319> thin<00:01:25.740> when<00:01:26.280> you're<00:01:26.429> going

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
cable it's very thin when you're going

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.660 
cable it's very thin when you're going
to<00:01:26.759> remove<00:01:27.179> it<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.920> don't<00:01:28.920> stress<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.460> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
to remove it so don't stress if you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
to remove it so don't stress if you
leave<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.969> pay<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:31.590> put<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
leave it pay it on there just put a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.029 
leave it pay it on there just put a
little<00:01:31.979> bit<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.280> liquid<00:01:32.429> flux<00:01:32.789> on<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:34.039> and

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
little bit of liquid flux on again and

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:41.510 
little bit of liquid flux on again and
just<00:01:35.819> talk<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.209> them<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.509> quickly<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:40.520> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
just talk to them out quickly just go so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:52.389 
just talk to them out quickly just go so
you<00:01:41.609> get<00:01:41.789> formerly<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:47.479> continuity<00:01:48.479> for

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:05.380 

now<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.849> case<00:01:59.090> getting<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.390> plate

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.729 

which<00:02:06.390> looks<00:02:06.659> something<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:09.410> now<00:02:10.410> make

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
which looks something like that now make

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.009 
which looks something like that now make
sure<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:11.039> put<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.400> back<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> right<00:02:12.840> way

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
sure you put it back on the right way

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:22.960

all<00:03:49.030> these<00:03:49.209> really<00:03:49.480> thin<00:03:49.870> stuff<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.940> some

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
all these really thin stuff it's some

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.750 
all these really thin stuff it's some
point<00:03:53.140> three<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> mill<00:03:53.860> diameter<00:03:54.519> soda

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
point three of the mill diameter soda

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.740 
point three of the mill diameter soda
well<00:03:57.760> oh<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.239> think<00:03:58.420> it's<00:03:58.690> really<00:03:58.840> thin<00:04:03.569> we<00:04:04.569> just

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
well oh I think it's really thin we just

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.450 
well oh I think it's really thin we just
wanna

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:27.110 

put<00:04:13.460> a<00:04:13.490> little<00:04:13.700> bit<00:04:13.910> more<00:04:13.970> flux

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:49.040
