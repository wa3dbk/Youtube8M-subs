00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone, it gives me a lot 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.069
 nice to meet you again on the channel in 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 this time we are going to touch a topic 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.380
 infatuation and love web starting with 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.780
 the idea that falling in love is a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 stage the infatuation and love are two 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 very different things 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.279
 right now explain why the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.160
 crush is a stage where we 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.760
 attracts a person we started to meet her 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.570
 and this stage is equal to the maximum we 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.059
 we feel super well up physically 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.190
 excited topa is that it is going great 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.489
 the person we are with is what 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.720
 maximum we give almost pure qualities not 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.300
 we give him defects and this stage 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.900
 in psychologists or knowledgeable people or 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.600
 so it lasts two years after these 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.750
 two years and the defects of the person 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.550
 they start to come out and this is where the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.230
 relationship or continues or ends because they are 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.390
 many flaws and we do not like them and 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.580
 then it ends not but if in a 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.080
 principle these senses and this is the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.760
 I can share a bit already from a 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.740
 experience when you have to turn 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.610
 louis everything was maximum of wonderful 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.770
 to see it 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 two years go by and if I started seeing these 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.890
 little things and their flaws and everything but of course 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.560
 that its virtues and what I like is 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.790
 much more than the defects then 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.920
 those flaws are not that important 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.220
 for me then this is where I already 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.479
 then you move on to a stage of love and 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.619
 falling in love before I was giving them 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.450
 previously 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.460
 here until chemically ours that 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.530
 our body changes our body 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.479
 produces endorphins is being at the end 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.729
 It also occurs when we do 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.000
 example exercise that we feel very 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.310
 all right 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.020
 simply love is changing and 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.750
 this process or this stage of 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.360
 falling in love we went to the stage of love 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.210
 in this stage of love it is said that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.120
 start loving someone when you leave 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.330
 to be in love is not that of being 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.840
 enamored be a bad one is very good but 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.340
 must evolve to a more mature love 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.410
 there are people who are addicted to falling in love 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.000
 then you can be very excited in 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.010
 a relationship but as soon as you see the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.860
 effects of the other person decide 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.050
 finish like I do not know they do not look for you and 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.850
 continues with another one becomes enamored and 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.520
 these are already disappointed with the defects 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.590
 and short or end and in a marriage 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.620
 we can also see it as a person 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.340
 who is addicted to infatuation as already 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.500
 He is married and he no longer feels that 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.290
 I felt before, loving is not a 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.360
 feeling is a decision and in the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.830
 infatuation if there is more 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.770
 feeling then a married person 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.290
 that he no longer feels so father and so 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.080
 say for your partner well good equal and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.310
 look for that feeling with someone else and 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.060
 This is where you can enter 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.819
 infidelities so that love lasts and 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.190
 prevail in a marriage for sure 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.640
 you have to have details that love 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.830
 grow day by day and mature day by day 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.680
 both people with conclusion about the 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.920
 love is not to share what love is 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.910
 is based on reality not in dreams 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.910
 nor in fantasies of the prince charming that 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.890
 many times we are already woman from 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.900
 chiquitas s chiquitas program us and 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.580
 we started to see this disney the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.489
 princesses and we all want our 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.769
 prince blue the perfect man or the 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.310
 perfect woman and there are no men and 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.920
 perfect women and nothing else or you 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.560
 say neither yo nor josé luís nor I are 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.500
 perfect but we are perfect together 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.320
 they understand us 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.390
 Then look for that person with the 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.760
 that complements you is that person 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.490

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.230
 good things and you also that one that 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.210
