00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 good morning friends and rubÃ©n and we are in 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 a new sky wars video and let's see 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.470
 how much does this game come out you know 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.330
 that as always I start with the kit 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.700
 iron is worth the iron armor that I 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.500
 I think it's definitely the best thing 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.870
 I already tell you, it's always worth it, I'll go back to 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.880
 repeat let's take all this see by 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.550
 here there is no car and well we are 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.830
 in the map of mus rom is worth here in the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.170
 craft cube server to view or fish tank 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.240
 perfect diamond okay we do not have to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.490
 arch but we can make one worth 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.219
 so I think the first thing is going to be 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 equip us this obviously also the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.920
 Cheeky is delighted, so great 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.540
 this over here to see this out we 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.649
 we put this here I always like it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.649
 order me everything 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.800
 worth this this and this is worth at 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.380
 first of all and primordial is 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.400
 get wood worth look there already 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.190
 they're fighting we 're going where are you going where 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.750
 the other teammates where you go is worth not 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.260
 there's wood I just realized that 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.239
 there is no wood 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.059
 so without wood we can not do 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.729
 absolutely nothing and we only have then 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.710
 that I have dropped that water in milk 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.550
 Jewish but you want to stop that you 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.790
 I bust my mother what a nightmare you 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.170
 voucher voucher 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.170
 it's getting heavy 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 and he wants to catch 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.380
 vale vale vale let's see at the moment 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 I need construction material like this 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.570
 that although it is of this but I need 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.860
 battery because with 10 stone I do not 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.100
 nothing the truth so let's see this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.950
 for here it's worth 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.930
 and that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.840
 I should get more the truth but 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.729
 good is that as there is no wood though 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.060
 well I could not have a peak either 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.860
 chop style because I can not this is 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.049
 wood there is no account or I have not 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.310
 account voucher voucher voucher with wood this 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:12.550
 yes yes yes we will not do 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:15.580
 a bow this around here this is worth it 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.110
 and it's worth perfect, well, now that 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.849
 yes we will be able to make us a bow 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.090
 well I only have two arrows but it 's 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.680
 better is better than nothing is worth this is already 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.580
 something is worth I do not realize that I had 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.240
 out there wood so something is something to 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.450
 see and not damn it be 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.190
 if I give the Eskimo please 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.980
 what's wrong I'm going to build I'm going to 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.200
 play as you play to see it because it's that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.350
 I have no other possibility because the other 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.860
 island more burst since I do not have a 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.860
 good sword 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.080
 OK 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.830
 to see what is here, what I am going to 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.670
 catch is the wood that is here 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.250
 ok let's take this little bag that we 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.370
 it's going to come in handy to see if it does not break 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.890
 the floor is perfect, this is more 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.720
 wood still and let's go towards the 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.400
 island next door 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.060
 that there is no path will touch me 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.060
 build it 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.970
 ok yes we are going to build towards the island 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.650
 next door a few of us were 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.570
 we were five grams very few the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.450
 I really need arrows 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.740
 honestly I would like to face 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.110
 someone to remove arrows to see if 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.370
 has what happens is that of course I 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.950
 I do not have a very good team either 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.340
 armor I go great armor voucher I go 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.590
 great but what is of weapons I already have 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.800
 a damn wooden sword I do not 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.410
 nothing with that and let's see 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.050
 which are fighting there really my 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.700
 only option would be to try to shoot him with 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.950
 the 8 balls that I have of snow 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.340
 which obviously is not precisely 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.410
 a lot but good you can can 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.090
 try the truth is worth going up 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.440
 upwards that apparently have 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.840
 built around there I have not noticed 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.560
 and we were spending material down 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.620
 OK 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.920
 ok we are left is that I fall 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.750
 I almost fell worth a certain food no 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.880
 I have no food, I 'm going to see if 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.610
 this gentleman has left something here if it is 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.470
 so kind to have left something 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.540
 nothing has been left and here 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.030
 more of the same they have not left anything 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.700
 I shit in the milk I'm already very fucked or 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.190
 either we were 3 but where I see or 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.100
 I do not have absolutely anything either 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.830
 I'm in serious real trouble 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.710
 I do not have food on top of it so we're going to 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.030
 watch 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:52.590
 a boy almost perfect meal food 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.420
 and perfect vale let's see to see if it 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.550
 has left something here nothing is tube 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.260
 empty it has to be I should consider 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.150
 build towards the center but but 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.250
 Of course I have a hard time 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.460
 try to throw the one who was 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.270
 building there look has just fallen 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.130
 we were two vouchers we were two 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.520
 and I'm going to try to build, I'm going to 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.800
 play if it's not there it's there I'm going to 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.530
 try to build me I'm playing 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.920
 very much but seriously I need 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.920
 I need whatever 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.840
 because if I do not, I will not be able to 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.840
 do nothing 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.379
 OK 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:44.430
 he has not thrown me damn he has thrown me 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.040
 and goes and goes towards the center that is me is 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.230
 quite the truth but but of course what 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.050
 I had very difficult because I did not have 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.220
 had a bow or anything but the truth 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.910
 It means that I have been hit by a 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.230
 authentic crush incredible the truth 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.240
 but good and second is the truth that 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.310
 every time I'm surviving more even 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.620
 it's even that he was without valuable weapons 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.840
 and swims a wooden sword and without a bow 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.180
 or nothing had very good armor but 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.940
 clear without no weapons to attack then 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.400
 like I can not do anything and good 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.300
 I did not have weapons at a distance because of 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.130
 snowballs and eggs 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.660
 navas that I had 8 you had and that you did not 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.150
 I did a lot with that but good 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.040
 I also think it was not bad 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.660
 the truth remained second I continue 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.280
 being among the first the truth 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.320
 that I basically always aim for 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.360
 is in between the top 34 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.480
 because I think it's a good position and 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.010
 well there I am looking at my statistics 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.020
 and well what I said, I hope that I have 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.610
 much liked this game is worth the 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.620
 it stays second the next day I'll try 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.080
 be better to see if they touch me better 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.940
 arms and not guys this that I have 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.860
 liked to leave a great like 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.450
 this game leaves a comment that what 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.130
 For unto you is like it and see you 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.130
