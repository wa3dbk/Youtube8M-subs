torque so we're going to find out today
why<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.330> most<00:01:36.570> evil<00:01:36.840> cat<00:01:37.080> dragon<00:01:37.530> as

why this is the most evil cat dragon as
evident<00:01:40.100> as<00:01:41.100> we've<00:01:41.340> seen<00:01:41.580> yet<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
evident as we've seen yet that is a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.460 
evident as we've seen yet that is a
perfect<00:01:42.960> car<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.530> half<00:01:44.190> 17<00:01:44.940> rooms<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.900> it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
perfect car for half 17 rooms and it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.320 
perfect car for half 17 rooms and it
makes<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.010> much<00:01:47.220> fun<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.730> hand<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.090> around

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
makes so much fun to hand it around

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.600 
makes so much fun to hand it around
every<00:01:48.720> corner<00:01:48.900> so<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:49.890> got<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.130> racetrack

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
every corner so if you got the racetrack

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.610 
every corner so if you got the racetrack
nearby<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.330> really<00:01:51.630> should<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.290> like

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
nearby you really should go there like

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.350 
nearby you really should go there like
every<00:01:52.980> weekend<00:01:53.370> because<00:01:53.550> that's<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.120> perfect

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
every weekend because that's the perfect

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.260 
every weekend because that's the perfect
calf<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.650> not<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.860> car<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.400> for<00:01:56.700> for

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
calf of it it's not a car like for for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
calf of it it's not a car like for for
slow<00:01:57.750> cruising<00:01:58.350> or<00:01:58.500> something<00:01:58.830> like<00:01:58.950> that

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
slow cruising or something like that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.980 
slow cruising or something like that
then<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.730> should<00:01:59.910> rather<00:02:00.300> get<00:02:00.510> in<00:02:00.630> GT<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
then you should rather get in GT a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.230 
then you should rather get in GT a
Jaguar<00:02:01.440> XK<00:02:01.800> for<00:02:02.010> example<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> Jaguar

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
Jaguar XK for example but a Jaguar

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
Jaguar XK for example but a Jaguar
f-type<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.570> clearly<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.260> sports<00:02:04.620> car<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.490> so

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
f-type is clearly a sports car and so

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.580 
f-type is clearly a sports car and so
for<00:02:05.880> example<00:02:05.940> here<00:02:06.360> when<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.690> got<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:07.350> roads

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
for example here when we got like roads

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.160 
for example here when we got like roads
which<00:02:07.800> are<00:02:07.920> rather<00:02:08.310> bumpy<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.960> at<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
which are rather bumpy you see it at the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
which are rather bumpy you see it at the
steering<00:02:10.410> wheel<00:02:10.740> as<00:02:10.980> soon<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.490> some<00:02:12.000> bumps

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
steering wheel as soon as some bumps

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.630 
steering wheel as soon as some bumps
come<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.080> road<00:02:13.290> changes<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.310> steering

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
come and the road changes the steering

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.610 
come and the road changes the steering
wheel<00:02:14.760> kind<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.270> works<00:02:15.510> for<00:02:15.780> itself<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.230> bit<00:02:16.380> so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
wheel kind of works for itself a bit so

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.350 
wheel kind of works for itself a bit so
you<00:02:16.650> really<00:02:17.070> have<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> hold<00:02:17.520> tight<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
you really have to hold tight to the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.590 
you really have to hold tight to the
steering<00:02:18.420> wheel<00:02:19.190> it's<00:02:20.190> not<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:21.150> comfy

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
steering wheel it's not that comfy

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.660 
steering wheel it's not that comfy
driving<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.350> really<00:02:22.710> have<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.980> work<00:02:23.280> with<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
driving you really have to work with the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.580 
driving you really have to work with the
car<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.120> that's<00:02:24.450> also<00:02:24.750> intentional<00:02:25.410> it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
car and that's also intentional it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.100 
car and that's also intentional it
should<00:02:25.800> be<00:02:25.980> like<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.190> working<00:02:26.730> sports<00:02:27.120> car<00:02:27.420> you

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
should be like a working sports car you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.380 
should be like a working sports car you
should<00:02:28.140> feel<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.950> road<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.880> know<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.270> a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
should feel the road you know it's a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.840 
should feel the road you know it's a
direct<00:02:30.810> translation<00:02:31.110> from<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.680> road<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
direct translation from the road to the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.290 
direct translation from the road to the

that's still fine you can still close
the<00:05:42.130> roof<00:05:42.520> so<00:05:42.850> that's<00:05:43.090> very<00:05:43.330> practical<00:05:44.550> what

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
the roof so that's very practical what

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.620 
the roof so that's very practical what
is<00:05:45.670> not<00:05:45.820> so<00:05:46.060> practical

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
is not so practical

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.530 
is not so practical
cause<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.200> trunk<00:05:47.520> but<00:05:48.520> I<00:05:48.550> must<00:05:48.820> say<00:05:48.970> as<00:05:49.210> I<00:05:49.240> saw

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
cause the trunk but I must say as I saw

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.870 
cause the trunk but I must say as I saw
it<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:49.750> first<00:05:49.960> time<00:05:50.170> it<00:05:50.470> looked<00:05:50.680> smaller<00:05:51.100> and

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
it the first time it looked smaller and

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.320 
it the first time it looked smaller and
