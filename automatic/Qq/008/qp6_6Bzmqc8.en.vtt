00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.890
 sixteen and a half thousand vineyards 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.720
 sticks in a greenhouse 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.179
 no cupboard can be found anywhere in europe 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.570
 become a driver on such a large scale 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.090
 shared 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.190
 make marijn the part 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.180
 from the new concept to the experience 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.289
 from joep and monique van schaik from ankle 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.630
 Southern European circumstances are becoming real 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.910
 simulated 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.789
 as you see they will prosper 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.699
 they asked a lot of tasty but my climate 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.980
 He also called to search and measure ranking 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 because it is well above 20 degrees 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.070
 while biden then maybe that again 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.750
 was withheld so hear so hot 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 the idea was born when the odds came up 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.870
 Engelseweg light came out 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.370
 and a new destination for this 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.140
 had to be found 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 a man came back from Spain and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760
 said we will say yes maybe something 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.520
 van drive and so on 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.140
 well looked on the internet than once 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 residential area to find anything though 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.030
 table grapes but none really yes not really 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.899
 of wine and such and that was now unpleasant 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.129
 What do special things fine and you 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.880
 actually it came from a it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.960
 other 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.600
 so we have our own a little bit 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.119
 and the park in Germany and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.220
 done and yes they are 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.650
 started on a large scale 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.800
 commercial 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.730
 growing wine grapes is in a greenhouse 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.080
 quite unique 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.880
 there are a number of projects more 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.740
 I think somewhere down in the Netherlands 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.720
 one more but so on especially you this 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.340
 not gone why was it not done 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.990
 do you have any idea 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.520
 normal for the climate in ireland 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.500
 now not really not that who 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.210
 is perfect for for viticulture 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.800
 choose most people who think 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.590
 want to continue professionally with with with 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.600
 with wine possible to deal with 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.890
 settle in countries where the team's heart 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.260
 could be more suitable more suitable 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.820
 actually so me i would have started now 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.830
 again with wonder than ever and me differently 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.750
 your wine driver is sorry table grapes 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.060
 well in the Netherlands tomorrow in the greenhouse 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.490
 child shared but wine grapes at my 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.220
 now also know the soil of vineyard each 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.840
 andrÃ© that had been empty for 8 years 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.610
 purchased 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.400
 are in this field of 2 hectares 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.470
 grapes grown from the chardonnay grass 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.060
 no hans and his daughter so the pigs 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.860
 strong varieties 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.120
 used here and we really have 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.810
 for the traditional 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.170
 luxury luxury varieties selected who already have the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.920
 simplicity simplicity has been the for years 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.510
 produce tastiest wines and we are 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.540
 just 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.190
 southern europe dementia sufferers actually here 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.870
 the couple itself has no affinity with 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.489
 producing wine 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.920
 that is why they receive help from, among others, the 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.290
 former owner of each entrance and and 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.480
 winemaking consultant 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.519
 because there is nowhere in Europe wine on this 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.959
 is being produced there is a lot 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.970
 attention from abroad 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.940
 so the Germans would like the project 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.940
 closely watching how it feels up 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.870
 yes quite good but it is also good 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.579
 it is actually all very exciting 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.549
 also all where we think it is 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.129
 is going to be and if so it is anyway 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.019
 dominating is actually yes there 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.480
 is still working hard to get everything ready 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.489
 before the opening on Friday then 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.810
 the restaurant opens 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.190
 it is intended that on both 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.390
 locations excursions are organized 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.489
 well what do we can choose to order 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.200
 a small scale start and but it 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.220
 problem is all three years 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.510
 to wait 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.269
 this is an old would choose then 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.590
 immediately cat full and and becomes ria bleaching 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.150
 the successes are still something 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.660
 'm wrong three years so the wait is 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.450
 a guess 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.569
 the financial press bets on right away 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.940
 do this scale but what we believe 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:40.090
 the self sacred in the globe 18th concept 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.790
 that this is going to work 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.579
 guessing the presses and distillation will 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.230
 in Egchel take place in September 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.579
 follows a start to produce 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.769
 wine 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.019
 still driving with purchased over 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.090
 three years are the first grapes of the 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.099
 vineyard then grab the first 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.099
 wine from the experience
