00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
field in those cases it's really easy to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.880 
field in those cases it's really easy to
get<00:00:38.820> out<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.840> some<00:00:40.050> work<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.800> if

get out there and do some work but if
you<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> nice<00:00:41.670> crop<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.960> start<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you do have a nice crop up you start to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.750 
you do have a nice crop up you start to
think<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.920> wow<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.579> I've<00:00:44.730> got

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
think about it wow you know I've got

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.299 
think about it wow you know I've got
crop<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.570> let's<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.050> say<00:00:46.230> 30<00:00:46.590> inch<00:00:46.800> rows<00:00:47.039> for

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
crop in let's just say 30 inch rows for

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.310 
crop in let's just say 30 inch rows for
example<00:00:47.789> how<00:00:48.090> much<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.539> crap<00:00:48.870> am<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.170> going

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
example how much of that crap am I going

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.319 
example how much of that crap am I going
to<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> tear<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.399> I'm<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.030> doing

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
to have to tear up if I'm just doing

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
to have to tear up if I'm just doing
tile<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.899> certain<00:00:52.320> parts<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.739> field<00:00:53.010> well

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
tile in certain parts of the field well

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
tile in certain parts of the field well
here's<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> way<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> look<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> whole<00:00:54.539> thing

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
here's the way I look at the whole thing

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.689 
here's the way I look at the whole thing
if<00:00:54.960> let's<00:00:55.230> say<00:00:55.350> you're<00:00:55.620> putting<00:00:55.920> tile<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.399> even

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
if let's say you're putting tile in even

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
if let's say you're putting tile in even
pattern<00:00:57.149> tiling<00:00:57.600> you're<00:00:57.840> only<00:00:57.989> going<00:00:58.289> every

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
pattern tiling you're only going every

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.830 
pattern tiling you're only going every
50<00:00:59.070> feet<00:00:59.100> okay<00:00:59.850> so<00:00:59.910> you're<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> tear<00:01:00.719> up

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
50 feet okay so you're going to tear up

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
50 feet okay so you're going to tear up
a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.020> bit<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.559> crop<00:01:01.739> every<00:01:02.010> 50<00:01:02.460> feet<00:01:02.489> but

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
a little bit of crop every 50 feet but

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
a little bit of crop every 50 feet but
even<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.870> not<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.320> bad<00:01:04.769> because

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
even there it's not that bad because

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.490 
even there it's not that bad because
what<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.489> found<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.000> our<00:01:06.090> own<00:01:06.270> fields<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.200> we

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
what we found in our own fields is as we

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.039 
what we found in our own fields is as we
go<00:01:07.680> through<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.460> pull<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> plow<00:01:09.150> right<00:01:09.750> in

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
go through we can pull the plow right in

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.469 
go through we can pull the plow right in
between<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.740> rows<00:01:10.950> quite<00:01:11.490> often<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.060> we

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
between the rows quite often and we

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
between the rows quite often and we
really<00:01:12.900> don't<00:01:13.080> rip<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.860> whole<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.280> yes<00:01:14.729> it's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
really don't rip up a whole lot yes it's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.480 
really don't rip up a whole lot yes it's
going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.390> move<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.189> settles

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
going to move some but then that settles

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.730 
going to move some but then that settles
back<00:01:17.790> down<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> most<00:01:18.930> part<00:01:19.080> we're

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
back down and for the most part we're

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
back down and for the most part we're
talking<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.220> less<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:20.640> five<00:01:21.060> percent<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
talking about less than five percent of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.030 
talking about less than five percent of
the<00:01:21.689> plants<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> whole<00:01:22.380> field<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.920> we've

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the plants in the whole field that we've

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.469 
the plants in the whole field that we've
actually<00:01:23.250> killed<00:01:23.759> well<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.299> less<00:01:24.450> than

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
actually killed well if it's less than

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
actually killed well if it's less than
five<00:01:24.810> percent<00:01:25.229> what's<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.799> really<00:01:25.979> amount<00:01:26.369> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
five percent what's it really amount to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
five percent what's it really amount to
because<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.600> year<00:01:27.869> deal<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
because this is a one year deal the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
because this is a one year deal the
other<00:01:28.530> big<00:01:28.770> thing<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.220> Darren<00:01:29.520> mentioned<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
other big thing like Darren mentioned is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
other big thing like Darren mentioned is
usually<00:01:30.600> we're<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.470> through<00:01:31.710> doing<00:01:32.040> spring

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
usually we're going through doing spring

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.399 
usually we're going through doing spring
tiling<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.909> areas<00:01:33.360> where<00:01:33.570> we've<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.200> some

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
tiling in areas where we've got some

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
tiling in areas where we've got some
issues<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> reason<00:01:35.369> why<00:01:35.400> retiling<00:01:35.820> in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
issues that's the reason why retiling in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
issues that's the reason why retiling in
the<00:01:36.090> first<00:01:36.299> place<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.079> weren't<00:01:37.259> getting

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the first place so we weren't getting

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
the first place so we weren't getting
that<00:01:37.920> great<00:01:38.130> crop<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.939> weren't<00:01:39.150> getting

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
that great crop there we weren't getting

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510 
that great crop there we weren't getting
250<00:01:39.990> bushel<00:01:40.290> corn<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:40.770> want<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.310> can

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
250 bushel corn like we want if we can

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
250 bushel corn like we want if we can
make<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.729> more<00:01:42.210> productive<00:01:42.960> over<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> next

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
make that more productive over the next

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
make that more productive over the next
few<00:01:43.770> years<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.850> we're<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.180> after

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
few years that's what we're really after

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.149 
few years that's what we're really after
we<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.439> point<00:01:46.649> well<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
we got to get to that point well the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.319 
we got to get to that point well the
other<00:01:47.250> thing<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.790> you're<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.090> tell

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
other thing is if you're going to tell

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.969 
other thing is if you're going to tell
your<00:01:48.600> whole<00:01:48.810> farm<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.290> you've<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.560> lots<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
your whole farm and you've got lots of

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
your whole farm and you've got lots of
work<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:51.119> are<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> find

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
work to do when are you going to find

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.899 
work to do when are you going to find
time<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.380> look<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.369> fall<00:01:53.640> for

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
time to do it look at this fall for

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
time to do it look at this fall for
example<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.479> ended<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.780> being<00:01:55.049> pretty<00:01:55.229> wet<00:01:55.649> in

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
example we ended up being pretty wet in

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.920 
example we ended up being pretty wet in
our<00:01:56.040> area<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> guys<00:01:57.420> had<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> hard

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
our area and a lot of guys had a hard

our area and a lot of guys had a hard
time<00:01:57.990> getting<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> crop<00:01:58.829> out<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.369> many<00:01:59.729> cases

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
time getting the crop out in many cases

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.569 
time getting the crop out in many cases
that<00:02:00.360> crop<00:02:00.570> came<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.229> spring

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
that crop came out in the spring

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.499 
that crop came out in the spring
unfortunately<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.729> shade<00:02:02.969> Aaron<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.360> had

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
unfortunately this shade Aaron we had

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
unfortunately this shade Aaron we had
two<00:02:03.780> days<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.049> do<00:02:04.740> tiling<00:02:05.159> last<00:02:05.340> fall<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.670> tiled

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
two days to do tiling last fall we tiled

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
two days to do tiling last fall we tiled
two<00:02:06.149> days<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.570> our<00:02:06.600> farm<00:02:06.869> literally<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.920> you

to
my<00:02:11.840> harvest<00:02:12.140> done<00:02:12.350> early<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:12.800> then<00:02:13.040> I'll<00:02:13.190> have

a<00:02:13.400> good<00:02:13.700> month<00:02:13.970> before<00:02:14.270> we<00:02:14.600> start<00:02:14.840> getting

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
a good month before we start getting

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.930 
a good month before we start getting
really<00:02:15.410> cold<00:02:15.650> or<00:02:15.950> we<00:02:16.070> get<00:02:16.190> some<00:02:16.430> snow<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.850> our

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
really cold or we get some snow in our

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.240 
really cold or we get some snow in our
area<00:02:17.230> good<00:02:18.230> luck<00:02:18.500> with<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.770> theory

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
area good luck with that theory

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.280 
area good luck with that theory
especially<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.210> Upper<00:02:20.510> Midwest<00:02:20.540> yeah

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
especially in the Upper Midwest yeah

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.230 
especially in the Upper Midwest yeah
we've<00:02:21.500> really<00:02:22.010> made<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.220> huge<00:02:22.340> difference<00:02:22.910> in

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
we've really made a huge difference in

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.940 
we've really made a huge difference in
our<00:02:23.330> farm<00:02:23.570> by<00:02:23.750> putting<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.410> much<00:02:24.530> side<00:02:24.800> we

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
our farm by putting in so much side we

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.070 
our farm by putting in so much side we
put<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.280> over<00:02:25.550> 60<00:02:25.940> miles<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.330> tile<00:02:26.600> in<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.870> last

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
put in over 60 miles of tile in the last

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.630 
put in over 60 miles of tile in the last
three<00:02:27.320> years<00:02:27.350> on<00:02:27.710> our<00:02:27.830> farm<00:02:28.070> we<00:02:28.130> still<00:02:28.490> have<00:02:28.580> a

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
three years on our farm we still have a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.920 
three years on our farm we still have a
little<00:02:28.820> bit<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.150> go<00:02:29.300> but<00:02:29.330> we're<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:29.630> about

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
little bit to go but we're just about

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.260 
little bit to go but we're just about
done<00:02:30.080> but<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.860> has<00:02:30.980> completely<00:02:31.640> changed<00:02:31.790> some

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
done but it has completely changed some

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.270 
done but it has completely changed some
of<00:02:32.300> these<00:02:32.480> fields<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.410> it's<00:02:33.620> whole<00:02:33.920> new

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
of these fields it's like it's whole new

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.220 
of these fields it's like it's whole new
ground<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.790> just<00:02:35.000> can't<00:02:35.240> believe<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.870> going<00:02:36.110> out

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
ground I just can't believe it going out

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.780 
ground I just can't believe it going out
in<00:02:36.320> some<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.560> these<00:02:36.620> fields<00:02:37.040> they're<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.610> much

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
in some of these fields they're so much

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.460 
in some of these fields they're so much
more<00:02:37.850> productive<00:02:38.360> now<00:02:38.690> it's<00:02:38.960> a<00:02:39.020> lot<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.320> fun

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
more productive now it's a lot of fun

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.140 
more productive now it's a lot of fun
but<00:02:39.770> anyway<00:02:40.070> getting<00:02:40.280> back<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:40.820> why<00:02:41.090> you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
but anyway getting back to this why you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.000 
but anyway getting back to this why you
would<00:02:41.450> want<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.690> tile<00:02:41.930> now<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:42.470> compared<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.860> in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
would want a tile now as compared to in

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.560 
would want a tile now as compared to in
the<00:02:43.100> fall<00:02:43.370> or<00:02:43.700> maybe<00:02:43.880> in<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.090> very<00:02:44.450> early

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
the fall or maybe in the very early

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.540 
the fall or maybe in the very early
spring<00:02:45.110> before<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.500> start<00:02:45.770> planting<00:02:46.190> here's

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
spring before you start planting here's

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.340 
spring before you start planting here's
the<00:02:46.760> number<00:02:47.060> one<00:02:47.240> reason<00:02:47.420> when<00:02:47.930> you're<00:02:48.080> tiling

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
the number one reason when you're tiling

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.710 
the number one reason when you're tiling
yourself<00:02:48.860> it's<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.460> lot<00:02:49.850> more<00:02:50.090> fun<00:02:50.360> when<00:02:50.570> it's

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
yourself it's a lot more fun when it's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.200 
yourself it's a lot more fun when it's
70<00:02:51.170> or<00:02:51.320> 80<00:02:51.500> degrees<00:02:51.890> outside<00:02:52.130> as<00:02:52.550> compared<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
70 or 80 degrees outside as compared to

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.970 
70 or 80 degrees outside as compared to
when<00:02:53.420> its<00:02:53.630> twenty<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.200> mean<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:54.620> not<00:02:54.800> the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
when its twenty I mean it's not the

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.740 
when its twenty I mean it's not the
hardest<00:02:55.370> job<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.880> world<00:02:55.940> or<00:02:56.300> anything<00:02:56.450> but

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
hardest job in the world or anything but

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.720 
hardest job in the world or anything but
still<00:02:57.080> you're<00:02:57.470> going<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.710> get<00:02:57.890> wet<00:02:58.190> probably

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
still you're going to get wet probably

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.580 
still you're going to get wet probably
you're<00:02:58.940> going<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.180> get<00:02:59.330> muddy<00:02:59.660> and<00:02:59.960> when<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
year when we get to the late fall it

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.010 
year when we get to the late fall it
gets<00:03:16.040> down<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.280> maybe<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.730> half<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.239> mile<00:03:17.450> per<00:03:17.840> day

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
of year we have to go in and pre rip the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.479 
of year we have to go in and pre rip the
ground<00:03:27.080> when<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.590> ground<00:03:27.739> is<00:03:27.950> partially

ground when the ground is partially

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.610 
ground when the ground is partially
frozen<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:29.390> takes<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.870> lot<00:03:30.020> more<00:03:30.050> time<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.500> make

frozen it takes a lot more time to make

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.380 
frozen it takes a lot more time to make
connections<00:03:30.980> it's<00:03:31.550> hard<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.850> get<00:03:31.970> anybody<00:03:32.180> to

of the field that tile is running we're

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.219 
of the field that tile is running we're
getting<00:04:43.729> benefit<00:04:44.150> from<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.509> right<00:04:44.750> now<00:04:44.930> and

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:50.719 
because you get a better crop canopy

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:52.270 
because you get a better crop canopy
you'll<00:04:50.900> have<00:04:50.990> better<00:04:51.139> weed<00:04:51.439> control<00:04:51.650> I<00:04:52.009> mean

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
you'll have better weed control I mean

and this is no joke seriously I mean on
our<00:05:18.169> farm<00:05:18.409> I<00:05:18.560> figured<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.069> first<00:05:19.340> field<00:05:19.699> we

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
our farm I figured the first field we

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.480 
our farm I figured the first field we
did<00:05:20.300> we'd<00:05:20.810> already<00:05:20.990> paid<00:05:21.229> for<00:05:21.439> everything<00:05:21.680> it

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
did we'd already paid for everything it

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.029 
did we'd already paid for everything it
comes<00:05:22.759> back<00:05:23.000> really<00:05:23.479> fast<00:05:23.779> not<00:05:24.590> just<00:05:24.800> in<00:05:24.949> the

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
comes back really fast not just in the

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.589 
comes back really fast not just in the
yield<00:05:25.250> gain<00:05:25.460> or<00:05:25.580> anything<00:05:25.879> else<00:05:26.060> but<00:05:26.270> in<00:05:26.479> the

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
yield gain or anything else but in the

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.749 
yield gain or anything else but in the
savings<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:27.259> you<00:05:27.529> doing<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:27.889> yourself<00:05:28.009> versus

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
savings of you doing it yourself versus

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.610 
savings of you doing it yourself versus
hiring<00:05:29.180> it<00:05:29.330> done<00:05:29.539> plus<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:30.080> other<00:05:30.199> thing<00:05:30.469> is

hiring it done plus the other thing is

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.110 
hiring it done plus the other thing is
