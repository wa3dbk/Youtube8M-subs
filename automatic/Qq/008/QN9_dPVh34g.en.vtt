00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
is that you actually commit because you

both<00:02:10.830> feet<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.489> board<00:02:11.790> almost<00:02:12.030> every<00:02:12.569> time

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
both feet on the board almost every time

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.470 
both feet on the board almost every time

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.619 
the
anything<00:02:13.930> wrong<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.980> very<00:02:15.629> small

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
anything wrong is just a very small

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.710 
anything wrong is just a very small
detail<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:18.760> board<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.239> upside<00:02:19.690> down

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
detail is that your board is upside down

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.199 
detail is that your board is upside down
not<00:02:20.590> sure<00:02:20.860> if<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.099> notice<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.580> or<00:02:21.730> not<00:02:21.879> but

not sure if you notice that or not but

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.360 
not sure if you notice that or not but
it's<00:02:22.330> kind<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.750> hard<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.049> land<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.040> kickflip

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
it's kind of hard to land a kickflip

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.089 
it's kind of hard to land a kickflip
with<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.640> board<00:02:24.849> upside<00:02:25.239> down<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.319> okay<00:02:26.890> cool

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.520 
with the board upside down so okay cool
I<00:02:27.310> actually<00:02:27.519> just<00:02:28.209> got<00:02:28.659> through<00:02:28.959> making<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
I actually just got through making a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
I actually just got through making a
super<00:02:30.430> super<00:02:30.940> detailed<00:02:31.540> video<00:02:32.019> called<00:02:32.950> how<00:02:33.400> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
super super detailed video called how to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.070 
super super detailed video called how to
kickflip<00:02:34.540> higher<00:02:35.049> and<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:36.760> video<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.209> go

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
kickflip higher and in that video I go

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.979 
kickflip higher and in that video I go
over<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.680> different<00:02:39.160> foot<00:02:39.549> positions<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.360> a

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
over the different foot positions for a

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.830 
over the different foot positions for a
kickflip<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:41.680> order<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.190> make<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.269> board<00:02:43.510> spin

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
kickflip in order to make the board spin

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.089 
kickflip in order to make the board spin
fast<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.620> how<00:02:45.579> to<00:02:45.640> make<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.150> board<00:02:46.390> spin<00:02:46.690> slow

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
fast and how to make the board spin slow

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.559 
fast and how to make the board spin slow
now<00:02:48.099> it's<00:02:48.220> kind<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.640> hard<00:02:48.940> for<00:02:49.120> me<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.329> tell

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
now it's kind of hard for me to tell

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.990 
now it's kind of hard for me to tell
where<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.200> feet<00:02:50.470> are<00:02:50.620> at<00:02:50.829> but<00:02:51.579> from<00:02:51.790> this

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
where your feet are at but from this

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.140 
where your feet are at but from this
angle<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.510> looks<00:02:52.540> like<00:02:52.930> your<00:02:53.109> front<00:02:53.319> foot<00:02:53.590> is

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
angle it looks like your front foot is

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.569 
angle it looks like your front foot is
really<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.660> board<00:02:55.959> Oh<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.859> a<00:02:57.040> lot<00:02:57.340> of

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
really on the board Oh like a lot of

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.270 
really on the board Oh like a lot of
your<00:02:57.790> front<00:02:58.060> foot<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.420> on<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.629> board<00:02:59.280> which

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
your front foot is on the board which

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.490 
your front foot is on the board which
actually<00:03:00.790> causes<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.390> board<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:02.019> flip<00:03:02.440> slower

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
actually causes the board to flip slower

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.289 
actually causes the board to flip slower
so<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.650> order<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:06.040> speed<00:03:06.370> up<00:03:06.400> your<00:03:06.549> kickflips

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
so in order to speed up your kickflips

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.599 
so in order to speed up your kickflips
I<00:03:07.359> want<00:03:07.599> you<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.810> take<00:03:08.019> your<00:03:08.170> front<00:03:08.530> foot<00:03:08.799> now<00:03:09.579> I

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
I want you to take your front foot now I

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.640 
I want you to take your front foot now I
want<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.030> move<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.599> more<00:03:10.840> off<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.379> board

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
want you to move it more off the board

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.170 
want you to move it more off the board
so<00:03:11.920> just<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:13.450> edge<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:14.290> your<00:03:14.650> toe<00:03:15.099> is<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.819> there

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
so just the edge of your toe is on there

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.940 
so just the edge of your toe is on there
and<00:03:16.450> then<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:16.959> want<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.349> do<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> same

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
and then I want you to do the same

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.250 
and then I want you to do the same
motion<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.609> you're<00:03:18.760> doing<00:03:19.120> right<00:03:19.480> here<00:03:19.780> drag

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
motion that you're doing right here drag

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.740 
motion that you're doing right here drag
your<00:03:20.500> foot<00:03:20.709> up<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:21.160> then<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.239> pop<00:03:22.510> your

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
your foot up and then when you pop your

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.580 
your foot up and then when you pop your
foot<00:03:22.989> up<00:03:23.260> right<00:03:23.889> here<00:03:24.930> boom<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.200> pop<00:03:26.440> your

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
foot up right here boom you pop your

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.129 
foot up right here boom you pop your
foot<00:03:26.739> up<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.310> that's<00:03:27.609> what<00:03:28.090> creates<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.630> spin

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
foot up and that's what creates the spin

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.770 
foot up and that's what creates the spin
the<00:03:29.430> problem<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.609> that<00:03:30.970> your<00:03:31.120> board<00:03:31.329> is<00:03:31.480> just

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
the problem is that your board is just

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.129 
the problem is that your board is just
not<00:03:32.049> spinning<00:03:32.440> fast<00:03:32.919> enough<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:34.450> with<00:03:34.630> less<00:03:34.930> of

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
not spinning fast enough so with less of

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.289 
not spinning fast enough so with less of
your<00:03:35.290> toe<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:35.950> board<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.880> should<00:03:36.910> be<00:03:37.209> able

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
your toe on the board you should be able

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.370 
your toe on the board you should be able
to<00:03:37.419> flick<00:03:37.780> off<00:03:37.989> just<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.919> little<00:03:39.120> bit<00:03:40.200> harder<00:03:41.200> on

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
to flick off just a little bit harder on

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.339 
to flick off just a little bit harder on
the<00:03:41.620> flick<00:03:41.980> causing<00:03:42.669> that<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.569> make<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.049> board

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
the flick causing that to make the board

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.640 
the flick causing that to make the board
spin<00:03:44.709> more<00:03:45.099> you<00:03:45.970> can<00:03:46.120> see<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.329> lot<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.959> your<00:03:47.230> your

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
spin more you can see a lot of your your

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.640 
spin more you can see a lot of your your
foot<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.069> on<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.370> board<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:49.690> you're<00:03:50.290> kind<00:03:50.560> of

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
foot is on the board like you're kind of

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.879 
foot is on the board like you're kind of
in-between<00:03:51.060> doing<00:03:52.060> just<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.599> nollie<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.380> a

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
in-between doing just a nollie and a

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.550 
in-between doing just a nollie and a
kickflip<00:03:54.430> like<00:03:55.000> your<00:03:55.239> flick<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:56.049> motion<00:03:56.440> of

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
kickflip like your flick the motion of

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.440 
kickflip like your flick the motion of
your<00:03:56.590> foot<00:03:56.889> and<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.129> flick<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.609> is<00:03:57.819> good<00:03:58.269> it

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
your foot and the flick is is good it

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.789 
your foot and the flick is is good it
does<00:03:58.660> go<00:03:58.870> up<00:03:58.900> into<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.440> air

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
does go up into the air

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.490 
does go up into the air
and<00:03:59.889> sometimes<00:04:00.879> your<00:04:01.090> your<00:04:01.599> feet<00:04:01.870> stop<00:04:02.260> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
and sometimes your your feet stop the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.720 
and sometimes your your feet stop the
board<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:02.980> right<00:04:03.280> here<00:04:03.639> you<00:04:04.540> actually<00:04:04.690> got<00:04:05.079> a

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
board like right here you actually got a

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.300 
board like right here you actually got a
flick<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.970> off<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.269> little<00:04:07.870> more<00:04:08.260> lift<00:04:09.099> your

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
flick it off a little more lift your

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.360 
flick it off a little more lift your
back<00:04:09.549> foot<00:04:09.819> up<00:04:09.849> higher<00:04:10.329> so<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:11.680> board<00:04:11.919> spins

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
back foot up higher so the board spins

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.479 
back foot up higher so the board spins
faster<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.389> then<00:04:13.989> comes<00:04:14.440> up<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.889> sucks<00:04:15.250> up

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
faster and then comes up and sucks up

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.879 
faster and then comes up and sucks up
into<00:04:15.849> your<00:04:16.000> back<00:04:16.239> foot<00:04:16.630> at<00:04:16.900> which<00:04:17.139> point<00:04:17.440> then

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
into your back foot at which point then

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.449 
into your back foot at which point then
you<00:04:18.459> can<00:04:18.699> put<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.180> down<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:19.599> land<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:21.160> you<00:04:21.250> can

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
you can put it down and land so you can

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.060 
you can put it down and land so you can
see<00:04:21.640> like<00:04:21.930> which<00:04:22.930> part<00:04:23.289> of<00:04:23.409> my<00:04:23.560> shoe<00:04:23.830> is

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
see like which part of my shoe is

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.589 
see like which part of my shoe is
sliding<00:04:24.430> up<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.820> board<00:04:25.060> right<00:04:25.240> here<00:04:25.270> it's

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
sliding up the board right here it's

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.430 
sliding up the board right here it's
like<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.930> tip<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.200> my

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
like the tip of my

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.610 
like the tip of my
toe<00:04:27.000> not<00:04:28.000> quite<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.360> tip<00:04:28.600> but<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:29.080> think<00:04:29.500> you

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
toe not quite the tip but I think you

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.700 
toe not quite the tip but I think you
you<00:04:30.010> see<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.370> area<00:04:30.820> so<00:04:31.780> usually<00:04:32.320> for<00:04:32.560> my

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
you see the area so usually for my

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.790 
you see the area so usually for my
kickflips<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:34.120> regular<00:04:34.750> kickflip<00:04:35.290> position

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
kickflips the regular kickflip position

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.920 
kickflips the regular kickflip position
when<00:04:36.250> I'm<00:04:36.370> starting<00:04:36.760> out<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.210> have<00:04:37.420> my<00:04:37.600> front

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
when I'm starting out I have my front

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.800 
when I'm starting out I have my front
foot<00:04:37.990> in<00:04:38.380> between<00:04:38.830> those<00:04:39.070> bolts<00:04:39.730> but<00:04:40.540> if<00:04:40.690> I

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
foot in between those bolts but if I

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.440 
foot in between those bolts but if I
want<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.080> do<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.230> double<00:04:41.800> flip<00:04:42.040> I'll<00:04:43.000> move<00:04:43.420> my

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
want to do a double flip I'll move my

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.930 
want to do a double flip I'll move my
foot<00:04:43.900> more<00:04:44.230> off<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.650> side<00:04:44.860> of<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.100> board<00:04:45.340> to

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
foot more off the side of the board to

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.440 
foot more off the side of the board to
cause<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.420> board<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.720> spin<00:04:47.080> faster<00:04:47.940> again<00:04:48.940> I

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
cause the board to spin faster again I

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.230 
cause the board to spin faster again I
go<00:04:49.900> over<00:04:50.050> this<00:04:50.170> in<00:04:50.380> super<00:04:50.950> super<00:04:51.220> detail<00:04:51.910> in

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
go over this in super super detail in

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.500 
go over this in super super detail in
the<00:04:52.540> video<00:04:52.690> how<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.470> kickflip<00:04:54.040> higher<00:04:54.450> so<00:04:55.450> you

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
the video how to kickflip higher so you

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.090 
the video how to kickflip higher so you
should<00:04:55.780> definitely<00:04:56.260> check<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:56.680> video<00:04:56.890> out

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
should definitely check that video out

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.700 
should definitely check that video out
and<00:04:57.490> just<00:04:57.730> see<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.840> difference<00:04:59.200> between<00:04:59.590> the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
and just see the difference between the

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.460 
and just see the difference between the
foot<00:04:59.950> positions<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.760> see<00:05:01.270> how<00:05:01.510> it<00:05:01.720> causes<00:05:02.020> the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
foot positions and see how it causes the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.100 
foot positions and see how it causes the
kickflip<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.070> spin<00:05:03.640> slower<00:05:04.090> in<00:05:04.510> one<00:05:04.780> foot

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
kickflip to spin slower in one foot

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.500 
kickflip to spin slower in one foot
position<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:05.830> how<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.730> causes<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.180> kickflip

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
position and how it causes the kickflip

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.160 
position and how it causes the kickflip
to<00:05:07.690> spin<00:05:07.930> faster<00:05:08.290> in<00:05:08.680> another<00:05:08.980> position<00:05:10.170> great

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
to spin faster in another position great

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.080 
to spin faster in another position great
so<00:05:11.500> with<00:05:11.680> that<00:05:11.920> said<00:05:12.250> I'm<00:05:12.520> going<00:05:12.700> to<00:05:12.790> give<00:05:12.940> you

your back foot just get the full flip

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.770 
your back foot just get the full flip
and<00:05:31.540> get<00:05:32.440> used<00:05:32.770> to<00:05:32.919> flipping<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.520> board<00:05:33.790> fully

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
and get used to flipping the board fully

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.110 
and get used to flipping the board fully
landing<00:05:35.770> just<00:05:36.040> with<00:05:36.220> your<00:05:36.430> front<00:05:36.640> foot<00:05:36.880> and

mind just with your back foot and once
you<00:05:45.250> got<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:45.790> then<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.810> can<00:05:46.990> put<00:05:47.200> them<00:05:47.320> both

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
you got that then you can put them both

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.330 
you got that then you can put them both
together<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:49.060> doesn't<00:05:49.210> look<00:05:49.600> to<00:05:50.350> me<00:05:50.590> from<00:05:51.160> your

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
together it doesn't look to me from your

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.370 
together it doesn't look to me from your
video<00:05:51.640> like<00:05:51.880> you<00:05:52.030> have<00:05:52.240> a<00:05:52.270> problem<00:05:52.690> committing

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
video like you have a problem committing

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.320 
video like you have a problem committing
it<00:05:53.980> just<00:05:54.280> looks<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:54.610> me<00:05:54.760> like<00:05:54.790> you<00:05:55.120> need<00:05:55.300> to

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
it just looks to me like you need to

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.810 
it just looks to me like you need to
learn<00:05:55.540> how<00:05:55.750> to<00:05:55.780> flip<00:05:56.050> your<00:05:56.260> board<00:05:56.410> faster<00:05:56.980> so

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
learn how to flip your board faster so

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.340 
learn how to flip your board faster so
once<00:05:58.000> you<00:05:58.120> do<00:05:58.300> those<00:05:58.510> two<00:05:58.720> steps<00:05:58.960> you'll<00:05:59.290> be

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
once you do those two steps you'll be

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.200 
once you do those two steps you'll be
able<00:05:59.530> to<00:05:59.680> put<00:05:59.860> it<00:05:59.980> together<00:06:00.100> and<00:06:00.610> you'll<00:06:01.060> be

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
able to put it together and you'll be

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.430 
able to put it together and you'll be
able<00:06:01.270> to<00:06:01.480> land<00:06:01.690> with<00:06:01.960> both<00:06:01.990> feet<00:06:03.900> so<00:06:04.900> check<00:06:05.290> out

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
able to land with both feet so check out

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.320 
able to land with both feet so check out
that<00:06:05.470> video<00:06:05.830> how<00:06:06.220> to<00:06:06.280> kickflip<00:06:06.700> higher<00:06:06.970> and

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
that video how to kickflip higher and

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.900 
that video how to kickflip higher and
also<00:06:07.750> you<00:06:08.290> should<00:06:08.680> just<00:06:09.280> get<00:06:09.520> a<00:06:09.580> new

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
also you should just get a new

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.630 
also you should just get a new
skateboarding<00:06:10.630> made<00:06:10.780> simple<00:06:11.290> it's<00:06:12.100> gonna<00:06:12.310> run

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
skateboarding made simple it's gonna run

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.640 
skateboarding made simple it's gonna run
you<00:06:12.820> through<00:06:12.850> every<00:06:13.660> single<00:06:13.930> one<00:06:14.110> of<00:06:14.350> the

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
you through every single one of the

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.640 
you through every single one of the
steps<00:06:14.980> and<00:06:15.330> it<00:06:16.330> breaks<00:06:16.600> it<00:06:16.780> down<00:06:16.810> so<00:06:17.260> it's<00:06:17.470> like

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
steps and it breaks it down so it's like

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.220 
steps and it breaks it down so it's like
you<00:06:18.250> stand<00:06:18.850> still<00:06:19.150> on<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.450> board<00:06:19.690> you

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
you stand still on the board you

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.920 
you stand still on the board you
practice<00:06:20.830> this<00:06:21.070> part<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:21.669> then<00:06:22.390> you<00:06:22.419> move<00:06:22.900> to
