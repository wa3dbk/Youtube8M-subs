00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
i don't remember the brand names because

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.910 
i don't remember the brand names because
it<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> long<00:00:27.210> time<00:00:27.449> ago<00:00:27.510> those<00:00:28.230> BB<00:00:28.590> creams

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
it was a long time ago those BB creams

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490 
it was a long time ago those BB creams
that<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.220> tried<00:00:29.640> had<00:00:29.910> more<00:00:30.210> coverage<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that I tried had more coverage and the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
that I tried had more coverage and the
coverage<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.610> by<00:00:32.820> Garnier<00:00:33.239> is

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
coverage with this one by Garnier is

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.110 
coverage with this one by Garnier is
very<00:00:34.170> sheer<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.800> very<00:00:35.070> light<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
very sheer and very light so this is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
very sheer and very light so this is
definitely<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.260> tinted<00:00:37.559> moisturizer

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
definitely more of a tinted moisturizer

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.090 
definitely more of a tinted moisturizer
in<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.640> opinion<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.379> labeled<00:00:40.860> as

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
in my opinion and if this was labeled as

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.340 
in my opinion and if this was labeled as
a<00:00:41.370> tinted<00:00:41.610> moisturizer<00:00:41.910> instead<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.020> BB

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
a tinted moisturizer instead of a BB

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.020 
a tinted moisturizer instead of a BB
cream<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.680> definitely<00:00:44.100> feel<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:44.940> would

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
cream I definitely feel like there would

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
cream I definitely feel like there would
be<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.239> lot<00:00:45.450> more<00:00:45.510> positive<00:00:45.899> reviews<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.890> this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
be a lot more positive reviews for this

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.819 
be a lot more positive reviews for this
because<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> tinted<00:00:48.480> moisturizer<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.350> really

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
because as a tinted moisturizer I really

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.580 
because as a tinted moisturizer I really
like<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.640> um<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.300> call<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> BB<00:00:52.079> cream<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
like it but um to call it a BB cream I
think<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> bit<00:00:53.190> misleading<00:00:53.399> I've<00:00:54.360> been<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
think is a bit misleading I've been a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.600

time now and since I consider this more

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.139

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
completely faded yet this will help even

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.340 
completely faded yet this will help even
that<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.729> far<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.240> major<00:01:27.810> coverage

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that out but as far as major coverage

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.920 
that out but as far as major coverage
this<00:01:28.650> definitely<00:01:29.369> will<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:29.759> cover<00:01:30.090> nearly<00:01:30.630> as

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
this definitely will not cover nearly as

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.830 
this definitely will not cover nearly as
much<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.770> BB<00:01:32.460> cream<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> love<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
much as a BB cream would what I love so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.719 
much as a BB cream would what I love so
much<00:01:34.079> about<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.159> finish<00:01:35.520> it's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
much about this is the finish it's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.179 
much about this is the finish it's
really<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.450> natural<00:01:37.140> looking<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.799> doesn't

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
really very natural looking it doesn't

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.219 
really very natural looking it doesn't

but I really think that the true test

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.410 
but I really think that the true test
would<00:02:36.250> be<00:02:36.400> during<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> summertime<00:02:37.090> when<00:02:37.269> it's
