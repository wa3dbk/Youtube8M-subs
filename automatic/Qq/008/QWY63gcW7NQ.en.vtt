00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.279 
a run than you can for a bike ride man
you<00:00:46.829> must<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.520> fish<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.079> can't

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
you must be fish because I can't

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.709 
you must be fish because I can't
even<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:49.950> running<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.460> know

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
even do that and I'm running you know

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:51.920 
even do that and I'm running you know
sub-17

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
sub-17
for<00:00:52.680> 5,000<00:00:53.399> meters<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:53.940> running<00:00:54.030> sub<00:00:54.390> 3

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

hours<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:54.960> our<00:00:55.110> fund<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.340> that's<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.789> this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
hours from our fund so that's that this

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
hours from our fund so that's that this
person<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.570> obviously<00:00:58.129> doing<00:00:59.129> some<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.579> real

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
person is obviously doing some a real

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.450 
person is obviously doing some a real
full<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.840> fitness<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.620> always<00:01:01.829> fit<00:01:02.309> as

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
full on fitness so you always fit as

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.840 
full on fitness so you always fit as
this<00:01:02.730> person<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:04.049> running<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
this person then running is going to be

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
this person then running is going to be
better<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:07.580> calories<00:01:08.720> but<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.920> know<00:01:11.070> this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
better for calories but you know this

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.940 
better for calories but you know this
person<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.689> fit<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
person is so fit because if you

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
person is so fit because if you
can<00:01:14.100> burn<00:01:14.250> three<00:01:14.880> times<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> calories<00:01:15.840> going

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
can burn three times the calories going

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.310 
can burn three times the calories going
for<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> run<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.790> 45<00:01:18.210> minutes<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> bike<00:01:19.049> riding

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
for a run then 45 minutes of bike riding

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.550 
for a run then 45 minutes of bike riding
then<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.880> must<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.600> Olympic

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
then you are must be a Olympic

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.070 
then you are must be a Olympic
level<00:01:22.740> runner<00:01:23.070> easy<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.420> 99<00:01:24.689> putting

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
level runner easy as that so 99 putting

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.850 
level runner easy as that so 99 putting
onto<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> time

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
onto the time

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
onto the time
cycling<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.090> better<00:01:27.270> than

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
cycling is going to be better than

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.609 
cycling is going to be better than
running<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.900> weight<00:01:28.049> loss<00:01:28.200> better<00:01:28.500> than

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
running for weight loss better than

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.109 
running for weight loss better than
running<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> walking<00:01:29.040> cycling<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
running and walking cycling is going to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.210 
running and walking cycling is going to
be<00:01:30.180> 1<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.450> cycling<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.079> no<00:01:31.229> impact<00:01:31.619> unless

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
be 1 because cycling is no impact unless

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.010 
be 1 because cycling is no impact unless
you<00:01:32.340> hit<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> tarmac<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:33.360> cycling<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.869> can

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you hit the tarmac then cycling you can

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.300 
you hit the tarmac then cycling you can
keep<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:34.979> going

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
keep going and going and going

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.580 
keep going and going and going
so<00:01:35.520> cycling<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.210> definitely<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.900> best<00:01:37.170> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
so cycling is definitely the best for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.990 
so cycling is definitely the best for
weight<00:01:37.799> loss<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.549> fit<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.880> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
weight loss so if you're as fit as this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.670 
weight loss so if you're as fit as this
person<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.869> an<00:01:39.960> excess<00:01:40.290> weight<00:01:40.500> issue

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
person you I have an excess weight issue

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
person you I have an excess weight issue
because<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.310> person<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.850> around<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.299> work

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
because this person going around to work

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
because this person going around to work
they<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.750> run<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> marathon<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.829> run<00:01:44.040> here

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
they can run a marathon I can run here

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.649 
they can run a marathon I can run here
they<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.520> run<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.909> they<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.210> probably
