 eyebrows and finally a lipstick

 color enough natural so everything 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.760
 first I used this product which 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.829
 is called the blur that I will drop 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.390
 by small keys using a 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.699
 sponge drop the product only on 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.070
 the scars it will smooth 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.080
 the skin just as you have some 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.289
 hollow scars that will tighten the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.160
 pores and unify the complexion times by 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:19.190
 compared to redness then I use 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.729
 a corrector this one that I'm going 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.840
 mix with my foundation and that 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.130
 I will apply using a sponge 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.270
 by tapping only on the areas to 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.270
 hide in numbers 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.640
 then with my foundation always 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.180
 the same and using a tongue brush 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.330
 of Charles 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.840
 I will deposit the foundation on the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.840
 rest of the face 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.890
 then I use a concealer so 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.450
 with my correctors palette I'm going 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.270
 take a rather orange color and 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.520
 to counterbalance the blue color 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.440
 concerns were to apply 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.440
 the concealer inside the cern 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.140
 in the inner hollow of the eye 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.770
 I will use a liquid blush for 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.170
 a more natural and color rendering 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.730
 pretty clear rather orange and so no 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.270
 not bring out the red color of the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.730
 scars 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.470
 so that's the bluff I'm going 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.960
 apply with a beveled brush 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.700
 like these and that I'm going to drop on 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.700
 the bone of the cheekbone 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.490
 by the treaty then I used a 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.110
 a little darker powder than my aunt's 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.990
 skin that I'm going to apply with a 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.230
 beveled brush under the bone of the 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.960
 cheekbone and I stretched outward 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.100
 in order to structure the face bring a 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.480
 few more colors will collapse gloss 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.080
 then I used a loose powder 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.350
 transparently applied throughout the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.610
 face to make up the makeup and 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.800
 avoid shine if you want 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.400
 let alone focus on your 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.960
 brands 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.480
 the cne if she sees herself still a lot 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.010
 could math eyes who finally 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.510
 focus on the eyes that will avoid 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.850
 to focus on your scars 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.460
 so I'm going to make a liner you 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.310
 can use a buddy comb that 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.790
 is called and I 'm going to apply that with 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:32.150
 a small beveled brush to start with 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.180
 drawn in very very very hungry at the grass 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.180
 eyelashes 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.350
 and towards the end you will stretch and thick if 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.350
 it's your trait 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.920
 then the mascara that I will start 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.510
 by applying to the top of the lashes so 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:04:01.079
 to remove the powder that may have fallen 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:03.950
 above and below our apens well 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.950
 the root of the eyelashes 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.380
 then I will use this product there 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.080
 for the eyebrows that will allow to 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.500
 fill in the holes and densify a little bit of 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.750
 sources he's only thrashing the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.750
 eyebrow in the direction of the hair 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.400
 and then then I will add a 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.350
 little touch on the lips very 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.350
 quickly with lipstick 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.300
 that's it you're ready to go out 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.069
 it's about
