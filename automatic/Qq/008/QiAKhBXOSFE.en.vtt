percent<00:03:39.750> that's<00:03:40.440> not<00:03:40.770> going<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.010> turn<00:03:41.190> around

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
percent that's not going to turn around

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.580 
percent that's not going to turn around
and<00:03:41.790> that's<00:03:42.090> why<00:03:42.360> I<00:03:42.390> think<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.200> markets

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
and that's why I think that the markets

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.080 
and that's why I think that the markets
main<00:03:43.830> may<00:03:44.130> not<00:03:44.310> do<00:03:44.459> as<00:03:44.610> well<00:03:44.640> as<00:03:44.940> you're

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
main may not do as well as you're

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.150 
main may not do as well as you're
predicting<00:03:45.569> well<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.020> didn't<00:03:46.380> say<00:03:46.410> as<00:03:46.650> well<00:03:46.860> I'm

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
predicting well I didn't say as well I'm

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.340 
predicting well I didn't say as well I'm
not<00:03:47.730> looking<00:03:48.120> for<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.480> go<00:03:48.630> up<00:03:48.840> incredibly

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
not looking for it to go up incredibly

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.170 
not looking for it to go up incredibly
what<00:03:49.560> I'm<00:03:49.680> just<00:03:49.890> saying<00:03:50.130> was<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.550> don't<00:03:50.970> think

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
what I'm just saying was I don't think

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.660 
what I'm just saying was I don't think
there's<00:03:51.420> going<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.630> be<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.780> big<00:03:52.020> downfall<00:03:52.670> after

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
there's going to be a big downfall after

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.340 
there's going to be a big downfall after
the<00:03:53.790> next<00:03:53.910> few<00:03:54.090> weeks<00:03:54.330> because<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.750> see<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.110> Fed

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
the next few weeks because I see the Fed

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.570 
the next few weeks because I see the Fed
going<00:03:55.739> into<00:03:56.100> almost<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:57.150> crisis<00:03:57.890> easy<00:03:58.890> mode<00:03:59.250> I

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
going into almost a crisis easy mode I

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.570 
going into almost a crisis easy mode I
think<00:04:00.180> it's<00:04:00.390> it's<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:01.170> almost<00:04:01.860> certain<00:04:02.340> it's

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
think it's it's it's almost certain it's

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.180 
think it's it's it's almost certain it's
about<00:04:02.880> as<00:04:03.030> almost<00:04:03.390> certain<00:04:03.989> as<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.860> know<00:04:04.950> when
