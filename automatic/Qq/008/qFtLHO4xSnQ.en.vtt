 heating of the greenhouse long spoiled 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.029
 farkas heaters b) brand b 1000 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:55.449
 3 pieces sleep with the size width again you 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:55.449
 9 meters high 280 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:09.759
 polycarbonate greenhouse material 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:17.050
 4 millimeter thick greenhouse day 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:17.050
 concrete path to this greenhouse 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:27.080
 desirable to place 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:30.100
 at least four heaters b1000 but 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.780
 due to save light was purchased 3 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.729
 so for maximum efficiency 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.670
 it was decided to place them above the concrete 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.200
 the path to warm the concrete track 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:53.020
 which will serve as a battery 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:56.619
 heat under floor offset heat cable 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.619
 for ground heating 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960
 shield 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.120
 looks like this in one 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.760
 three-phase circuit breaker 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.099
 launcher will become transitions to 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.550
 switchgear for magnetic 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.959
 starters are managed 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.959
 thermostats 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:32.000
 the Internet vt sends a turquoise themselves and 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.810
 exxon controls the thermostats for 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:42.610
 warm floors 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:42.610
 yes turn on possessed magnetic starter 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:59.110
 the camera doesn't really show 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:07.959
 by decree 26 one degree minutes 15 hryvnia 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:07.959
 greenhouse more on temperature 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:21.100
 273 degrees concrete track temperature 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.170
 16 degrees when logged in was 14 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:31.700
 greenhouse spilled sulfur 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:37.000
 trial run was well too will be shooting 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.000
 Python warms up twice 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:48.319
 during operation, warming up by 22 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:53.389
 degrees at a distance of two centimeters 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.709
 from the sand you know in advance better seen 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.459
 here 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:01.989
 light streaks then dried sand here 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.989
 by wire 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.950

 9 degrees 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.770
 but 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.160
 someone greenhouses for sure 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.700
 3 meters in the center 3 meters in the center in 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.530
