you<00:00:00.120> basically<00:00:00.299> have<00:00:00.780> 12<00:00:01.140> different<00:00:01.560> effects

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
you basically have 12 different effects

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.590 
you basically have 12 different effects
that<00:00:02.100> you<00:00:02.190> can<00:00:02.340> have<00:00:02.610> turned<00:00:02.970> on<00:00:03.149> or<00:00:03.300> off<00:00:03.419> at

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
that you can have turned on or off at

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.820 
that you can have turned on or off at
one<00:00:04.080> time<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:05.839> as<00:00:06.839> they're<00:00:07.170> divided<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.680> is

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
one time and as they're divided it is

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.589 
one time and as they're divided it is
you<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.189> think<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.519> four<00:00:08.790> effects<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.420> at<00:00:09.540> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
you can think of four effects on at a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.530 
you can think of four effects on at a
time<00:00:09.840> but<00:00:10.590> three<00:00:10.980> variations<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.000> those

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
time but three variations and those

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.450 
time but three variations and those
three<00:00:12.870> variations<00:00:13.200> could<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.769> any<00:00:13.980> one<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
three variations could be any one of the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.910 
three variations could be any one of the
things<00:00:14.780> generally<00:00:15.780> speaking<00:00:16.170> people<00:00:16.350> tend<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
things generally speaking people tend to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.060 
things generally speaking people tend to
put<00:00:17.600> dynamic<00:00:18.600> effects<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.230> compressors<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
put dynamic effects like compressors and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.480 
put dynamic effects like compressors and
distortions<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.199> filters<00:00:22.199> like<00:00:22.560> Waze<00:00:22.890> or

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
distortions and filters like Waze or

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.179 
distortions and filters like Waze or
true<00:00:24.119> filters<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.900> synth<00:00:25.199> filters<00:00:25.680> at<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
true filters like synth filters at the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.580 
true filters like synth filters at the
start<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.880> chain<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.019> then

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
start of the chain like I do and then

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.609 
start of the chain like I do and then
progress<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.570> modulations<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:30.779> delays<00:00:31.080> those

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
progress to modulations or delays those

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.340 
progress to modulations or delays those
can<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.890> flipped<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.399> either<00:00:32.759> order<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.350> then

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
can be flipped in either order and then

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.790 
can be flipped in either order and then
on<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.770> reverbs<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.430> then<00:00:35.730> out<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.500> most

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
on to reverbs and then out I have most

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.889 
on to reverbs and then out I have most
of<00:00:37.950> my<00:00:38.070> stuff<00:00:38.340> set<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:39.000> way<00:00:39.270> because<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
of my stuff set up that way because it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
of my stuff set up that way because it
tends<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> work<00:00:40.530> best<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> distortions

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
tends to work best with the distortions

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.400 
tends to work best with the distortions
to<00:00:43.550> not<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.850> them<00:00:45.030> come<00:00:45.210> after<00:00:45.450> delays<00:00:46.110> or

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to not have them come after delays or

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.700 
to not have them come after delays or
modulation<00:00:46.860> effects<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.680> so

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
modulation effects but this thing is so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
modulation effects but this thing is so
flexible<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> want<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> break<00:00:51.480> rules<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
flexible if you want to break rules you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.549 
flexible if you want to break rules you
can<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.590> plenty<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:54.020> in<00:00:55.020> terms<00:00:55.410> of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
can do plenty of that in terms of

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.350 
can do plenty of that in terms of
distortions<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.399> everything<00:00:56.670> from<00:00:57.000> mild

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090

array<00:01:15.229> does<00:01:16.229> something<00:01:16.619> similar<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> seat

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
array does something similar to the seat

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
array does something similar to the seat
but<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> think<00:01:18.090> there's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.450> more<00:01:18.570> random

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
but I think there's a little more random

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:52.510 
but I think there's a little more random
element<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.920 

one<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> things<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:54.120> really<00:01:54.330> like<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.570> use

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
one of the things I really like to use

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.560 
one of the things I really like to use
delay<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.680> too<00:01:55.980> is<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> create<00:01:56.760> real<00:01:57.000> ambience

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
delay for too is to create real ambience

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.080 
delay for too is to create real ambience
well<00:01:57.870> type<00:01:58.200> effects<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.700> favorite

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
well type effects and one of my favorite

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.000 
well type effects and one of my favorite
effects<00:02:00.390> from<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.720> green<00:02:00.960> delay<00:02:01.260> modeler<00:02:01.740> is

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
effects from the green delay modeler is

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.640 
effects from the green delay modeler is
the<00:02:02.970> volume<00:02:03.360> swell<00:02:03.750> delay<00:02:04.080> let<00:02:04.290> me<00:02:04.380> go<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
the volume swell delay let me go to a

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.359 
the volume swell delay let me go to a
scene<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:04.980> fixtures<00:02:05.730> that<00:02:05.910> prominently<00:02:07.369> my

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
scene that fixtures that prominently my

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.900 
scene that fixtures that prominently my
scratch<00:02:08.790> pad<00:02:09.290> I<00:02:10.290> love<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.190> sound<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.670> auto

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910

volume<00:02:12.390> swell<00:02:12.750> but<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> also<00:02:13.290> love<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.910> with

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
volume swell but I also love it with

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.060 
volume swell but I also love it with
other<00:02:15.420> effects<00:02:16.050> employed<00:02:16.530> with<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.890> like

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
other effects employed with it like

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.280 
other effects employed with it like
analog<00:02:17.550> mock<00:02:18.090> with<00:02:18.360> modulation<00:02:18.900> which

overdrive<00:02:35.550> I'll<00:02:35.730> switch<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.510> think<00:02:36.570> an

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
overdrive I'll switch to and I think an

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.230 
overdrive I'll switch to and I think an
octave<00:02:37.290> fuzz<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.250> all<00:02:38.459> switch<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:39.060> some

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
octave fuzz to all switch to at some

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:46.760 
octave fuzz to all switch to at some
point<00:02:43.970> now<00:02:44.970> another<00:02:45.390> thing<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:46.320> be<00:02:46.470> aware<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
point now another thing to be aware of

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.340 
point now another thing to be aware of
is<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.540> assign<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.320> different

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
is you can assign to different

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.300 
is you can assign to different
expression<00:02:50.250> pedals<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:52.160> dynamically<00:02:53.160> change

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
expression pedals to dynamically change

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.420 
expression pedals to dynamically change
your<00:02:54.060> effects<00:02:54.590> really<00:02:55.590> any<00:02:55.890> one<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.190> these

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
your effects really any one of these

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.610 
your effects really any one of these
this<00:02:56.910> expression<00:02:57.570> pedal<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.989> I've<00:02:58.170> got<00:02:58.410> my

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
this expression pedal that I've got my

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.880 
this expression pedal that I've got my
wonderful<00:02:59.489> slipper<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.060> right<00:03:00.420> now<00:03:00.890> is

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
wonderful slipper on right now is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.420 
wonderful slipper on right now is
controlling<00:03:03.230> these<00:03:04.230> three<00:03:04.680> effects<00:03:05.100> all

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
controlling these three effects all

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.390 
controlling these three effects all
delays<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.150> basically<00:03:06.860> it's<00:03:07.860> kind<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.160> more

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
delays and basically it's kind of a more

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.670 
delays and basically it's kind of a more
switch<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:09.120> me<00:03:09.239> I'm<00:03:09.480> bringing<00:03:10.140> more<00:03:10.290> feedback

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
switch for me I'm bringing more feedback

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.070 
switch for me I'm bringing more feedback
in<00:03:11.190> maybe<00:03:11.489> more<00:03:11.790> depth<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.390> delay<00:03:12.720> at<00:03:12.989> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
in maybe more depth of the delay at the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.100 
in maybe more depth of the delay at the
same<00:03:13.320> time<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.209> case<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.720> swell

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
same time and in the case of the swell

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.680 
same time and in the case of the swell
volume<00:03:16.650> it'll<00:03:17.010> create<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.459> sustain<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.420> want

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
volume it'll create a sustain if I want

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.150 
volume it'll create a sustain if I want
to<00:03:18.840> if<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.050> really<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> pedal<00:03:19.920> all<00:03:20.100> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
to if I really have the pedal all the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:31.569 
to if I really have the pedal all the
way<00:03:20.310> toe<00:03:20.640> down<00:03:20.880> so

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.190 

there's<00:03:32.579> no<00:03:32.849> attack<00:03:33.450> you're<00:03:33.750> not<00:03:33.870> giving<00:03:34.140> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
there's no attack you're not giving the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.470 
there's no attack you're not giving the
tackle<00:03:34.680> at<00:03:34.829> all<00:03:34.980> okay<00:03:35.819> so<00:03:35.849> now<00:03:36.180> I'm<00:03:36.269> going<00:03:36.420> to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
tackle at all okay so now I'm going to

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.589 
tackle at all okay so now I'm going to
create<00:03:36.629> some<00:03:36.870> more<00:03:36.900> sustain<00:03:37.620> by<00:03:37.859> just<00:03:38.129> simply

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
create some more sustain by just simply

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.699 
create some more sustain by just simply
increasing<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:39.689> feedback<00:03:40.139> of<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.379> delays

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
increasing the feedback of the delays

00:03:40.709 --> 00:04:27.720 
increasing the feedback of the delays
with<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> pedal<00:03:41.700> brought<00:03:42.120> down

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:55.180 

little<00:04:28.730> distortion<00:04:29.150> here<00:04:29.660> with<00:04:30.350> that<00:04:30.560> sound

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.190 

now<00:04:56.190> I'm<00:04:56.370> going<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.580> add<00:04:56.730> some<00:04:57.060> extra<00:04:57.420> store

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
now I'm going to add some extra store

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.720 
now I'm going to add some extra store
ssin<00:04:58.380> on<00:04:58.500> top<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.890> this<00:04:59.040> but<00:04:59.250> I'm<00:04:59.400> going<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.640> be

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
ssin on top of this but I'm going to be

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.200 
ssin on top of this but I'm going to be
adding<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.270> from<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.600> different<00:05:00.780> pedal<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:02.210> I

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
adding it from a different pedal that I

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.600 
adding it from a different pedal that I
have<00:05:03.840> plugged<00:05:04.260> into<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.740> effects<00:05:05.100> loop<00:05:05.310> on

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
have plugged into the effects loop on

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.910 
have plugged into the effects loop on
the<00:05:05.760> end<00:05:05.790> thirteen<00:05:06.410> one<00:05:07.410> nice<00:05:07.620> thing<00:05:07.890> about

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
the end thirteen one nice thing about

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.370 
the end thirteen one nice thing about
the<00:05:08.370> m13<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.240> integrates<00:05:09.750> really<00:05:09.870> nice

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
the m13 is it integrates really nice

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.830 
the m13 is it integrates really nice
with<00:05:10.680> other<00:05:10.920> analog<00:05:11.400> pedals<00:05:11.820> so<00:05:12.150> for<00:05:12.570> instance

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
with other analog pedals so for instance

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.590 
with other analog pedals so for instance
I<00:05:12.990> always<00:05:13.170> like<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.500> use<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.710> nice<00:05:14.670> compressor<00:05:15.570> I

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
I always like to use a nice compressor I

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.620 
I always like to use a nice compressor I
have<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.440> overdrive<00:05:17.370> I'm<00:05:17.580> very<00:05:17.790> fond<00:05:18.120> of<00:05:18.360> I

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
have and a overdrive I'm very fond of I

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.810 
have and a overdrive I'm very fond of I
just<00:05:19.470> put<00:05:19.800> them<00:05:19.890> into<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.100> effects<00:05:20.400> loop<00:05:20.610> of

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
just put them into the effects loop of

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.420 
just put them into the effects loop of
this<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.270> then<00:05:21.660> I<00:05:21.780> can<00:05:21.990> assign<00:05:22.500> where<00:05:23.010> in<00:05:23.310> that

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
this and then I can assign where in that

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.430 
this and then I can assign where in that
chain<00:05:23.760> I<00:05:23.790> want<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:24.180> place<00:05:24.420> those<00:05:24.660> things<00:05:24.990> in<00:05:25.260> my

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
chain I want to place those things in my

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.280 
chain I want to place those things in my
case<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.100> conventionally<00:05:27.170> towards<00:05:28.170> the

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
case and conventionally towards the

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.590 
case and conventionally towards the
front<00:05:28.620> but<00:05:29.280> sometimes<00:05:29.760> I'll<00:05:29.940> place<00:05:30.210> it<00:05:30.420> in

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
front but sometimes I'll place it in

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.290 
front but sometimes I'll place it in
front<00:05:30.630> of<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.200> first<00:05:31.440> effect<00:05:32.310> sometimes<00:05:33.120> I'll

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
front of the first effect sometimes I'll

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.390 
front of the first effect sometimes I'll
place<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.110> directly<00:05:34.230> after<00:05:34.920> depending<00:05:35.190> on

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
place it directly after depending on

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.210 
place it directly after depending on
what<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.730> is<00:05:35.870> in<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> cases<00:05:37.200> of<00:05:37.590> filter

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
what that is in the cases of filter

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.790 
what that is in the cases of filter
effects<00:05:38.580> sometimes<00:05:39.090> I'll<00:05:39.270> put<00:05:39.600> it<00:05:39.720> after<00:05:39.930> it

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
effects sometimes I'll put it after it

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.680 
effects sometimes I'll put it after it
tends<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.370> make<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.580> respond<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.390> little<00:05:42.540> bit

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
tends to make it respond a little bit

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.070 
tends to make it respond a little bit
better

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
better

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.080 
better
so<00:05:43.320> here's<00:05:43.680> adding<00:05:44.130> a<00:05:44.160> little<00:05:44.310> bit<00:05:44.400> more<00:05:44.520> juice

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
so here's adding a little bit more juice

00:05:45.090 --> 00:06:09.559 
so here's adding a little bit more juice
with<00:05:45.420> another<00:05:45.660> pedal

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.629 

you
