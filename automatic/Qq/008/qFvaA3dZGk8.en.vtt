00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the magnificent 12th century cathedral of the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.189
 city of chartres north of france 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.550
 It is an ancient enigma even in pre 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.889
 christians the druids celtic priests 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.750
 of galia and britania founded in chartres 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.359
 a university to spread their 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.670
 teachings obeying a vision 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.130
 prophetic they carved in wood the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.070
 statue of a virgin and a child to whom 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.330
 they called the virgin under the earth 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.970
 discovered by Christians in the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.369
 3rd century they venerated her as the virgin 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.100
 Black had darkened with the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.380
 time began the tradition of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840
 erect in that sacred place churches in 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.520
 honor of our lady the masterpiece 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.980
 Gothic that we know is the culmination 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140
 of all of them point theories abound 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.750
 about the inspiration of the cathedral 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.789
 according to legend the knights 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.489
 original templars they got in 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.110
 East advanced knowledge 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 architectural with which it was possible 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.820
 build the temple persuaded by 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.309
 bernardo de claraval founder of the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.500
 Cistercian monastic order nine 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 French knights abandoned their 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.660
 material possessions to go 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.000
 of the secrets supposedly hidden in 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.610
 the sacred sanctuary under the ruins of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 Solomon temple in Jerusalem during 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.990
 his 10-year search was suspected 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.500
 the knights had started in the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.320
 occultism on his return to France in 1128 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.479
 it was rumored that they had found the ark 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.550
 of the coffer alliance that contained the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.370
 secrets of the divine law concerning 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:38.450
 numbers weights and measures among them the 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:41.070
 golden number 1 618 the scale 11 618 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.350
 golden section or proportion was 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.090
 considered of special aesthetic value and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.700
 regio to a large extent the art and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.400
 Renaissance architecture as well as 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.200
 those of later periods the return 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.030
 of the gentlemen coincided with the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.729
 flourishing of gothic architecture 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.979
 in europe so that the construction of 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.910
 the first chartres cathedral began 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.030
 six years later in three decades 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.950
 stonemasons glassmakers sculptors 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.200
 geometers astronomers and other craftsmen 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.840
 they created an immense temple whose 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.760
 orientation proportions 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.500
 and symbolism have stimulated from 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.560
 then the imagination of their 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.319
 visitors and comforted his spirit the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.209
 sacred center of the cathedral rests 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.790
 between the second and the third bathroom 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.150
 choir there was originally raised the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.980
 altar about 37 m below is located the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.799
 water level in the Druids' well 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.959
 the pinnacle of the gothic vault of the 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.849
 cathedral rises exactly to the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.120
 same distance over the sacred center 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.970
 point from 1,130 in europe 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.489
 burst the Gothic style the Gothic is not 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.370
 an evolution of Romanesque appears from 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.410
 suddenly and almost always in the abbeys 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.989
 Cistercians if Romanesque reaches its 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.579
 fullness after multiple 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.010
 improvements from the Roman style 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.950
 and Byzantine the Gothic emerges suddenly 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.110
 complete and total appears after the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.209
 first crusade and especially after the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.000
 return of the Knights Templar ' 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.579
 with his secret a secret concerning 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.220
 the sacred use and so to speak 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.230
 magic of architecture we have already 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.600
 mentioned earlier what contained the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.500
 stones of the law the same key 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.450
 numerical that was 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.180
 used in the construction of the great 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.580
 Pyramid and Temple of Solomon does not 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.800
 it is necessary to remember that Moses came from Egypt 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.780
 all Egyptian culture was 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.240
 concentrated on the priests and he was 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.850
 one of them so he was instructed in 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.580
 all the science of the pharaohs in the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.709
 medieval europe and during 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.410
 approximately 150 years the application 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.480
 of this architectural knowledge goes to 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.750
 manifest itself in the construction of 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.240
 great cathedrals and it is in one of them 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.459
 chartres very close to paris where 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.890
 we found a new reference to the ark 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.870
 of the alliance, it goes without saying that 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.330
 Cathedral of Chartres is in Gothic style 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.580
 and of origin 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.070
 evidently templar point l porch 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.530
 north of said cathedral is called portico 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.410
 of the initiates in it is in two 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.450
 columns sculpted in one of them is 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.370
 observe an ark that is transported by 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.650
 one bullock cart and the other 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.900
 we can see how a man covers the ark 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.640
 with a veil surrounded by a lot of 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.950
 corpses among which a 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.020
 knight in chainmail the two 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.430
 columns just below the 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.860
 representations 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.590
 they make up a controversial legend and 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.780
 here my chance holder of eris we say 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.240
 controversial because the expression such and 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.310
 as it is recorded in Latin it does not exist 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.110
 which is really strange but 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.110
 surprisingly the only text 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.690
 plausible that would be and here my headline already 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.630
 it was from eris translates as in this 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.550
 place the ark of the alliance is hidden 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.770
 it seems a lot of chance to think 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.020
 that there is not any truth in all this 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.090
 in the main nave of the Cathedral of 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.210
 chartres appears drawn a famous 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.620
 labyrinth whose 13 meters in diameter what 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.139
 become the largest of the 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.789
 preserved for the Gothic period 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.800
 difference from the labyrinths of the 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.229
 seniority starting with the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.539
 Minotaur in Crete of Chartres only 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.370
 offers a possible route through a 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.560
 continuous line drawn along 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.479
 two hundred and sixty-two meters and eleven 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.639
 concentric circles until you reach 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.400
 center there is no reference 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.560
 documentary about its meaning and nobody 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.669
 know they intended to represent with him 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.910
 its builders 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.770
 maybe it served so that the pilgrims 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.150
 will reach a state of trance giving 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.160
 lots of twists 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.370
 to get to the center where according to 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.560
 some news there was until 1828 a 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.750
 scene of the greek hero teseo fighting 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.660
 against the minotaur in the work of Lewis 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.900
 carpentier the enigma of the Cathedral of 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.930
 Chartres published in Spain in 1969 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.630
 script comments the curious disposition 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.010
 architectural of the cathedral 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.560
 coincident in certain aspects with the 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.140
 disappeared Temple of Solomon and with the 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.150
 great Egyptian buildings all 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.430
 this knowledge would have been learned 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.770
 when finding during the excavation the 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.350
 tot books revealing secrets 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.680
 ancestral of the Egyptians for another 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.240
 part inside the great pyramid 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.370
 specifically in the king's chamber it 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.560
 can see today a sarcophagus of 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.480
 granite from which historians doubt 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.660
 much that was the recipient of the 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.650
 mummy of pharaoh keops but what if 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.050
 surprisingly it has the measurements 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.150
 exact interiors to those of the Ark of the 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.700
 alliance that you already saw built a 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.580
 Moses who had undoubtedly been trained 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.350
 in the court of the pharaohs and participant 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.420
 of the most hidden sciences and secrets 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.289
 of this ancient and enigmatic 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.990
 civilization 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:45.719
 since according to the sacred scriptures it was 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.319
 educated as the son of pharaohs on the other 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:49.110
 side 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.479
 lewis carpentier goes on saying that 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.119
 in chartres france there is a slab 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:56.399
 rectangular whose whiteness stands out 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:58.379
 the grayish color of the paving and that 

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:01.349
 is marked by a metal spike 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:04.800
 bright slightly golden, well 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:07.110
 tells us that every year on June 21 a 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.499
 sunbeam falls exactly on the 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.959
 white stone chance or science for 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:15.509
 some this stone could hide but 

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:17.789
 the ark if any message from the place where 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:20.389
 could be hidden the true ark of 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:20.389
 the alliance
