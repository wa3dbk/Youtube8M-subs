why<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> screen<00:01:14.430> looks<00:01:14.460> less<00:01:14.850> bright<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
why the screen looks less bright and I

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.429 
why the screen looks less bright and I
adjusted<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.040> bb10<00:01:17.909> brightness<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> quite

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
adjusted the bb10 brightness to a quite

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.810 
adjusted the bb10 brightness to a quite
high<00:01:19.619> level<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.220> why<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> feel<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
high level and that's why I feel the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.980 
high level and that's why I feel the
difference<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> brightness<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.750> other<00:01:21.869> than

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
difference of brightness but other than

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
difference of brightness but other than
that<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.770> speed<00:01:23.070> looked<00:01:23.340> pretty<00:01:23.670> good<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.450> now

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
that the speed looked pretty good so now

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
that the speed looked pretty good so now
in<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> first<00:01:25.530> browser<00:01:26.040> test<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.610> saw<00:01:26.820> both

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
in the first browser test we saw both

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.260 
in the first browser test we saw both
smartphones<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.439> gone<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.159> cnn.com<00:01:29.610> before

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
smartphones have gone to cnn.com before

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.230 
smartphones have gone to cnn.com before
and<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:31.049> test<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.829> either<00:01:32.220> phone<00:01:32.640> has<00:01:33.030> gone

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and this test on either phone has gone

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.550 
and this test on either phone has gone
to<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:34.110> website<00:01:34.560> which<00:01:34.799> has<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.210> google<00:01:36.210> maps

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
to this website which has a google maps

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.929 
to this website which has a google maps
integration<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.799> three<00:01:38.610> two<00:01:39.210> one

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.679 

so<00:01:43.939> bb10<00:01:44.360> us<00:01:44.570> faster<00:01:45.110> off<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.530> gate<00:01:46.039> and<00:01:46.310> we'll

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
so bb10 us faster off the gate and we'll

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.190 
so bb10 us faster off the gate and we'll
see<00:01:47.689> how<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.810> goes

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
