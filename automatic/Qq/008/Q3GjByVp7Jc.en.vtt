00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.429
 in the first part of the documentation 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.490
 we shown like the pond in three 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.219
 variations were planned and how to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.920
 this is done with the help of modern 3d technology 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.100
 also on your own computer or tablet 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.560
 see for yourself from all perspectives 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.689
 can 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.670
 we were there as the excavator the hole 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.189
 has dug and we have with 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.440
 different animations shown how 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.350
 measure the pit and the fleece 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.930
 was rolled out 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.520
 Finally, the film was in a few 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.520
 minutes dragged into the pit 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.660
 up to this point we are in 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.940
 first part of these building instructions for 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.800
 come to a swimming pond who believes 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.660
 that now the foil lies in it only 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.670
 still water must be introduced and 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.570
 so that everything is okay , that displaces one 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.170
 few problems 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.539
 The guaranteed will come a very 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.699
 quickly the problem arises 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.260
 sediment that is inevitably on the ground 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.500
 accumulates against autumn leaves helps one 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.049
 foliage protection net against pollen and 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.920
 petals you can use a scanner 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.710
 use 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.990
 but you will never be able to prevent that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.799
 something sinks to the ground and there 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.930
 is gradually reduced to mud in the 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.390
 Over the years, a thicker one emerges 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.470
 layered by swimmers or fish 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.840
 The pond is whirled up again and again 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.340
 grund becomes a kind of compost pile 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.680
 with each stir up the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.119
 Nutrients back into the water and fertilize 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.220
 there the next generation 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.220
 this problem is inevitable 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.579
 the water is all green or make it 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.460
 everybody is driving 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.439
 but you can preventively have naturagart 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.289
 for this the technique of sediment trap 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.270
 develops while the bitch fall 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.719
 article through a lattice sheet metal and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.760
 can be targeted from there 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:14.739
 I think that will be taken away 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.410
 insufficient sediment control 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.330
 For over 90 percent of all pond problems 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.430
 it is therefore very responsible 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.500
 meaningful such a sediment trap 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.019
 if you have such problems 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.180
 to solve it in advance 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.849
 You can do it at the same time 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.260
 another very slowly ticking 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.079
 disarm time bomb 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 it's about making everyone clear 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.650
 want to participate then that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.780
 sunlight but also unhindered to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.349
 the film can urgently and the uv 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.530
 share in the radiation destroyed 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.180
 in the longer term the film in nature 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.519
 Particle prevents the density 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.160
 bepflanzung that the sunlight to 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.870
 ground can penetrate 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.030
 in clear fish and swimming ponds 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.190
 Mostly nothing grows the fish 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.500
 eat the plant the float 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:09.000
 want to have free track then however 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.549
 the sunlight penetrates deep into the pond 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.540
 1000 sheets no light no algae the 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.919
 the radiation would stop 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.040
 especially the proportion is problematic 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.590
 on ultraviolet light in the course of 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.030
 time destroy the uv radiate all 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.959
 plastic films break 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.419
 at the latest with frost the solution is one 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.419
 rock hard armor of the film 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:40.090
 In this connection one can also have one 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:43.440
 secure access control are the films 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.599
 extremely happy under water 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.030
 in the first step is a verbund 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.040
 matt on the foil glued on the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.980
 Backside there are fiber free areas 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.840
 on which special adhesive strips adhere 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.010
 the whole film is covered with it 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.049
 adjacent tracks become the 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.530
 overlap area easiest with 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.750
 Hot air connected 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.319
 so you can also slide easily 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.150
 fold invisible can make the mortar 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.870
 you can either mix yourself or 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.970
 as used here as a finished sackware 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.400
 special cement will take care of that and 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.450
 several additives are used for this 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.850
 an optimal result on this provide 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.669
 Construction site in the naturagart park will become one 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.889
 usual cleaning machine used them 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.650
 injects the thin mortar layer with 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.440
 compressed air in the composite mat of the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.500
 Mortar is made with a color powder depending on 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.390
 wish dyed on the hang 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.960
 One only develops about five to ten 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.230
 millimeter thin layer on the floor 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.740
 and the terraces will be 3 to 5 cm 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.480
 mortar will also be applied 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.740
 this demand fall as well as the suction and 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.970
 built-in lines 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.460
 you can cover the areas with one 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.010
 Trowel almost tile peel off sheet 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.440
 with very large particles you can 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.500
 this most often save then 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.390
 one creates about 500 square meters per 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.740
 Day 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.419
 You can pond your whole 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.400
 different safety levels 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.380
 what we give you in this video 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.970
 Show is the ideal solution is possible 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.220
 of course easier too 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.320
 accordingly different are the 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.570
 costs for the building material 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.300
 they vary between 200000 euro for 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.090
 the simplest version up to about 7000 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.070
 euro for such an ideal version build 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.289
 Of course, you have to do it yourself 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.210
 how does that work we show them in yes 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.720
 this series and in the construction manuals 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.190
 that at naturagart gives the result 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.870
 is a part of not like one 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.410
 foil roof but like a natural one 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.080
 Sandpit does not look like the uv light 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.000
 the sun nor the children play again 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.669
 dogs claws or heron beaks 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.680
 can penetrate this armor layer 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.680
 the foil is perfectly protected underneath
