00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.529
 one more interesting novelty which 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.960
 presented on chain 2013 this is a tablet 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.020
 fujitsu stylistic m700 2 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.560
 in principle, the device was presented 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.359
 on mvc that was a week earlier but we 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.919
 just do not get around so we will tell 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.519
 this tablet is now made for rather 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.059
 business user it is enough 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:38.370
 expensive 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.000
 prices it starts from 990 9 euros in 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.000
 Russia exact price is still unknown 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.789
 so well, in short something around 40 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.820
 thousand rubles is expensive but there is a reason 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.170
 pay so here is a 10 inch display 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.870
 the resolution of 1080 by 1200 pixels is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 even more than full hd 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.989
 while everything is running 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.750
 android 4.0 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.920
 why not 41 because the system is more 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 stable and since we sell it differently 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 i fujitsu submits tablet 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.580
 business users mean he should 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 to be reliable it is reliable not only 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.050
 because it's not the android itself 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.140
 latest version but also because of the 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.819
 score standard ip 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:30.410
 58 means you can put in quelle 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.410
 pollute in every way and even 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.200
 place under water 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.090
 depth 1 meter 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.600
 up to half an hour 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.299
 what we have interesting in terms of ports 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.640
 audio jack on the left side of the micro usb port 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.950
 and under the plug it is then rubberized 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.690
 pretty comfortable double button 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.610
 adjust the volume below two just 2 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.490
 2 notches for cat connection 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.890
 Docking stations, respectively, are behind 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.149
 two contacts for charging purely for 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.009
 charging and data transfer is not 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.990
 supported because water 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.490
 security by the way about the transfer 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.920
 data this micro usb port 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.290
 also supports the regime and mitchell 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.739
 You can use an adapter here. 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.290
 to plug 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.440
 from home and display video pics and stuff 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.739
 stuff on the big screen 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.860
 there is a big plug on the right side 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.980
 which is a port for micro sim 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.069
 cards and micro sd cards with sd 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.769
 cards up to 64 gigabytes 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.459
 own memory and 32 gigabytes 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.459
 so I understand why 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.920
 let a large amount of cards here this 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.080
 the antenna on here is not advancing because 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.510
 that this is a sample for Asian countries 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.010
 television in Europe is another standard 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.050
 so you just don't need it and 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.410
 Russia will not have these antennas either 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.019
 above the power button such 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.030
 silver back camera for 8 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:04.810
 megapixels and all here because all 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.330
 I told it seems the gadget is built on 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.250
 based on nvidia tegra 3 chipset 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.140
 this is a quad-core processor with a clock 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.519
 1.3 gigahertz frequency here 2 gigs 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.130
 RAM and graphics accordingly 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.819
 g-force mobile graphics 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.730
 device 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.250
 expensive but nonetheless very very 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.080
 interesting by the way this is still the thing 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.950
 this is not just a return button on 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.049
 home screen 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.709
 it is also a fingerprint scanner 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.080
 which must additionally protect 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.040
 all sorts of business secrets from abuses 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.040

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.040
