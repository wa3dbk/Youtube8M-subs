we<00:00:00.210> think<00:00:00.420> that<00:00:00.539> when<00:00:01.290> creativity<00:00:01.829> happens<00:00:02.190> it

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
we think that when creativity happens it

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.789 
we think that when creativity happens it
just<00:00:02.370> it<00:00:02.730> happens<00:00:03.090> sort<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.330> magically<00:00:03.959> and

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
just it happens sort of magically and

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.130 
just it happens sort of magically and
that<00:00:05.279> there<00:00:06.180> are<00:00:06.270> either<00:00:06.390> really<00:00:06.720> highly

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
that there are either really highly

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.230 
that there are either really highly
structured<00:00:07.700> sort<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.760> traditional

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
structured sort of traditional

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.430 
structured sort of traditional
environments<00:00:09.719> or<00:00:09.870> they're<00:00:09.990> creative

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
environments or they're creative

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.560 
environments or they're creative
environments<00:00:11.010> where<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.849> don't<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.300> put

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
environments where you don't have to put

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.650 
environments where you don't have to put
any<00:00:12.719> structure<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.790> but<00:00:14.790> with<00:00:15.330> design

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
any structure on it but with design

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.490 
any structure on it but with design
thinking<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:16.080> we're<00:00:16.170> saying<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.470> that

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
thinking what we're saying is that

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.250 
thinking what we're saying is that
there's<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.240> highly<00:00:18.240> structured<00:00:18.510> environment

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
there's a highly structured environment

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:37.670 
there's a highly structured environment
that<00:00:19.800> fosters<00:00:20.070> creativity<00:00:36.260> get<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.469> hands

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
that fosters creativity get your hands

that fosters creativity get your hands
on<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> space<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.489> gets<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:40.020> see

on the space it gets you to actually see

work on the design challenges we

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
work on the design challenges we

important for them to know the steps to
have<00:01:34.030> that<00:01:34.240> structure<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.930> know<00:01:35.020> all<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.010> steps

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
have that structure I know all the steps

have that structure I know all the steps
and<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.540> really<00:01:37.810> do<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:37.990> think<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.320> important

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
and I really do you think is important

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
the phases that we teach and then we

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.050 
the phases that we teach and then we
talk<00:01:41.470> about<00:01:41.620> our<00:01:41.980> empathy<00:01:42.390> defined<00:01:43.410> id8

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
to come up with these ideas that can go

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.610 
to come up with these ideas that can go
beyond<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:55.030> structure<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:56.110> just<00:01:56.350> becomes

develop<00:02:19.819> empathy<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.629> particular<00:02:21.019> person

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
develop empathy for a particular person

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.410 
develop empathy for a particular person
or<00:02:21.620> group<00:02:21.799> of<00:02:21.890> people<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:23.390> a

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
or group of people that have a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.970 
or group of people that have a

perspective or have some experience with
that<00:02:25.040> issue

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
that issue

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.610 
that issue
empathy<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.299> basically<00:02:26.750> putting<00:02:26.989> yourself<00:02:27.379> in

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
empathy is basically putting yourself in

empathy is basically putting yourself in
so<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:27.950> guess<00:02:28.280> issues<00:02:28.640> need<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.180> see<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.599> how

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
so I guess issues need to see and how

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.010 
so I guess issues need to see and how

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:54.709 
and so it impacted me in the drive of

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:58.540 
and so it impacted me in the drive of
the<00:04:55.279> question<00:04:55.669> because<00:04:56.139> I<00:04:57.139> choose<00:04:57.709> my<00:04:57.949> age<00:04:58.189> and

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
the question because I choose my age and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.519 
the question because I choose my age and
I<00:04:58.669> was<00:04:58.819> just<00:04:58.909> basically<00:04:59.059> you<00:04:59.629> know<00:04:59.659> saying<00:05:00.199> how

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:00.529 
I was just basically you know saying how

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:09.969 
I was just basically you know saying how
would<00:05:00.709> it<00:05:00.739> feel<00:05:01.279> to<00:05:01.879> meet<00:05:02.059> her

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.840 

actions<00:05:10.979> which<00:05:11.250> are<00:05:11.810> feeling<00:05:12.810> stop<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:14.160> what

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
actions which are feeling stop and what

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.159 
actions which are feeling stop and what
are<00:05:14.940> their<00:05:15.150> thoughts<00:05:15.210> when<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.780> think<00:05:16.050> that

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
are their thoughts when you think that

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.689 
are their thoughts when you think that
they're<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:17.100> it's<00:05:17.250> all<00:05:18.289> user<00:05:19.289> centered<00:05:19.889> not<00:05:20.460> in

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
they're so it's all user centered not in

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.180 
they're so it's all user centered not in
your<00:05:20.910> lesson<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.690> guess<00:05:22.350> sticky<00:05:22.590> notes<00:05:22.860> right

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
your lesson I guess sticky notes right

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
it can be anything to stick up on board

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.420 
it can be anything to stick up on board
ten<00:05:28.620> minutes<00:05:28.949> as<00:05:29.160> much<00:05:29.820> as<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.090> can<00:05:30.410> remember
