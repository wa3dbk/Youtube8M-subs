it's very happy in their cancer lilit is
an<00:01:56.399> energy<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.180> all<00:01:57.390> about

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
an energy that is all about

an energy that is all about

self-interest that is about I want my
equality<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.460> paradox

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.620 
equality here so it's a bit of a paradox
between<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.500> giving<00:02:04.979> nature<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.700> cancer<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
between the giving nature of cancer and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.279 
between the giving nature of cancer and
between<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.119> self-interest<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.300> limits<00:02:09.840> that

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
between the self-interest of limits that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.140 
between the self-interest of limits that
is<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> paradox<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.430> will<00:02:11.610> all<00:02:11.849> have<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
is a paradox that we will all have to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.600 
is a paradox that we will all have to
solve<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.900> our<00:02:13.110> horoscopes<00:02:13.769> in<00:02:14.010> our<00:02:14.160> charts

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
solve in our horoscopes in our charts

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.550 
solve in our horoscopes in our charts
and<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.120> second<00:02:15.870> house<00:02:16.019> so<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.470> about

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and for you second house so it's about

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.009 
and for you second house so it's about
self-worth<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.940> about<00:02:18.239> for<00:02:18.569> some<00:02:18.810> of

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
self-worth and it's about for some of

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.350 
self-worth and it's about for some of
you<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.620> about<00:02:19.830> money<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.220> well<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.150> hope

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
you it's about money as well so I hope

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.420 
you it's about money as well so I hope
for<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> lot<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.989> geminis<00:02:22.590> who<00:02:22.799> had<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.010> hard<00:02:23.310> time

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
for a lot of geminis who had a hard time

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.820 
for a lot of geminis who had a hard time
when<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.360> considers<00:02:24.810> money<00:02:25.049> that<00:02:25.560> will

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
when it considers money that will

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.530 
when it considers money that will
attract<00:02:26.220> money<00:02:26.459> with<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> Jupiter<00:02:27.390> in

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
attract money with that Jupiter in

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.440 
attract money with that Jupiter in
cancer<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:28.380> there's<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.709> possibility<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.730> or

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
cancer and there's a possibility of or

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.229 
cancer and there's a possibility of or
have<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:31.019> ease<00:02:31.349> when<00:02:32.160> it<00:02:32.340> comes<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:33.030> your

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
have more ease when it comes to your

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.110 
have more ease when it comes to your
resources<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.860> for<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.099> lot<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.280> people<00:02:35.670> it's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
resources but for a lot of people it's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.820 
resources but for a lot of people it's
on<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.330> deeper<00:02:36.750> level<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:37.319> on<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> more

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
on a deeper level it's on a more

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.479 
on a deeper level it's on a more
emotional<00:02:38.549> psychological<00:02:39.239> level<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.489> that

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
emotional psychological level and that

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.819 
emotional psychological level and that
is<00:02:41.700> about<00:02:41.910> yourself<00:02:42.510> word<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.079> your<00:02:43.260> talents

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
is about yourself word and your talents

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.380 
is about yourself word and your talents
which<00:02:44.579> is<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:44.970> important<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.090> limit<00:02:48.090> is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
which is so important this a limit is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.860 
which is so important this a limit is
also<00:02:49.290> about<00:02:49.440> self-worth<00:02:50.099> actually<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.209> it's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
also about self-worth actually it's it's

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.199 
also about self-worth actually it's it's
when<00:02:52.859> you<00:02:52.950> listen<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.400> story<00:02:53.819> where<00:02:54.120> it

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
when you listen to the story where it

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.300 
when you listen to the story where it
comes<00:02:54.480> from<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.069> check<00:02:56.280> that

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
comes from that I you can check that

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.390 
comes from that I you can check that
other<00:02:56.640> video<00:02:57.170> about<00:02:58.170> Lilith<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.769> Jupiter<00:02:59.250> it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
other video about Lilith and Jupiter it

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.309 
other video about Lilith and Jupiter it
is<00:02:59.579> really<00:02:59.940> about<00:03:00.180> standing<00:03:00.840> up<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:00.989> yourself

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
is really about standing up for yourself

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.599 
is really about standing up for yourself
and<00:03:01.980> standing<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:02.760> being<00:03:03.180> very<00:03:03.630> confident

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
and standing and being very confident

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.020 
and standing and being very confident
about<00:03:05.609> yourself<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.660> really<00:03:07.350> want<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:08.370> choose

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
about yourself and really want to choose

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.720 
about yourself and really want to choose
from<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:10.350> Lynn<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.799> is<00:03:10.980> where<00:03:11.519> we<00:03:11.700> are

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
from that now Lynn it is where we are

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.259 
from that now Lynn it is where we are
not<00:03:12.150> being<00:03:12.540> mainstream<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:14.310> have<00:03:14.519> a

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
not being mainstream so if we have a

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.440 
not being mainstream so if we have a
tragedy<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.530> means<00:03:16.859> that<00:03:17.040> things<00:03:17.370> will<00:03:18.180> happen

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
tragedy it means that things will happen

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.490 
tragedy it means that things will happen
in<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.959> non<00:03:19.200> mainstream<00:03:19.530> way<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:22.019> will<00:03:22.200> have

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
in a non mainstream way so you will have

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.410 
in a non mainstream way so you will have
to<00:03:22.769> adjust<00:03:22.950> some<00:03:23.760> things<00:03:24.680> considering<00:03:25.680> your

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
to adjust some things considering your

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.629 
to adjust some things considering your
your<00:03:27.420> earnings<00:03:27.989> arm<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.650> mean<00:03:28.829> your<00:03:29.100> resources

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
your earnings arm I mean your resources

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.660 
your earnings arm I mean your resources
are<00:03:29.970> considering<00:03:30.959> also<00:03:31.560> what<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.040> are

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
will be prompted in situations

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.140 
will be prompted in situations
especially<00:03:42.750> with<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.410> Gemini<00:03:44.160> rising<00:03:44.400> having

especially with it Gemini rising having
this<00:03:45.299> all<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.720> your<00:03:45.870> second<00:03:46.620> house<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:48.079> cancer

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
this all in your second house of cancer

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.069 
this all in your second house of cancer
you<00:03:49.650> will<00:03:49.829> be<00:03:49.980> triggered<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:51.329> stand<00:03:51.870> up<00:03:52.049> for

you will be triggered to stand up for

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.020 
you will be triggered to stand up for
yourself<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:52.829> maybe<00:03:53.220> in

yourself and maybe in

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.510 
yourself and maybe in
situations<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.840> first<00:03:55.590> feel<00:03:56.010> rejected

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
situations that you first feel rejected

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.970 
situations that you first feel rejected
because<00:03:56.970> limit<00:03:57.569> energy<00:03:57.990> is<00:03:58.170> about<00:03:58.500> where<00:03:58.800> we

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
because limit energy is about where we

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.180 
because limit energy is about where we
feel<00:03:59.250> rejected<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.450> where<00:04:00.990> we<00:04:01.140> have<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:02.010> have

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
feel rejected and where we have we have

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.850 
feel rejected and where we have we have
to<00:04:02.370> raise<00:04:02.670> from<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.420> now<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.319> good<00:04:04.560> thing<00:04:04.620> is

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
to raise from that now the good thing is

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.890 
to raise from that now the good thing is
that<00:04:04.920> Jupiter<00:04:05.520> is<00:04:05.700> there<00:04:05.910> as<00:04:06.060> well<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:06.270> it<00:04:06.690> can

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
that Jupiter is there as well so it can

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.420 
that Jupiter is there as well so it can
help<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:08.959> transcend<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.680> as<00:04:11.370> a

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
help you to transcend that and as a

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
your own equality so maybe you have to

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.590

work<00:04:22.139> harder<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.980> get<00:04:23.220> your<00:04:23.460> money<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:24.000> you

even if all other people are seeing what

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.300 
even if all other people are seeing what

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
some kind of way stand up for yourself

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.250 
some kind of way stand up for yourself
on<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:43.740> particular<00:04:44.430> area<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.240> your<00:04:45.570> mind<00:04:45.840> we

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
on that particular area of your mind we

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.250 
on that particular area of your mind we
all<00:04:46.350> have<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.860> but<00:04:47.430> for<00:04:47.700> you<00:04:47.850> this<00:04:48.570> transit<00:04:49.140> is

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
all have it but for you this transit is

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.690 
all have it but for you this transit is
in<00:04:49.470> your<00:04:49.620> second<00:04:50.010> house<00:04:50.330> so<00:04:52.040> this<00:04:53.040> is<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:53.490> is

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
in your second house so this is this is

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.520 
in your second house so this is this is
very<00:04:53.729> interesting<00:04:54.450> energy<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.290> very

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
very interesting energy and very

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.190 
very interesting energy and very
focusing<00:04:56.220> energy<00:04:56.340> now<00:04:56.729> in<00:04:56.910> July<00:04:57.210> this<00:04:57.840> will<00:04:58.050> go

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
focusing energy now in July this will go

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.550 
focusing energy now in July this will go
on<00:04:58.229> for<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:59.550> next<00:04:59.700> year<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.419> with<00:05:01.080> Lilith<00:05:01.380> it

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
on for the next year and with Lilith it

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.150 
on for the next year and with Lilith it
will<00:05:01.770> go<00:05:01.919> along<00:05:02.130> up<00:05:02.430> until<00:05:02.870> februari<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.160> 2014

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
will go along up until februari of 2014

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.540 
will go along up until februari of 2014
so<00:05:05.430> this<00:05:05.580> is<00:05:05.610> a<00:05:05.790> longer<00:05:06.150> transit<00:05:06.990> but<00:05:07.919> it<00:05:08.310> is

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
so this is a longer transit but it is

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.909 
so this is a longer transit but it is
emphasized<00:05:09.210> now<00:05:09.630> because<00:05:10.110> there<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.380> so<00:05:10.650> many

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
emphasized now because there is so many

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.130 
emphasized now because there is so many
other<00:05:11.160> planets<00:05:11.669> and<00:05:11.820> especially<00:05:12.180> your<00:05:12.419> ruler

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
other planets and especially your ruler

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.920 
other planets and especially your ruler
mercury<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:13.919> that<00:05:14.370> second<00:05:14.789> house<00:05:15.000> so<00:05:15.660> you<00:05:15.720> will

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
mercury in that second house so you will

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.960 
mercury in that second house so you will
be<00:05:15.990> probably<00:05:16.560> also<00:05:16.800> thinking<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.640> lot<00:05:17.729> about

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
be probably also thinking a lot about

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.500 
be probably also thinking a lot about
how<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:18.930> will<00:05:19.229> manage<00:05:19.550> maybe<00:05:20.550> your<00:05:20.789> financial

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
how you will manage maybe your financial

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.659 
how you will manage maybe your financial
situation<00:05:21.750> how<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.590> will<00:05:22.860> do<00:05:23.100> it<00:05:23.310> how<00:05:23.610> you
