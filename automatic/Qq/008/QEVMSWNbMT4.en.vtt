gonna take it and turn it on its side
this<00:00:38.370> whole<00:00:38.670> groove<00:00:39.180> revolves<00:00:39.899> around<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.260> very

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this whole groove revolves around a very

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920 
this whole groove revolves around a very
simple<00:00:41.070> sticking<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.610> right<00:00:42.149> right<00:00:42.390> left<00:00:42.660> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
simple sticking of right right left I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.060 
simple sticking of right right left I
found<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> best<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> come<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:43.950> with

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
found the best way to come up with

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.970 
found the best way to come up with
something<00:00:44.340> new<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.719> take<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:46.230> old<00:00:46.530> things

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
something new is to take some old things

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.680 
something new is to take some old things
and<00:00:47.250> look<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.090> them<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.570> bit

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and look at them a little bit

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.420 
and look at them a little bit
differently<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.649> exactly<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.280> we're

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
differently that's exactly what we're

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.810 
differently that's exactly what we're
gonna<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:50.969> lesson<00:00:52.340> for<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.520> groove

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
gonna do in this lesson for this groove

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430 
gonna do in this lesson for this groove
we're<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.390> working<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.899> triplets

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
we're going to be working with triplets

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.580 
we're going to be working with triplets
now<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.890> count<00:00:56.219> triplets<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.570> way<00:00:57.870> one

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
now we count triplets in this way one

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.420 
now we count triplets in this way one
Lali<00:00:58.890> -<00:00:59.489> Lali<00:00:59.910> three<00:01:00.570> Lali<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.500> Lali<00:01:01.829> there's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
Lali - Lali three Lali for Lali there's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
Lali - Lali three Lali for Lali there's
three<00:01:02.850> triplets<00:01:03.359> per<00:01:03.840> quarter<00:01:04.320> note<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
three triplets per quarter note if you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.920 
three triplets per quarter note if you
have<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.890> bar<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.700> 4/4<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.450> means<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> have

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
have a bar of 4/4 that means you have

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
have a bar of 4/4 that means you have
how<00:01:07.170> many<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> bar<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.130> twelve

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
how many in a bar you have twelve

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.850 
how many in a bar you have twelve
triplets<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.479> bar<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> regular

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
triplets in a bar now with a regular

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.460 
triplets in a bar now with a regular
halftime<00:01:11.520> shuffle<00:01:11.909> you'll<00:01:12.810> find<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
halftime shuffle you'll find that the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.490 
halftime shuffle you'll find that the
ride<00:01:13.740> pattern<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> hi-hat<00:01:14.880> pattern<00:01:15.299> is

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
ride pattern of the hi-hat pattern is

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:25.990 
ride pattern of the hi-hat pattern is
usually<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:17.100> la<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.390> empty<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.619> Li<00:01:19.950> so

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
triplet partial on the snare drum so now

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.139 
triplet partial on the snare drum so now
you<00:01:43.439> have<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> sticking<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> right<00:01:44.909> right

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you have the sticking of right right

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.260 
you have the sticking of right right
left<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> trip<00:01:46.229> bullet<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:47.399> la<00:01:47.670> Li<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
left or a trip bullet one la Li and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.639 
left or a trip bullet one la Li and
we're<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> repeat<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:48.960> over<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.500> over

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
we're going to repeat that over and over

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
we're going to repeat that over and over
and<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:49.979> kind<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.189> takes<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.670> shuffle

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
and it kind of takes that shuffle

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
and it kind of takes that shuffle
pattern<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:51.810> halftime<00:01:52.229> shuffle<00:01:52.439> pattern

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
pattern then halftime shuffle pattern

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:08.520 
pattern then halftime shuffle pattern
and<00:01:53.040> turns<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> around<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.820> itself

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.750 

the<00:02:09.530> thing<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.800> remember<00:02:09.920> with<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.490> is<00:02:10.640> it's

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
the thing to remember with this is it's

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.310 
the thing to remember with this is it's
going<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> 2<00:02:11.390> bar<00:02:11.690> group<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.140> it's<00:02:12.230> gonna

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
going to be a 2 bar group so it's gonna

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.920 
going to be a 2 bar group so it's gonna
take<00:02:12.890> two<00:02:13.160> measures<00:02:13.580> for<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.420> come<00:02:14.630> back

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
take two measures for this to come back

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.530 
take two measures for this to come back
around<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.620> loop<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:16.460> I'm<00:02:16.730> gonna<00:02:16.910> take<00:02:17.300> and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
around and loop now I'm gonna take and

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.390 
around and loop now I'm gonna take and
I'm<00:02:17.600> gonna<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:17.900> gonna<00:02:18.050> add<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.350> backbeat<00:02:19.160> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
I'm gonna so gonna add a backbeat the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.150 
I'm gonna so gonna add a backbeat the
backbeat<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.180> gonna<00:02:20.330> be<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.750> three<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.500> each

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
backbeat is gonna be on three of each

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.930 
backbeat is gonna be on three of each
measure

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
measure

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.100 
measure
so<00:02:23.360> one<00:02:23.720> lolli<00:02:24.020> -<00:02:24.230> lolli<00:02:24.770> three<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.480> -<00:02:26.750> that

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
so one lolli - lolli three on the - that
