00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
to make one out of out of a nice stable

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.479 
to make one out of out of a nice stable
wood<00:00:44.300> like<00:00:44.780> this<00:00:44.829> with<00:00:45.829> traditional<00:00:46.250> hand

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
wood like this with traditional hand

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.590 
wood like this with traditional hand
tools<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:48.219> the<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.850> first<00:00:49.879> thing<00:00:50.269> is<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.570> make

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
tools so the the first thing is to make

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.240 
tools so the the first thing is to make
sure<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:51.019> you<00:00:51.109> select<00:00:51.340> stable<00:00:52.929> stable

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
sure that you select stable stable

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.220 
sure that you select stable stable
quarter<00:00:55.250> sawn<00:00:55.429> wood<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:56.480> has<00:00:56.809> vertical

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
quarter sawn wood that has vertical

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.110 
quarter sawn wood that has vertical
grain<00:00:57.649> like<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.519> can<00:00:58.640> see<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.879> grain

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
grain like this you can see the grain

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.360 
grain like this you can see the grain
running<00:00:59.600> straight<00:00:59.929> along<00:01:00.170> that<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:01.160> means

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
running straight along that that means

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.290 
running straight along that that means
that<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:01.579> will<00:01:01.640> be<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.789> lot<00:01:01.999> more<00:01:02.179> stable<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:05.089> why

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
that it will be a lot more stable so why

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.890 
that it will be a lot more stable so why
don't<00:01:06.050> I<00:01:06.670> recommend<00:01:07.670> using<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.210> metal<00:01:08.659> straight

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
don't I recommend using a metal straight

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.160 
don't I recommend using a metal straight
edge<00:01:09.159> well<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:11.180> nice<00:01:11.480> thing<00:01:11.510> about<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.930> wooden

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
edge well the nice thing about a wooden

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.770 
edge well the nice thing about a wooden
straight<00:01:12.440> edge<00:01:12.620> is<00:01:12.860> it's<00:01:13.670> inexpensive<00:01:14.600> to

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
straight edge is it's inexpensive to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.250 
straight edge is it's inexpensive to
make<00:01:14.990> it's<00:01:15.320> very<00:01:16.450> easy<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.630> repair<00:01:18.050> if<00:01:18.170> you

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
make it's very easy to repair if you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.110 
make it's very easy to repair if you
ever<00:01:18.380> drop<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.800> if<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:19.610> ever<00:01:19.730> drop<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:20.090> of

ever drop it if you ever drop one of
these<00:01:20.240> metal<00:01:20.600> straight<00:01:20.870> edges<00:01:21.230> then<00:01:22.190> you're

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
these metal straight edges then you're

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.410 
these metal straight edges then you're
pretty<00:01:22.700> much<00:01:22.820> out<00:01:23.120> fifty<00:01:23.630> or<00:01:23.750> sixty<00:01:23.900> dollars

video<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.670> what<00:02:13.670> about<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.030> dimension<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
video so what about the dimension of the

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.170 
video so what about the dimension of the
wood<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.019> think<00:02:15.590> everybody<00:02:16.040> should<00:02:16.180> build

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
wood I think everybody should build

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.230 
wood I think everybody should build
theirs<00:02:17.660> with<00:02:18.320> hand<00:02:19.070> tools<00:02:19.310> with<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.730> hand<00:02:19.970> plane

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
theirs with hand tools with a hand plane

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.200 
theirs with hand tools with a hand plane
and<00:02:21.340> all<00:02:22.340> right

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
and all right

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.310 
and all right
you<00:02:23.240> can<00:02:23.390> choose<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.690> dimension<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.260> I

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
you can choose the dimension that I

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.380 
you can choose the dimension that I
chose<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.860> make<00:02:25.010> mine<00:02:25.250> around<00:02:25.520> 36<00:02:26.090> inches<00:02:26.330> long

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
chose to make mine around 36 inches long

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.480 
chose to make mine around 36 inches long
about<00:02:26.990> two<00:02:27.320> inches<00:02:27.560> tall<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.070> about<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.280> half

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
about two inches tall and about a half

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.510 
about two inches tall and about a half
inch<00:02:28.670> thick<00:02:28.820> was<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.540> final<00:02:29.930> dimension<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:31.490> I

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
inch thick was the final dimension so I

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.180 
inch thick was the final dimension so I
like<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.570> make<00:02:32.690> sure<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.290> plane<00:02:33.920> all

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
like to just make sure that I plane all

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.470 
like to just make sure that I plane all
the<00:02:34.460> sides<00:02:35.320> flat<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.620> straight<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.100> square

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
the sides flat and straight and square

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.750 
the sides flat and straight and square
if<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.870> aren't<00:02:39.560> sure<00:02:39.590> how<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.160> this<00:02:40.190> or<00:02:40.670> how

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
if you aren't sure how to do this or how

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.390 
if you aren't sure how to do this or how
to<00:02:40.820> join<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.120> edges<00:02:41.570> flat<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.920> can<00:02:43.070> check<00:02:43.250> out

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
to join the edges flat you can check out

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.550 
to join the edges flat you can check out
my<00:02:43.580> video<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.270> how<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.600> square<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.140> dimension

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
my video on how to square and dimension

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.960 
my video on how to square and dimension
up<00:02:46.750> boards<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.260> uh<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.770> have<00:02:49.520> a<00:02:49.550> link<00:02:49.760> below

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
up boards but uh I have a link below

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.040 
up boards but uh I have a link below
this<00:02:50.210> video<00:02:50.480> for<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.320> but<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:53.420> most<00:02:53.570> important

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
this video for it but the most important

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.620 
this video for it but the most important
part<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.190> once<00:02:55.790> you've<00:02:55.940> got<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> flat<00:02:56.360> face

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
part is to once you've got a flat face

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.670 
part is to once you've got a flat face
is<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.260> make<00:02:58.100> sure<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.460> have<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.610> very<00:02:58.940> flat<00:03:00.070> and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
is to make sure you have a very flat and

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.060 
is to make sure you have a very flat and
straight<00:03:03.880> bottom<00:03:04.930> choose<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.170> bottom<00:03:06.920> that's

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
straight bottom choose the bottom that's

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.180 
straight bottom choose the bottom that's
going<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.430> give<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.850> very<00:03:08.060> best<00:03:08.300> edge<00:03:08.660> and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
going to give you the very best edge and

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.920 
going to give you the very best edge and
make<00:03:10.190> sure<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:10.460> use<00:03:10.640> plane<00:03:11.060> with<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.660> grain

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
make sure you use plane with the grain

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.280 
make sure you use plane with the grain
and<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.910> really<00:03:14.540> nice<00:03:15.340> reference<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:18.230> if

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
and be a really nice reference so but if

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.810 
and be a really nice reference so but if
you<00:03:18.380> don't<00:03:18.530> have<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.980> straight<00:03:19.280> edge<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.640> check

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
you don't have a straight edge to check

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.750 
you don't have a straight edge to check
the<00:03:19.970> flatness<00:03:20.390> of<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.720> just<00:03:21.110> shape<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:22.370> use

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
the flatness of this just shape you use

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.230 
the flatness of this just shape you use
a<00:03:22.790> known<00:03:23.690> flat<00:03:24.050> surface<00:03:24.530> like<00:03:24.800> a<00:03:25.250> melamine

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
a known flat surface like a melamine

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.740 
a known flat surface like a melamine
board<00:03:26.540> or<00:03:26.990> a<00:03:27.020> table<00:03:27.410> saw<00:03:27.590> surface<00:03:28.310> or<00:03:28.880> another

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
board or a table saw surface or another

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.300 
board or a table saw surface or another
straight<00:03:30.020> edge<00:03:30.140> if<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:30.350> have<00:03:30.500> one<00:03:30.740> or

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
straight edge if you have one or

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.210 
straight edge if you have one or
something<00:03:32.030> like<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.960> gauge<00:03:33.890> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
something like that to gauge the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.650 
something like that to gauge the
flatness<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.780> your<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:37.430> your<00:03:37.700> straight<00:03:38.630> edge

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
flatness of your of your straight edge

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.710 
flatness of your of your straight edge
and<00:03:39.370> make<00:03:40.370> sure<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.480> definitely

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
and make sure that it's definitely

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.830 
and make sure that it's definitely
square<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.890> sides<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:45.160> that's<00:03:46.840> about

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
square to the the sides and that's about

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.480 
square to the the sides and that's about
all<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.320> need<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.560> know<00:03:48.680> for<00:03:48.890> dimensioning

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
all you need to know for dimensioning

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.750 
all you need to know for dimensioning
the<00:03:50.120> wood<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:52.010> really<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.460> make<00:03:52.640> it

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
the wood so really you can make it

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.020 
the wood so really you can make it
pretty<00:03:53.240> much<00:03:53.390> any<00:03:53.660> size<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.710> want<00:03:55.030> but

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
pretty much any size that you want but

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.270 
pretty much any size that you want but
the<00:03:56.120> longer<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.810> make<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.710> more<00:03:57.740> accurate

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
the longer you make it the more accurate

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.760 
the longer you make it the more accurate
is<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:58.700> just<00:03:58.730> make<00:03:59.030> sure<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.240> don't<00:03:59.710> have<00:04:00.710> a

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
is but just make sure you don't have a

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.820 
is but just make sure you don't have a
scooped<00:04:01.460> over<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.000> edge<00:04:02.150> shape<00:04:03.020> or<00:04:03.260> an<00:04:03.440> oval

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
scooped over the edge shape or an oval

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.820 
scooped over the edge shape or an oval
make<00:04:04.040> sure<00:04:04.160> it's<00:04:04.310> definitely<00:04:04.520> flat<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:06.620> like

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
make sure it's definitely flat so I like

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.940 
make sure it's definitely flat so I like
to<00:04:06.860> put<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.130> curve<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:07.610> my<00:04:07.760> straight<00:04:08.120> edge<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:09.170> as

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
to put a curve on my straight edge so as

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.620 
to put a curve on my straight edge so as
you<00:04:10.070> can<00:04:10.160> see<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.370> created<00:04:10.490> just<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.150> simple

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
you can see I created just a simple

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:19.120 
you can see I created just a simple
little<00:04:13.600> frame<00:04:14.600> here<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:16.239> scribe<00:04:17.239> out<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.859> arc

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
little frame here to scribe out the arc

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.160 
little frame here to scribe out the arc
so<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:19.790> got<00:04:20.000> some<00:04:20.270> quarter-inch<00:04:20.600> wood<00:04:20.960> that's

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
so I got some quarter-inch wood that's

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.720 
so I got some quarter-inch wood that's
bendable<00:04:21.710> and<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:23.720> marked<00:04:24.260> up<00:04:24.410> with<00:04:24.920> a<00:04:25.220> square

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
bendable and I marked up with a square

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.640 
bendable and I marked up with a square
to<00:04:25.970> about<00:04:26.120> where<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.330> wanted<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.630> arc<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.290> start

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
to about where I wanted to arc to start

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.540 
to about where I wanted to arc to start
and<00:04:27.920> I<00:04:28.670> drew<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.390> I<00:04:29.710> just<00:04:30.710> clamped<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.340> and

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
and I drew and I just clamped that and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.150 
and I drew and I just clamped that and
then<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.810> can<00:04:32.960> see<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.169> bent<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.560> up<00:04:33.680> here<00:04:34.130> I

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
then you can see I bent it up here I

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.640 
then you can see I bent it up here I
found<00:04:34.400> this<00:04:34.610> Center<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.030> marked<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.480> center

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
found this Center I marked the center

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.990 
found this Center I marked the center
and<00:04:36.830> clamp<00:04:37.160> this<00:04:37.340> down<00:04:37.400> there<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:39.520> then<00:04:40.520> over

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
and clamp this down there and then over

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.150 
and clamp this down there and then over
there<00:04:41.270> is<00:04:41.479> the<00:04:41.840> same<00:04:42.110> distance<00:04:42.530> down<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.040> my

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
there is the same distance down so my

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.830 
there is the same distance down so my
arc<00:04:43.340> should<00:04:44.110> be<00:04:45.760> symmetrical<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:47.630> all<00:04:47.750> you

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
arc should be symmetrical so all you

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.030 
arc should be symmetrical so all you
really<00:04:47.960> need<00:04:48.169> to<00:04:48.260> do<00:04:48.380> after<00:04:48.500> you've<00:04:48.740> clamped

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
really need to do after you've clamped

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.300 
really need to do after you've clamped
it<00:04:49.130> up<00:04:49.280> is<00:04:50.110> just<00:04:51.110> start<00:04:51.350> on<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:51.620> line<00:04:52.130> that

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
it up is just start on that line that

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.150 
it up is just start on that line that
you<00:04:52.370> made<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.820> draw<00:04:53.530> clear<00:04:54.530> around<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:54.979> arch

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
you made and draw clear around the arch

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:05.920 
you made and draw clear around the arch
I<00:04:57.910> just<00:04:59.949> take<00:05:00.949> off<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:03.889> clamps<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:05.600> you<00:05:05.750> can

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
I just take off the clamps and you can

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.260 
I just take off the clamps and you can
see<00:05:06.199> that<00:05:06.470> strong<00:05:07.400> all<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.669> way<00:05:07.760> around<00:05:08.060> so

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
see that strong all the way around so

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.939 
see that strong all the way around so
I'll<00:05:09.080> go<00:05:09.199> ahead<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.500> draw<00:05:09.650> in<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.860> little

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
I'll go ahead and draw in a little

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.430 
I'll go ahead and draw in a little
profile<00:05:10.520> here<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:10.940> little<00:05:11.090> over<00:05:11.360> low<00:05:11.630> profile

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
profile here a little over low profile

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.560 
profile here a little over low profile
there<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:14.150> same<00:05:14.389> on<00:05:14.630> that<00:05:14.660> end<00:05:16.510> okay<00:05:17.510> so

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
there and the same on that end okay so

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.060 
there and the same on that end okay so
on<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.900> end<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.169> arch<00:05:18.350> here<00:05:18.620> I'm<00:05:18.830> putting

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
on the end of the arch here I'm putting

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.620 
on the end of the arch here I'm putting
a<00:05:19.220> little<00:05:20.260> oval<00:05:21.260> oh<00:05:21.440> you<00:05:22.190> can<00:05:22.370> see<00:05:22.639> and<00:05:22.910> I'll

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
a little oval oh you can see and I'll

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.770 
a little oval oh you can see and I'll
actually<00:05:23.870> put<00:05:24.229> a<00:05:24.260> little<00:05:24.440> template<00:05:25.570> with<00:05:26.570> this

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
actually put a little template with this

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.930 
actually put a little template with this
video<00:05:27.110> you<00:05:27.199> can<00:05:27.380> look<00:05:27.560> below<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.919> video<00:05:28.190> and

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.230 

or<00:05:31.940> you<00:05:32.120> can<00:05:32.270> use<00:05:32.419> some<00:05:33.940> square<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.090> compass

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
or you can use some square and compass

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:43.330 
or you can use some square and compass
to<00:05:37.360> scribe<00:05:38.360> out<00:05:39.280> your<00:05:40.280> own<00:05:40.460> design<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:42.340> then

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
to scribe out your own design and then

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:53.490 
to scribe out your own design and then
we'll<00:05:43.880> cut<00:05:44.060> these<00:05:44.180> out<00:05:44.419> and<00:05:44.660> rasp<00:05:44.930> them

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.200 

you<00:05:54.500> can<00:05:54.620> see<00:05:54.770> I'm<00:05:54.860> using<00:05:55.010> a<00:05:55.340> tenon<00:05:55.669> saw<00:05:55.910> to<00:05:56.780> cut

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
you can see I'm using a tenon saw to cut

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.010 
you can see I'm using a tenon saw to cut
to<00:05:59.210> cut<00:05:59.419> the<00:05:59.919> the<00:06:00.919> some<00:06:01.510> waste<00:06:02.510> out<00:06:02.720> of<00:06:02.750> there

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
to cut the the some waste out of there

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.480 
to cut the the some waste out of there
to<00:06:03.320> make<00:06:03.470> a<00:06:03.500> little<00:06:03.740> easier<00:06:04.040> to<00:06:04.130> get<00:06:04.220> in<00:06:04.340> here

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
to make a little easier to get in here

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:13.689 
to make a little easier to get in here
with<00:06:04.790> my<00:06:05.000> bow<00:06:05.150> saw<00:06:12.070> you<00:06:13.070> can<00:06:13.220> see<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.460> relief

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
with my bow saw you can see the relief

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.430 
with my bow saw you can see the relief
cuts<00:06:14.000> there<00:06:14.180> make<00:06:14.330> it<00:06:14.419> a<00:06:14.479> lot<00:06:14.630> easier<00:06:17.260> I'm<00:06:18.260> not

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
cuts there make it a lot easier I'm not

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.659 
cuts there make it a lot easier I'm not
going<00:06:18.650> to<00:06:18.740> cut<00:06:18.889> right<00:06:19.040> on<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:19.190> line<00:06:19.400> cuz<00:06:19.580> I'm

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
going to cut right on the line cuz I'm

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:20.890 
going to cut right on the line cuz I'm
going<00:06:19.790> to<00:06:19.850> come<00:06:19.970> back<00:06:20.000> with<00:06:20.240> a<00:06:20.270> rasp<00:06:20.540> but<00:06:20.810> I'll

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
going to come back with a rasp but I'll

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.890 
going to come back with a rasp but I'll
just<00:06:20.930> get<00:06:21.199> close<00:06:25.539> then<00:06:26.539> you<00:06:26.630> can<00:06:26.750> use<00:06:26.870> a

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
just get close then you can use a

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.409 
just get close then you can use a
crosscut<00:06:27.199> saw<00:06:27.470> to<00:06:27.710> cut<00:06:27.979> down<00:06:28.250> through<00:06:28.520> across

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
crosscut saw to cut down through across

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.550 
crosscut saw to cut down through across
the<00:06:29.630> grain<00:06:29.949> to<00:06:30.949> make<00:06:31.070> those<00:06:31.280> relief<00:06:31.610> cuts<00:06:32.560> on

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
the grain to make those relief cuts on

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:42.820 
the grain to make those relief cuts on
the<00:06:34.310> on<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.419> arch<00:06:41.320> so<00:06:42.320> after<00:06:42.530> I<00:06:42.560> finish

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
the on the arch so after I finish

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.710 
the on the arch so after I finish
cutting<00:06:43.539> all<00:06:44.539> this<00:06:44.780> off<00:06:44.960> of<00:06:45.110> the<00:06:45.199> bow<00:06:45.350> saw<00:06:45.620> I

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
cutting all this off of the bow saw I

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.920 
cutting all this off of the bow saw I
take<00:06:47.720> a<00:06:48.020> very<00:06:48.440> sharp<00:06:48.650> block<00:06:48.949> plane<00:06:49.280> and<00:06:50.530> knock

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
take a very sharp block plane and knock

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.640 
take a very sharp block plane and knock
knock<00:06:53.930> this<00:06:54.110> down<00:06:55.750> keeping<00:06:56.750> the<00:06:56.810> on<00:06:57.440> this<00:06:57.590> side

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
knock this down keeping the on this side

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.770 
knock this down keeping the on this side
I<00:06:57.830> can<00:06:57.950> see<00:06:58.310> the<00:06:58.520> actual<00:06:58.970> pencil<00:06:59.210> mark<00:06:59.539> so

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
I can see the actual pencil mark so

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.950 
I can see the actual pencil mark so
keeping<00:07:00.080> that<00:07:00.139> in<00:07:00.460> my<00:07:01.460> sight<00:07:01.789> not<00:07:02.419> to<00:07:02.660> go<00:07:02.780> over

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
keeping that in my sight not to go over

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.600 
keeping that in my sight not to go over
the<00:07:02.990> pencil<00:07:03.410> marks<00:07:03.650> but<00:07:03.830> just<00:07:04.010> to<00:07:04.070> go<00:07:04.190> up<00:07:04.220> to<00:07:04.490> it

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
the pencil marks but just to go up to it

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.969 
the pencil marks but just to go up to it
and<00:07:05.680> this<00:07:06.680> is<00:07:06.740> a<00:07:07.660> modelers<00:07:08.660> rasp<00:07:08.930> this<00:07:09.830> is

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979 
and this is a modelers rasp this is

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.700 
and this is a modelers rasp this is
perfect<00:07:10.340> for<00:07:10.490> getting<00:07:10.700> these<00:07:11.349> getting<00:07:12.349> the

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
perfect for getting these getting the

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.180 
perfect for getting these getting the
little<00:07:12.979> details<00:07:13.639> I<00:07:14.110> used<00:07:15.110> to<00:07:15.260> think<00:07:15.440> that<00:07:15.560> why

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
little details I used to think that why

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.920 
little details I used to think that why
would<00:07:16.370> you<00:07:16.490> spend<00:07:16.700> money<00:07:16.910> on<00:07:17.030> rasp

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
would you spend money on rasp
