 ball bearing so now we have two 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.460
 Buddy location we have the bike 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.270

 rear wheel two small bicycles and that 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.150

 the switzerland is running and that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.010
 The most important thing about welding is of course
