00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
360 so it plays it from all around which

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.960 
360 so it plays it from all around which
is<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:35.960> really<00:00:36.260> nice<00:00:36.440> feature<00:00:36.500> of<00:00:37.040> course<00:00:37.280> not

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
is a really nice feature of course not

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.790 
is a really nice feature of course not
something<00:00:38.329> that<00:00:38.450> other<00:00:38.720> devices<00:00:39.200> tend<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.680> do

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
something that other devices tend to do

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.410 
something that other devices tend to do
they<00:00:40.100> tend<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.399> blow<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:40.670> one<00:00:40.880> way<00:00:41.059> instead<00:00:41.360> of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
they tend to blow it one way instead of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.479 
they tend to blow it one way instead of
all<00:00:41.660> around<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:43.280> do<00:00:43.399> have<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.899> HD<00:00:45.489> speakerphone

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.910 
all around you do have a HD speakerphone
so<00:00:46.880> essentially<00:00:47.540> with<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.079> Samsung<00:00:48.500> device

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
so essentially with the Samsung device

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.209 
so essentially with the Samsung device
it<00:00:49.130> will<00:00:49.280> have<00:00:49.460> HD<00:00:50.059> sound<00:00:50.360> over<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.840> Bluetooth

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
it will have HD sound over the Bluetooth

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.610 
it will have HD sound over the Bluetooth
easy<00:00:52.219> bluetooths<00:00:52.880> are<00:00:53.270> sorry<00:00:53.510> NFC<00:00:54.020> pairing<00:00:54.379> by

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
easy bluetooths are sorry NFC pairing by

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.160 
easy bluetooths are sorry NFC pairing by
just<00:00:54.829> tapping<00:00:55.010> on<00:00:55.430> here<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.110> high<00:00:57.110> quality

Bluetooth<00:00:57.890> sound<00:00:58.610> just<00:00:59.480> basically<00:00:59.750> because

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
Bluetooth sound just basically because

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.470 
Bluetooth sound just basically because
as<00:01:00.260> noise<00:01:00.620> cancellation<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:02.239> really

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
as noise cancellation and the really

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.079 
as noise cancellation and the really
cool<00:01:03.260> part<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.649> it<00:01:03.890> does<00:01:03.980> have<00:01:04.039> up<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.640> 15

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
cool part is that it does have up to 15

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.660 
cool part is that it does have up to 15
hours<00:01:05.269> of<00:01:05.479> playback<00:01:06.170> which<00:01:06.650> is<00:01:06.799> just<00:01:07.010> really

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
nice that's a really good time for a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.510 
nice that's a really good time for a
speaker<00:01:10.970> i<00:01:11.000> would<00:01:11.180> say<00:01:11.920> when<00:01:12.920> we<00:01:13.010> flip<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.250> box

it<00:01:26.090> annoyed<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.630> keep<00:01:26.750> saying<00:01:26.960> that<00:01:27.080> durable

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
it annoyed to keep saying that durable

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.039 
it annoyed to keep saying that durable
stylish<00:01:28.490> all-metal<00:01:29.000> construction<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.750> does

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
stylish all-metal construction it does

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.440 
stylish all-metal construction it does
seem<00:01:30.290> very<00:01:30.650> heavy<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.430> I'm<00:01:32.030> guessing<00:01:32.360> that's

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
seem very heavy and I'm guessing that's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.780 
seem very heavy and I'm guessing that's
because<00:01:32.659> right<00:01:33.080> here<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.710> says<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:34.610> is

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
because right here it says it is

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
weighted at the bottom in order to give

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.070 
weighted at the bottom in order to give
a<00:01:37.100> better<00:01:37.250> sound<00:01:37.610> well<00:01:37.939> it's<00:01:38.150> definitely<00:01:38.479> it's

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
a better sound well it's definitely it's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.410 
a better sound well it's definitely it's
a<00:01:39.229> bit<00:01:39.380> heavier<00:01:39.680> box<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.400> it's<00:01:41.119> supposed<00:01:41.330> to

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
a bit heavier box and it's supposed to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.480 
a bit heavier box and it's supposed to
be<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.570> very<00:01:41.750> small<00:01:42.020> design<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:43.040> have<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:43.220> micro

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
be a very small design you have a micro

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.649 
be a very small design you have a micro
USB<00:01:43.520> for<00:01:44.030> charging<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.630> headphone<00:01:45.259> port<00:01:45.619> and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
USB for charging it headphone port and

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.300 
USB for charging it headphone port and
Bluetooth<00:01:47.659> tapping<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:48.799> if<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.009> don't<00:01:49.189> have

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
Bluetooth tapping so if you don't have

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.950 
Bluetooth tapping so if you don't have
NFC<00:01:49.520> on<00:01:49.729> your<00:01:49.850> device<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.390> pair<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.689> and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
NFC on your device you can pair it and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.340 
NFC on your device you can pair it and
of<00:01:51.710> course<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.159> power<00:01:52.490> switch<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.840> really

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
of course the power switch so really

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.590 
of course the power switch so really
nice<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.070> let's<00:01:55.700> take<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> look<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:56.299> see<00:01:56.329> how

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
nice and let's take a look and see how

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:07.210 
nice and let's take a look and see how
it<00:01:56.689> looks<00:01:56.750> inside<00:01:57.110> alright

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.249
