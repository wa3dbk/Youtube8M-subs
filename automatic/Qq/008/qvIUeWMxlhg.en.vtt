00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
impacts that was years ago and they are

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.270 
impacts that was years ago and they are
still<00:04:58.750> using<00:04:58.990> these<00:04:59.199> same<00:04:59.530> old<00:04:59.830> toxic

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
chemicals today big cosmetics companies

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.950 
chemicals today big cosmetics companies
say<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.580> doses<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.090> poison<00:05:04.300> in<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.630> products

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
say the doses of poison in the products

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.050 
say the doses of poison in the products
are<00:05:05.080> small<00:05:05.440> enough<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.710> be<00:05:05.860> harmless<00:05:06.220> yeah

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
are small enough to be harmless yeah

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.820 
are small enough to be harmless yeah
maybe<00:05:07.360> if<00:05:07.539> you<00:05:07.630> use<00:05:07.780> them<00:05:07.930> once<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.259> year<00:05:08.650> I

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
maybe if you use them once a year I

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.740 
maybe if you use them once a year I
guess<00:05:09.580> they<00:05:09.729> never<00:05:09.819> get<00:05:10.120> out<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.300> see<00:05:10.569> that

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
guess they never get out and see that

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.969
