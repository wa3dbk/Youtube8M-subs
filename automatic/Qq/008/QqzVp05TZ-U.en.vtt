Tim<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.120> making<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.569> chest<00:02:12.990> with<00:02:13.380> iron

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
Tim like you're making a chest with iron

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.730 
Tim like you're making a chest with iron
and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.100> put<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.610> poor<00:02:15.420> IAM<00:02:15.630> ingots<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and then put a poor IAM ingots in the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.350 
and then put a poor IAM ingots in the
middle<00:02:16.980> giving<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.459> trained<00:02:17.880> horse<00:02:17.910> deal

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
middle giving you a trained horse deal

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.080 
middle giving you a trained horse deal
so<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.959> kind<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.170> making<00:02:19.290> an<00:02:19.680> iron<00:02:20.010> block<00:02:20.490> but

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
so it's kind of making an iron block but

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.440 
so it's kind of making an iron block but
with<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.200> before<00:02:22.950> ending<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.310> inside<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.910> as

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
with a before ending it inside and as

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.870 
with a before ending it inside and as
opposed<00:02:24.690> gained<00:02:24.900> 18<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.920> it's<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.400> pretty<00:02:26.760> good

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
opposed gained 18 so it's a pretty good

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.570 
opposed gained 18 so it's a pretty good
deal<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.570> then<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.320> next<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.890> reinforced

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
deal and then on next is reinforced

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.910 
deal and then on next is reinforced
glass<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:30.480> make<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> reinforced<00:02:31.140> glass<00:02:31.260> you

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
glass to make a reinforced glass you

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:41.540 
glass to make a reinforced glass you
need<00:02:33.530> for<00:02:34.530> iron<00:02:34.860> ingots<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:38.180> 4<00:02:39.180> /<00:02:39.420> 4<00:02:39.690> units<00:02:40.550> and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
need for iron ingots and 4 / 4 units and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.920 
need for iron ingots and 4 / 4 units and
put<00:02:41.760> those<00:02:41.880> together<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.360> then<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.750> get<00:02:42.870> your

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
put those together and then you get your

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.780 
put those together and then you get your
reinforced<00:02:43.650> glass<00:02:43.739> once<00:02:44.160> put<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.430> glass<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
reinforced glass once put the glass the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.470 
reinforced glass once put the glass the
middle<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.959> get<00:02:46.410> reinforced<00:02:46.980> glass<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:48.300> then

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
middle so get reinforced glass and then

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.880 
middle so get reinforced glass and then
finally<00:02:48.989> sandbags<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.590> course<00:02:52.800> the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
finally sandbags and then of course the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.960 
finally sandbags and then of course the
cattlemen<00:02:53.250> now<00:02:53.820> they<00:02:54.060> um<00:02:54.500> whoa<00:02:55.640> that's<00:02:56.640> wrong

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
cattlemen now they um whoa that's wrong

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.720 
cattlemen now they um whoa that's wrong
the<00:02:57.660> tunneler<00:02:58.260> I'm<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:59.190> quite<00:02:59.489> interesting

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
the tunneler I'm is quite interesting

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.860 
the tunneler I'm is quite interesting
i'll<00:03:00.000> show<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.750> second<00:03:01.470> after<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:02.870> this

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
i'll show you that a second after I this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
so you get six in bags the tunneler is

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.880 
so you get six in bags the tunneler is
one<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.730> my<00:03:08.820> favorite<00:03:09.150> blocks<00:03:09.390> cuz<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.530> some

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
one of my favorite blocks cuz it's some

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.160 
one of my favorite blocks cuz it's some

the start of all the automatic things as

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.759 
the start of all the automatic things as
I<00:03:13.290> said<00:03:13.470> before<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.880> side<00:03:15.390> guys<00:03:15.709> planning<00:03:16.709> on

I said before the side guys planning on

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.520 
I said before the side guys planning on
adding<00:03:17.070> um<00:03:17.519> auto<00:03:17.880> farm<00:03:18.360> blocks<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:19.110> like<00:03:19.320> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.770 
adding um auto farm blocks just like the
ton<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.820> i'll<00:03:20.910> show<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.180> tongue<00:03:21.420> there<00:03:21.600> in

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
ton so i'll show you the tongue there in

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.569 
ton so i'll show you the tongue there in
a<00:03:21.810> little<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:24.620> now<00:03:25.620> i<00:03:25.650> also<00:03:25.950> want<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.310> show<00:03:26.400> you

that<00:03:26.910> um<00:03:27.560> reinforced<00:03:28.560> iron<00:03:28.829> looks<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.310> lot<00:03:29.579> like

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
that um reinforced iron looks a lot like

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.319 
that um reinforced iron looks a lot like
iron<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.410> major<00:03:31.620> difference<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
iron but the one major difference is the

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.610 
iron but the one major difference is the
purple<00:03:34.230> streaks<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.430> reinforced<00:03:36.030> iron<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.870> so

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
purple streaks in reinforced iron in so

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.550 
purple streaks in reinforced iron in so
and<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.700> darker<00:03:39.329> kind<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.840> tinting<00:03:40.170> around<00:03:40.410> it

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and the darker kind of tinting around it

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.860 
and the darker kind of tinting around it
so<00:03:41.519> I'm<00:03:41.610> go<00:03:41.820> ahead<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.060> show<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.420> bunker

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
sandbags of the same property of sand so

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.590 
sandbags of the same property of sand so
they<00:03:49.579> fall<00:03:50.579> but<00:03:50.850> there<00:03:51.000> are<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> lot<00:03:51.299> stronger

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
they fall but there are a lot stronger

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.380 
they fall but there are a lot stronger
on<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.840> sand<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:52.530> not<00:03:53.519> scape<00:03:53.760> confused<00:03:56.329> so<00:03:57.329> i'm

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
going to show you what I created this is

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.240 
going to show you what I created this is
a<00:03:58.680> bunker<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.280> made<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:01.290> i'll<00:04:01.410> show<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
a bunker I made and i'll show you the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.729 
a bunker I made and i'll show you the
blast<00:04:02.640> resistance<00:04:03.180> in<00:04:03.420> here<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.440> couple

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
blast resistance in here and a couple

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.740 
blast resistance in here and a couple
other<00:04:04.950> things<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.730> made<00:04:06.090> couple<00:04:06.329> sandbags

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
other things so made couple sandbags

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.280 
other things so made couple sandbags
reinforced<00:04:07.440> glass<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.070> close<00:04:08.910> them

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.670 

so<00:04:13.540> another<00:04:14.540> great<00:04:14.629> thing<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.230> like<00:04:15.379> about<00:04:15.409> this

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
so another great thing I like about this

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.289 
so another great thing I like about this
is<00:04:15.980> since<00:04:16.310> reinforced<00:04:17.150> iron<00:04:17.449> is<00:04:17.810> um<00:04:19.150> just<00:04:20.150> as

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
is since reinforced iron is um just as

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.999 
is since reinforced iron is um just as
strong<00:04:20.600> as<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:21.199> if<00:04:21.410> not<00:04:21.590> stronger<00:04:21.829> than

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
strong as not if not stronger than

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.040 
strong as not if not stronger than
obsidian<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.699> what<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.479> can<00:04:23.600> be<00:04:23.690> pushed<00:04:23.900> by

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
obsidian and what it can be pushed by

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.900 
obsidian and what it can be pushed by
Pistons<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.830> can<00:04:25.009> pretty<00:04:25.340> much<00:04:25.460> make<00:04:25.580> a

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.710 

completely<00:04:28.910> explosive<00:04:29.570> proof<00:04:29.870> bunker<00:04:31.720> and

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
completely explosive proof bunker and

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.719 
completely explosive proof bunker and
close<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:32.990> door<00:04:33.380> even<00:04:34.130> if<00:04:34.220> there's<00:04:34.370> nothing

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
close that door even if there's nothing

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.020 
close that door even if there's nothing
really<00:04:34.850> out<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.120> come<00:04:35.960> get<00:04:36.199> me<00:04:36.229> so<00:04:36.639> I<00:04:37.639> made<00:04:38.000> a

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
really out to come get me so I made a

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.820 
really out to come get me so I made a
simple<00:04:38.479> bunker<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.050> course<00:04:39.320> with<00:04:39.470> food<00:04:39.680> and

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
simple bunker of course with food and

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.740 
simple bunker of course with food and
everything<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.310> eventually<00:04:41.060> he<00:04:41.090> plans<00:04:41.539> on

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
everything and eventually he plans on

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.920 
everything and eventually he plans on
making<00:04:41.960> am<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.880> know<00:04:43.880> I'm<00:04:44.120> repeating<00:04:44.479> this<00:04:44.690> a

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
making am I know I'm repeating this a

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.830 
making am I know I'm repeating this a
farm<00:04:45.650> bluff<00:04:45.979> on<00:04:46.280> macland<00:04:46.610> makes<00:04:46.789> warrants<00:04:47.120> so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
farm bluff on macland makes warrants so

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.120 
farm bluff on macland makes warrants so
i'm<00:04:48.139> going<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.349> show<00:04:48.440> you<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.830> blast

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
i'm going to show you the blast

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:58.210 
i'm going to show you the blast
resistance<00:04:49.729> of<00:04:50.060> all<00:04:50.300> these<00:04:52.570> TNT<00:04:54.099> so<00:04:57.160> going<00:04:58.160> to

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
resistance of all these TNT so going to

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:06.749 
resistance of all these TNT so going to
come<00:04:58.430> into<00:04:58.580> my<00:04:58.729> um<00:04:59.090> testing<00:05:00.020> area<00:05:00.380> for<00:05:00.919> T&amp;T<00:05:05.259> and

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
come into my um testing area for T&amp;T and

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.159 
come into my um testing area for T&amp;T and
i'm<00:05:07.759> going<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.940> place<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.360> TNC<00:05:08.810> here<00:05:09.050> and

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
i'm going to place the TNC here and

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.779 
i'm going to place the TNC here and
first<00:05:09.380> I'm<00:05:09.530> gonna<00:05:09.620> go<00:05:09.770> with<00:05:09.949> on<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.400> sand

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
first I'm gonna go with on the sand

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:17.339 
first I'm gonna go with on the sand
block<00:05:11.169> which<00:05:12.169> if<00:05:12.860> it's<00:05:13.580> closer<00:05:13.970> I'll<00:05:14.360> show<00:05:14.690> you

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.510 

it<00:05:18.349> works<00:05:18.650> like<00:05:18.830> this

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.469 

I<00:05:24.740> just<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.860> see<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.099> stand<00:05:26.370> block<00:05:26.699> stood<00:05:27.360> up

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
I just and see the stand block stood up

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.650 
I just and see the stand block stood up
to<00:05:27.629> that<00:05:27.660> but<00:05:28.530> um<00:05:28.710> it's<00:05:29.280> kind<00:05:29.550> of<00:05:29.669> random<00:05:30.240> like

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
to that but um it's kind of random like

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.450 
to that but um it's kind of random like
I'm<00:05:30.870> occasionally<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.770> sand<00:05:32.009> block<00:05:32.250> will

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
I'm occasionally the sand block will

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.149 
I'm occasionally the sand block will
blow<00:05:32.669> up<00:05:32.819> normally<00:05:33.780> when<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.139> TNT<00:05:34.650> is<00:05:34.770> right

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
blow up normally when the TNT is right

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:42.850 
blow up normally when the TNT is right
next<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:36.240> would<00:05:37.199> blow<00:05:37.409> up<00:05:39.770> it<00:05:40.770> was<00:05:40.979> wrong

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
next to it it would blow up it was wrong

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.680 
next to it it would blow up it was wrong
so<00:05:43.860> I'm<00:05:43.949> going<00:05:44.099> to<00:05:44.129> try<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.340> run<00:05:45.120> out<00:05:45.300> as<00:05:45.509> soon

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
so I'm going to try to run out as soon

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.320 
so I'm going to try to run out as soon
as<00:05:45.810> I<00:05:45.900> place<00:05:46.169> this<00:05:46.409> TNT<00:05:46.860> since<00:05:47.639> the<00:05:47.819> stream<00:05:48.180> is

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
as I place this TNT since the stream is

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.760 
as I place this TNT since the stream is
already<00:05:48.720> active<00:05:49.289> so<00:05:50.330> as<00:05:51.440> you<00:05:52.440> can<00:05:52.530> see<00:05:52.680> it

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
already active so as you can see it

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.830 
already active so as you can see it
deletes<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.099> block<00:05:53.280> now<00:05:53.520> if<00:05:54.000> it's<00:05:54.150> um<00:05:54.360> one

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
deletes the block now if it's um one

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.659 
deletes the block now if it's um one
block<00:05:55.020> away<00:05:55.080> from<00:05:55.379> the<00:05:55.590> T&amp;T<00:05:55.979> does<00:05:56.310> not<00:05:56.460> from

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
block away from the T&amp;T does not from

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.740 
block away from the T&amp;T does not from
the<00:05:57.479> right<00:05:57.630> of<00:05:57.750> sandbags<00:05:58.699> so<00:05:59.699> now<00:06:00.599> i'm<00:06:00.720> going

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
the right of sandbags so now i'm going

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.930 
the right of sandbags so now i'm going
to<00:06:00.900> show<00:06:01.050> you<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:01.530> again<00:06:02.159> now<00:06:02.729> i'm<00:06:02.789> going<00:06:02.880> to

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
to show you that again now i'm going to

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:12.350 
to show you that again now i'm going to
show<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.169> fired<00:06:05.630> or<00:06:08.690> yeah<00:06:10.280> so<00:06:11.280> since<00:06:12.030> we're<00:06:12.210> in

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
show you fired or yeah so since we're in

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.480 
show you fired or yeah so since we're in
a<00:06:12.659> iron<00:06:14.210> reinforced<00:06:15.210> iron<00:06:15.449> room<00:06:15.810> as<00:06:16.400> you<00:06:17.400> can

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
a iron reinforced iron room as you can

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.709 
a iron reinforced iron room as you can
see<00:06:17.639> it<00:06:17.729> doesn't<00:06:18.000> really<00:06:18.120> affect<00:06:18.240> anything

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719 
see it doesn't really affect anything

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:22.059 
see it doesn't really affect anything
and<00:06:19.500> then<00:06:19.889> finally<00:06:20.130> the<00:06:20.699> reinforced<00:06:21.539> glass

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
and then finally the reinforced glass

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.830 
and then finally the reinforced glass
which<00:06:23.069> is<00:06:24.139> fairly<00:06:25.139> much<00:06:25.409> alike<00:06:25.949> like<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:26.520> sand

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
which is fairly much alike like the sand

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.110 
which is fairly much alike like the sand
but<00:06:27.840> has<00:06:28.319> a<00:06:28.620> higher<00:06:28.919> glass<00:06:29.400> resistance<00:06:29.909> and

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
but has a higher glass resistance and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.899 
but has a higher glass resistance and
should<00:06:30.960> pretty<00:06:31.139> much<00:06:31.229> stand<00:06:31.590> up<00:06:31.740> to<00:06:32.610> just

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
should pretty much stand up to just

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.029 
should pretty much stand up to just
about<00:06:33.000> anything<00:06:33.300> but<00:06:33.690> with<00:06:34.409> the<00:06:34.620> massive

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
about anything but with the massive

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.070 
about anything but with the massive
amount<00:06:35.099> into<00:06:35.580> you<00:06:35.880> to<00:06:35.969> eventually<00:06:36.509> blow<00:06:36.780> up<00:06:36.930> as

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
amount into you to eventually blow up as

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.260 
amount into you to eventually blow up as
you<00:06:37.349> can<00:06:37.440> see<00:06:37.650> it<00:06:37.949> just<00:06:37.979> did<00:06:38.310> so<00:06:38.789> if<00:06:38.940> it's<00:06:39.090> two

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
you can see it just did so if it's two

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.350 
you can see it just did so if it's two
blocks<00:06:39.389> away<00:06:39.690> that's<00:06:40.289> how<00:06:40.500> that<00:06:40.560> works<00:06:40.770> and

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 
blocks away that's how that works and

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.540 
blocks away that's how that works and
then<00:06:42.360> I'm<00:06:42.509> the<00:06:43.469> tunnel<00:06:43.770> air<00:06:43.860> well<00:06:44.099> it<00:06:44.250> doesn't

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
then I'm the tunnel air well it doesn't

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.499 
then I'm the tunnel air well it doesn't
have<00:06:44.669> it'll<00:06:45.090> blow<00:06:45.630> up<00:06:45.779> the<00:06:45.960> Sears<00:06:46.199> you<00:06:46.469> um<00:06:46.650> like

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
have it'll blow up the Sears you um like

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.159 
have it'll blow up the Sears you um like
something<00:06:48.509> in<00:06:48.630> it<00:06:48.719> now<00:06:48.870> I'm<00:06:48.930> going<00:06:49.050> to<00:06:49.110> show

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
something in it now I'm going to show

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.769 
something in it now I'm going to show
you<00:06:49.289> what<00:06:49.529> the<00:06:49.650> tunneler<00:06:50.069> does<00:06:50.550> so<00:06:51.419> the

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:51.779 
you what the tunneler does so the

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:55.879 
you what the tunneler does so the
tunneler<00:06:52.400> makes<00:06:53.400> tumbles<00:06:53.610> stuff<00:06:54.330> and<00:06:54.650> but<00:06:55.650> it

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
tunneler makes tumbles stuff and but it

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:59.300 
tunneler makes tumbles stuff and but it
makes<00:06:56.159> bunker<00:06:56.880> tones<00:06:57.680> so<00:06:58.680> I'll<00:06:58.949> go<00:06:59.130> ahead<00:06:59.159> and

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
makes bunker tones so I'll go ahead and

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.909 
makes bunker tones so I'll go ahead and
make<00:06:59.490> one<00:06:59.699> right<00:06:59.940> over<00:06:59.969> here<00:07:00.240> I<00:07:00.449> guess<00:07:01.759> and<00:07:03.919> it

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 
make one right over here I guess and it
