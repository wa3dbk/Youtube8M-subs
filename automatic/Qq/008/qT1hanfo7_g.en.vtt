well according to the two test tubes if

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.550 
well according to the two test tubes if
we<00:01:56.980> study<00:01:57.280> closely<00:01:57.670> on<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.720> right<00:01:58.930> test<00:01:59.260> tube

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
you can see underneath how the copper

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.380 
you can see underneath how the copper
sulfate<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.530> zinc<00:02:02.830> foil<00:02:03.160> fuse<00:02:03.760> together<00:02:03.970> to

sulfate and zinc foil fuse together to

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.390 
sulfate and zinc foil fuse together to
produce<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:05.050> ruddy<00:02:05.350> light<00:02:05.440> substance

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
produce a ruddy light substance

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.580 
produce a ruddy light substance
whereas<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.360> test<00:02:07.600> tube<00:02:07.870> on<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.110> Left<00:02:08.380> has

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
whereas the test tube on the Left has

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.750 
whereas the test tube on the Left has
not<00:02:08.770> changed<00:02:09.250> at<00:02:09.369> all

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
not changed at all

why<00:02:10.560> essentially<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.710> displacement<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.730> when<00:02:13.000> a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
why essentially a displacement is when a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.630 
why essentially a displacement is when a
less<00:02:13.390> reactive<00:02:13.780> metal<00:02:14.260> deposits<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.130> top<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.550> a

less reactive metal deposits on top of a
more<00:02:15.940> reactive<00:02:16.480> metal<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:17.410> means<00:02:17.710> if<00:02:17.980> you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
more reactive metal this means if you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.640 
more reactive metal this means if you
have<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.550> solution<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.540> copper<00:02:19.900> sulfate<00:02:20.410> and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
have a solution of a copper sulfate and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.710 
have a solution of a copper sulfate and
replaced<00:02:21.130> one<00:02:21.400> zinc<00:02:21.670> face<00:02:21.940> in<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.450> chip

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
replaced one zinc face in the chip

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.080 
replaced one zinc face in the chip
together<00:02:23.110> then<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.070> copper<00:02:24.340> metal<00:02:24.610> will

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
together then the copper metal will

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.140 
together then the copper metal will
precipitate<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.050> solid<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:27.550> basic<00:02:27.910> rule<00:02:28.120> is

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
precipitate as a solid the basic rule is

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.900 
precipitate as a solid the basic rule is
and<00:02:28.690> more<00:02:29.200> reactive<00:02:29.620> metal<00:02:29.950> will<00:02:30.220> displace<00:02:30.670> a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
and more reactive metal will displace a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.050 
and more reactive metal will displace a
less<00:02:31.420> reactive<00:02:31.810> metal<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.410> solution<00:02:33.220> however

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
less reactive metal and solution however

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.510 
less reactive metal and solution however
we<00:02:34.900> use<00:02:35.110> zinc<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.560> copper<00:02:35.770> sulfate<00:02:36.340> to

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
we use zinc and copper sulfate to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.140 
we use zinc and copper sulfate to
demonstrate<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.590> sink<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.980> settled<00:02:39.610> Midway

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
demonstrate this sink is settled Midway

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.360 
demonstrate this sink is settled Midway
as<00:02:40.330> being<00:02:40.540> much<00:02:40.750> reactive<00:02:41.260> metal<00:02:41.560> whereas

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
as being much reactive metal whereas

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.400 
as being much reactive metal whereas
copper<00:02:42.970> being<00:02:43.450> less<00:02:43.690> reactive

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
copper being less reactive

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.890 
copper being less reactive
therefore<00:02:45.220> as<00:02:45.340> being<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.700> most<00:02:45.910> reactive

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
therefore as being the most reactive

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.860 
therefore as being the most reactive
metal<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.470> gives<00:02:48.070> off<00:02:48.370> its<00:02:48.850> electron<00:02:49.540> shells

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
metal it gives off its electron shells

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.680 
metal it gives off its electron shells
quicker<00:02:50.340> when<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.460> mix<00:02:51.760> zinc<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.450> copper

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
quicker when we mix zinc and copper

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.350 
quicker when we mix zinc and copper
together<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.680> electron<00:02:54.190> from<00:02:54.370> zinc<00:02:54.730> will<00:02:55.240> be

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
together the electron from zinc will be

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.060 
together the electron from zinc will be
transferred<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.110> Aeons<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.830> less

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
transferred to the Aeons of the less

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.740 
transferred to the Aeons of the less
reactive<00:02:57.370> metal<00:02:57.790> which<00:02:58.030> is<00:02:58.180> copper<00:02:58.420> and

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
reactive metal which is copper and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.930 
reactive metal which is copper and
therefore<00:02:59.740> we<00:02:59.890> have<00:03:00.070> that<00:03:00.220> change<00:03:00.670> of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
therefore we have that change of

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.300 
therefore we have that change of
reaction<00:03:01.510> which<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.440> substance

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
reaction which is the substance

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.850 
reaction which is the substance
turning<00:03:03.700> into
