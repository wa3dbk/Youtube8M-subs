20 round pmags one difference though

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.090 
20 round pmags one difference though
that<00:01:20.210> you're<00:01:20.300> gonna<00:01:20.390> see<00:01:20.659> is<00:01:21.619> if<00:01:21.770> we<00:01:21.830> take<00:01:21.950> our

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
that you're gonna see is if we take our

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.340 
that you're gonna see is if we take our
30<00:01:22.310> round<00:01:22.520> PMAG<00:01:22.850> here<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.690> compare<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.200> you'll

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
30 round PMAG here and compare it you'll

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.850 
30 round PMAG here and compare it you'll
see<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.840> locking<00:01:26.840> tab<00:01:27.049> is<00:01:27.290> different<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.799> the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
see the locking tab is different on the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.380 
see the locking tab is different on the
40<00:01:28.130> rounder<00:01:28.430> honestly<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:28.850> don't<00:01:28.970> know<00:01:29.119> quite

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
40 rounder honestly I don't know quite

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.780 
40 rounder honestly I don't know quite
why<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.840> is<00:01:29.990> just<00:01:30.740> hypothesizing<00:01:31.520> here<00:01:31.700> it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
why that is just hypothesizing here it

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.580 
why that is just hypothesizing here it
may<00:01:31.970> be<00:01:32.000> just<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.600> reinforce<00:01:32.899> it<00:01:33.320> with<00:01:33.500> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
may be just to reinforce it with the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.620 
may be just to reinforce it with the
extra<00:01:33.920> weight<00:01:33.950> of<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.579> 40<00:01:35.000> rounder<00:01:35.299> hanging

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
extra weight of the 40 rounder hanging

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.539 
extra weight of the 40 rounder hanging
in<00:01:35.750> your<00:01:35.960> mag<00:01:36.500> low<00:01:36.710> but<00:01:36.950> obviously<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.310> really

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
in your mag low but obviously I really

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:38.620 
in your mag low but obviously I really
don't<00:01:37.700> know<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.060> it's<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:38.240> something<00:01:38.509> that

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
don't know but it's just something that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.330 
don't know but it's just something that
that<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:39.079> noticed<00:01:39.439> when<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.590> was<00:01:39.680> comparing<00:01:40.189> the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
that I noticed when I was comparing the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.310 
that I noticed when I was comparing the
two<00:01:40.490> once<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.210> disassemble<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.750> 40<00:01:42.049> rounder

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
two once you disassemble the 40 rounder

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.870 
two once you disassemble the 40 rounder
you'll<00:01:42.469> see<00:01:42.619> it's<00:01:42.920> pretty<00:01:43.159> much<00:01:43.399> like<00:01:43.610> every

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
you'll see it's pretty much like every

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.660 
you'll see it's pretty much like every
other<00:01:44.030> gen<00:01:44.810> m3p<00:01:45.229> mag<00:01:45.680> out<00:01:45.890> there<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
other gen m3p mag out there the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.480 
other gen m3p mag out there the
anti-tilt<00:01:47.479> follow<00:01:47.780> up<00:01:48.079> front<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.310> only

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
anti-tilt follow up front the only

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.859 
anti-tilt follow up front the only
exception<00:01:49.909> is<00:01:49.939> gonna<00:01:50.090> be<00:01:50.240> obviously<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:50.659> have<00:01:50.840> a

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
exception is gonna be obviously I have a

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.450 
exception is gonna be obviously I have a
much<00:01:51.079> longer<00:01:51.229> spring<00:01:51.680> one<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.280> downsides

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
much longer spring one of the downsides

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.370 
much longer spring one of the downsides
of<00:01:52.850> having<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.149> 4<00:01:53.329> year<00:01:53.450> on<00:01:53.539> PMAG<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.020> obviously

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
of having a 4 year on PMAG is obviously

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.200 
of having a 4 year on PMAG is obviously
gonna<00:01:54.500> be<00:01:54.590> weight<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.310> we'll<00:01:55.789> go<00:01:55.939> ahead<00:01:56.119> and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
gonna be weight so we'll go ahead and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.700 
gonna be weight so we'll go ahead and
throw<00:01:56.299> the<00:01:56.420> 40<00:01:56.990> rounder<00:01:57.259> on<00:01:57.409> there

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
throw the 40 rounder on there

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.999 
throw the 40 rounder on there
that<00:01:58.399> one<00:01:58.549> there<00:01:58.729> is<00:01:58.759> fully<00:01:59.270> loaded<00:01:59.509> with<00:02:00.009> 55

them at now if you think about it when
you<00:03:49.310> go<00:03:49.400> ahead<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.640> load<00:03:49.760> these<00:03:49.910> things<00:03:50.150> up

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
you go ahead and load these things up

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.810 
you go ahead and load these things up
once<00:03:50.600> an<00:03:50.810> MDM<00:03:51.230> it's<00:03:51.770> gonna<00:03:52.340> be<00:03:52.550> basically

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
once an MDM it's gonna be basically

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.550 
once an MDM it's gonna be basically
costing<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.420> as<00:03:53.540> much<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.870> mag<00:03:54.050> as<00:03:54.350> the

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
costing you as much of the mag as the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.040 
costing you as much of the mag as the
mag<00:03:54.739> if<00:03:54.950> not<00:03:55.100> more<00:03:55.400> so<00:03:55.670> really<00:03:55.940> long-term<00:03:56.180> in

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
mag if not more so really long-term in

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.960 
mag if not more so really long-term in
my<00:03:57.290> opinion<00:03:57.770> that<00:03:57.890> cost<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.370> kind<00:03:58.580> of<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.730> minor

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
my opinion that cost is kind of a minor

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.580 
my opinion that cost is kind of a minor
issue<00:03:59.209> they're<00:03:59.570> still<00:03:59.810> very<00:04:00.080> reasonably

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
issue they're still very reasonably

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.830 
issue they're still very reasonably
priced<00:04:01.000> Magpul<00:04:02.000> probably<00:04:02.360> could<00:04:02.480> release

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
priced Magpul probably could release

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.990 
priced Magpul probably could release
these<00:04:03.050> at<00:04:03.320> $30<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.100> up<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.370> people<00:04:04.400> still

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
these at $30 and up and people still

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.190 
these at $30 and up and people still
would<00:04:05.180> have<00:04:05.299> bought<00:04:05.450> them<00:04:05.630> all<00:04:05.690> out<00:04:05.870> so

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
would have bought them all out so

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.680 
would have bought them all out so
definitely<00:04:06.980> reasonably<00:04:07.459> priced<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
definitely reasonably priced the

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.970 
definitely reasonably priced the
advantage<00:04:09.140> of<00:04:09.290> them<00:04:09.380> that<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.500> didn't<00:04:09.680> mention

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
advantage of them that I didn't mention

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.979 
advantage of them that I didn't mention
but<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.519> can<00:04:10.670> see<00:04:10.850> right<00:04:11.030> here<00:04:11.060> is<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.870> they

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
but you can see right here is that they

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.610 
but you can see right here is that they
do<00:04:12.049> work<00:04:12.709> with<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.040> mag<00:04:13.250> link<00:04:13.489> so<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.620> can't
