I'll<00:00:15.209> be<00:00:15.389> demonstrating<00:00:15.570> how<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.320> cable<00:00:17.070> with

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
I'll be demonstrating how to cable with

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240 
I'll be demonstrating how to cable with
cable<00:00:18.330> needle<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.349> example<00:00:19.769> I<00:00:20.010> will<00:00:20.070> be

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
cable needle for this example I will be

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.429 
cable needle for this example I will be
doing<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.760> four<00:00:21.150> stitch<00:00:21.480> cable<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.230> I

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
doing a four stitch cable and I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.140 
doing a four stitch cable and I
generally<00:00:22.919> don't<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.550> use<00:00:23.970> this

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
generally don't like to use this

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.929 
generally don't like to use this
technique<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.869> cables<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.680> use<00:00:26.489> more<00:00:26.789> than

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
technique with cables that use more than

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.390 
technique with cables that use more than
four<00:00:27.150> stitches<00:00:27.419> because<00:00:27.770> the<00:00:28.770> cables<00:00:29.130> can<00:00:29.250> get

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
four stitches because the cables can get

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.970 
four stitches because the cables can get
very<00:00:29.730> tight<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.419> a<00:00:30.480> bigger<00:00:31.349> risk<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.800> losing

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
very tight and a bigger risk of losing

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.850 
very tight and a bigger risk of losing
your<00:00:32.189> stitches<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> first<00:00:34.379> of<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.680> going

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
to go ahead and knit two stitches just

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.189 
to go ahead and knit two stitches just
to<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.640> myself<00:00:38.790> away<00:00:39.269> from<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.629> edge<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
to get myself away from the edge and

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.430 
to get myself away from the edge and
able<00:00:40.769> to<00:00:40.800> make<00:00:41.220> this<00:00:41.400> cable<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.960> here

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
able to make this cable for you so here

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.079 
able to make this cable for you so here
I<00:00:43.650> have<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.949> four<00:00:44.339> stitches<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:44.940> going

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
I have my four stitches that are going

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.990 
I have my four stitches that are going
to<00:00:45.269> be<00:00:45.480> making<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.739> cable<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.879> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to be making up the cable and if you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.020 
to be making up the cable and if you
remember<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.540> cable<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.369> formed<00:00:50.369> when<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.790> take

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
remember a cable is formed when you take

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.850 
remember a cable is formed when you take
groups<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.570> stitches<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> knit<00:00:52.409> them<00:00:52.650> out

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
groups of stitches and you knit them out

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.130 
groups of stitches and you knit them out
of<00:00:53.250> order<00:00:53.519> so<00:00:54.150> the<00:00:54.299> first<00:00:54.540> one<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.900> going

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
of order so the first one that I'm going

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.799 
of order so the first one that I'm going
to<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.470> doing<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.460> cable<00:00:57.150> where<00:00:57.360> these

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
to be doing is a cable where these

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.740 
to be doing is a cable where these
stitches<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.500> held<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.549> the<00:00:59.580> front<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.299> that

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
stitches are held to the front and that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.689 
stitches are held to the front and that
results<00:01:01.290> in<00:01:01.409> a<00:01:01.500> left-leaning<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.369> left

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
results in a left-leaning or a left

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.840 
results in a left-leaning or a left
cross<00:01:03.030> cable<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.379> start<00:01:04.799> by<00:01:04.860> slipping<00:01:05.519> two

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
cross cable so we start by slipping two

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.870 
cross cable so we start by slipping two
stitches<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> our<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.900> hand<00:01:07.110> needle<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
stitches to our right hand needle and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.160 
stitches to our right hand needle and
then<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.630> ahead<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
then we're just going to go ahead and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.160 
then we're just going to go ahead and
knit<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> next<00:01:10.890> two<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:14.869> then<00:01:15.869> I'm<00:01:15.990> going<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
knit the next two and then I'm going to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.320 
knit the next two and then I'm going to
take<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.590> left<00:01:16.979> hand<00:01:17.280> needle<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:18.270> going

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
take my left hand needle and I'm going

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
take my left hand needle and I'm going
to<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> front<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.950> those<00:01:20.040> two

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to go into the front of those two

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.630 
to go into the front of those two
stitches<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.720> slipped<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.249> my<00:01:23.369> left

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
stitches that I slipped so that my left

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450 
stitches that I slipped so that my left
needle<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.179> in<00:01:24.329> there<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:24.890> then<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
needle is in there and then I'm going to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
needle is in there and then I'm going to
take<00:01:26.939> my<00:01:27.359> right<00:01:27.600> hand<00:01:27.869> needle<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:28.439> I'm<00:01:28.649> going

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
take my right hand needle and I'm going

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.989 
take my right hand needle and I'm going
to<00:01:29.149> carefully<00:01:30.149> pull<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.749> out<00:01:31.100> from<00:01:32.100> those<00:01:32.549> two

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
to carefully pull it out from those two

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.789 
to carefully pull it out from those two
stitches<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.810> knit<00:01:34.280> freeing<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.609> and<00:01:36.799> go

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
stitches I just knit freeing it and go

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.770 
stitches I just knit freeing it and go
ahead<00:01:38.069> and<00:01:38.280> reinsert<00:01:38.939> them<00:01:39.149> into<00:01:39.630> those

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
stitches so you can see that I switch

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.289 
stitches so you can see that I switch
the<00:01:42.840> order<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.679> stitches<00:01:44.069> now<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.789> will
