it<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.939> interesting<00:02:06.979> but<00:02:07.979> at<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> moment

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it will be interesting but at the moment

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.850 
it will be interesting but at the moment
I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.569> need<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.050> take<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.410> startup

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I think we we need to take the startup

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.250 
I think we we need to take the startup
from<00:02:11.039> Monte<00:02:11.310> Carlo<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:12.239> lend<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.690> car<00:02:12.900> for

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
from Monte Carlo or lend the car for

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.809 
from Monte Carlo or lend the car for
Landa<00:02:13.739> teaming<00:02:14.569> is<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.349> not<00:02:16.500> very

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
Landa teaming is that it's not very

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.000 
Landa teaming is that it's not very
important<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.880> already<00:02:18.750> show<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.560> speed<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
important to already show the speed the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.610 
important to already show the speed the
challenges<00:02:23.549> are<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:24.060> Monte<00:02:24.420> Carlo<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.900> find

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
challenges are in Monte Carlo to find

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.940 
challenges are in Monte Carlo to find

good tire choice because you can have in

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.130 
good tire choice because you can have in

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
a few stages many different conditions

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.770 
a few stages many different conditions
