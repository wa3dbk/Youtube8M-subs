00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.260 
certainly do that I think that they lead
the<00:01:37.689> way<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.259> that<00:01:38.320> front<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:38.950> if<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.149> give

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
the way on that front so if you can give

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.910 
the way on that front so if you can give
you<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> little<00:01:40.600> edge<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.780> performance<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.590> I

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
you a little edge in performance and I

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.050 
you a little edge in performance and I
think<00:01:41.950> nowadays<00:01:42.310> there<00:01:42.729> is<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:42.820> lot<00:01:42.880> of

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
think nowadays there is a lot of

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.670 
think nowadays there is a lot of
competition<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.659> then<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:43.869> s<00:01:43.990> always<00:01:44.320> pushing

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
competition and then of s always pushing

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.069 
competition and then of s always pushing
the<00:01:44.860> barriers<00:01:45.579> making<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.210> they<00:01:46.810> look<00:01:46.990> way

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
the barriers making it they look way

00:01:47.079 --> 00:02:02.870

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
league for and if we did it because the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.530 
league for and if we did it because the
the<00:03:04.020> club<00:03:04.290> structuralism<00:03:05.040> she<00:03:06.000> don't<00:03:06.210> give<00:03:06.420> up

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the club structuralism she don't give up

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.990 
the club structuralism she don't give up
when<00:03:06.959> he<00:03:07.080> played<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.380> calendar<00:03:08.040> final<00:03:08.490> ten

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
when he played the calendar final ten

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.230 
when he played the calendar final ten
minutes<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.480> go<00:03:09.660> we<00:03:09.900> kept<00:03:10.350> fighting<00:03:10.800> against

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
minutes to go we kept fighting against

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.610 
minutes to go we kept fighting against
Liverpool<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.050> end<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.350> know<00:03:13.470> we

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
Liverpool and in the end you know we

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.960 
Liverpool and in the end you know we
equalize<00:03:13.980> we<00:03:14.190> won<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.430> game<00:03:14.580> during<00:03:14.820> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
equalize we won the game during the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.360 
equalize we won the game during the
extra<00:03:15.360> time<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.470> think<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.800> shows<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
extra time and and I think it shows the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.370 
extra time and and I think it shows the
spirit<00:03:17.640> of<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.300> whole<00:03:18.450> club<00:03:18.720> because<00:03:19.020> ever

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
spirit of the whole club because ever

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.260 
spirit of the whole club because ever
since<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.950> been<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:20.489> been<00:03:20.550> like<00:03:20.850> that

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
since it's been it's been like that

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.949 
since it's been it's been like that
so<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.470> think<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:24.000> motto<00:03:24.570> which

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
so I think this is this is a motto which

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.460 
so I think this is this is a motto which
really<00:03:25.410> suits<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.520> club<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.540> we<00:03:27.660> have<00:03:27.780> very

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
really suits the club and we have very

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.640 
really suits the club and we have very
great<00:03:29.310> record<00:03:29.580> on<00:03:29.989> which<00:03:30.989> also<00:03:31.170> shows<00:03:31.500> a

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
great record on which also shows a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.350 
great record on which also shows a
massive<00:03:31.800> fans<00:03:32.130> always<00:03:32.340> behind<00:03:32.670> us<00:03:32.910> they<00:03:33.209> never

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
everyone around the club for that the

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.270 
everyone around the club for that the
fans<00:03:47.760> players<00:03:48.690> everyone<00:03:49.050> we<00:03:49.500> need<00:03:49.620> defense<00:03:50.010> or

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
fans players everyone we need defense or

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.340 
fans players everyone we need defense or
every<00:03:50.640> club<00:03:50.880> need<00:03:51.060> offense<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.600> especially

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
every club need offense and especially

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.040 
every club need offense and especially
in<00:03:52.709> England<00:03:53.070> I<00:03:53.160> think<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:53.780> they<00:03:54.780> are<00:03:54.870> very

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
in England I think it's they are very

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.170 
in England I think it's they are very
important

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
important

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.240 
important
the<00:03:57.299> influence<00:03:58.140> to<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.469> game<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.859> very<00:03:58.920> high

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
the influence to the game is very high

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.589 
the influence to the game is very high
from<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.640> fence<00:03:59.879> because<00:04:00.329> they're<00:04:00.450> very

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
from the fence because they're very

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.349 
from the fence because they're very
close<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.379> page<00:04:01.590> they're<00:04:02.579> very<00:04:02.760> loud<00:04:03.000> and

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
close to the page they're very loud and

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.869 
close to the page they're very loud and
so<00:04:04.349> it's<00:04:04.620> typically<00:04:05.099> for<00:04:05.310> England<00:04:05.609> and

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
so it's typically for England and

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.270 
so it's typically for England and
especially<00:04:06.239> for<00:04:06.689> Chelsea<00:04:07.109> yeah<00:04:07.409> everything

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
especially for Chelsea yeah everything

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.339 
especially for Chelsea yeah everything
you<00:04:08.370> need<00:04:08.549> them<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.969> keep<00:04:09.359> going<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.810> through

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
you need them to keep going to through

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.410 
you need them to keep going to through
