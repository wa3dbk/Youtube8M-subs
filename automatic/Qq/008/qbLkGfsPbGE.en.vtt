turn<00:02:25.360> into<00:02:25.690> glass<00:02:26.190> into<00:02:27.190> about<00:02:27.370> five<00:02:27.640> sub

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
turn into glass into about five sub

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.670 
turn into glass into about five sub
things<00:02:28.209> yes<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.840> could<00:02:28.959> see<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.230> freezing
