00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.870
 Hello, we are back to our blog today. 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.880
 people are going to make you a picanha 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.740
 oven in the thick salt 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.750
 here I already have some piece of 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.450
 approximately one pound and three hundred 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.310
 salt kebab thick here I have three 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.260
 pounds but the sun will depend on the size 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.750
 of its platter the size of its 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.020
 picanha because the main thing is that 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.000
 and stay 100% submerged in salt here one 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.369
 tip for you 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.290
 in the picanha here the bottom and are 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.420
 Seeing that it has a few pieces of fat. 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.700
 that little is interesting that 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.800
 have the picanha be 100% clean 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.079
 because at the time of cooking when this 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.220
 screen height way up to the meat 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.270
 Wet is so beginning on the platter. 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.920
 We're going to have to do a 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.469
 family that just to put the campaign 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.559
 Top car so at least people 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.989
 will put the son made a call 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.140
 reasonably thick for the 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.260
 lean against the crossbar and do not burn 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.369
 so I've already made my salt form 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.979
 with the fat up and now 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.830
 We're going to cover saulo's money. 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.590
 will not stay a bit of that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.720
 to win out just looks a little was 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.360
 100% roberta does not have any small pieces 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.950
 From her outside I used almost three pounds 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.500
 of salt because of the size of my 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.660
 through will still depend on each 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.080
 now we are going to take the oven in 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.390
 temperature between 180 and 220 we are going 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.210
 now make a cookie from our picanha 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.160
 It's very easy to do. It was very tasty. 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.260
 so here is the frying pan line and now 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.050
 I put in four spoons of 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.250
 olive oil soup and 4 tablespoons of 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.620
 butter 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.920
 here I have two cloves of garlic 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.810
 chopped and chopped onion 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.690
 the first thing we'll take here 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.750
 to fire his way and we will go 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.030
 brown the onion and garlic leek already 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.869
 melted the butter with a 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.290
 onion and garlic and we will try to use 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.530
 one gilt and the sauce ready hard 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.530
 like this 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.780
 look at this onion and our area 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.880
 stayed here one of five to ten 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.600
 minutinhos're just so it really 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.120
 cook and catch one're already corzinha 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.100
 ok let's hang up and we'll go 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.970
 Throw this sauce over our picanha 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.459
 that already cut back wins here with a 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.440
 hour and forty in the oven temperatures 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.780
 between 80 and 220 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.550
 now we are going to take this layer of 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:44.670
 salt was to get the win in India 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.670
 asking the lawyer does not stay 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.960
 we take our picanha through now 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.280
 We'll slice it super softly well. 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:58.030
 Wet now let's get it going I'm going 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.030
 show her how she stays for me 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.030
 also 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.810
 it is practically well past only one 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.120
 little better for those who enjoy car and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.800
 more will pass by always leaving those who 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.320
 likes to speak very well behaved 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.210
 let's stay for at least two hours 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.580
 But this point here, she's fine. 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.270
 And that's the secret of this 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.740
 our peck is now already cut 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:30.920
 people come with that cookie that we 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:33.370
 prepared with bulbs onions and plays 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.370
 over 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.560
 [Music] 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.960
 and this is our shame in the oven 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.300
 with coarse salt is a delight 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.190
 I hope you liked it and we 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.300
 back at a next opportunity with more 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.520
 a video for you 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:55.629
 that new year 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.629
