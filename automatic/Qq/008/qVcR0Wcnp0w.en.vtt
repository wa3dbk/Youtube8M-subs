00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
colors as well you have your simple redo

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.390 
colors as well you have your simple redo
and<00:04:09.489> undo<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:11.019> have<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.170> few<00:04:11.530> settings<00:04:12.010> here

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
and undo you have a few settings here

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.360 
and undo you have a few settings here
basically<00:04:12.970> your<00:04:13.450> paper<00:04:13.720> type<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.410> then<00:04:15.100> if

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
basically your paper type and then if

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.460 
basically your paper type and then if
you<00:04:15.549> get<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.820> plus<00:04:16.209> again<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:17.109> gives<00:04:17.290> you<00:04:17.380> an

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
you get the plus again it gives you an

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.949 
you get the plus again it gives you an
option<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.799> create<00:04:17.950> additional<00:04:18.820> pages<00:04:19.150> with

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
option to create additional pages with

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.219 
option to create additional pages with
paper<00:04:20.260> iTunes<00:04:21.250> photos<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.180> Dropbox<00:04:22.900> and

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
paper iTunes photos and Dropbox and

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.770 
paper iTunes photos and Dropbox and
finally<00:04:24.010> this<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.370> just<00:04:24.550> your<00:04:24.880> tool<00:04:25.120> control

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
finally this is just your tool control

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.290 
finally this is just your tool control
if<00:04:26.349> you<00:04:26.440> tap<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:26.740> you<00:04:27.010> lose<00:04:27.490> your<00:04:27.729> tools<00:04:27.970> you

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
if you tap that you lose your tools you

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.010 
if you tap that you lose your tools you
come<00:04:28.539> back<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.960> gain<00:04:29.200> your<00:04:29.380> tool

come back you gain your tool

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.290 
come back you gain your tool
so<00:04:30.500> we<00:04:30.620> already<00:04:31.010> demonstrated<00:04:31.850> how<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.000> just

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
so we already demonstrated how to just

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.110 
so we already demonstrated how to just
write<00:04:32.540> a<00:04:32.570> quick<00:04:33.050> note<00:04:33.350> right<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.460> screen

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
write a quick note right on the screen

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.480 
write a quick note right on the screen
but<00:04:35.720> again<00:04:36.080> that<00:04:36.260> takes<00:04:36.560> up<00:04:36.800> pretty<00:04:37.010> much<00:04:37.130> the

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
but again that takes up pretty much the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.360 
but again that takes up pretty much the
entire<00:04:37.820> screen<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:39.320> what<00:04:39.500> we<00:04:39.620> really<00:04:40.070> want<00:04:40.280> to

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
entire screen so what we really want to

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.020 
entire screen so what we really want to
do<00:04:40.580> is<00:04:40.880> we<00:04:41.750> want<00:04:42.020> some<00:04:42.230> fine<00:04:42.620> control<00:04:43.340> here<00:04:43.880> so

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
do is we want some fine control here so

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.480 
do is we want some fine control here so
we'll<00:04:44.900> tap<00:04:45.170> our<00:04:45.380> pen<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:45.980> we're<00:04:46.130> gonna<00:04:46.220> go

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
we'll tap our pen and we're gonna go

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.510 
we'll tap our pen and we're gonna go
down<00:04:46.700> here<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.300> wrist<00:04:47.600> guard<00:04:47.960> slash<00:04:48.520> pen

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
down here to the wrist guard slash pen

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.690 
down here to the wrist guard slash pen
control<00:04:50.210> area<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:51.260> if<00:04:51.320> we<00:04:51.440> drag<00:04:51.830> that<00:04:52.100> up<00:04:52.160> you

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
control area so if we drag that up you

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.140 
control area so if we drag that up you
see<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.510> get<00:04:53.780> this<00:04:54.220> location<00:04:55.220> now<00:04:55.520> where<00:04:55.820> you

have this blue box and that controls
where<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.490> write<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.720> if<00:04:59.930> we're<00:05:00.080> on<00:05:00.110> our<00:05:00.410> pen

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
where you write so if we're on our pen

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.860 
where you write so if we're on our pen
tool<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.340> we<00:05:01.550> start<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.060> write<00:05:02.330> here<00:05:04.690> you<00:05:05.690> can

see how easy it is to fill in just a

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.410 
see how easy it is to fill in just a
particular<00:05:09.110> line<00:05:09.680> now<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.460> can<00:05:10.700> also<00:05:10.910> move

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
particular line now you can also move

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.040 
particular line now you can also move
this<00:05:11.720> box<00:05:12.080> by<00:05:12.410> just<00:05:12.650> simply<00:05:12.950> tapping<00:05:13.370> and<00:05:13.730> hold

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
dragging up to the corner and now you

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.690 
dragging up to the corner and now you
could<00:05:16.820> say<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.360> number<00:05:17.630> one<00:05:18.050> item<00:05:18.350> now<00:05:19.190> if<00:05:19.460> you

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
could say the number one item now if you

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.490 
could say the number one item now if you
notice<00:05:20.000> we<00:05:20.150> lost<00:05:20.390> our<00:05:20.600> wrist<00:05:20.870> guard<00:05:21.140> so<00:05:21.320> let's
