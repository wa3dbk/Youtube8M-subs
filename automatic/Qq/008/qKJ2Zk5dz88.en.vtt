00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.130
 sandra welcome 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.770
 my brother in class 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.340
 we want to know how it went with the line 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.340
 so 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.630
 I look more than children for that is called 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.039
 the effect of tightening the skin but what 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.050
 in that sense as the skin goes firm 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.179
 the essence like right now I ate them and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.070
 the next day after he touched me 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.480
 palpated the skin already felt as firmer 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.079
 not so flaccid because he feels that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.980
 the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.980
 neither there is no 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.309
 the list was more than everything I felt 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.929
 I am very generous because I suffer from 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.629
 if it's not useful up I do not have a good 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.850
 I dream and I always drive very emaciated with 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.199
 the logics then felt that fighting it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.199
 I understood myself is by even 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.110
 and I supported it with the eye contour and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.159
 what if he felt that dawned as 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.560
 if you had a dream 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.840
 prepared with a luminosity with the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.090
 uniform skin color were like 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.240
 the two main results of 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:30.750
 housing print change 26 years no 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:32.280
 there is not the expression because everything 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 they are spots 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.720
 this skin tired but not yet 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.899
 I feel an area like many lines 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.000
 then for a skin like the way I 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.690
 I think the most important thing was the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.970
 firmness and uniformity both in the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.470
 texture as in the body that is 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.590
 you had these spots change is that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.090
 they decreased them 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.200
 a drop 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:03.040
 I'm doing I wanted her to handle 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:09.450
 and we are going to compare in what way acting 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:12.450
 that hydrating immediately from 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.450
 function 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:22.290
 here 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:25.709
 how good is 0 hydration and like here 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.220
 will increase 97 hydration only 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.440
 hard 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.840
 so my recommendation is that I 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.840
 have to give anything support 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.640
 twice a week at night without 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.930
 apply the other products only 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.930
 so that you 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.150
 one week
