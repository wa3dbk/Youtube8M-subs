video I'm going to talk to you about the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.680 
video I'm going to talk to you about the
difference<00:00:06.930> between<00:00:07.140> art<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.040> design<00:00:08.760> if

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
between art and graphic design a lot of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.599 
between art and graphic design a lot of
people<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.779> confused<00:00:25.560> about<00:00:25.710> art<00:00:26.160> versus

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
people are confused about art versus

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.179 
people are confused about art versus
design<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.240> general<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.650> specifically

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
design in general but I'm specifically

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.790 
design in general but I'm specifically
going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> most<00:00:30.029> part<00:00:30.720> talk<00:00:31.500> about

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
going to for the most part talk about

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.799 
going to for the most part talk about
graphic<00:00:32.460> design<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.660> this

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
graphic design when I have this

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
graphic design when I have this
conversation<00:00:34.399> for<00:00:35.399> me<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.700> primary

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
conversation for me the primary

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.720 
conversation for me the primary
differences<00:00:36.719> between<00:00:36.899> art<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.620> design<00:00:38.070> are

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
differences between art and design are

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.600 
differences between art and design are
the<00:00:38.790> fact<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.480> art<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.110> expressive<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.219> art

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the fact that art is expressive and art

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
the fact that art is expressive and art
is<00:00:41.790> usually<00:00:42.420> about<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> artist<00:00:44.129> wants

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
is usually about what the artist wants

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.540 
is usually about what the artist wants
whereas<00:00:45.059> design<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.750> about<00:00:46.110> intent<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> what

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
whereas design is about intent and what

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.139 
whereas design is about intent and what
the<00:00:47.789> audience<00:00:48.480> wants<00:00:48.840> design<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.010> about

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
the audience wants design is about

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.970 
the audience wants design is about
communication<00:00:51.149> art<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.870> about<00:00:52.079> expression

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
communication art is about expression

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.639 
communication art is about expression
now<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.120> part<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:55.350> gets<00:00:55.530> confusing

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
now this is part of what gets confusing

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.500 
now this is part of what gets confusing
for<00:00:56.160> some<00:00:56.280> people<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
for some people because a lot of the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.740 
for some people because a lot of the
principles<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.350> art<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.859> design<00:00:59.460> are<00:00:59.969> similar

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
principles in art and design are similar

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.080 
principles in art and design are similar
as<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> lot<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> techniques<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
as well as a lot of the techniques but I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.390 
as well as a lot of the techniques but I
think<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.690> ultimately<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.619> defining<00:01:04.979> line

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
think that ultimately the defining line

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.490 
think that ultimately the defining line
between<00:01:05.640> art<00:01:06.030> InDesign<00:01:06.330> does<00:01:06.810> come<00:01:07.080> back<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
between art InDesign does come back to I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800 
between art InDesign does come back to I
said<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.280> motivations<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.299> each<00:01:09.479> one

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
said about the motivations for each one

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
said about the motivations for each one
if<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:10.740> doing<00:01:10.979> something<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.369> an<00:01:11.490> artist

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
if you're doing something as an artist

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.120 
if you're doing something as an artist
then<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.689> may<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.869> purely<00:01:13.290> doing<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.860> for

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
then you may be purely doing that for

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.370 
then you may be purely doing that for
yourself<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.450> you're<00:01:15.810> doing<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.350> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
yourself or if you're doing it as a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.320 
yourself or if you're doing it as a
commission<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> client<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:18.000> still

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
commission for the client that's still

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.300 
commission for the client that's still
fine<00:01:18.540> too<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.409> expressing<00:01:20.159> or

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
fine too because you're expressing or

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
fine too because you're expressing or
you're<00:01:20.430> doing<00:01:20.700> whatever<00:01:20.880> they<00:01:21.180> want<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you're doing whatever they want but you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.010 
you're doing whatever they want but you
know<00:01:22.770> there's<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.220> necessarily<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:24.090> overall

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
know there's not necessarily a overall

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.350 
know there's not necessarily a overall
intent<00:01:25.590> behind<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.100> terms<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> message<00:01:27.090> or

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
intent behind in terms of a message or

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
intent behind in terms of a message or
something<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.840> needs<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.080> communicated

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
something that needs to be communicated

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.429 
something that needs to be communicated
beyond<00:01:29.520> things<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.570> subjective<00:01:31.229> or

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
beyond things of a subjective or

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.520 
beyond things of a subjective or
emotional<00:01:32.189> context<00:01:32.790> design<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.840> subjective

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
emotional context design is subjective

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.340 
emotional context design is subjective
but<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.400> less<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.150> because<00:01:36.390> design<00:01:37.020> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
but it's much less so because design is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.749 
but it's much less so because design is
supposed<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.740> communicate<00:01:37.979> something

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
supposed to communicate something

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
supposed to communicate something
specific<00:01:39.509> even<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.439> thing<00:01:40.680> that

broad billboards are probably one of the

best examples of this when you see a
