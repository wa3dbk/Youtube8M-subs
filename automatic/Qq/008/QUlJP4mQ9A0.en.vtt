 And then, it's okay that the speaker is the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.859
 edu and in today's video I wanted to show 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.900
 for you a little bit of my house 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.059
 here in Canada I know that many have 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.299
 curiosity to see what a house looks like 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.340
 Canadian and not only have you seen the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.109
 my house in other videos so I do not 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.310
 I have problems, I'll show you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.960
 how is she 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.300
 we are seeing here behind me is the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.369
 entrance of the house at the entrance of the house should 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.769
 to see you there on the floor you have 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.929
 some sneakers and things like that have a 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.000
 a little different floor this is because 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.610
 Here in Canada we have the custom of 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 not walk indoors with a sneaker or 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.920
 com is any footwear that we use 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.110
 on the street so you do not dirty the dirt floor 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.780
 mainly in the winter because 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.480
 It's not enough and you do not want to bring snow. 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.480
 from the street into the house what 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.219
 You see here then is the home room has 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.129
 My battery back there I have only 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.050
 The rest of us do not have a sofa at home. 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.149
 It's very small and I have not had it yet. 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.160
 time and financial resources to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.220
 buy a sofa but has a battery 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.080
 electronics there the camera tripod should give 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.330
 people also see zinho property there 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.350
 lighting is all connected to power 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.600
 to film better 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.340
 I have a tv here along with the tv I 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.619
 I have a Blu-ray player that I like 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.040
 a lot of watching both movies and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.650
 also serials with the sapeca and ali 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.509
 underneath you if you see I have mine 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.369
 play 2 that I put in the room to 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.860
 to play and have fun then we 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.530
 Here is a simple and neighboring property 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 also the back of the feet, right? 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.000
 The game does not stay here so let's see 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.100
 He's kind of messy, do not fix it. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.040
 right and after I got back to the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.500
 or rendering a video on the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.720
 moment is here my laptop that he 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.880
 monitors a good secondary monitor to have 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.409
 two monitors to edit videos 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 I think you know the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.159
 most of the things that should already have 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.829
 seen maybe something or other is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.340
 new the dreamcast down there is thing 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.049
 I brought a new one from Brazil, but I did not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.990
 There are great news, and I do not have it here. 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.229
 it was even pec that you can see me 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.039
 So I finally won that someone. 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.780
 None here I will not show you 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.180
 but here 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.090
 My double room need not see 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.050
 because I think it would be very invasive of 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.340
 privacy 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.200
 and here we are entering the bathroom 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.440
 you must ask yourself what is 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.670
 showing the bathroom of your house is 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 because the bathrooms are 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.940
 different from my sink for example is 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.220
 super low I do not know why it 's us 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.920
 here is the bathtub normally 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.100
 can not use this type of tub 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.780
 if you use the normal boxing shower, people 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.850
 have to put this towel here 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.900
 all right if you put your towel 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.820
 out 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.440
 You'll look at everything when you look. 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.930
 out because the water hits here in the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.209
 towel and fall out so the tip is 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.319
 You have to always let it in. It's okay. 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.480
 common is to be from the shower so 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.569
 with bathtub here in canada left 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.380
 go back to the camera and we'll go to 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.500
 here 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.660
 here is the control of the capture of the house 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.060
 Canadian fighters all have elevation is 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.080
 It's very cold here if I open it and let's go 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.390
 see but I will not open it gives much 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.570
 work let's see here we are from 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.060
 back in the room and I'll show it now 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.220
 For you, the kitchen will rain everything. 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.040
 right here so this is the kitchen of 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.470
 house is I very much like coffee I 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.560
 I have this coffee machine to make 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.440
 Express is very cool and went well 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.090
 cheap that in Canada was $ 150 at 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.420
 Brazil would cost a fortune 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.810
 things here are very cheap is the stove 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.000
 Let me show you guys, you come here. 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.930
 stove here is in the North American style 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.840
 it is not a stove is to fire like the electric 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.239
 and the oven down here, right down to the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.950
 Here we go, I'm fine. 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.560
 showing curiosities here is very common 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.410
 the blenders are non-glass 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.450
 Plastic is the standard love that more I 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.720
 Can I show you different here? 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.630
 here we have the laundry 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.390
 house plus the washing machine 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.530
 also has a tumble dryer because 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.540
 here in Canada 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.700
 It's too cold, you will not be able to 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.470
 put a bar outside the house 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.630
 so you have to have 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.880
 It's now customary in Canada when you 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.790
 purchase or rent a house I already saw with 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.370
 dryer and washing machine 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.450
 It is their standard even when you buy 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.640
 This house here and I rent and I do not know 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.590
 I really like what's different. 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.320
 here in Canada are also the cracks 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.960
 just look at that door that opens here 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.550
 underneath and lock up here but not 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.310
 only this from the outside did we see 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.260
 here ok same thing tank on top and 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.570
 c key was on the contrary you do not put the 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.480
 key the way we put it in brazil 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.400
 It's ethical to head up here. 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.460
 head job is different is a custom 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.200
 I've already shown one of the backyard 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.890
 video for you guys I'll show you again 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.020
 there is a lot of snow here fast but 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.500
 she is melting and that little 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.470
 bear in the bottom one I do not use her but she 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.720
 There the trees are all without leaves. 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.930
 because we are in the winter after 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.060
 they will earn greenbacks and leaves turn 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.020
 Then in fall next fall they will 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.660
 stay orange and yellow and 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.890
 leaves fall all close there beauty 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:37.650
 I locked right on our bikes here 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.560
 and just look at the water heater this here 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.510
 winner of the house water, that 's the 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.220
 my house that they may have 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.080
 Today's video again quite a lot 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.390
 I intend to continue bringing 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.760
 many videos here for the second channel 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:53.220
 keep following and you like it 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.780
 this video here please leave a 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.780
 I liked a favorite to help me. 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.720
 with the evaluation and dissemination of the 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.460
 video and channel comment on what you 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.090
 they found the house what is different what 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.040
 It's not something you do not have that 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.530
 house that has no heart but most 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.510
 of Canadian homes have the reason for 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.640
 What this house is not, it's because 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.350
 right underneath it already has a rock 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.800
 the reason why Canadian homes 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.260
 in general, it is due to the fact that 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.419
 temperature and snow is being made 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.729
 a very deep excavation to 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:29.039
 make the foundation of the house with you already 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:32.010
 dig a hole to make the foundation 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.729
 so it's best to already use that area 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.360
 between people 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:38.849
 Do the basements go sane of course 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.610
 custom but makes sense has a reason 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:44.129
 by which there is this clear custom that 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.129
 also has the issue of protection here 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:49.370
 jaílton has no hurricane thing of the type already 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:52.800
 had in the past but is very rare but 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.830
 many places have occurred due to the 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.749
 Security, finally I'll be by 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.580
 here thank you very much for the attention of 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:03.169
 everybody and that's it folks 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.169
 thanks bye
