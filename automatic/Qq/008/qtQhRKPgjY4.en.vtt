00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
today I'm going to show you the methods

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.320 
today I'm going to show you the methods
I<00:00:16.260> use<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.890> cleaning<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.670> Watchers<00:00:18.090> once

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
I use for cleaning the Watchers once

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.790 
I use for cleaning the Watchers once
I've<00:00:18.540> stripped<00:00:19.170> them<00:00:19.349> down<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:21.810> products

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I've stripped them down and the products

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.749 
I've stripped them down and the products
that<00:00:22.950> are<00:00:23.070> used<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.820> clean<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> parts<00:00:25.759> make

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
that are used to clean the parts make

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.359 
that are used to clean the parts make
sure<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.119> wear<00:00:27.329> rubber<00:00:27.660> gloves<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.369> wear

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
sure you wear rubber gloves and wear

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.940 
sure you wear rubber gloves and wear
appropriate<00:00:29.610> protection<00:00:30.450> for<00:00:30.630> your<00:00:30.720> eyes<00:00:30.950> it

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
appropriate protection for your eyes it

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.040 
appropriate protection for your eyes it
should<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.730> noted<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:33.510> products

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
should also be noted that these products

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.170 
should also be noted that these products
can<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.559> flammable<00:00:37.100> now<00:00:38.100> once<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.610> watch<00:00:38.969> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
can be flammable now once the watch is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.049 
can be flammable now once the watch is
stripped<00:00:39.510> down<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:40.070> place<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> parts<00:00:41.879> in

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
stripped down I place all the parts in

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.099 
stripped down I place all the parts in
these<00:00:42.539> baskets

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.049 

naturally<00:00:46.109> this<00:00:46.289> allows<00:00:46.649> me<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.190> separate<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
naturally this allows me to separate the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.529 
naturally this allows me to separate the
heavy<00:00:48.510> parts<00:00:49.160> from<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.429> light<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.789> sensitive

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
heavy parts from the light and sensitive

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
heavy parts from the light and sensitive
parts<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:54.920> smaller<00:00:55.920> parts<00:00:56.249> do<00:00:56.399> not

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
parts so that the smaller parts do not

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.440 
parts so that the smaller parts do not
get<00:00:56.730> damaged

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.390 

so<00:01:07.049> these<00:01:07.200> baskets<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:08.790> fit<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.390> frame

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
so these baskets they fit into a frame

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.020 
so these baskets they fit into a frame
which<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.610> turn<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.860> placed<00:01:13.860> into<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.460> watch

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
which in turn is placed into the watch

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:32.960 
which in turn is placed into the watch
click<00:01:15.360> onto<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> watch<00:01:15.930> cleaning<00:01:16.439> machine

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.270 

watch<00:01:33.970> cleaning<00:01:34.450> machine<00:01:34.780> holds<00:01:35.350> free

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
watch cleaning machine holds free

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.640 
watch cleaning machine holds free
separate<00:01:36.820> jars<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:39.150> they're<00:01:40.150> filled<00:01:40.420> with

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
separate jars and they're filled with

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.400 
separate jars and they're filled with
first<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.830> watch<00:01:42.100> cleaning<00:01:42.700> fluid<00:01:43.450> which<00:01:44.200> is

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
first a watch cleaning fluid which is

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
first a watch cleaning fluid which is
usually<00:01:45.340> ammonium<00:01:46.060> based<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:47.650> second<00:01:48.040> jar<00:01:48.280> is

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
usually ammonium based the second jar is

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.070 
usually ammonium based the second jar is
a<00:01:48.460> first<00:01:48.910> rinse<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.680> third<00:01:50.920> jar<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:52.080> holds

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
a first rinse and the third jar is holds

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.260 
a first rinse and the third jar is holds
the<00:01:53.200> same<00:01:53.440> fluid<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.130> but<00:01:54.790> it's<00:01:54.910> a<00:01:55.030> further

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
the same fluid and but it's a further

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.359 
the same fluid and but it's a further
rinse<00:01:55.660> I<00:01:57.270> set<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.390> timer<00:01:58.660> for<00:01:58.840> 15<00:01:59.140> minutes<00:01:59.830> for

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
rinse I set the timer for 15 minutes for

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:08.309 
rinse I set the timer for 15 minutes for
each<00:02:00.550> process<00:02:01.330> in<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.690> cycle

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.160 

so<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.799> first<00:02:09.039> jar<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.489> use<00:02:09.849> a<00:02:10.170> cleaning

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
so the first jar I use a cleaning

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.339 
so the first jar I use a cleaning
solution<00:02:11.579> personally<00:02:12.579> I<00:02:12.790> use<00:02:13.329> a<00:02:13.540> solution

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
solution personally I use a solution

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.599 
solution personally I use a solution
made<00:02:14.650> by<00:02:14.859> a<00:02:15.189> company<00:02:15.819> called<00:02:15.909> Quadra<00:02:16.569> lien

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
made by a company called Quadra lien

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.369 
made by a company called Quadra lien
although<00:02:18.609> the<00:02:18.790> cleaning<00:02:19.209> solution<00:02:19.659> from<00:02:19.810> LNR

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
although the cleaning solution from LNR

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:29.160 
although the cleaning solution from LNR
is<00:02:20.560> very<00:02:21.280> good<00:02:21.519> as<00:02:21.670> well<00:02:26.790> after<00:02:27.790> 15<00:02:28.599> minutes<00:02:28.840> I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
is very good as well after 15 minutes I

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.660 
is very good as well after 15 minutes I
spin<00:02:29.590> off<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:31.180> excess<00:02:31.510> fluid<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.519> then<00:02:33.519> it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
spin off the excess fluid and then it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.490 
spin off the excess fluid and then it
goes<00:02:33.849> down<00:02:33.879> into<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.480> second<00:02:34.930> jar<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.439> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
goes down into the second jar for the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.750 
goes down into the second jar for the
first<00:02:35.859> rinse<00:02:36.189> I<00:02:38.069> like<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.189> keep<00:02:39.310> it<00:02:39.459> in<00:02:39.549> there

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
first rinse I like to keep it in there

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.960 
first rinse I like to keep it in there
for<00:02:39.790> 15<00:02:40.329> minutes<00:02:40.659> also<00:02:46.620> as<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.799> can<00:02:47.829> see<00:02:47.970> using

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
for 15 minutes also as you can see using

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.839 
for 15 minutes also as you can see using
the<00:02:49.359> rinsing<00:02:49.989> solution<00:02:50.500> from<00:02:50.650> LNR<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:53.639> get<00:02:54.639> very

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
the rinsing solution from LNR I get very

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:03.010 
the rinsing solution from LNR I get very
good<00:02:55.000> results<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.989> this<00:02:56.230> brand<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.680> solution

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.780 

after<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.040> final<00:03:04.430> rinse<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:06.230> spin<00:03:06.560> off<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:06.980> we

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
after the final rinse we spin off and we

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.960 
after the final rinse we spin off and we
turn<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.300> heater<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.050> machine<00:03:11.080> and

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
turn on the heater in the machine and

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.160 
turn on the heater in the machine and
then<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.090> put<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.360> into<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.750> heating<00:03:15.140> chamber

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
then we put it into the heating chamber

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.870 
then we put it into the heating chamber
and<00:03:15.800> we<00:03:16.490> set<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.820> spin<00:03:18.280> for<00:03:19.280> approximately

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and we set it to spin for approximately

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.760 
and we set it to spin for approximately
another<00:03:20.090> 11<00:03:20.630> minutes<00:03:23.170> this<00:03:24.170> dries<00:03:24.440> all<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
another 11 minutes this dries all the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.450 
another 11 minutes this dries all the
parts<00:03:26.050> once<00:03:27.050> it's<00:03:27.260> done<00:03:27.410> we<00:03:27.860> switch<00:03:28.100> off<00:03:28.280> the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
parts once it's done we switch off the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.740 
parts once it's done we switch off the
heater<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:30.850> remove<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.030> basket<00:03:32.210> from<00:03:32.570> the

machine be careful it's hot you can

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.630 
machine be careful it's hot you can
manually<00:03:40.330> clean<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:42.320> watch<00:03:42.470> parts<00:03:42.950> in<00:03:43.130> some

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
manually clean the watch parts in some

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.980 
manually clean the watch parts in some
heavily<00:03:44.180> diluted<00:03:44.390> horror<00:03:45.050> line<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:46.990> it's

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
heavily diluted horror line and it's
