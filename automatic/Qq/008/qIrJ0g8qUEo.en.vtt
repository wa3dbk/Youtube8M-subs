00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.350
 all at once are already said 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 as Bielefeld wanted to come into play and life was difficult for us 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.650
 The leather was actually made by us 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.199
 was in the program I think that is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.539
 19 thousand 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.529
 400 people 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.869
 Eleven people in the square and we have to learn to handle it 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.119
 this is quite normal when opponents are so deep and their nla-team ours 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.809
 Quality is not so bad but is not used to it this week 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.070
 Week to do so 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.800
 yes there can be a warm Fehlpass times 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.890
 In fact, this can be one or the other 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.790
 Too much for that I have then very shortly Kunt drinks Mellenthin people like that 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.920
 around me we misunderstood clock 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.970
 because I just knew it was going to happen so we have a lot to do with it 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.720
 many unprepared long balls in front played it is called Matthias 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.490
 Walter did not like us so much, but still got three big ones 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.930
 Scoring chances 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.160
 a slim one-half the plan to do something patient so all in all 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.810
 to better prepare these balls to the top 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.160
 Hamm and then us-partner at least suspected that we continue 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.880
 Scoring chances 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.650
 we really have finishers then much more football 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.720
 played Nane Mundt that has just been rewarded by the action 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.020
 which certainly was not really controversial was water penalty 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.580
 After that, everyone saw each other, so I think it was good for everyone today 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.570
 then it has 2 0 then at some point to see the chances were huge and Dawn 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.980
 Susat remained exciting until the end 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.180
 the people are used to it is here in addition to entrance fee with it 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.390
 one that one 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.850
 It does not need to tremble up to 90 Stemmer every week but when the end is so 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.970
 went out well then suits today also Marcus Kuhl I think 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.420
 also that a deserved winner 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.840
 the team has done everything I have done everything right but 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.890
 earned game and won accordingly
