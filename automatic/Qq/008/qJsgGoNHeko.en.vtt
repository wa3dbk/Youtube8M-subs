00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.490
 hola amigos youtube fucking maniac 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.640
 back and good here I bring you a new 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.770
 video a new series of fifa 2011 and 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.700
 well what we are going to do is a way 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.370
 new career 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.529
 to also go changing a little games 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.180
 and everything in the channel because now we are 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.860
 hanging lately many videos of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.340
 minecraft let's do a little fifa 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:27.300
 now come here here let's go make a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.789
 good mode of the player manager 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.009
 and now I will tell you because I do not have 2012 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.370
 OK, I'm going to catch the boat that is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.010
 my favorite professional team five 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 minutes because it is not very long and it 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.190
 all this is already well worth it because it is already 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.010
 fuck the bunny 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.780
 ah ok did not start the session because no 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.660
 I have something with this law that is worth 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.660
 so that's why it's not going to continue 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.900
 good perfect so good while 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.280
 is loading the season I'm going to 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.520
 do a little more or less what happens here 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.520
 with the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.770
 why 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.590
 I bought the beach three months ago or 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.840
 less and already so it takes 12 of time 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.900
 since then I say I buy type to a bait a 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.490
 little like that for fun, well, I 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.220
 I bought for ten euros in the game of 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.370
 second hand I think it was and well the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.110
 truth is that it looks to make a 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.440
 then let's make a way 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.420
 race here 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.299
 but I keep 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.850
 and good with the barÃ§a and when the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.500
 myself 13 they will buy it for sure 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.450
 very safe and another I say no 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.850
 I do not lie when I say one thing 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.070
 I buy and upload a safe career mode 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.000
 also this until he makes us help 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.740
 2013 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.070
 I will continue uploading videos or upload 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.990
 videos of type 11 maybe I do not know it depends 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.490
 of other videos that you have then 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.890
 maybe there was one 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.170
 one or two a week depends because 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.490
 I want to upload a daily video and I'm 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.310
 trying also to see if I can 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.009
 save some video for when it starts 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.819
 I the institute because otherwise I will not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.410
 time between we have jobs and 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.940
 study and everything because I will not have much 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.950
 time therefore I'm trying 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.260
 do there 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.360
 some videos to save me some 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.080
 gameplays the bad thing is that now I can not 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.170
 play car-blue team 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.740
 why why why why only 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.350
 I left a friend more than anything is this 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.680
 and he's going to give it back to me in his day 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.680
 knows 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.130
 I do not know what is imported but good I have 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.670
 a while smoke up sin 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.880
 and well I will bring more time more 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.830
 very safe because I already have 11 I have it 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.550
 that record again has had it and 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.550
 saved and good 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.660
 I'm also going to start a road 90 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.490
 hit 90 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.470
 another of the series that always wants 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.750
 do and I will do it very safely 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.430
 also it brings me raring has never 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.819
 kissed the gold sale penalty not because 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.829
 I could not but because I did not 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.840
 I do not know I've always liked other weapons 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.720
 like the 17 steel 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.670
 with the 9001 app they are always the ones that 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.430
 I normally take the 145 the acr the 97 and 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.550
 the 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.910
 and the app 99 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.319
 and well this is useful we will upload it if 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.359
 someday we settled perfect 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.489
 and good in this is creating the 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.889
 I already tell you, I'm going to go 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.650
 climbing match matches match 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.030
 match is worth in this way career and what 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.889
 more sure it's a season already 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.540
 is because I do not think any means 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:50.500
 time to do more when you leave 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.080
 2012 then I will go to sack 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.480
 2 the 2013 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.450
 and of asarco in 2013 therefore therefore 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.640
 do not 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.660
 I have this at the moment so I will go 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.470
 uploading more videos to go changing 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.680
 a little the channel and good 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.680
 this over here I'm going to change the template 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.410
 I do not know what to do 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.180
 instead the template and I will put the 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.090
 it will be because it will be my players 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.110
 in the mic and this one is going to change it for 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.310
 the villa is worth it and it is already new I take it 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.580
 here because I'm not going to use it for 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.580
 nothing 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:43.640
 I suppose the drink 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:46.250
 if better of us bojan true and 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:51.620
 good Mascherano but I'm going to change 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.729
 abidal or for something or not when I play toco 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.249
 Then come for nothing 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.809
 since it is already because already we have already 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:02.039
 created to seasons but they liked it 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:02.039
 and good bye
