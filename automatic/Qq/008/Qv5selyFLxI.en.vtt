00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:04.179
 m 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.349
 as we saw until about the 87th minute 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.910
 then we take it to each video and 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.300
 well 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:32.029
 Today I bring you for 12 effects 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.649
 to hold San Andres and this weighs 14 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.200
 megas but for people that up 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.649
 and then they say it weighs heavily 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.309
 before 80 but good when ends this 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.430
 file will take us out of these four that 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.400
 first let's copy effects your move 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.570
 I prefer to copy the copies and we 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.110
 we move to android with points 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.760
 trading station fire and do not have the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.579
 model folder they copy it and I say they create it 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.340
 take off 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:13.740
 now we return to the file 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.990
 in my house and well besides that I said te x 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.350
 of what we copy 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.520
 cutie 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.780
 we go to android you try face computation and 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.780
 third country 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.009
 tx must txt and we want it 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.530
 or 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.650
 345 about 340 visited is fine because it's 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.910
 my first if I do it and if I do wrong 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.910
 Well, fuck me, it's gta 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.420
 this would be all knowing how we are going in gta 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.119
 iv I make a small cut and we do not see 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.030
 a second gamer if we have returned and 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.680
 Well, first let's try this 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.630
 exploiting this car let's see how 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.090
 the explosion comes out but hey it's great 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.010
 it looks like a nuclear bomb gives a little 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.100
 more realism this wants in the water 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.590
 and this 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.360
 and I would also like to teach you 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.130
 how the shots look is that I do not have 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.220
 many bullets to bapro enough shotguns 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.250
 although there was a black powder when I gave him 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.040
 but I'm not able to do because 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.570
 call my life until the bullet is measured 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.660
 also the blood change i'm going to kill 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:41.070
 someone is quickly teaching the blood 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.140
 like salt in our flesh to her I'm going to 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.190
 kill her 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.360
 and look at the boots in all effects 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.910
 who brings these 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.290
 they vote is said when he gave his 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.050
 administration but when the blood 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.030
 you change the lights of the cars change 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.890
 to see that the collisions are calmer 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.330
 when he threw karachi house until I 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.060
 changed and gave me a bit of the gp2 and 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.420
 name and lengthened the sun change the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.910
 age also a tone all the moon all 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.790
 and you will see it when they are loaded 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.920
 and put it in your gta but good this 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.180
 It will be everything I hope you liked it 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.680
