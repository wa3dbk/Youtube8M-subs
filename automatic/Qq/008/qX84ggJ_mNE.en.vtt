00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.390
 the speaker is my friend and in this tutorial 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.350
 I'll teach you the drawing effect . 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.129
 pencil 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.530
 many people already know how to do this but done 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.010
 For those who do not know, I'll teach you. 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.329
 how to make this effect and what has 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.239
 a normal photo is in pencil drawing nor 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.059
 it looks as if it were a drawing 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.149
 pencil to make this effect you have 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.059
 you are using in an image that 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.750
 has a good quality, nor is it 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.610
 This one I used to make this 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.549
 It is made 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.960
 if you have a quality image 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.000
 low will not get such an effect. 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.509
 It looks like it's going to roll out 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 But then I'll teach you how to do it. 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.299
 Now I'm here with this image here. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.369
 huh 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.280
 so the first thing I'm going to be 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:37.950
 doing is coming here in picture 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.400
 I died in adjustments and put black here 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.619
 and white black and white right let's 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.119
 leave the image in black and white and 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.399
 Let's click ok 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:55.590
 after that we'll be duplicating 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.650
 the image by clicking on meeting already adopted 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.780
 clicking this image 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:07.140
 and then we'll get it and put it here. 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.330
 in blending mode to increase exposure of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.840
 colors and then let's squeeze and then 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.780
 the control key ii to be able to 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:26.520
 reversing or else you see here in 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:29.640
 settings of a bt jack or 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.690
 reverse against the wii squeezes and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.150
 control and goes is reversing the image 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.970
 so to end the effect you go 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.500
 see here in filter to come here in 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:49.890
 blur and blur gum if I walk right 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.170
 so mine I can leave in 20% 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.790
 but still depending on the image you 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.920
 are using 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.640
 you may be putting more or less 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:05.730
 depends on the image you have 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.190
 using it then can vary from 20 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.690
 houses and nine per cent and twenty picchu one 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.870
 radius of twenty pixels can range from 30 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:20.280
 20 how much you see that read you 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.989
 leaves what I found cool was 20 pixels 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.110
 and then I click ok and this here 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:33.180
 I also thought it was cool, you are 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.300
 put here on the fill and 90% 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.360
 I thought it looked more like a 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.260
 pencil drawing you placing at 90% the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.640
 top layer filling see 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.200
 maybe yes 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.600
 I left it here in 90% 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.730
