the reason why they has such a heavy
weight<00:00:32.349> is<00:00:32.559> due<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:32.980> foam<00:00:33.489> pad<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:34.030> they

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
weight is due to the foam pad that they

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.030 
weight is due to the foam pad that they
