00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.460
 headphones so as not to disturb loved ones 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.320

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.720
 TV connection options 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.160
 the easiest way but if there is no TV 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.269
 connector or there are some other 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.070
 difficulties there are broken and so on then 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.750
 can connect directly to sony 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.100
 playstation super slim 3 headphones mean 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.170
 for this we need 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.170
 Naturally sony playstation 3 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:48.719
 standard cable that goes to 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.329
 complete with a prefix 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.870

 output sound through tulips image 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.200
 in this case it is brought out through a cable 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:17.070
 hdmi can verify this 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.520
 TV and the sound will be displayed 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:29.579
 through tulips and connected to headphones 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:33.720
 Headphones have such here 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.280
 standard output jack three and a half 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.490

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.710
 adapter that is tulips on jig here 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.869
 better of course if you can find 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.329
 Not contact but the nest is such a jack but I 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.810
 I could not find such a person 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.820
 take such an adapter 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.490
 and at home I was like this 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.950
 here are just two jacks two jacks 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.470
 unite into one this part of us 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.390
 we don't really need it, only 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.819
 these connectors are they 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.810

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.630
