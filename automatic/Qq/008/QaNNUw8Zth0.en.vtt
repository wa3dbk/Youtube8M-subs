I'm<00:00:29.650> Rebecca<00:00:30.070> work<00:00:30.340> and<00:00:30.870> winery<00:00:31.870> is<00:00:32.080> called

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
I'm Rebecca work and winery is called

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.380 
I'm Rebecca work and winery is called
ampulla<00:00:32.920> cellars<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:33.730> it's<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:33.970> winery<00:00:34.240> that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
ampulla cellars and it's a winery that

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.700 
ampulla cellars and it's a winery that
my<00:00:34.570> husband<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.020> I<00:00:35.140> do<00:00:35.200> all<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.680> work

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
my husband and I do all the work

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.710 
my husband and I do all the work
ourselves<00:00:36.040> it's<00:00:36.580> a<00:00:36.640> very<00:00:36.790> small<00:00:37.060> winery<00:00:37.480> in

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
ourselves it's a very small winery in

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.670 
ourselves it's a very small winery in
the<00:00:38.500> Santa<00:00:38.950> Barbara<00:00:38.980> Santa<00:00:39.670> Rita<00:00:39.910> Hills<00:00:40.180> area

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the Santa Barbara Santa Rita Hills area

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.250 
the Santa Barbara Santa Rita Hills area
we<00:00:41.680> make<00:00:41.860> about<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.130> total<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.640> 3,500<00:00:43.450> cases<00:00:43.930> and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
we make about a total of 3,500 cases and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.940 
we make about a total of 3,500 cases and
so<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:45.340> have<00:00:45.489> a<00:00:45.520> vineyard<00:00:45.820> as<00:00:46.090> well<00:00:46.559> 25<00:00:47.559> acres

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
so we have a vineyard as well 25 acres

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.190 
so we have a vineyard as well 25 acres
planted<00:00:48.190> so<00:00:48.820> two-thirds<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:49.750> what<00:00:49.870> we<00:00:49.989> make

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
planted so two-thirds of what we make

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.650 
planted so two-thirds of what we make
comes<00:00:50.710> from<00:00:50.920> our<00:00:51.070> own<00:00:51.100> vineyard<00:00:51.580> and<00:00:51.850> many

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
comes from our own vineyard and many

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.570 
comes from our own vineyard and many
people<00:00:53.050> don't<00:00:53.559> really<00:00:53.949> know<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.370> difference

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
people don't really know the difference

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.810 
people don't really know the difference
between<00:00:55.210> those<00:00:55.360> three<00:00:55.629> practices<00:00:56.290> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
between those three practices so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.189 
between those three practices so
basically<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:58.030> actually<00:00:58.360> have<00:00:58.510> four<00:00:58.750> farming

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
basically you actually have four farming

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.860 
basically you actually have four farming
practices<00:00:59.800> you<00:01:00.370> have<00:01:00.400> conventional<00:01:01.120> which<00:01:01.720> is

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
practices you have conventional which is

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.560 
practices you have conventional which is
basically<00:01:02.260> spray<00:01:02.680> herbicides<00:01:03.220> pesticides

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
basically spray herbicides pesticides

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.110 
basically spray herbicides pesticides
artificial<00:01:05.170> fertilizers<00:01:05.920> try<00:01:06.760> and<00:01:06.909> get<00:01:07.030> the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
artificial fertilizers try and get the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.670 
artificial fertilizers try and get the
largest<00:01:07.450> yields<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.020> can<00:01:08.200> get<00:01:08.320> out<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:08.590> the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
largest yields you can get out of the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.160 
largest yields you can get out of the
land<00:01:08.920> don't<00:01:09.909> necessarily<00:01:10.450> pay<00:01:10.630> attention<00:01:10.659> to

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
land don't necessarily pay attention to

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.350 
land don't necessarily pay attention to
waste<00:01:11.560> management<00:01:12.250> irrigation<00:01:12.700> practices

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
waste management irrigation practices

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.960 
waste management irrigation practices
any<00:01:14.050> of<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.260> farming<00:01:14.590> aspects<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.280> know<00:01:15.729> just

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
any of the farming aspects you know just

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.399 
any of the farming aspects you know just
try<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.240> grow<00:01:16.450> as<00:01:16.720> much<00:01:16.960> as<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.229> can<00:01:17.380> possibly

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
try and grow as much as you can possibly

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.430 
try and grow as much as you can possibly
grow<00:01:17.950> out<00:01:18.130> of<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.880> soil<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.260> have

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
grow out of the soil then you have

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.039 
grow out of the soil then you have
organic<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.340> organic<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.720> know<00:01:22.840> you're

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
organic and organic is you know you're

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.390 
organic and organic is you know you're
not<00:01:23.140> allowed<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.470> spray<00:01:23.710> herbicides<00:01:24.280> or

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
not allowed to spray herbicides or

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.990 
not allowed to spray herbicides or
pesticides<00:01:24.460> or<00:01:25.150> use<00:01:25.330> artificial<00:01:25.810> fertilizers

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
pesticides or use artificial fertilizers

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.020 
pesticides or use artificial fertilizers
so<00:01:28.000> basically<00:01:28.450> don't<00:01:28.630> spray<00:01:28.870> any<00:01:29.080> nasty<00:01:29.440> stuff

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so basically don't spray any nasty stuff

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.730 
so basically don't spray any nasty stuff
but<00:01:31.030> organic<00:01:31.540> doesn't<00:01:31.720> say<00:01:32.049> what<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.350> must<00:01:32.560> do

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
but organic doesn't say what you must do

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.410 
but organic doesn't say what you must do
or<00:01:32.979> how<00:01:33.159> you<00:01:33.219> must<00:01:33.520> do<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.880> doesn't<00:01:34.180> pay

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
or how you must do it doesn't pay

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.840 
or how you must do it doesn't pay
attention<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.899> waste<00:01:35.500> management<00:01:36.100> irrigation

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
attention to waste management irrigation

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.179 
attention to waste management irrigation
practices<00:01:37.030> any<00:01:37.899> of<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.350> farming<00:01:38.740> aspects

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
practices any of the farming aspects

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.940 
practices any of the farming aspects
just<00:01:39.460> don't<00:01:39.640> spray<00:01:39.880> that<00:01:40.030> bad<00:01:40.240> stuff<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.770> have

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
just don't spray that bad stuff you have

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.580 
just don't spray that bad stuff you have
biodynamic<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.030> biodynamic<00:01:43.570> actually<00:01:44.350> came

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
biodynamic and biodynamic actually came

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.800 
biodynamic and biodynamic actually came
before<00:01:44.890> organic<00:01:45.850> so<00:01:46.030> it's<00:01:46.149> around<00:01:46.240> been

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
before organic so it's around been

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.499 
before organic so it's around been
around<00:01:47.049> since<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.409> early<00:01:47.460> 1900s<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.359> is

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
around since the early 1900s so this is

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.599 
around since the early 1900s so this is
not<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.689> newfangled<00:01:50.200> ideas<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:51.509> biodynamic<00:01:52.509> is

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
not a newfangled ideas and biodynamic is

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.770 
not a newfangled ideas and biodynamic is
you're<00:01:54.609> not<00:01:54.700> allowed<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.060> spray<00:01:55.240> herbicides

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
you're not allowed to spray herbicides

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.359 
you're not allowed to spray herbicides
or<00:01:55.930> pesticides<00:01:55.990> or<00:01:56.649> use<00:01:56.770> artificial

but<00:02:00.880> biodynamic<00:02:01.600> says<00:02:01.869> here's<00:02:02.200> what<00:02:02.259> you<00:02:02.530> must

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
but biodynamic says here's what you must

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.889 
but biodynamic says here's what you must
do<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.100> here's<00:02:03.280> how<00:02:03.429> you<00:02:03.490> must<00:02:03.759> do<00:02:03.969> it

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
do and here's how you must do it

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.870 
do and here's how you must do it
biodynamic<00:02:05.649> follows<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> earth<00:02:06.340> schedule

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
biodynamic follows the earth schedule

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.419 
biodynamic follows the earth schedule
and<00:02:07.090> not<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.359> farmer<00:02:07.719> schedules<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.710> examples

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
and not the farmer schedules so examples

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.880 
and not the farmer schedules so examples
of<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.670> would<00:02:09.820> be<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:11.020> know<00:02:11.200> in<00:02:11.320> a<00:02:11.410> descending

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
of that would be we know in a descending

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.770 
of that would be we know in a descending
moon<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.280> earth<00:02:12.310> takes<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.970> an<00:02:13.150> ascending

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
moon the earth lets out so we irrigate

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.090 
moon the earth lets out so we irrigate
on<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> descending<00:02:16.780> moon<00:02:16.960> because<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.800> takes

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
on a descending moon because it takes

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.130 
on a descending moon because it takes
less<00:02:18.310> water<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:18.910> get<00:02:19.060> deeper<00:02:19.480> penetrations

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
less water we get deeper penetrations

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.600 
less water we get deeper penetrations
than<00:02:20.350> if<00:02:20.500> we<00:02:20.680> irrigated<00:02:21.370> on<00:02:21.520> ascending<00:02:22.390> moon

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
than if we irrigated on ascending moon

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.980 
than if we irrigated on ascending moon
biodynamic<00:02:24.610> says<00:02:24.819> everything<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.569> take<00:02:25.750> out

treat everything like one holistic

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.090 
treat everything like one holistic
system<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.080> we<00:02:38.380> know<00:02:38.530> we<00:02:38.710> have<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.860> lot<00:02:39.070> of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
system so we know we have a lot of

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.830 
system so we know we have a lot of
beneficial<00:02:39.760> insects

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
beneficial insects

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.600

so<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.200> make<00:02:41.560> sure<00:02:41.739> those<00:02:41.950> insects<00:02:42.400> don't

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
so to make sure those insects don't

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.229 
so to make sure those insects don't
leave<00:02:42.819> our<00:02:43.000> vineyard<00:02:43.450> every<00:02:44.440> tenth<00:02:44.739> row<00:02:45.239> is
