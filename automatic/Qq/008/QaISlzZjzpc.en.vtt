00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.700
 good afternoon dear like go to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.450
 In this video plot I will tell you how 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.160
 choose the right water hunter's knife 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.870
 you can underwater hunters the most 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.320
 an important element of underwater equipment 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.810
 who are responsible for your safety 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.029
 you need entanglement cases in 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.340
 poaching fishing nets either 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.550
 entanglement in lily water lily plants 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 either if you were shot fish but not 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.320
 paralyzed movement she convulsed 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.969
 can reel in our housing with your 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 arrows from your gun 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.399
 for your legs thereby immobilizing you 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 and creating at the same time 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.450
 stressful adverse situation knife 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.210
 underwater hunter consists of such 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:52.469
 items 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:54.840
 blade handle sheath and every knife in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.480
 the kit comes with two rubber straps 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.120
 thanks to which the knife is attached to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 underwater hunter 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:10.439
 knife underwater hunter attached to the foot 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.299
 and blood for muscle either on hand or if 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.820
 do you use the organ suit there 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.600
 special attachment of the knife on 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.280
 knife blade chest 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.110
 must be made of 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.020
 high quality stainless steel 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.970
 either titanium steel 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.220
 quality steel is responsible for reliability 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.500
 his sharpening with poor-quality steel knife 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.439
 dull quickly with quality this 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.650
 the process is more slow also 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.079
 the blade must be sharpened with two 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.240
 the parties are the same so they don't think what 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.299
 knife side 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.850
 cut network moreover need to 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.740
 so that the knife was healing for. at 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.430
 Ideally this to the delay of Syria 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.430
 was 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.180
 knife handle you need to consider this 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.960
 the glove you choose if you 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.760
 hunt 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.440
 in two millimeter or three 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.600
 millimeters gloved it can take 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.700
 small knife handle if you 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.600
 hunt in thick seven millimeter 5 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.330
 millimeters in gloves feel asti 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.280
 knife in hand falls and 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.840
 arm can be saved either on the blade or 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.540
 miss the legs would not feel it 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.000
 Potapov handle should be more 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.640
 thick in size is also nice when 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.840
 she is present at the knob 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.970
 metal in case you own 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.750
 fish did not immediately paralyze her 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.030
 in other cases you can finish 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.650
 thus we overcome with a knife 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.880
 hide cans cut sausage 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.400
 clean the fish 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.580
 the knife is not intended for this and leads 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.220
 to flooding in this way after every 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.870
 hunting knife must be washed in fresh 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.780
 water or lubricated with silicone grease 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.250
 for sea hunting, I recommend only 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.459
 titanium knives because even 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.650
 stainless knives they are covered with white 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.190
 with specks and with time begins 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.989
 rust 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:19.540
 if the knife does not properly operate not 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:23.450
 rinse and store me dried 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:29.390
 basic knives which i recommend when 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:34.580
 choosing an underwater knife and there wounds 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:38.320
 stalker z 1 marlin stanley steel 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.880
 either marlin stefan pacific or atlantic 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.510
 bush 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.930
 dagger2 mary snake it if you 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.120
 order online if you 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.940
 are Kiev you can come to 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.370
 choose a large number of knives each 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.420
 hold the knife in your hand 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.540
 choose the best knife 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.850
 for example our soldier has a special 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.470
 arm mount 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:10.140
 it can be very comfortable for someone 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:13.390
 knives no special attachments for example 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.530
 even from a stalker wound but dinah or should 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.420
 fasteners on the latch 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.970
 I recommend it to everyone underwater 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.850
 hunters of the considered most reliable 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.380
 even if for some reason one of 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:30.250
 the sides of the knife snaps off then 2 will not give 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:34.330
 the knife fall out also on the same is on 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.490
 special rezinochkah and implemented 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.690
 knives 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.460
 special lock that is knives 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.450
 underwater hunter is often lost 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.440
 there is a mount called lock 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.230
 snap off and lock and only then 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.880
 push and pull the knife if you 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.760
 lock you can not push and pull 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.120
 knife it will be unrealistic but you are not 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:03.100
 lose a knife though better lose a knife 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.580
 than because of the good choice of lucky you 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.580
 and the move goes
