00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
it's a little showdown before everything

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.479 
it's a little showdown before everything
else<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.319> really<00:02:25.530> weird<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:25.769> we<00:02:25.920> were<00:02:26.069> in

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
else it was really weird when we were in

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.850 
else it was really weird when we were in
the<00:02:26.610> writing<00:02:26.910> phase<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.450> felt<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.739> was

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the writing phase it felt like it was

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.250 
the writing phase it felt like it was
something<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.190> could<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.730> interesting<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:31.080> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
something we could be interesting and I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.620 
something we could be interesting and I
think<00:02:31.319> Brian<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.580> Lucas<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.420> did<00:02:33.569> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
think Brian and and Lucas that did a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.650 
think Brian and and Lucas that did a
very<00:02:33.780> good<00:02:33.989> job<00:02:34.049> but<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.280> will<00:02:36.060> end<00:02:36.239> into<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
very good job but I will end into the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.870 
very good job but I will end into the
scene<00:02:36.900> shooting<00:02:37.170> thinking<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.950> let's<00:02:38.730> just

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
scene shooting thinking that let's just

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.940 
scene shooting thinking that let's just
try<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.959> let's<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:40.200> what<00:02:40.350> we<00:02:40.440> can<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.739> with

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
try and let's see what we can do with

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.800 
try and let's see what we can do with
this<00:02:41.930> having<00:02:42.930> them<00:02:43.049> kind<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.290> faceoff<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
this having them kind of faceoff and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.240 
this having them kind of faceoff and
play<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> little<00:02:45.959> bit<00:02:46.170> more<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.560> how<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:47.130> know

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
play a little bit more of how you know

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.110 
play a little bit more of how you know
getting<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> know<00:02:47.790> DK<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.750> how<00:02:49.620> kind<00:02:49.950> of

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
getting to know DK and how kind of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.750 
getting to know DK and how kind of
deceptive<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.840> way<00:02:51.989> he<00:02:52.140> thinks<00:02:52.760> but

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
deceptive and the way he thinks but

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.970 
deceptive and the way he thinks but
ultimately<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.560> one<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.860> first

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
ultimately this is one of the first

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.660 
ultimately this is one of the first
scenes<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.370> we<00:02:56.489> had<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.090> got<00:02:57.599> cut<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
scenes that we had just got cut and I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.920 
scenes that we had just got cut and I
think<00:02:59.880> it<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> good<00:03:00.209> try<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.420> think<00:03:00.599> we<00:03:00.840> were

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
think it was a good try I think we were

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.509 
think it was a good try I think we were
trying<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.260> something<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.950> little

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
trying to do something a little

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.800 
trying to do something a little
different<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.940> would<00:03:06.120> be<00:03:06.239> score<00:03:06.540> here

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
different and that would be score here

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.569 
different and that would be score here
actually<00:03:07.109> so<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.560> lot<00:03:07.769> of<00:03:07.829> time<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:07.950> see<00:03:08.190> these

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
actually so a lot of time you see these

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.090 
actually so a lot of time you see these
deleted<00:03:09.120> scenes<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.560> know<00:03:10.680> that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
deleted scenes and you know that

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.660 
deleted scenes and you know that
obviously<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:12.329> was<00:03:12.600> abandoned<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.519> early<00:03:14.519> on

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
obviously this was abandoned so early on

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.569 
obviously this was abandoned so early on
that<00:03:14.940> we<00:03:15.060> don't<00:03:15.239> have<00:03:15.480> any<00:03:15.799> score<00:03:16.799> for<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:18.470> yeah

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
that we don't have any score for it yeah

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:27.920 
that we don't have any score for it yeah
everybody<00:03:20.579> does

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.420 

he<00:03:28.440> once<00:03:28.620> told<00:03:28.920> me<00:03:29.069> never<00:03:30.709> get<00:03:31.709> hung<00:03:31.890> up<00:03:32.010> on<00:03:32.220> one

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
he once told me never get hung up on one

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.350 
he once told me never get hung up on one
girl<00:03:33.890> but<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.920> do<00:03:35.400> believe<00:03:35.610> this<00:03:35.879> is<00:03:35.940> probably

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
girl but I do believe this is probably

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.470 
girl but I do believe this is probably
the<00:03:36.540> first<00:03:37.200> scene<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:38.180> got<00:03:39.180> cut<00:03:39.450> from

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
the first scene that that got cut from

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:52.220 
the first scene that that got cut from
the<00:03:39.690> movie<00:03:46.159> how<00:03:47.159> could<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.489> know

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.490 

but<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:52.830> have<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.280> say<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.519> disagree<00:03:54.379> and<00:03:55.379> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
but I have to say I disagree and the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.869 
but I have to say I disagree and the
other<00:03:55.620> thing<00:03:55.830> about<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.190> scene<00:03:56.400> was<00:03:56.580> we<00:03:56.730> were

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
other thing about the scene was we were

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.640 
other thing about the scene was we were
trying<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.239> bring<00:03:57.390> in<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.659> notion<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.290> uncle

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
trying to bring in the notion of uncle

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.589 
trying to bring in the notion of uncle
Kamata<00:03:59.060> which<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.299> hear<00:04:00.599> earlier<00:04:05.569> but<00:04:06.569> I

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
Kamata which you hear earlier but I

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.710 
Kamata which you hear earlier but I
think<00:04:06.840> it's<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:06.989> good<00:04:07.110> try<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:09.360> that's<00:04:09.540> what's

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
think it's a good try and that's what's

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.800 
think it's a good try and that's what's
fun<00:04:09.900> about<00:04:09.930> movie<00:04:10.410> sometimes<00:04:11.569> you<00:04:12.569> know<00:04:12.690> you

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
fun about movie sometimes you know you

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.360 
fun about movie sometimes you know you
