00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
just hinged up and down it has does have

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.220 
just hinged up and down it has does have

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
a Play feature it has firing missiles

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.500 
a Play feature it has firing missiles
which<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.800> should<00:01:54.790> see<00:01:54.940> if<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.090> can<00:01:55.240> do<00:01:55.360> this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
which you should see if I can do this

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.330 
which you should see if I can do this
just<00:01:56.350> flick<00:01:56.590> down<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:59.200> probably<00:02:00.070> just<00:02:00.130> lost

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
just flick down it probably just lost

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.520 
just flick down it probably just lost
that<00:02:00.490> one<00:02:00.610> as<00:02:00.730> well<00:02:00.870> also<00:02:01.870> if<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.020> don't<00:02:02.290> like

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
that one as well also if you don't like

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.250 
that one as well also if you don't like
the<00:02:02.860> missile<00:02:03.640> firing<00:02:04.090> these<00:02:04.300> pods<00:02:04.780> that<00:02:05.140> the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
the missile firing these pods that the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.960 
the missile firing these pods that the
missiles<00:02:05.560> looking<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.070> click<00:02:06.370> into<00:02:06.550> are

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
missiles looking to click into are

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.270 
missiles looking to click into are
removable<00:02:07.870> so<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.590> can<00:02:08.709> actually<00:02:08.979> have<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.129> lot

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
removable so you can actually have a lot

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.259 
removable so you can actually have a lot
that<00:02:09.429> but<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.610> think<00:02:09.670> actually<00:02:09.909> looks<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> bit

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
that but I think actually looks a bit

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.820 
that but I think actually looks a bit
skinny<00:02:10.599> like<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:14.200> could<00:02:14.500> intend<00:02:14.769> to

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
skinny like that so I could intend to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.110 
skinny like that so I could intend to
keep<00:02:14.920> them<00:02:15.069> on<00:02:15.159> it<00:02:15.580> does<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.909> Play<00:02:16.090> feature

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
keep them on it does have a Play feature

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.619 
keep them on it does have a Play feature
as<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.629> said<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.019> move<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.129> head<00:02:18.400> down<00:02:18.909> like

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
as I said if you move the head down like

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.890 
as I said if you move the head down like
