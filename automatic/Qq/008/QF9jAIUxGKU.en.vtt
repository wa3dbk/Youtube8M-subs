00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.220 
you should add one extra second when the
speed<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.609> more<00:02:58.609> than<00:02:58.670> 40<00:02:59.239> miles<00:02:59.450> per<00:02:59.569> hour<00:02:59.720> so

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
speed is more than 40 miles per hour so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.349 
speed is more than 40 miles per hour so
you<00:03:00.290> are<00:03:00.680> driving<00:03:01.010> on<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> highway<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.000> you

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
you are driving on a highway so you

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.750 
you are driving on a highway so you
should<00:03:02.659> assume<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.409> speed<00:03:04.069> is<00:03:04.220> higher<00:03:04.459> than

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
should assume the speed is higher than

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.960 
should assume the speed is higher than
40<00:03:05.510> miles<00:03:05.750> per<00:03:05.900> hour<00:03:06.109> because<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.280> well<00:03:07.639> again

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
40 miles per hour because the well again

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.879 
40 miles per hour because the well again
the<00:03:08.620> usually<00:03:09.620> highway<00:03:10.069> speed<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.549> 55<00:03:11.889> and

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
the usually highway speed is 55 and

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.789 
the usually highway speed is 55 and
that's<00:03:13.310> why<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:14.150> right<00:03:14.450> answer<00:03:14.810> here<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.349> for
