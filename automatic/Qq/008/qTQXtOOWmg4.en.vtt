all right the next project that I want
to<00:00:12.380> show<00:00:12.560> you<00:00:12.620> on<00:00:12.920> a<00:00:12.950> wood<00:00:13.280> surface<00:00:13.790> is

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
to show you on a wood surface is

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.720 
to show you on a wood surface is
embossing<00:00:15.889> on<00:00:16.100> wood

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
embossing on wood

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.170 
embossing on wood
now<00:00:17.360> when<00:00:18.110> you<00:00:18.200> emboss<00:00:18.500> on<00:00:18.770> wood<00:00:19.100> you<00:00:19.760> can

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
now when you emboss on wood you can

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.700 
now when you emboss on wood you can
either<00:00:20.750> stain<00:00:21.380> as<00:00:21.890> I<00:00:21.950> have<00:00:22.369> here<00:00:22.880> or<00:00:23.410> you<00:00:24.410> can

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
base coat your surface which means that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.749 
base coat your surface which means that
it<00:00:27.259> has<00:00:27.380> an<00:00:27.560> opaque<00:00:27.829> coverage<00:00:28.070> on<00:00:28.460> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.170 
surface two things to keep in mind one
you<00:00:35.660> need<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:35.960> keep<00:00:36.110> moving<00:00:36.560> the<00:00:36.710> heat<00:00:36.920> gun<00:00:37.180> so

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
you need to keep moving the heat gun so

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.229 
you need to keep moving the heat gun so
that<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:38.630> don't<00:00:39.130> overheat<00:00:40.130> the<00:00:40.670> paint<00:00:40.970> and

when you heat it it will draw the SAP
out<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.730> the<00:01:04.970> wood<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.630> it'll<00:01:06.410> ruin<00:01:06.530> your

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
out of the wood and it'll ruin your

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.330 
out of the wood and it'll ruin your
project<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.050> really<00:01:09.050> most<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.740> wood<00:01:10.010> on

project so really most of the wood on
the<00:01:10.610> market<00:01:11.030> even<00:01:11.659> in<00:01:11.870> the<00:01:12.050> crafts<00:01:12.620> chains<00:01:13.090> is

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
the market even in the crafts chains is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.050 
the market even in the crafts chains is
a<00:01:14.480> heart<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.110> wood<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.530> will<00:01:15.710> work<00:01:15.920> for<00:01:16.280> this

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
a heart of wood and will work for this

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.170 
a heart of wood and will work for this
technique<00:01:17.510> alright<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:18.920> what<00:01:19.340> we're<00:01:19.490> gonna<00:01:19.580> do

technique alright so what we're gonna do
I<00:01:22.420> went<00:01:23.420> ahead<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.660> base<00:01:23.930> coated<00:01:24.440> this

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
I went ahead and base coated this

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.180 
I went ahead and base coated this
project<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.820> selected<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:27.350> same<00:01:27.590> element

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
project and I selected the same element

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.880 
project and I selected the same element
that<00:01:28.460> I<00:01:28.520> did<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.510> other<00:01:31.210> frame<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.900> I'm

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
that I did on the other frame and I'm

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.100 
that I did on the other frame and I'm
going<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.970> ink<00:01:35.660> this<00:01:35.840> up<00:01:36.080> using<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:38.110> sukkah

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
going to ink this up using the sukkah

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.170 
going to ink this up using the sukkah
neko<00:01:39.410> Versamark<00:01:40.340> ink<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:45.880> I'm<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.060> gonna

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
neko Versamark ink and I'm just gonna

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.410 
neko Versamark ink and I'm just gonna
stamp<00:01:47.750> it<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:50.990> surface<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:52.460> then<00:01:53.210> what<00:01:53.390> I

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
stamp it to the surface and then what I

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.090 
stamp it to the surface and then what I
do<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.690> every<00:01:54.290> time<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.710> stamp<00:01:55.130> at<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.400> image<00:01:55.790> I

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
do is every time I stamp at the image I

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.390 
do is every time I stamp at the image I
come<00:01:58.100> back<00:01:58.310> with<00:01:58.880> whichever<00:01:59.540> color<00:02:00.220> powder<00:02:01.220> I

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
come back with whichever color powder I

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.570 
come back with whichever color powder I
want<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.790> use<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:03.440> I'm<00:02:03.620> gonna<00:02:03.770> go<00:02:04.010> go<00:02:04.310> ahead

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
want to use and I'm gonna go go ahead

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.130 
want to use and I'm gonna go go ahead
and<00:02:04.850> sprinkle<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.690> on<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.620> that<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:06.860> can<00:02:07.220> see

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
and sprinkle this on so that I can see

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.410 
and sprinkle this on so that I can see
where<00:02:09.140> I've<00:02:09.319> stamped<00:02:09.910> since<00:02:10.910> it's<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.150> clear

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
where I've stamped since it's a clear

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.150 
where I've stamped since it's a clear
ink

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.160 

little<00:02:19.940> all<00:02:20.940> right<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.780> always<00:02:24.900> use

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
little all right so then I always use

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930 
little all right so then I always use
piece<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.590> paper<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.670> can

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
piece of paper to do this so you can

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:36.740 
piece of paper to do this so you can
create<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:28.910> funnel<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:36.060> pour<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.390> back<00:02:36.420> into

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
create a funnel and pour it back into

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.830 
create a funnel and pour it back into
the<00:02:36.900> bottle<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.620> I'm<00:02:40.770> probably<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:42.180> usually

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the bottle so I'm probably I usually

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.310 
the bottle so I'm probably I usually
repeat<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:44.340> image<00:02:44.760> an<00:02:45.030> odd<00:02:45.540> number<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:45.990> times

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
repeat the image an odd number of times

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.590 
repeat the image an odd number of times
so<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> pretty<00:02:47.400> small<00:02:47.700> frame<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.480> I'm

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
so this is a pretty small frame so I'm

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.960 
so this is a pretty small frame so I'm
probably<00:02:48.720> only<00:02:49.020> going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.260> do<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.530> like

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
probably only going to do this like

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:59.850 
probably only going to do this like
three<00:02:50.970> times

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
powder already has a shiny finish to it

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.179 
powder already has a shiny finish to it
and<00:04:47.729> I<00:04:47.789> actually<00:04:47.999> like<00:04:48.569> that<00:04:49.050> contrasts<00:04:49.949> with

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 
and I actually like that contrasts with

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.549 
and I actually like that contrasts with
the<00:04:50.520> matte<00:04:50.699> finish<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.449> paint<00:04:51.870> so<00:04:52.529> I

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:52.559 
the matte finish of the paint so I

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:54.379 
the matte finish of the paint so I
usually<00:04:53.069> don't<00:04:53.189> even<00:04:53.370> varnish<00:04:53.969> these<00:04:54.180> pieces

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
usually don't even varnish these pieces

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.510 
usually don't even varnish these pieces
I<00:04:54.779> just<00:04:55.080> leave<00:04:55.259> them<00:04:55.439> like<00:04:55.589> that<00:04:55.620> it's<00:04:56.069> really

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
I just leave them like that it's really

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.619 
I just leave them like that it's really
quick<00:04:56.939> and<00:04:56.999> easy<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:59.120> anyway<00:05:00.120> that's<00:05:00.389> how<00:05:00.539> you

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
quick and easy so anyway that's how you

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.550 
quick and easy so anyway that's how you
do<00:05:00.839> embossing<00:05:01.229> on<00:05:01.710> wood
