00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
cylinder and I will add a picture of it

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.509 
cylinder and I will add a picture of it
I<00:02:52.629> don't<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.859> didn't<00:02:54.099> purchase<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.430> for

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
it because it it is a metal bill inside

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.319 
it because it it is a metal bill inside
a<00:02:59.379> wooden<00:03:00.989> cylinder<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:03.579> you're<00:03:03.730> able<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.090> see

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
a wooden cylinder and you're able to see

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.509 
a wooden cylinder and you're able to see
the<00:03:04.450> Bell<00:03:04.659> which<00:03:05.019> is<00:03:05.170> great<00:03:05.500> because<00:03:06.220> the

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
the Bell which is great because the

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.039 
the Bell which is great because the
challenge<00:03:06.879> is<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.120> know<00:03:07.239> what<00:03:07.540> makes<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
challenge is to know what makes the

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.020 
challenge is to know what makes the
noise<00:03:08.290> that's<00:03:08.799> why<00:03:09.069> Manchester<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:09.670> very<00:03:09.879> much

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
noise that's why Manchester is very much

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.930 
noise that's why Manchester is very much
against<00:03:10.329> things<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.690> use<00:03:10.930> batteries

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
against things that use batteries

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.009 
against things that use batteries
because<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.030> child<00:03:13.269> needs<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.569> know<00:03:13.629> what<00:03:13.900> is

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
because the child needs to know what is

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.379 
because the child needs to know what is
making<00:03:14.199> the<00:03:14.349> noise<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.250> as<00:03:15.549> he<00:03:15.849> moves<00:03:16.150> the

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
making the noise so as he moves the

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.119 
making the noise so as he moves the
cylinder<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.169> teaches<00:03:17.560> some<00:03:17.709> cause<00:03:17.919> and

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
cylinder it teaches some cause and

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.430 
cylinder it teaches some cause and
effect<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.730> telling<00:03:19.329> him<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.720> am<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.230> one<00:03:20.410> that

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
effect I telling him I am the one that

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.520 
effect I telling him I am the one that
is<00:03:20.769> making<00:03:21.069> this<00:03:21.340> noise<00:03:21.579> it<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.299> also<00:03:22.599> perfect

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
is making this noise it is also perfect

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.610 
is making this noise it is also perfect
for<00:03:23.709> crawling<00:03:24.669> and<00:03:25.180> tripping<00:03:25.660> around<00:03:25.780> because

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
for crawling and tripping around because

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.180 
for crawling and tripping around because
it<00:03:26.919> encourages<00:03:27.430> you

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
it encourages you

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.010 
it encourages you
to<00:03:28.370> move<00:03:28.580> into<00:03:28.850> reach<00:03:29.240> for<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.570> object

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
to move into reach for the object

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.250 
to move into reach for the object
because<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.440> doesn't<00:03:30.770> roll<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.540> yeah<00:03:32.870> I

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
because it doesn't roll so yeah I

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.580 
because it doesn't roll so yeah I
recommend<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.280> great
