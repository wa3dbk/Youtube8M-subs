hey<00:00:02.240> guys<00:00:03.040> this<00:00:04.040> is<00:00:04.220> something<00:00:04.520> very<00:00:04.730> simple

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey guys this is something very simple

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.159 
hey guys this is something very simple
but<00:00:05.660> I<00:00:06.380> just<00:00:06.890> wanted<00:00:07.160> to<00:00:07.250> put<00:00:07.549> it<00:00:07.640> out<00:00:07.730> there

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:08.169 
but I just wanted to put it out there

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.560 
but I just wanted to put it out there
somebody<00:00:09.169> might<00:00:09.349> find<00:00:09.530> this<00:00:09.709> useful<00:00:10.329> I've<00:00:11.329> got

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
somebody might find this useful I've got

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.359 
somebody might find this useful I've got
one<00:00:11.749> of<00:00:11.839> these<00:00:11.929> uh<00:00:13.299> civil<00:00:14.299> defense<00:00:15.369> meters

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
one of these uh civil defense meters

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.779 
one of these uh civil defense meters
from<00:00:16.519> the<00:00:16.670> 60s<00:00:17.089> that<00:00:17.210> run<00:00:17.359> off<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:17.539> D<00:00:17.689> battery

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
from the 60s that run off the D battery

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.230 
from the 60s that run off the D battery
to<00:00:19.789> measure<00:00:19.970> background<00:00:20.480> radiation<00:00:21.789> and<00:00:22.789> I'm

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
to measure background radiation and I'm

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:32.310 
to measure background radiation and I'm
sick<00:00:23.449> of<00:00:23.480> replacing<00:00:24.140> the<00:00:24.320> D<00:00:24.470> batteries<00:00:29.679> so<00:00:30.679> uh

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
sick of replacing the D batteries so uh

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.160 
sick of replacing the D batteries so uh
put<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:34.120> current<00:00:35.120> meter<00:00:35.270> in<00:00:35.480> series<00:00:35.719> and

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
put a current meter in series and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.170 
put a current meter in series and
realized<00:00:36.739> it<00:00:36.949> didn't<00:00:37.160> draw<00:00:37.340> much<00:00:37.670> current<00:00:38.090> at

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
realized it didn't draw much current at

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.660 
realized it didn't draw much current at
all<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:39.250> so<00:00:40.250> I'm<00:00:40.340> running<00:00:40.489> off<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.940> 1.5<00:00:41.780> volt

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
all and so I'm running off of 1.5 volt

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.729 
all and so I'm running off of 1.5 volt
so<00:00:43.670> uh<00:00:43.699> I<00:00:44.090> just<00:00:45.079> did<00:00:45.230> a<00:00:45.260> little<00:00:45.320> bit<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.559> math

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
so uh I just did a little bit of math

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.819 
so uh I just did a little bit of math
and<00:00:46.629> just<00:00:47.629> basic<00:00:48.170> Ohm's<00:00:48.440> law<00:00:50.620> just<00:00:51.620> made<00:00:51.800> a

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
and just basic Ohm's law just made a

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.430 
and just basic Ohm's law just made a
little<00:00:51.980> voltage<00:00:52.309> divider<00:00:52.809> and<00:00:53.809> chopped<00:00:54.109> up<00:00:54.289> a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
little voltage divider and chopped up a

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.570 
little voltage divider and chopped up a
USB<00:00:54.920> cable<00:00:55.280> right<00:00:56.030> here

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.079 

positive<00:00:59.480> and<00:00:59.630> negative<00:01:01.090> a<00:01:02.090> positive<00:01:04.089> it's

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
positive and negative a positive it's

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.520 
positive and negative a positive it's
not<00:01:05.180> hooked<00:01:05.420> up<00:01:05.570> right<00:01:05.750> now<00:01:05.930> hook<00:01:06.170> it<00:01:06.290> up<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:06.470> a

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
not hooked up right now hook it up in a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.800 
not hooked up right now hook it up in a
second<00:01:06.890> coming<00:01:07.790> into<00:01:09.220> this<00:01:10.220> side<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.630> is

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
second coming into this side of this is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.490 
second coming into this side of this is
a<00:01:11.840> 70<00:01:12.350> ohm<00:01:12.500> resistor<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.110> they<00:01:15.110> didn't<00:01:15.320> have<00:01:15.470> a

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
a 70 ohm resistor and they didn't have a

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.460 
a 70 ohm resistor and they didn't have a
30<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.220> I<00:01:16.250> had<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.580> put<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.000> 20<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.840> 10<00:01:18.110> in

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
30 so I had to put a 20 and a 10 in

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.910 
30 so I had to put a 20 and a 10 in
series<00:01:19.660> that's<00:01:20.660> these<00:01:20.870> other<00:01:21.290> two<00:01:21.500> resistors

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
series that's these other two resistors

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.380 
series that's these other two resistors
here<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:24.440> one<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:24.800> that<00:01:24.830> one

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
here that one and that one

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.760 
here that one and that one
you<00:01:26.390> take<00:01:26.600> your<00:01:26.780> voltage<00:01:27.850> your<00:01:28.850> output<00:01:29.770> ground

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
you take your voltage your output ground

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.609 
you take your voltage your output ground
would<00:01:31.340> be<00:01:31.369> down<00:01:31.640> here<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:32.900> take<00:01:33.080> your<00:01:33.140> output

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
would be down here you take your output

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.609 
would be down here you take your output
across<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.400> 30<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.780> gives<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.020> 1.5

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
across the 30 and it gives you a 1.5

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.990 
across the 30 and it gives you a 1.5
volt<00:01:37.479> 50<00:01:38.479> million<00:01:39.460> now<00:01:40.460> I'm<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:40.729> could<00:01:40.820> use

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
volt 50 million now I'm you could use

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.450 
volt 50 million now I'm you could use
this<00:01:41.149> for<00:01:41.450> other<00:01:41.570> purposes<00:01:42.200> too<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:43.040> guess

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
this for other purposes too I guess

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.090 
this for other purposes too I guess
anything<00:01:43.910> to<00:01:44.030> really<00:01:44.210> rent<00:01:44.450> right<00:01:44.630> off<00:01:44.810> of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
anything to really rent right off of

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.359 
anything to really rent right off of
like<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.130> double<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.610> or<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.390> triple<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.930> 1.5<00:01:48.619> 1.5

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
like a double a or a triple a 1.5 1.5

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.850 
like a double a or a triple a 1.5 1.5
volt<00:01:49.729> source<00:01:50.530> if<00:01:51.530> you've<00:01:51.710> got<00:01:51.830> different

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
volt source if you've got different

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.900 
volt source if you've got different
higher<00:01:52.930> current<00:01:53.930> requirements<00:01:54.710> then<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.100> may

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
higher current requirements then you may

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.130 
higher current requirements then you may
need<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:58.520> need<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.790> change<00:01:59.149> your<00:02:02.020> value<00:02:03.020> of

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
need to you need to change your value of

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.400 
need to you need to change your value of
your<00:02:03.259> resistors<00:02:04.330> but<00:02:05.330> for<00:02:05.569> this<00:02:05.720> purpose<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
your resistors but for this purpose and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.910 
your resistors but for this purpose and
50<00:02:07.190> milliamps<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.759> fun<00:02:08.350> although<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:09.590> should've

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
50 milliamps is fun although I should've

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.830 
50 milliamps is fun although I should've
went<00:02:10.130> with<00:02:10.250> half<00:02:10.550> watt<00:02:10.819> resistors<00:02:11.360> instead<00:02:11.750> of

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
went with half watt resistors instead of

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.570 
went with half watt resistors instead of
these<00:02:11.959> little<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.500> think<00:02:13.010> these<00:02:13.130> are<00:02:13.250> quarter

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
these little I think these are quarter

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.580 
these little I think these are quarter
watt<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.630> does<00:02:14.840> one<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.350> them<00:02:15.470> does

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
watt because it does one of them does

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.850 
watt because it does one of them does
get<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.770> little<00:02:15.980> warm<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:17.380> I'm<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.470> gonna<00:02:18.590> hook

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
get a little warm so I'm just gonna hook

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.230 
get a little warm so I'm just gonna hook
the<00:02:19.040> positive<00:02:19.640> lead<00:02:21.760> see<00:02:22.760> if<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.000> hold<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
the positive lead see if I can hold the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.410 
the positive lead see if I can hold the

clip<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.660> it's<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.830> positive<00:03:07.760> across<00:03:08.330> the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
clip and it's the positive across the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.430 
clip and it's the positive across the
voltage<00:03:08.720> divider<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:10.130> should<00:03:10.910> have<00:03:11.030> about<00:03:11.780> 1.5

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
voltage divider so should have about 1.5

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.510 
voltage divider so should have about 1.5
1.5<00:03:13.160> volt<00:03:13.640> here<00:03:17.770> except<00:03:18.770> that<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:19.130> think<00:03:19.190> my

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
1.5 volt here except that I think my

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.490 
1.5 volt here except that I think my
units<00:03:19.850> turned<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.270> so<00:03:20.510> I'm<00:03:20.930> having<00:03:21.050> a<00:03:21.200> bit<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.440> a

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
units turned on so I'm having a bit of a

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.970 
units turned on so I'm having a bit of a
voltage<00:03:21.860> drop<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.400> do<00:03:22.520> have<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.820> connected<00:03:23.980> let

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
voltage drop I do have it connected let

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.970 
voltage drop I do have it connected let
me<00:03:25.040> turn<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.370> meter<00:03:25.810> itself<00:03:26.810> off<00:03:29.980> yeah

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
me turn the meter itself off yeah

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.350 
me turn the meter itself off yeah
actually<00:03:31.280> I've<00:03:31.490> got<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:31.910> measuring

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
actually I've got it it's measuring

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.280 
actually I've got it it's measuring
right<00:03:32.480> now<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:38.300> right<00:03:38.480> now<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.810> meter<00:03:39.110> is

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
right now so right now the meter is

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.630 
right now so right now the meter is
working<00:03:41.050> let<00:03:42.050> me<00:03:42.110> turn<00:03:42.260> this<00:03:42.410> off<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.980> then<00:03:43.070> Oh

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.010 

hold<00:03:46.640> all<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.000> stuff<00:03:47.210> at<00:03:47.300> one<00:03:47.450> time<00:03:47.630> I'm<00:03:47.930> gonna

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
hold all the stuff at one time I'm gonna

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.480 
hold all the stuff at one time I'm gonna
turn<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.260> meter<00:03:48.440> off<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.010> we<00:03:49.250> don't<00:03:49.340> have

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
turn the meter off so that we don't have

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.740 
turn the meter off so that we don't have
any<00:03:49.640> voltage<00:03:49.940> drop<00:03:50.150> whatsoever<00:03:53.890> but<00:03:54.890> uh<00:03:55.750> I'll

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
any voltage drop whatsoever but uh I'll

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.640 
any voltage drop whatsoever but uh I'll
get<00:03:56.900> some<00:03:57.080> higher<00:03:57.260> wattage<00:03:58.570> resistors

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
get some higher wattage resistors

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.070 
get some higher wattage resistors
probably<00:04:00.650> Oh<00:04:00.680> with<00:04:00.800> a<00:04:00.860> half<00:04:01.010> watt<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:02.750> get<00:04:03.050> a

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
probably Oh with a half watt and get a

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
probably Oh with a half watt and get a
grommet<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:06.080> I'll<00:04:06.260> part<00:04:06.500> just<00:04:06.650> drill<00:04:06.860> a<00:04:06.890> hole

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
grommet and I'll part just drill a hole

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.350 
grommet and I'll part just drill a hole
and<00:04:07.130> want<00:04:07.580> to<00:04:07.640> eat<00:04:07.760> one<00:04:08.300> of<00:04:08.330> either<00:04:08.510> side<00:04:08.810> and

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
and want to eat one of either side and

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.060 
and want to eat one of either side and
waterproof<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.510> with<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.630> grommet<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.770> get<00:04:13.040> a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
waterproof it with a grommet and get a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.120 
waterproof it with a grommet and get a
old<00:04:13.610> USB<00:04:13.940> cable<00:04:14.480> so<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.470> can<00:04:15.620> just<00:04:15.710> plug<00:04:15.920> this<00:04:16.070> up

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
old USB cable so I can just plug this up

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.010 
old USB cable so I can just plug this up
and<00:04:16.910> not<00:04:17.060> have<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.330> worry<00:04:17.450> about<00:04:17.510> batteries

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
and not have to worry about batteries

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:24.190 
and not have to worry about batteries
but<00:04:18.290> uh<00:04:18.820> anyway<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:19.970> meters<00:04:20.720> off<00:04:20.900> now<00:04:21.170> so<00:04:23.020> if<00:04:24.020> I

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
but uh anyway the meters off now so if I

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.790 
but uh anyway the meters off now so if I
measure<00:04:24.380> again<00:04:24.860> if<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.280> find<00:04:25.580> my<00:04:25.670> probe<00:04:26.590> go<00:04:27.590> down

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
measure again if I find my probe go down

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.520 
measure again if I find my probe go down
here<00:04:28.010> huh

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
here huh

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.450 
here huh
anyway<00:04:30.530> I'm<00:04:30.980> back<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:32.950> turned<00:04:33.950> it<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.280> meter

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
anyway I'm back so I turned it the meter

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.029 
anyway I'm back so I turned it the meter
off

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
off

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:50.309 
off
and<00:04:36.129> without<00:04:36.939> a<00:04:37.089> load<00:04:40.259> 1.58<00:04:41.259> 1.77<00:04:49.110> series<00:04:50.110> here

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
and without a load 1.58 1.77 series here

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.950 
and without a load 1.58 1.77 series here
cuz<00:04:50.499> I<00:04:50.559> didn't<00:04:50.770> have<00:04:50.889> a<00:04:50.919> 30<00:04:51.749> something's<00:04:52.749> using

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
cuz I didn't have a 30 something's using

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.230 
cuz I didn't have a 30 something's using
a<00:04:53.020> 20<00:04:53.289> and<00:04:53.379> a<00:04:53.469> 10<00:04:53.680> but<00:04:54.009> basically<00:04:54.819> across<00:04:55.029> this

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
a 20 and a 10 but basically across this

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.209 
a 20 and a 10 but basically across this
30<00:04:55.599> ohm<00:04:56.080> resistor<00:04:58.139> so<00:04:59.139> I'd<00:04:59.259> be<00:04:59.379> getting<00:04:59.589> 3.5

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:00.219 
30 ohm resistor so I'd be getting 3.5

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:05.879 
30 ohm resistor so I'd be getting 3.5
across<00:05:00.939> the<00:05:01.270> 70<00:05:01.659> ohm<00:05:01.779> and<00:05:03.749> your<00:05:04.749> 1.5<00:05:05.379> across

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
across the 70 ohm and your 1.5 across

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.969 
across the 70 ohm and your 1.5 across
the<00:05:06.460> 3000<00:05:07.240> likes<00:05:08.139> it<00:05:08.349> I<00:05:08.379> mean<00:05:08.529> you<00:05:08.710> can<00:05:08.740> use

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
the 3000 likes it I mean you can use

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.589 
the 3000 likes it I mean you can use
this<00:05:09.129> for<00:05:09.460> I'm<00:05:10.149> using<00:05:10.389> it<00:05:10.569> for<00:05:10.599> this<00:05:10.779> meter<00:05:11.020> but

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
this for I'm using it for this meter but

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.029 
this for I'm using it for this meter but
just<00:05:13.599> good<00:05:13.719> to<00:05:13.899> know<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.319> mean<00:05:14.559> if<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:14.830> want<00:05:15.009> to

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
just good to know I mean if you want to

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.639 
just good to know I mean if you want to
run<00:05:15.129> your<00:05:16.409> you<00:05:17.409> can<00:05:17.559> use<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.860> same<00:05:18.069> little

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:19.649 
run your you can use the same little

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:22.739 
run your you can use the same little
voltage<00:05:20.649> divider<00:05:21.099> to<00:05:21.430> power<00:05:22.029> anything<00:05:22.449> that

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
voltage divider to power anything that

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:26.639 
voltage divider to power anything that
runs<00:05:22.809> off<00:05:23.020> 1.5<00:05:23.680> volt<00:05:25.229> like<00:05:26.229> I<00:05:26.319> said<00:05:26.469> if<00:05:26.559> you

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:26.649 
runs off 1.5 volt like I said if you

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:29.040 
runs off 1.5 volt like I said if you
want<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.949> run<00:05:27.819> something<00:05:28.059> that<00:05:28.539> draws<00:05:28.719> more

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
want to run something that draws more

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.309 
want to run something that draws more
current<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:29.979> you<00:05:30.099> need<00:05:30.309> to<00:05:30.459> rework<00:05:30.849> your

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
current and you need to rework your

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.670 
current and you need to rework your
resistor<00:05:32.319> values<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.919> accommodate<00:05:33.459> for<00:05:33.490> that

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
resistor values to accommodate for that

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.539 
resistor values to accommodate for that
just<00:05:35.680> wanted<00:05:35.889> to<00:05:35.979> share<00:05:36.099> that<00:05:36.360> take<00:05:37.360> care
