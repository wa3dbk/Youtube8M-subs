00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
some simple ingredients we have our

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.950 
some simple ingredients we have our
mother<00:00:11.010> culture<00:00:11.280> here<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.750> we<00:00:12.840> have

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
mother culture here and we have

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.189 
mother culture here and we have
blackstrap<00:00:13.500> molasses<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.519> have<00:00:14.670> water

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
blackstrap molasses and we have water

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.420 
blackstrap molasses and we have water
we're<00:00:16.199> making<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.680> 32-ounce<00:00:17.460> one-chord<00:00:18.420> batch

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
we're making a 32-ounce one-chord batch

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.890 
we're making a 32-ounce one-chord batch
starting<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.520> with<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:20.880> 20<00:00:21.420> ounces<00:00:21.539> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
starting out with about 20 ounces of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.410 
starting out with about 20 ounces of
water<00:00:22.140> filling<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> up<00:00:22.710> halfway<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.519> heated<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
water filling it up halfway I heated the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.810 
water filling it up halfway I heated the
water<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.960> bit<00:00:25.369> I'm<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.580> put<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
water up a bit I'm going to put the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.470 
water up a bit I'm going to put the
molasses<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:29.519> heated<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> water<00:00:29.939> just

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
molasses in and I heated the water just

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.410 
molasses in and I heated the water just
kind<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.900> help<00:00:31.080> them<00:00:31.230> molasses<00:00:32.329> dissolve<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
kind of help them molasses dissolve a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.799 
kind of help them molasses dissolve a
little<00:00:33.450> better<00:00:34.100> because<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.489> sticky<00:00:35.880> always

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:46.850 

sexually<00:00:39.809> getting<00:00:40.969> stuck<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.270> edges<00:00:45.860> yeah

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
sexually getting stuck on the edges yeah

stir this up really well does it stick

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:06.429 
stir this up really well does it stick
on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> bottom<00:01:03.049> take<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.339> mother<00:01:05.339> culture

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
on the bottom take the mother culture

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.950 
on the bottom take the mother culture
and<00:01:07.439> wanna<00:01:07.890> another<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> half<00:01:09.750> ounces

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and wanna another one and a half ounces

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:34.730 
and wanna another one and a half ounces
is<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:10.770> we're<00:01:10.920> using<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:33.740> looks

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
is what we're using for that looks

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.510 
is what we're using for that looks
pretty<00:01:34.979> good<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:36.650> just<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> fill<00:01:38.340> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
pretty good so just going to fill this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:58.080 
pretty good so just going to fill this
up<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:41.299> 32<00:01:42.299> ounce<00:01:42.540> mark<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.350> here

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:21.320 

pour<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.180> in

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.610 

and<00:02:23.300> it's<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.360> little<00:02:24.510> too<00:02:24.750> much<00:02:24.930> space<00:02:25.260> there

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and it's a little too much space there

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.620 
and it's a little too much space there
so<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.100> want<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.480> add<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:27.780> water<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:29.630> get

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
so I want to add a little water to get

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.450 
so I want to add a little water to get
it<00:02:30.750> up<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.990> little<00:02:31.110> closer<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> top<00:02:32.190> so

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
it up a little closer to the top so

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.690 
it up a little closer to the top so
there's<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> lot<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.270> air<00:02:33.540> space<00:02:33.900> that's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
there's not a lot of air space that's

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:44.420 
there's not a lot of air space that's
fine<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:41.540> make<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.570> little<00:02:42.900> too<00:02:43.050> much<00:02:43.430> or

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
fine like that make a little too much or

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:53.570 
fine like that make a little too much or
a<00:02:44.490> little<00:02:44.610> out<00:02:49.070> that's<00:02:50.070> pretty<00:02:50.340> good<00:02:52.520> put<00:02:53.520> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
a little out that's pretty good put the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.530 
a little out that's pretty good put the
cap<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:55.220> little<00:02:56.220> shake<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:59.540> just

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
cap on a little shake and then just

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.200 
cap on a little shake and then just
going<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.810> leave<00:03:00.960> it<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:02.060> what's<00:03:03.060> going<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
going to leave it and what's going to

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.520 
going to leave it and what's going to
happen<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:04.130> this<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.190> going<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.490> start<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.790> brew

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
happen is this is going to start to brew

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.280 
happen is this is going to start to brew
ferment<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:09.450> way<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:09.660> can<00:03:09.870> tell<00:03:10.080> when

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
ferment and the way you can tell when

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.150 
ferment and the way you can tell when
it's<00:03:10.410> done<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.130> pH<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.880> going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> be<00:03:13.160> three

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
it's done is the pH is going to be three

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.190 
it's done is the pH is going to be three
point<00:03:14.430> seven<00:03:14.640> or<00:03:14.910> below<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.720> generally

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
point seven or below this generally

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.890 
point seven or below this generally
takes<00:03:16.470> between<00:03:16.740> four<00:03:17.250> days<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.910> two<00:03:18.660> weeks

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
takes between four days and two weeks

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.350 
takes between four days and two weeks
depending<00:03:19.140> on<00:03:19.500> how<00:03:19.590> warm<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.190> if<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:21.240> in

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
depending on how warm it is if it's in

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.640 
depending on how warm it is if it's in
the<00:03:21.480> 80s<00:03:21.870> or<00:03:22.530> 90s<00:03:22.560> even<00:03:23.130> will<00:03:23.370> go<00:03:23.490> faster<00:03:24.060> and

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
the 80s or 90s even will go faster and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.680 
the 80s or 90s even will go faster and
so<00:03:25.650> what<00:03:26.220> I'll<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.550> I'll<00:03:26.760> start<00:03:27.000> doing<00:03:27.360> after<00:03:27.660> a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
so what I'll do I'll start doing after a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.790 
so what I'll do I'll start doing after a
few<00:03:27.930> days<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:29.340> just<00:03:29.640> checking<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> pH<00:03:30.390> daily

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
few days is just checking the pH daily

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.479 
few days is just checking the pH daily
there's<00:03:31.800> some<00:03:32.040> pH<00:03:32.370> papers<00:03:33.770> take<00:03:34.770> off<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> strip

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
there's some pH papers take off a strip

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.470 
there's some pH papers take off a strip
like<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:38.150> I'll<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.360> little

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
like this and I'll do a little

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.030 
like this and I'll do a little
demonstration<00:03:39.720> with<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.500> mother<00:03:40.709> culture

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
demonstration with the mother culture

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.000 
demonstration with the mother culture
since<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.790> know<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.410> this<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.620> ready<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.920> go

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
since I know that this is ready to go

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.390 
since I know that this is ready to go
and<00:03:44.459> has<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.760> right<00:03:44.910> pH<00:03:45.860> just<00:03:46.860> wet<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.220> down

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
and has the right pH just wet it down

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.550 
and has the right pH just wet it down
and<00:03:48.380> as<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.650> see<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.900> has<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.260> kind<00:03:52.500> of

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
and as you can see that has that kind of

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.250 
and as you can see that has that kind of
orangey<00:03:53.280> look<00:03:53.700> which<00:03:54.420> matches<00:03:55.670> closest<00:03:56.670> to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
orangey look which matches closest to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.750 
orangey look which matches closest to
between<00:03:58.260> three<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:58.830> three<00:03:59.250> point<00:03:59.520> five<00:03:59.730> right

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
between three and three point five right

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.570 
between three and three point five right
now<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.360> mother<00:04:03.540> culture<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:03.989> good<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:05.459> if

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
now so the mother culture is good so if

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.810 
now so the mother culture is good so if
I<00:04:05.670> were<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.820> test<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.950> we<00:04:07.950> just<00:04:08.280> made<00:04:08.520> we'll

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
I were to test this we just made we'll

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.660 
I were to test this we just made we'll
probably<00:04:09.000> closer<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.830> dark<00:04:11.100> green<00:04:11.430> on

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
probably closer to the dark green on

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.000 
probably closer to the dark green on
this<00:04:11.880> end<00:04:12.150> 5.5<00:04:13.850> so<00:04:14.850> I<00:04:15.560> said<00:04:16.560> I'll<00:04:16.680> be<00:04:16.770> checking

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
this end 5.5 so I said I'll be checking

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.000 
this end 5.5 so I said I'll be checking
this<00:04:17.340> every<00:04:17.790> day<00:04:17.820> after<00:04:18.390> about<00:04:18.600> four<00:04:18.870> days<00:04:19.049> and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
this every day after about four days and

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.510 
this every day after about four days and
also<00:04:20.640> which<00:04:21.299> want<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.690> do<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.710> at<00:04:22.919> least<00:04:23.070> once<00:04:23.340> a

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
also which want to do is at least once a

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.080 
also which want to do is at least once a
day<00:04:23.550> just<00:04:24.000> open<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.690> cap<00:04:24.900> for<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.200> second<00:04:25.650> and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
day just open the cap for a second and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.689 
day just open the cap for a second and
let<00:04:27.090> out<00:04:27.270> some<00:04:27.690> air<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.400> little<00:04:29.640> bit<00:04:29.820> of

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
let out some air just a little bit of

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.200 
let out some air just a little bit of
build<00:04:31.330> up<00:04:31.539> in<00:04:31.689> here<00:04:31.870> not<00:04:32.110> much<00:04:32.669> but<00:04:33.669> that's<00:04:34.030> one

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
build up in here not much but that's one

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.379 
build up in here not much but that's one
reason<00:04:34.389> why<00:04:34.599> I<00:04:34.629> use<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.810> plastic<00:04:35.139> bottle<00:04:35.650> so

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
reason why I use a plastic bottle so

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.850 
reason why I use a plastic bottle so
Kasich<00:04:37.389> got<00:04:37.569> you<00:04:37.780> know<00:04:37.870> station<00:04:38.379> mister<00:04:38.650> for<00:04:38.800> a

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
Kasich got you know station mister for a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.469 
Kasich got you know station mister for a
couple<00:04:39.099> of<00:04:39.189> days<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.520> bottle<00:04:39.849> would<00:04:40.029> expand

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
couple of days the bottle would expand

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.149 
couple of days the bottle would expand
was<00:04:40.900> glass<00:04:41.169> by<00:04:41.560> break<00:04:41.860> so<00:04:42.099> use<00:04:42.639> plastic<00:04:43.210> so

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
was glass by break so use plastic so

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.969 
was glass by break so use plastic so
that's<00:04:45.159> all<00:04:45.370> there<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.819> it
